Fedora provides a platform in which any contributor, large or small, can integrate and offer technologies for a large audience of consumers. This does not mean that Fedora is untested, it simply means that Fedora is a rapidly progressing platform.\n\nSo, in short, it's \"a testbed for many technologies some of wich might end up in RHEL\".

And plus, there's nothing inherently wrong with being a testbed for RHEL, some people might like that.\n\n&gt; For the second item, this does mean that Fedora is often running in uncharted innovative territory, but not that it is using too-new code. The programs in Fedora are generally stable releases or well-tested pre-release versions. There are guidelines behind the inclusion of pre-release software, and thorough testing is always done prior to Fedora releases.

Additionally, our well-managed packaging and review process adds an extra layer of safety not found in some other distributions.\n\nYes, it has proven it can be stable and reliable.

Refer to QA for more information about our extensive quality testing practices, which, like all other Fedora teams, are open to community participation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;History disagrees with this assessment. Hell, go search for reviews of Fedora 13, 14, 15....  Hell, go watch one of the many many many episodes of LAS, the Lunduke ones, where they review Fedora! It&amp;#39;s not hating, it&amp;#39;s public knowledge!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each new Fedora release receives updates from the Fedora community for two subsequent releases, plus one month -- on average, about thirteen months. We do everything we can to make sure that the final products released to the general public are stable and reliable. Fedora has proven that it can be a stable, reliable, and secure platform, as shown by its popularity and broad usage. Additionally, our well-managed packaging and review process adds an extra layer of safety not found in some other distributions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it has proven it can be stable and reliable. It has also proven that it can be a trainwreck. But, again, not that there&amp;#39;s anything wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, none of the answers given plainly say: &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;. They dodge the question. And, again, there&amp;#39;s no reason to.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "linux", "name": "t1_dg8f1j9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492155202.0, "created_utc": 1492126402.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8a4hy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg89eqq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/linux", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1492178976.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "linux", "name": "t1_dg8a4hy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492148760.0, "created_utc": 1492119960.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656x1p", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8fjct", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Maddisonic", "parent_id": "t1_dg89eqq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/linux", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Like Debian stale...
