It&amp;#39;s great at keeping track of your schedule (yes, it can integrate with google calendar). It can also notify you of upcoming appointments (I use it with notify-send for stuff like, &amp;quot;Meeting with XXX in 12 minutes!&amp;quot;). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also use it to keep track of various &amp;quot;stuff.&amp;quot; So if I&amp;#39;m browsing the web and find a webpage I want to read later, I save it using an org-capture extension for my browser which puts it in an org-friendly format in a file that I specify. Using some IFTTT/Dropbox hackery, you can also get it to where you can text stuff to a certain number and get it to save the text in org-friendly format in that same file (I call the file &amp;quot;inbox.org&amp;quot;). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Org-mode syntax is supported by github so things render nicely, and it&amp;#39;s supported by several major static site generators (like Hugo and Nikola). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "linux", "name": "t1_dgd9hed", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492444428.0, "created_utc": 1492415628.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65t2mk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65t2mk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdd9qn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zreeon", "parent_id": "t1_dgdc67x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/linux", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The org manual is great.
