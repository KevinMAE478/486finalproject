The important thing is to help our friends use a distro that they can use for along time without feeling lost or the need for help after we help them out setting it up. I've installed Linux on both my parents laptops, and they've been using it for years now with very few issues.\n\nYeah... Linux is too full of technical bullshit and buggy for me to install it on anyone I knows computer. \n\nAnd of course, you might not be able to install the software that you want because \"MUH ideological bullshit is more important than what the user wants.\". Yes, it depends on the distro: Ubuntu and Arch both take a \"Meh\" aproach to non libre software but Debian, Fedora, etc? Get the fuck out.\n\nAlso: You want to use the latest Proprietary Nvidia driver? Well, you gotta add this special PPA that isn't *technically* supported by us *wink*.\n\n&gt; would recommend the website Compute Freely for some simple explanations and info on software compatibility, which might otherwise scare some people from trying (like \"can I still edit Office documents?\").\n\nAnother bullshit Linux propaganda website? Hmm, lets take a look shall we?\n\n&gt;Many free and open source operating systems have the LibreOffice suite available which lets you create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations as you would with Microsoft Office. With LibreOffice, you can also open and edit any Word, Powerpoint, or Excel files you may already have.\n\nLOL, yeah right. LibreOffice looks like shit compared to Microsoft Office and isn't fully compatible.\n\n&gt;The number of Linux games available are rapidly growing on platforms like Steam and GOG.\n\n75%(probably way more) of them are indie games that no one really gives a shit about. Pretty much every game that has Linux support in Steam also has game or engine port issues and don't get as good performance as in Windows.\n\nHonestly just stop the bullshit. The Linux desktop still has a lot of progress that needs to be made before it's ready for wide adoption.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This could be a good time to talk to your friends about Linux&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK, i&amp;#39;ll tell them how buggy and unreliable it is. I&amp;#39;ll tell them that the majority of games that they play won&amp;#39;t work in Linux.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll tell them that there is no &amp;quot;Windows Restore Point&amp;quot; recovery option alternative in Linux so if something goes to shit you need someone who knows what their doing to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll tell them about the community and their constant lying in order to make themselves look better than what they are and makes gaming console fanboys look like perfect little angels in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know about Vault7. I know Linux isn&amp;#39;t perfect. But I think we here all can agree that software where everyone can see the source and help look for and fix security holes is better than the alternative \u2013 and that the more people who use it, the more people will look for flaws and help fix them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A flawed assumption. If this was actually true then there wouldn&amp;#39;t be any kernel security vulnerabilities. Being a high profile Open Source project doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t care about particular distro and DE &amp;quot;feuds&amp;quot; in this context.
