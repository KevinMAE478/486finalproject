You copied a feature from PHP, and it was a bad one.  (Arguably this is part of the \"class model sucks\" rant.) [ex: 6]\n\nAs is the case for a lot of these, you can sorta kinda kludge something together to work around these.  Sure.  And a good programmer can definitely work around them well enough to write something that works well.  But you're starting from *such* a crippled position compared to even decades-old languages that it pisses off people such as myself to no end when people pretend that JS is in any way a good language.  It's not.  It was a clever hack that a dude at Netscape whipped up in 72 hours that has gotten layer upon layer of crap duct-taped to it over the years, and it shows.\n\n---\n\n[0] Absolutely justifiable at the time.  See above: 72 hours.  Not justifiable 20 years later.  I would sorta get it if it was like \"oh yeah our default is float, but we've also got an arbitrary-precision decimal type etc.\"  But it's not.  Nope, you can choose between IEEE float or gofuckyourself.\n\n[1]  No, \"oh, just use this third party linting tool as a bandaid\" is not a good justification for your language having shit syntax.\n\nA classic example that I shamelessly stole from elsewhere about the stupidity of semicolon insertion\n\n    return\n        1 + 2;\n\nIn every other sane C-syntax language this is either a parse-time error (if whitespace isn't flexible) or it returns 3 (if it is).  Javascript?  `undefined`.  Have fun finding that bug in your program.\n\n[2] I just know somebody's gonna try to challenge me on this.  Let me clarify: you can make a domain model that is almost immutable in the sense that you have to go out of your way to modify objects.  But you cannot -- without non-standard help from the VM -- make one that is perfectly immutable without either a royally painful usage convention or placing most/all of the burden on the caller... which means that you can't assume immutability, which in turn makes various conventions and entire classes of VM optimization impossible.  \n\n[3] Are you fucking kidding me?  This is literally never a good idea in any high level language.  It was done for one reason and one reason only: to make it easier for people who aren't programmers to program.  That's it.  Yeah, \"strict mode\" is a good example of a band-aid over this, and a wonderful example of the JS tendency towards inflexible hacks.  It fixes the problem, but...\n\n[4] Which they've actually made more confusing.  \"It's easy, you can define a thing that's sorta like a class in several ways.  Which one is correct depends on who you ask (and also if you want `instanceof` to work like you'd expect).  Oh, BTW, we also added `class`, which naturally works slightly differently than the other ways and is mostly a hack on top of the existing model, but not entirely.\" \n\n[5] There is absolutely no good logical justification for this.  On paper `null` means, well, `null`, while undefined means not defined.  But that is differentiation without purpose, at least at the user level.  There is a good reason for a language *implementation* to distinguish between the two (numerous ones, in fact) but if an application developer feels the need to distinguish between them then they are probably doing something dumb, misguided, or both.  Hence why most other languages, well... don't.  The further fractal of stupid here is that `null` is an object (but not an Object), which gets back to the whole \"not entirely object oriented\" complaint.  And for the game, set, and match of dumb, while `undefined` is supposed to be for when a variable has not been defined, it's a valid value for assignment to a variable that's already been defined, which means that it can't even serve its stated purpose.\n\n[6]  Another stolen example:\n\n    &gt; class Foo { get z() { return \"z\";}}\n\n    [Function: Foo]\n\n    &gt; var x = new Foo();\n\n    undefined\n\n    &gt; x.z;\n\n    'z'\n\n    &gt; x.z = \"y\";\n\n    'y'\n\n    &gt; x.z;\n\n    'z'\n\n    &gt; var Bar = function() {this.z = \"z\";}\n\n    [Function: Bar]\n\n    &gt; var b = new Bar();\n\n    undefined\n\n    &gt; b.z;\n\n    'z'\n\n    &gt; b.z = \"y\";\n\n    'y'\n\n    &gt; b.z;\n\n    'y'\n\n    /* Whoo whoo. All aboard the SS Clusterfuck. */\n\nOh, and for bonus points (the original author of the above snippet omits this, I assume because he had started drinking at that point):\n\n    &gt; typeof x.z;\n\n    'string'\n\n    &gt; typeof b.z;\n    \n    'string'\n\nIn other words, if you're just handed an object you have no way to tell whether `z` is a getter or a settable property.

You copied a feature from PHP, and it was a bad one.  (Arguably this is part of the &amp;quot;class model sucks&amp;quot; rant.) [ex: 6]&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As is the case for a lot of these, you can sorta kinda kludge something together to work around these.  Sure.  And a good programmer can definitely work around them well enough to write something that works well.  But you&amp;#39;re starting from &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a crippled position compared to even decades-old languages that it pisses off people such as myself to no end when people pretend that JS is in any way a good language.  It&amp;#39;s not.  It was a clever hack that a dude at Netscape whipped up in 72 hours that has gotten layer upon layer of crap duct-taped to it over the years, and it shows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[0] Absolutely justifiable at the time.  See above: 72 hours.  Not justifiable 20 years later.  I would sorta get it if it was like &amp;quot;oh yeah our default is float, but we&amp;#39;ve also got an arbitrary-precision decimal type etc.&amp;quot;  But it&amp;#39;s not.  Nope, you can choose between IEEE float or gofuckyourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[1]  No, &amp;quot;oh, just use this third party linting tool as a bandaid&amp;quot; is not a good justification for your language having shit syntax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A classic example that I shamelessly stole from elsewhere about the stupidity of semicolon insertion&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;return\n    1 + 2;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In every other sane C-syntax language this is either a parse-time error (if whitespace isn&amp;#39;t flexible) or it returns 3 (if it is).  Javascript?  &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;.  Have fun finding that bug in your program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[2] I just know somebody&amp;#39;s gonna try to challenge me on this.  Let me clarify: you can make a domain model that is almost immutable in the sense that you have to go out of your way to modify objects.  But you cannot -- without non-standard help from the VM -- make one that is perfectly immutable without either a royally painful usage convention or placing most/all of the burden on the caller... which means that you can&amp;#39;t assume immutability, which in turn makes various conventions and entire classes of VM optimization impossible.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[3] Are you fucking kidding me?  This is literally never a good idea in any high level language.  It was done for one reason and one reason only: to make it easier for people who aren&amp;#39;t programmers to program.  That&amp;#39;s it.  Yeah, &amp;quot;strict mode&amp;quot; is a good example of a band-aid over this, and a wonderful example of the JS tendency towards inflexible hacks.  It fixes the problem, but...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[4] Which they&amp;#39;ve actually made more confusing.  &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s easy, you can define a thing that&amp;#39;s sorta like a class in several ways.  Which one is correct depends on who you ask (and also if you want &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt; to work like you&amp;#39;d expect).  Oh, BTW, we also added &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;, which naturally works slightly differently than the other ways and is mostly a hack on top of the existing model, but not entirely.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[5] There is absolutely no good logical justification for this.  On paper &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; means, well, &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, while undefined means not defined.  But that is differentiation without purpose, at least at the user level.  There is a good reason for a language &lt;em&gt;implementation&lt;/em&gt; to distinguish between the two (numerous ones, in fact) but if an application developer feels the need to distinguish between them then they are probably doing something dumb, misguided, or both.  Hence why most other languages, well... don&amp;#39;t.  The further fractal of stupid here is that &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; is an object (but not an Object), which gets back to the whole &amp;quot;not entirely object oriented&amp;quot; complaint.  And for the game, set, and match of dumb, while &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; is supposed to be for when a variable has not been defined, it&amp;#39;s a valid value for assignment to a variable that&amp;#39;s already been defined, which means that it can&amp;#39;t even serve its stated purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[6]  Another stolen example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; class Foo { get z() { return &amp;quot;z&amp;quot;;}}\n\n[Function: Foo]\n\n&amp;gt; var x = new Foo();\n\nundefined\n\n&amp;gt; x.z;\n\n&amp;#39;z&amp;#39;\n\n&amp;gt; x.z = &amp;quot;y&amp;quot;;\n\n&amp;#39;y&amp;#39;\n\n&amp;gt; x.z;\n\n&amp;#39;z&amp;#39;\n\n&amp;gt; var Bar = function() {this.z = &amp;quot;z&amp;quot;;}\n\n[Function: Bar]\n\n&amp;gt; var b = new Bar();\n\nundefined\n\n&amp;gt; b.z;\n\n&amp;#39;z&amp;#39;\n\n&amp;gt; b.z = &amp;quot;y&amp;quot;;\n\n&amp;#39;y&amp;#39;\n\n&amp;gt; b.z;\n\n&amp;#39;y&amp;#39;\n\n/* Whoo whoo. All aboard the SS Clusterfuck. */\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and for bonus points (the original author of the above snippet omits this, I assume because he had started drinking at that point):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; typeof x.z;\n\n&amp;#39;string&amp;#39;\n\n&amp;gt; typeof b.z;\n\n&amp;#39;string&amp;#39;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you&amp;#39;re just handed an object you have no way to tell whether &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; is a getter or a settable property.  Have fun!  Other OO languages and dynamic languages worked out introspection years ago.

People don't want to use Flash because of the security issues but there isn't a good solution for vector video as far as I have seen.\n\nGoogle is a big player in this, if they wanted to kill Flash, a new container format would help. A standard format for outputting would also be better for programs, especially if free animation programs/video editors could get it (plus stuff like After Effects or even the ability to convert old Flash animations). Make the container able to be ignored (or more specifically, the controls) and played right on Youtube through the HTML5 player and it's a huge incentive.\n\nFlash has a bunch of features for animations (scene selections, bonus features, endless seamless loops, interactivity/easter eggs, randomness, links for when the file inevitably gets passed around on the net with little more than a title etc) but even just a file format with vector animation and sound supported outright (and playable with the default HTML5 player+controls) would be a decent step up from where we are now.

Basically games that don't ever run. That was a big issue when they first came out, Unity WebGL was basically not supported at all under Chrome. However it has gotten better (but there are still occasionally issues).\n\n I think I've also had an issue with textures not properly displaying, but I'm not sure what that was about. On Kongregate called Rogue Fable II takes up a bit more room than it should (and thus has a scroll bar on the side). \n\nSome of these issues can be caused by an outdated browser (which I know can be a user issue, but is also an issue with slow-moving distros especially with outdated distros people don't want to bother with the chance of breakage... especially when any sort of production is needed or the machine is used as some kind of server) but some games run perfectly fine, and some have random crashes (like in the game 'That Pokeyman Thing Your Grandkids Are Into') even with an updated browser.
