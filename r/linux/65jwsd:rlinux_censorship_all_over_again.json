Some things will slip though, some things will be misjudged. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you also need to account for the amount of content coming in. Maybe it&amp;#39;s a fast week with lots of news, so decisions will fall more towards keeping noise down. During a slow week they might be more inclined to let fluff though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just because something is being taken down doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s censorship. If something were clearly Linux news, maybe critical about Linux or people involved, and being taken down for being criticism - THAT would be censorship. If &amp;quot;Linus Torvalds found killing puppies&amp;quot; was taken down and replaced with &amp;quot;Linus Torvalds helps with animal control&amp;quot; - THAT would be censorship. If a link to an article comparing Linux and Windows favoring Windows were taken down by moderators - THAT would be censorship. When an article rides the line on relevance - that&amp;#39;s curation. Curation by humans, which may not be perfect by your standards, but keeps this subreddit running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "linux", "name": "t1_dgb0yl4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492311889.0, "created_utc": 1492283089.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 97}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jwsd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jwsd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbu3u2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jones_supa", "parent_id": "t1_dgbh6t3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/linux", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think that there is anyone deliberately choosing focus on news over discussion.
