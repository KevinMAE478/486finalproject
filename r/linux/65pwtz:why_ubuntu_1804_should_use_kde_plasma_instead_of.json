There was a brief discussion where Hugo expressed his concerns and they were summarily dismissed.\n\nI have to be honest, one area where this is still brutally apparent is GTK CSDs in KWin. The A in RGBA is ignored completely, and that's something we can't implement in KWin due to how they've architected the CSDs. Martin could theoretically implement some special cases with a lot of work, but there's no guarantee it would still function after the next GTK update. The only tenable solution is for the GTK folks to utilize a standardized CSD hint that works in a predictable manner.\n\nSo yeah, it's been a pain in the ass. In fact, GNOME didn't even support consistently theming GTK 2 (and by extension Qt) applications in GNOME 3 for a few releases until I started working on it.

There was a brief discussion where Hugo expressed his concerns and they were summarily dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to be honest, one area where this is still brutally apparent is GTK CSDs in KWin. The A in RGBA is ignored completely, and that&amp;#39;s something we can&amp;#39;t implement in KWin due to how they&amp;#39;ve architected the CSDs. Martin could theoretically implement some special cases with a lot of work, but there&amp;#39;s no guarantee it would still function after the next GTK update. The only tenable solution is for the GTK folks to utilize a standardized CSD hint that works in a predictable manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, it&amp;#39;s been a pain in the ass.
