It is fitted with two M-Sata disks and one SSD, leaving one &amp;#39;spare bay&amp;#39; available. Transfer between those disks is lightening quick.\nIt is running Ubuntu Mate 16.10 (Mate is her preferred DE).\nIt simply seems to run everything that you can chuck at it with relative ease, and the degree of general productivity that can be achieved with a machine like this is of a very high order - it just never keeps you waiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a general comment - if you have never owned a  machine that is built to run Linux from day one, but have used a machine built for another OS and just put Linux on it, you will be in for a real treat buying a machine that is built specifically for the Linux OS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I would say very good value all round, and we have no hesitation in recommending it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;lspci output&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$ lspci\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Device 5910 (rev 05)\n00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Skylake PCIe Controller (x16) (rev 05)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Device 591b (rev 04)\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H USB 3.0 xHCI Controller (rev 31)\n00:14.2 Signal processing controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H Thermal subsystem (rev 31)\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H CSME HECI #1 (rev 31)\n00:17.0 SATA controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H SATA Controller [AHCI mode] (rev 31)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H PCI Express Root Port #1 (rev f1)\n00:1c.4 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H PCI Express Root Port #5 (rev f1)\n00:1c.6 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H PCI Express Root Port #7 (rev f1)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H LPC Controller (rev 31)\n00:1f.2 Memory controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H PMC (rev 31)\n00:1f.3 Audio device: Intel Corporation Device a171 (rev 31)\n00:1f.4 SMBus: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H SMBus (rev 31)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP106M [GeForce GTX 1060] (rev a1)\n6d:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.
