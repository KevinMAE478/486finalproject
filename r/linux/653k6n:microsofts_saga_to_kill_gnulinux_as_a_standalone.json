I'm not going to pretend Linux is perfect, just that I legitimately do think Windows doesn't do much of anything that great. The most that can be said is that it's GUI's do a decent job of abstracting implementation details away from less knowledgeable people and from a technical perspective it can not suck a lot of the time.\n&gt; SELinux is a mess, how often do you use semanage, restorecon and ls -lZ / ps -Zxau?\n\nEvery once in a while, about as often as I use chown or chmod. A lot of stuff is unconfined on the desktop and on servers once things are setup you really only fiddle with SELinux if something changes.\n\n&gt; It's such a mess than many admins just give up and use set enforce 0, leaving the security of their Linux system behind Windows since there's no context nor integrity levels.\n\nNot too far behind because IIRC when it comes to what Linux calls MAC, Windows pretty much only distinguishes between the OS and \"other stuff.\"\n\nBut there's no accounting for shutting off security features. All a vendor can do is provide you a means to protect yourself. A lot of that is just voodoo logic where people turn SELinux off seemingly just because you're supposed to not like it. As in I've seen several people _disable_ it to figure out if it's blocking something and when it comes out that it wasn't they still leave it disabled even though it wasn't what their problem was. A vendor can't really do anything about that kind of obstinate attitude.\n\nLike I said though SELinux could probably be simplified. I don't think it's that hard but I think if someone released something similar for most servers that just did the type enforcement stuff then I think people would've been a lot less prone to turning it off and more prone to figuring out how to solve their problems. \n\nNowadays, on the desktop, I think things are progressing towards using snappy/flatpak so the issue of simplifying SELinux for desktop users is kind of moot now.\n\n&gt; but the lack of integrity levels under Linux is a problem, it's the main reason why Firefox still can't be sandboxed properly. https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox#Current_Status\n\nI'm not going to pretend to understand Windows security terminology but from what I'm able to understand about what you linked it seems like it allows you to specify varying levels of authority and realms of action? If so then there are actually a variety of mechanisms for doing that on Linux. For example, on Fedora the plugin container for firefox runs confined by SELinux and there are other mechanisms such as seccomp, user/group DAC permissions, and setcap (for dropping process capabilities) to approximate that sort of affect. SELinux itself (and IIRC AppArmor as well) can also implement MCS and MLS logic for confining applications by type and sandboxing them from other applications of the same type.\n\nThis may be a case where you're just looking for a 1:1 analog and it just doesn't exist because it's a different OS. \n\nThat said, I don't think this is really that much of a problem. Flatpak and snappy are going to be the \"secure\" mean of deploying your applications going forward and they can be confined with MAC if you want.\n\n&gt; In the end, people still use the octal rights, straight from the seventies.\n\nYMMV but I've seen a lot of people use POSIX acl's. I think people generally just post examples online that are simple therefore only setting permissions for the owner/group/world is usually sufficient. You typically only do ACL's when you've got a lot of different sorts of people accessing the same data and obviously nobody's going to write a how-to that involves something that complicated.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning `chattr` since a lot of things that are missing from the POSIX operations list are present there. For instance, you can make a file undeletable or append-only there, you just can't do it using regular permissions like you can with richacls.\n\n&gt; VBS, anyone? Ease of use for smart cards and easy to use biometric features like Windows Hello? Device Guard? EMET features? GPOs? There's still none of that in the Linux world, sorry.\n\n[Linux supports smartcard authentication](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Managing_Smart_Cards/enabling-smart-card-login.html) and has for a long time now.\n\nEMET has loads of FOSS alternatives.
