Here&amp;#39;s something else to look forward to: I&amp;#39;m very very excited about Android not running on Linux, but on a microkernel. Check out &lt;a href=\"https://genode.org\"&gt;https://genode.org&lt;/a&gt;, there is a third party effort to port Android as a Genode component. This way we can choose to run Android on okL4, seL4, Fiasco, Fiasco.OC, Pistachio, the NOVA microhypervisor, the Muen separation kernel, or Genode&amp;#39;s own microkernel. (I&amp;#39;m most excited about seL4!!)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "linux", "name": "t1_dg5bffc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491991872.0, "created_utc": 1491963072.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ub75", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ub75", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ub75", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ue83", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jabjoe", "parent_id": "t1_dg5mk4e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/linux", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why?
