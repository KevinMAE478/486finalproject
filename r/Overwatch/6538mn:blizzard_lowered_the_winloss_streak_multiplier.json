Today I wanted to talk about a behind the scenes change to our matchmaking systems that just went live with the 1.10 patch, but first I should take a step back and provide some background information.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;As Jeff Kaplan noted in a recent post about smurfing, we do a decent job of quickly determining someone\u2019s skill at playing Overwatch. The faster we can update your matchmaking rating (MMR) to match your \u201creal\u201d skill, the fewer unfair matches get created with a player with inaccurate skill. Another way to look at it is that when we\u2019re incorrect at identifying someone\u2019s skill, then win or loss streaks can occur. One of the tools we use to accelerate a player to their appropriate MMR is a multiplier to the rating change based upon these consecutive wins or losses.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;While this streak multiplier has been working well in the \u201csmurf\u201d case, win or loss streaks can also just naturally occur when the matchmaking system has already properly identified skill. After all, the matchmaker is trying to place in you fair matches where you have a 50% chance to win. It\u2019s rare, but sometimes you flip a coin 5 times and it lands on heads every time. So, when these natural streaks occur, the multiplier has been accelerating gains and losses away from your \u201ctrue\u201d skill. You end up having a larger variance in skill rating over time, which in turn hurts the overall quality of the matches.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;Therefore, we\u2019re changing the tuning of the streak multiplier to be quite a bit less aggressive. You now need to win or lose more games in a row before any multiplier is used, and it scales up at a slower pace. Furthermore, we will now try to only use the multiplier in cases where the matchmaking system has some confidence that the player\u2019s MMR and skill are wildly mismatched. In cases of natural, random streaks, you ideally shouldn\u2019t see any acceleration either up or down at all.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;We\u2019ll be monitoring how these changes affect overall match quality going forward, and continue to adjust tuning over time to improve the fairness and quality of Overwatch matches. Thanks for the continued feedback, and good luck in your matches!\n\n\n---\n^(Beep boop. No, I do not want a banana.)\n\n^(I am robot.

In the last couple weeks since then, I climbed to the high 3800s and even broke 3900, then I went on a losing streak and fell down to 3690 or so. That losing streak was when I started losing more than I gained. Even so, I climbed back up to 3870, and then after the patch (and last night specifically), I got all the way to 3970, but the fucking losses keep fucking me over; I loss 3 in a row from 2970 and ended up at 3870, then won 4 and loss 1 and ended up at 3940.

I was pretty annoyed at first thinking this pc account will be doomed in bronze elo hell. One weekend and im back in to plat on PC. I would argue it has very much to do with skill. I also believe good coms and positive attitude go a long ways too. I saw an obvious increase of wins when I started drawing out coms from others and being positive with supportive criticism each match vs everyone remaining silent or allowing the tilties to run the coms....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On consoles Coms is typically non existent because everyone assumes the worst or just remain within their own team coms. At least on pc I can type and request others to use group coms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Overwatch", "name": "t1_dg7mmr3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123016.0, "created_utc": 1492094216.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u5kl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6538mn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7sjql", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ak474000", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ebf5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Overwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "When you just accept the fact the game is going to place you with people of your skill IE, the lower you go if you are dropping means you are going to find your skill floor at some point which means games will become a lot easier for you as well.\n\nThere is a give and take to the whole system.
