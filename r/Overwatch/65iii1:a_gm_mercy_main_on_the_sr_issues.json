If you have feedback regarding the rate at which SR is accrued, I suggest that you compile your feedback and continue to voice your opinion on the Competitive Discussion forum.\n\nBlizzard Response: Disagreeing with the number of points you received is not a bug. As the Quality Assurance team, we are responsible for meeting with development, understanding how the game is intended to function, and documenting instances where the game does not represent design intent. My team is not responsible/accountable for player-percieved \"fairness\" or \"balance\". We do playtests and communicate our own feedback/risks, but we do not decide the results of those conversations.
