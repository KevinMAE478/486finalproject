I know this isn't strictly relevant because it's not about Overwatch, but if you think it's bad for Australian characters in video games... Try being *Scottish*. Not only are there far, far fewer Scottish characters, but the vast majority - and I really do mean vast - are voiced by Americans. Poorly voiced. For a particularly relevant example from Blizzard: ever heard dwarves in World of Warcraft? Yeah. Yikes. I know there's the excuse of \"oh, but dwarves are fantasy characters!\" and... yeah, but they're clearly *meant* to sound Scottish, considering the attempt at an accent and the fact that a lot of them are walking, talking stereotypes (which also annoys me, but eh, that's another issue entirely). \n\nSo, really. I know your pain. I really do. I've always hoped that newer content from Blizzard featuring dwarves would have... actual Scottish voice actors. The closest they came was with the Innkeeper in Hearthstone, voiced by an Irish guy. An *Irish* guy, attempting a *Scottish* accent. (Not even an Ulster-Scot, who do speak somewhat similarly to us. No, a dude from south of Dublin. It is, of course, a mess.) \n\nI live in fear of the day they ever even *think* of introducing a Scottish character to Overwatch. I mean, I highly doubt it'll happen - but if it does, and if it's a rehash of their typical \"oh, just get an American voice actor to roll their R's a bit more, it'll be *fine*\" then... Hoo boy. I already grit my teeth whenever I have to hear a dwarf in WoW talk for any longer than a brief second. In Overwatch, playing the hero or playing with the hero? It'd just be a nightmare. (Alright, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, but still - the American perception of the Scottish accent is a very stereotypical, painfully stylised one. Like, it almost feels like mockery when they imitate us in such an over-the-top, ridiculous way. I have one of the \"rougher\" Scottish accents, so it does tend to make me self-conscious. Heh.)\n\nAnyway, sorry for going off on a tangent.
