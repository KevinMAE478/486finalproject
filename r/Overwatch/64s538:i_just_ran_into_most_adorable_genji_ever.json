It&amp;#39;s satisfying when either genji pulls his dragon blade and I hook him in mid cast and one shot him as he tries to jump on our Ana or Mercy or Lucio. Or hook the pesky Tracer trying to burst them down. Roadhog and Zarya is nice to save someone, zarya is more sure about negating the damage they would take also to charge yourself, but roadhog is kinda more fun imo, hook isn&amp;#39;t always too sure, but if you hook one you usually get a kill and get rid of the problem temporarily, while Zarya just blocks damage but the problem is still there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Overwatch", "name": "t1_dg4sej2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491968126.0, "created_utc": 1491939326.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u5kl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s538", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4xfm0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Toludude", "parent_id": "t3_64s538", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Overwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "**\"I NEED HEALING\"**\n\n^^\"Please\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;I NEED HEALING&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;quot;Please&amp;quot;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Overwatch", "name": "t1_dg4xfm0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491973734.0, "created_utc": 1491944934.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u5kl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s538", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5fbkx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Splinterbee", "parent_id": "t3_64s538", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Overwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In all honesty, I've never had problems with Genji.\n\nUnless hes on the ENEMY TEAM.
