I do a great job at attack Ana and defense Mercy.  I can make a good impact with either Zenyatta and Lucio as well.  My win rate with these four heroes range from 55% - 69% (69% with Zenyatta).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy playing support but yet, I don&amp;#39;t want to play support anymore.  I genuinely love playing Mercy and Zenyatta but I find myself conflicted.  I also play tank but I know I could be providing my team with the healing they need.  In competitive I&amp;#39;d rather play support because I know my team would be in good hands.  But I&amp;#39;m so conflicted, I don&amp;#39;t want to play support because even with my high win rate I don&amp;#39;t go anywhere in terms of SR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so fucking crazy because even though my SR creeps up slowly, my MMR seems to be going up higher.  It&amp;#39;s just a hunch but I&amp;#39;m being placed with much higher ranking players than m&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good support player is just as important as a good DPS player.  So instead of being a dick and not playing support in competitive, I&amp;#39;m just not going to play competitive.  I could be a DPS main but I&amp;#39;m no good at DPS so I&amp;#39;m not going to let my SR tank and ruin the experience for the 5 other people that get matched with me.

(My main is level 250, my alt is level 9.)\n\nI think what's happening is that since I lose so many quickplay matches on my main, my hidden MMR is way lower than my actual skill.  When I then go on to lose a match in competitive, the system wants to bring my SR as close to my hidden MMR as quickly as possible.  So when I lose, I lose a lot of SR.  When I win, the system knows it has to give me SR, but I still have that low hidden MMR, so it doesn't award very much.  (Don't want SR to get too far away from hidden MMR, after all.)  The end result is that your losses in quickplay end up becoming SR losses in competitive, despite your excellent performance in competitive (or a bad day where you have 6 games with leavers in a row).\n\nWhy does this affect supports disproportionately?  If you're Soldier or even D.va, you can mostly ignore your team and just frag out to win.  If you're Mercy, you can't do much with a team that won't group up, coordinate ults, pick reasonable compositions, or, to be blunt, even shoot at the enemy.  You can be the world's best Mercy and you won't turn the tide in those matches.\n\nThat's my theory.  We'll see if I'm right.\n\nSomeday I'll have to pull my main account out of Elo hell, though.

Meanwhile, my main account (with Mercy as my most-often-selected hero in QP) routinely has only players that have &amp;lt; 500 SR.  Interesting.  (My main is level 250, my alt is level 9.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think what&amp;#39;s happening is that since I lose so many quickplay matches on my main, my hidden MMR is way lower than my actual skill.  When I then go on to lose a match in competitive, the system wants to bring my SR as close to my hidden MMR as quickly as possible.  So when I lose, I lose a lot of SR.  When I win, the system knows it has to give me SR, but I still have that low hidden MMR, so it doesn&amp;#39;t award very much.  (Don&amp;#39;t want SR to get too far away from hidden MMR, after all.)  The end result is that your losses in quickplay end up becoming SR losses in competitive, despite your excellent performance in competitive (or a bad day where you have 6 games with leavers in a row).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why does this affect supports disproportionately?  If you&amp;#39;re Soldier or even D.va, you can mostly ignore your team and just frag out to win.  If you&amp;#39;re Mercy, you can&amp;#39;t do much with a team that won&amp;#39;t group up, coordinate ults, pick reasonable compositions, or, to be blunt, even shoot at the enemy.  You can be the world&amp;#39;s best Mercy and you won&amp;#39;t turn the tide in those matches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my theory.  We&amp;#39;ll see if I&amp;#39;m right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someday I&amp;#39;ll have to pull my main account out of Elo hell, though.  If I get to a high level only playing D.va, it will be hard to just switch back to Mercy and Ana.  I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Overwatch", "name": "t1_dgandv3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492292304.0, "created_utc": 1492263504.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u5kl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h9gy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgavsn4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FkthisTimeline", "parent_id": "t3_65h9gy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Overwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I had a 26 min game on lucio went 72-12, 9 min objtime, 51,objkill... 21 points..", "edited": 1492389500.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a 26 min game on lucio went 72-12, 9 min objtime, 51,objkill... 21 points..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Overwatch", "name": "t1_dgavsn4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492304868.0, "created_utc": 1492276068.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u5kl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h9gy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb2gn9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Didag", "parent_id": "t3_65h9gy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Overwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm in mid gold as a Mercy main.
