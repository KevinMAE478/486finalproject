When you run the numbers on how much energy a human requires to live our modern lifestyle, it&amp;#39;s astronomical. I have chosen to opt out of this because i&amp;#39;m concerned for my home planet (we only have one) and i just don&amp;#39;t feel called to fatherhood.  Marriage is another thing that i opt out of. I don&amp;#39;t need to bring the state in to my love affairs. When i love someone, i just love them, and nature runs it&amp;#39;s course. I&amp;#39;m not really monogamous, but not exactly polyamorous either. I just don&amp;#39;t like the obligations and drama that comes with &lt;em&gt;mild&lt;/em&gt; co-dependency (which is what most LTRs are). If i ever do get legally married (i won&amp;#39;t) it will be an economical decision, as married couples pay less taxes(super romantic, right?)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "simpleliving",
