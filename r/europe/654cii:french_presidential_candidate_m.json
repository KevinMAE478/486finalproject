Yes, according to M\u00e9lenchon. Following a tense interview with Patrick Cohen on the French TV show *C \u00e0 vous*, Alexis Corbi\u00e8re, spokesperson for the movement, highlighted a measure that, until then, did not stir up interest. *\"You leave the European treaties, you leave NATO, you leave the WTO, but France won't be left alone because in chapter 62, we join the Bolivarian Alliance, of which the principal members are Cuba and Venezuela, and of which Russia and Iran are observers. Cuba and Venezuela are not democracies, nor it is the case for Russia and Iran\"* pointed out the journalist.\n\nThe project is mentioned twice in Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon's platform-book. In chapter 62, *\"Build international and alter-globalized cooperations\"*, where it is specified *\"to establish a new foreign policy for co-development with Latin America and the Carribbean by joining the ALBA (Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America)\"*. In chapter 15 as well, dedicated to overseas policies, where it is planned to *\"join regional cooperations with a logic of human, social, and ecological co-development ; for example the ALBA (Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America) for the Antilles and French Guiana, Southern Africa for Mayotte and R\u00e9union, etc.\"*. In his booklet on the theme of overseas regions, he explains that French Guiana and the Antilles will join the ALBA, as well as the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).\n\n### Virtual common currency\n\nCreated in 2004 by Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Cuban leader Fidel Castro, the Bolivarian Alliance is first and foremost a political and economical alliance, which presents itself as an alternative to the American free-trade area, project supported by the United States. The purpose is *\"to reduce poverty and social inequalities resulting from the promiscuous enforcement of neoliberal policies\"* on the basis of *\"solidarity, justice, mutual support, and cooperation\"*. The founders claim to align their vision with Venezuelan icon Simon Bolivar's, *\"of unity and sovereignty in countries that overthrown colonial powers to gain their independence\"*.\n\nFrom an economical standpoint, a note from the French Treasury dated May 2016 explains that the Alliance is supported by two financial instruments. First, a virtual common currency available for the central banks in the member countries: the *Sucre* (*Syst\u00e8me unitaire de compensation r\u00e9gional*). The currency's purpose is to ease trades and investments within the Alliance, without the need of the dollar. The ALBA also created its very own bank in 2008, which holds a billion dollars to *\"consolidate the sovereignty and financial independence of the member countries of [the Alliance] by financing social development projects\"*. In six years, 46 projects (for a total of $334 million, that is more than \u20ac313 million) have been claimed to be initiated according to the Treasury. While offering as well ALBA Games, cultural prizes, and a program to fight illiteracy, the Alliance is first and foremost an opposition to the North Atlantic policies.\n\n### Iran and Syria observers\n\nThe Alliance as of today has twelve members: Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, and Saint Kitts and Nevis. The organization also includes three observers: Haiti, Iran and Syria. Not really democratic ...

Last year already, he claimed his desire to leave the European treaties to enter *\"in the coalition of the Carribbean and Latin American countries\"*. *\"The longest common border France has is with Brazil, not with Germany\"*, often argues M\u00e9lenchon while referring to French Guiana.\n\nEven Cl\u00e9mentine Autain, close supporter of M\u00e9lenchon, apparently did not know this aspect of the candidate's plateform.", "edited": 1492099602.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me translate all that for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What is this Bolivarian Alliance M\u00e9lenchon wants to join?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In his political platform, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of the Unsubmissive France movement, plans to join the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), a political and economical organization opposing the North Atlantic countries, created in 2004 by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Fidel Castro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is France a country of Latin America?

Hospital is shit, any administrative work is painful, social aids are divided by two, no social housing and above all: way overpriced food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can believe anything the politicians tells you but actually foreign territories receive about a tenth of what a metropolitan receive. Where are our tax cut then? We pay the same as any French.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A specific example: we recently had an insane immigration problem. Due to political problems in Comoros a lot of people immigrated here. They are sentenced to death in their home country so they would just try to get a living hiding in the mountains. They were a real pain for the local population, criminality and insecurity. So a huge majority of people here were whiling to vote for Le Pen. This year, an electoral year, the govt seeing how popular FN is, decided to finally correctly fund the police. You now what?
