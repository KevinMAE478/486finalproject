Last year they ran an article where they explained very clearly why they do this. \"Why we hate you and why we fight you\", the article was called. Excerpts that article:\n\n&gt;1. We hate you, first and foremost, because you are disbelievers; you reject the oneness of Allah \u2013 whether you realize it or not \u2013 by making partners for Him in worship, you blaspheme against Him, claiming that He has a son, you fabricate lies against His prophets and messengers, and you indulge in all manner of devilish practices. It is for this reason that we were commanded to openly declare our hatred for you and our enmity towards you.\n\n&gt;2. We hate you because your secular, liberal societies permit the very things that Allah has prohibited while banning many of the things He has permitted, a matter that doesn\u2019t concern you because you separate between religion and state, thereby granting supreme authority to your whims and desires via the legislators you vote into power. In doing so, you desire to rob Allah of His right to be obeyed and you wish to usurp that right for yourselves.\n\n&gt;3. In the case of the atheist fringe, we hate you and wage war against you because you disbelieve in the existence of your Lord and Creator.\n\n&gt;4. We hate you for your crimes against Islam and wage war against you to punish you for your transgressions against our religion. As long as your subjects continue to mock our faith, insult the prophets of Allah \u2013 including Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad \u2013 burn the Quran, and openly vilify the laws of the Shari\u2019ah, we will continue to retaliate, not with slogans and placards, but with bullets and knives.\n\n&gt;5. We hate you for your crimes against the Muslims; your drones and fighter jets bomb, kill, and maim our people around the world, and your puppets in the usurped lands of the Muslims oppress, torture, and wage war against anyone who calls to the truth.\n\n&gt;6. We hate you for invading our lands and fight you to repel you and drive you out. As long as there is an inch of territory left for us to reclaim, jihad will continue to be a personal obligation on every single Muslim.\n\n&gt;What\u2019s important to understand here is that although some might argue that your foreign policies are the extent of what drives our hatred, this particular reason for hating you is secondary, hence the reason we addressed it at the end of the above list. The fact is, even if you were to stop bombing us, imprisoning us, torturing us, vilifying us, and usurping our lands, we would continue to hate you because our primary reason for hating you will not cease to exist until you embrace Islam. Even if you were to pay jizyah and live under the authority of Islam in humiliation, we would continue to hate you.\n\nSo now you know.

It is for this reason that we were commanded to openly declare our hatred for you and our enmity towards you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hate you because your secular, liberal societies permit the very things that Allah has prohibited while banning many of the things He has permitted, a matter that doesn\u2019t concern you because you separate between religion and state, thereby granting supreme authority to your whims and desires via the legislators you vote into power. In doing so, you desire to rob Allah of His right to be obeyed and you wish to usurp that right for yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the atheist fringe, we hate you and wage war against you because you disbelieve in the existence of your Lord and Creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hate you for your crimes against Islam and wage war against you to punish you for your transgressions against our religion.
