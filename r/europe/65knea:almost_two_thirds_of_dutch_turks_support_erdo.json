Almost as big a majority condemns the role of the Netherlands in the diplomatic row with Turkey.\n\nThis is apparent from a survey of 561 Turkish Dutch in that, in command of the Times was carried out by Ipsos and the Opinion House. The study took place after the Netherlands two Turkish ministers had denied access to the country. That was the low point in the difficult relationship between the Netherlands and Turkey in recent months. Turkish Dutch groups protested in Rotterdam against the expansion of one of the ministers, but it was unknown how the Turkish community in general looks at the conflict. Now it appears that about six out of ten Dutch Turkish support the policies of Erdo\u011fan. \n\nTwo thirds of respondents disapprove of the Turkish ministers no campaign could perform in the Netherlands. Half welcomes the fierce reaction of Erdogan in the Dutch attitude in the conflict. Four in ten are (strongly) agree with Erdogan when he spoke of \"fascists and remnants of Nazis. A slightly larger proportion is not behind those statements. Young people under 35 supports Erdogan more frequently than the over 55s. Under Turkish Dutch who voted to think in the last parliamentary elections, Erdogan is still popular. 84 percent of voters think supports the controversial policies of the Turkish president.\n\nExperts see that Turkish-Dutch young people increasingly focus on Turkey Jaco Dagevos, professor integration and migration at the Erasmus University Rotterdam and researcher at the Social and Cultural Planning Office (SCP), said previous studies already showed that the Turkish community is very loyal to her country of origin. \"The degree of support to Erdogan does not therefore completely unexpected.\" Turkish election results showed that Erdogan's AKP is popular in the Netherlands, but also put down an uncertain picture because it was not clear whether ups and voters equally went to the polls. The Turkish-Dutch cultural anthropologist Ibrahim Yerden says the research results confirm a trend. Both experts see that Turkish-Dutch young people increasingly focus on Turkey.

The study took place after the Netherlands two Turkish ministers had denied access to the country. That was the low point in the difficult relationship between the Netherlands and Turkey in recent months. Turkish Dutch groups protested in Rotterdam against the expansion of one of the ministers, but it was unknown how the Turkish community in general looks at the conflict. Now it appears that about six out of ten Dutch Turkish support the policies of Erdo\u011fan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two thirds of respondents disapprove of the Turkish ministers no campaign could perform in the Netherlands. Half welcomes the fierce reaction of Erdogan in the Dutch attitude in the conflict. Four in ten are (strongly) agree with Erdogan when he spoke of &amp;quot;fascists and remnants of Nazis. A slightly larger proportion is not behind those statements. Young people under 35 supports Erdogan more frequently than the over 55s.
