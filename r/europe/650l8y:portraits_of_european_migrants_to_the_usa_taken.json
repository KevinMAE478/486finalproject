As such, capes are excellent when you need clothes to stay warm but want to get rid of them quickly when action starts.\n\n&gt;Why swords went out of style\n\nCartridges and rifling became more popular. Before that firearms were inaccurate and the charging times were long, making \"I'll let you shoot and then I'm going to run you through with my sword\" a valid strategy.

Before that, as long as the taxes kept flowing and there weren't rebellions, things were grand. The roads had bandits that could escape to forests for years without getting caught (and in fact, such people lived in Estonia until 1990s, being on the run from Soviets for one reason or another). In general, lack of technology and people being spread over the countryside made exact policing difficult: there was no way to travel fast, there was no way to communicate fast or longer distances, so it was pretty much every-man-for-themselves. With industrialisation people moved to cities and suddenly having police running around was that much more efficient: all you needed was a whistle.\n\nLack of wars: as killing became less acceptable as a profession (symbolised with how USA now has a defence ministry with the eagle looking at olive branch instead of war ministry with eagle looking at the weapons), people started to think more closely about weapons in daily life. Swords and guns can only be used for killing, while knives have other functions too (and indeed, it's still rather common to see workers walking on the street with knives hanging from a belt or being easily reachable in clothes, similarly as how those Russians had cartridges). As such, we got more laws on where it's acceptable to have guns: a change that came rather late in European societies. Apparently in the 1940s (or even 1960s) you could still buy a revolver as you would a cell phone today.\n\nAnd of course, when weapons were less common, killing with them was less common, too. After WW1, soldiers might still kill people on their furlong and only get fines (or similar); now it's nearly always jail time. \n\nClothing goes with technology.
