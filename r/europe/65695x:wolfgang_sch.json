Not the least for a small country with a relatively small police force such as Sweden.\n\n\n\nThere's 12,000 people that were denied asylum to Sweden who has since gone underground into hiding. There has been severe lack of action to prevent it from happening, and two attacks so far has been someone denied asylum and later turning radical or plotting some sort of revenge: The first one I can recall is the IKEA murders, where an Eriteran man spontaneously knifed a mother and her son to death. I don't see how that attack is any less bad than the recent truck attack, which was also a random act of hatred, probably not thinking more \"white = a swede\" to punish the country.\nBut back when that happened, there was no giant articles of a \"Sweden has been attacked in a terrorist attack!! In our beloved and all-important Stockholm !!\" It was just seen a sad thing, and no pictures of victims and perpetrator were displayed in the news. Only ones truly bothered were people on the Internet and right-wing websites. The man who attacked a bunch of teachers and kids at a immigrant-heavy school got a lot more publicity abroad and at home IIRC, because of being a case of \"far-right hatred\", but isn't any such attack, Islamic or not also far-right  hatred? Even when they are not a part of any political or even religious group, it's all equally racist attacks.\n\n Only difference is that attacks by truck or explosives are meant to kill hundreds or thousands if possible, but they rarely succeed. Knife attacks are harder to kill more than a few except in extremely crowded, confined areas.\n\n[A user in /r/Sweden said it right](https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/64d8t3/polischef_finns_just_nu_12_500_andra_avvikare/dg1gqts/):\n\n(Pardon my poor Google Translate + cleaning up translation but): \n\n* First, the person is to be found, it may require an extensive investigation.  We likely have no surplus of police, and the ones we have are hardly unoccupied.\n\n\n* The person is then to be picked up, which means a smaller or larger police operation...\n\n* Then the person must be put in a safe custody that he/she can not escape from, it ought to be in the style of high-risk prisons. In other words, large resource-heavy facilities, and we hardly have a bunch of empty prisons today.\n\n* Then to actually get the person out of the country requires even more. Ecpessialy if the person does not want to. It's not like we can just book a ticket Arlanda - Astana with Uzbekistan Airlines.  Probably some sort of police jet with a crew. We have, incidentally, probably no larger fleet of such planes.\n\n\n\n* In addition, all the problems to make it even be feasible depends on the country we are deporting to. It has been understood that it's not exactly problem-free.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492161135.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may sound simple to just &amp;quot;deport, deport!&amp;quot; but people underestimate the huge amount of resources to just deport a single person. Not the least for a small country with a relatively small police force such as Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s 12,000 people that were denied asylum to Sweden who has since gone underground into hiding. There has been severe lack of action to prevent it from happening, and two attacks so far has been someone denied asylum and later turning radical or plotting some sort of revenge: The first one I can recall is the IKEA murders, where an Eriteran man spontaneously knifed a mother and her son to death. I don&amp;#39;t see how that attack is any less bad than the recent truck attack, which was also a random act of hatred, probably not thinking more &amp;quot;white = a swede&amp;quot; to punish the country.\nBut back when that happened, there was no giant articles of a &amp;quot;Sweden has been attacked in a terrorist attack!! In our beloved and all-important Stockholm !!&amp;quot; It was just seen a sad thing, and no pictures of victims and perpetrator were displayed in the news. Only ones truly bothered were people on the Internet and right-wing websites. The man who attacked a bunch of teachers and kids at a immigrant-heavy school got a lot more publicity abroad and at home IIRC, because of being a case of &amp;quot;far-right hatred&amp;quot;, but isn&amp;#39;t any such attack, Islamic or not also far-right  hatred? Even when they are not a part of any political or even religious group, it&amp;#39;s all equally racist attacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only difference is that attacks by truck or explosives are meant to kill hundreds or thousands if possible, but they rarely succeed. Knife attacks are harder to kill more than a few except in extremely crowded, confined areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/64d8t3/polischef_finns_just_nu_12_500_andra_avvikare/dg1gqts/\"&gt;A user in /r/Sweden said it right&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Pardon my poor Google Translate + cleaning up translation but): &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the person is to be found, it may require an extensive investigation.  We likely have no surplus of police, and the ones we have are hardly unoccupied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person is then to be picked up, which means a smaller or larger police operation...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the person must be put in a safe custody that he/she can not escape from, it ought to be in the style of high-risk prisons. In other words, large resource-heavy facilities, and we hardly have a bunch of empty prisons today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then to actually get the person out of the country requires even more. Ecpessialy if the person does not want to. It&amp;#39;s not like we can just book a ticket Arlanda - Astana with Uzbekistan Airlines.  Probably some sort of police jet with a crew.
