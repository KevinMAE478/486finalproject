Yes, it was flawed, yes, it becane obsolete, but in any other field that wouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem. Das Kapital was supposed to be read, critiqued, the ideas were supposed to be developed further and adapted to changing times. Even Marx himself didn&amp;#39;t think his work is impervious to criticism - in fact, in the preface to the second edition of Communist Manifesto he himself wrote that in many regards it is already obsolete. Surely he thought of Das Kapital in the same manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we got instead was Lenin, who took it as gospel. And worse yet, he convinced himself  and his followers that they&amp;#39;re on a mission to change the world according to that Gospel, and that no price is too high to fulfill that destiny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they did it for so much time and so zealously that even admitting to having read Das Kapital makes you a tankie in the eyes of way too many people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, sadly, in the end I came to agree with a certain statement by Georgy Plekhanov, father of Russian social democracy: &amp;quot;Against Bolsheviks, all methods are acceptable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "europe", "name": "t1_dg4g5yr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491954820.0, "created_utc": 1491926020.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q6mw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q6mw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q6mw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q6mw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q6mw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q6mw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4y8fh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "OlejzMaku", "parent_id": "t1_dg4vbrg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/europe", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That the more generous view.
