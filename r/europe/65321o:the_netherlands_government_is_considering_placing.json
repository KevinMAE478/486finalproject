Because 1) vegetarians cannot have a shitty diet? 2) meat eaters cannot have a healthy diet? and 3) -and I cannot stress this enough- your source wasn't even talking about people going vegetarian...!!!!!

No, the reason you are feeling better is because you stopped eating 3 bags of crisps per day, drinking nothing but caffeinated water, and throw whatever crap you can find in the microwave/stove, and instead started taking control of your life and started eating healthy, fresh and varied food. (In general terms of course.) \n\nI'd like to reiterate that the source you provided does not say anything about vegetarianism. All it basically concludes is that if people were to take better care of satisfying their nutricial needs by eating more vegetables, that would be good for them; they'd have less health issues, it would be better for society, and it would stimulate the economy. Colour me suprised... And it is completely useless in supporting the position you hold.\n\n&gt;They changed to a diet that is better for all three.\n\nYour diet is also still bad for the environment, and arguably also still bad for animal's health. \n\n\n&gt;If you really don't give a shit about the previous three points, then don't put yourself in this discussion, it's pointless for everyone involved.\n\n'Agree to all my points on my moral superiority, or don't talk to me.' And people wonder why people don't like evangelical vegetarians.\n\nThe reason I get involved in discussions like this is not because I am some crazy meat lover who hates vegetarianism and vegans. Not at all. I actually don't eat that much meat at all. Believe it or not, but the total amount of meat I'll be eating this week will be 100gr of serrano ham, and I guess 100-300 gr of meat per week is average for me. I like cooking and I truly love vegetables. By your own source, me switching to not eating meat would have next to no effect at all. I saved more CO2 emissions by being more efficient with energy last year... And that is kind of my bone in this discussion; you claim moral superiority because you don't eat meat, and that is good for the environment. Yet most of you diet, I guarantee you, is still a waste and leads to unnecessary CO2 emissions. If you truly cared about the environment you'd basically just eat potato's and other root vegetables; those are the most efficient to produce after all (I love root vegetables btw: parsnip for the win!). But I'd bet my liver (no more wine!) on you consuming inefficient foodstuffs and drinks which are not strictly necessary for survival because you like them. And that is fine, I have no issue with that. But don't go disparaging others for making a slightly different judgement on what is acceptable in this regard. Because you and your way are not perfect, you simply drew an arbitrary line somewhere on what is acceptable, and what isn't. But that line is no better or worse than any other line drawn by any other. The real reason here is that it involves animals, and CO2 emission is just a conveniet stick to beat people with to convert them to your view that eating meat is bad. Although I am not sure you realise this yourself. And that is what I personally like about this: I get to point this out to you. In the end, once you take them to their logical conclusion, any reason any person ever gives for being vegetarian (or vegan) is just as stupid as whatever reason a person may give for eating meat. It just reflects subjective value judgements and which belies a certain world view, but not an underlying truth.\n\nEDIT: btw, perish the thought that I do not care about animal welfare; whenever feasibly I only eat biological meat, only consume biological diary and buy only free range eggs,  despite fully knowing that this is the absolute worst you could do to the environment. I do this because I feel we have a moral obligation to offer the best possible circumstances to the animals we keep.
