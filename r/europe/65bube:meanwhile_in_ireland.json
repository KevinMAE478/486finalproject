Permitting people to drink on Sunday permits alcohol to compete with God for human attention.  Were alcohol to win some people over, people might not attend church, and souls might be lost.  We shall keep the flame alive until you re-accept the Lord.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_laws_in_the_United_States\n\n* Arkansas: Arkansas has 75 counties, 39 of which are \"dry\", meaning the sale of any alcoholic beverage is prohibited entirely. (Some exceptions are made for private facilities). Private facilities must have licenses, which, in this state, can be rigorous. Sale of alcoholic beverages on Christmas Day is entirely prohibited, even in private facilities. Alcohol and liquor sales are entirely prohibited on Sunday and Christmas Day. (Some exceptions for private facilities are made for Sundays).\n\n* Florida: Several counties prohibit the sale of alcohol and sex toys on Sunday and during certain hours.\n\n* Georgia: Sunday retail alcohol sales in stores were prohibited by the Georgia General Assembly up until 2011. On April 28, 2011, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal signed legislation allowing local communities to vote on whether to allow alcohol sales on Sundays.[5] Sales are still restricted on Sundays before 12:30 p.m. On November 8, 2011, voters in more than 100 Georgia cities and counties voted on a bill that would allow stores to sell alcohol on Sundays. It passed in Valdosta, Atlanta, Savannah and many other cities.\n\n* Illinois: Sunday retail alcohol sales in stores are prohibited until after 11:00 a.m.\n\n* Indiana: Carry-out alcohol sales were strictly prohibited on Sundays until 2010, when the State amended its laws to permit qualified breweries to sell local brews for carryout (generally growlers). Restaurants and taverns can generally still serve alcoholic beverages.[11] Alcohol sales are no longer prohibited on New Years Day unless it falls on a Sunday. The Sunday rule that prohibits alcohol sales at carry-out venues is still in effect.\n\n* Minnesota: The sale of alcohol in liquor stores is prohibited statewide on Sundays.[26] As recently as the 2015 legislative session, proposals to allow Sunday liquor sales have been defeated.   However, Sunday growler purchases are legal.\n\n* Mississippi: The sale of alcohol is prohibited in most of Mississippi on Sundays. Also, the sale of liquor is not allowed at all in nearly half of the state's counties.\n\n* Missouri: The sale of alcohol is prohibited from 1:30 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. Saturday through Monday.[31] Alcohol sales on Sunday are allowed from 9:00 a.m. to midnight subject to an additional liquor license fee.\n\n* New Mexico: New Mexico does not allow alcohol sales on Sunday before noon.\n\n* New York: Alcohol sales for consumption off-premises are not permitted between 3 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Sundays, while on-premises sales are not permitted between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. on any day...Relatively few parts of New York actually permit alcohol sales at all times permissible under state law; most counties have more restrictive blue laws of their own.\n\n* North Carolina: North Carolina does not allow alcohol sales between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. Monday through Saturday and between 2 a.m. and noon on Sundays.\n\n* North Dakota: North Dakota may have the strictest remaining blue law of the United States.

(Some exceptions are made for private facilities). Private facilities must have licenses, which, in this state, can be rigorous. Sale of alcoholic beverages on Christmas Day is entirely prohibited, even in private facilities. Alcohol and liquor sales are entirely prohibited on Sunday and Christmas Day.

Restaurants and taverns can generally still serve alcoholic beverages.[11] Alcohol sales are no longer prohibited on New Years Day unless it falls on a Sunday. The Sunday rule that prohibits alcohol sales at carry-out venues is still in effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minnesota: The sale of alcohol in liquor stores is prohibited statewide on Sundays.[26] As recently as the 2015 legislative session, proposals to allow Sunday liquor sales have been defeated.
