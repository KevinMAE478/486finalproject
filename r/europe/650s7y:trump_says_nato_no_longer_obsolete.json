I think they want to put the US military firmly in charge of foreign policy.  That will naturally result in a more traditional foreign policy.  It will also cause the US to move away from Obama&amp;#39;s policy of diplomacy, which put the State Department in the driver&amp;#39;s seat most of the time, and towards a greater reliance on military posturing and displays of force.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trump&amp;#39;s State Department, which is in charge of diplomacy, is &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/03/state-department-trump/517965/\"&gt;understaffed and isolated&lt;/a&gt;.  I wonder if there is a rivalry between the military and State.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rise of the generals explains the &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bannon-removed-from-security-council-as-mcmaster-asserts-control/2017/04/05/ffa8b5d2-1a3a-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html\"&gt;purge of Trump&amp;#39;s ideological advisor from the National Security Council and the restoration of traditional military figures to the Council&lt;/a&gt; soon after McMaster took office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It explains the bombing of Syria, which US military leaders advocated in 2013 after the first use of gas by the Syrian military.  Obama chose to take the issue to Congress instead of unilaterally authorizing an attack.  When Congress said no, Obama pursued diplomacy rather than pushing the matter, and he negotiated a deal to drastically reduce Syrian stockpiles of gas.  The US military wasn&amp;#39;t happy due to concerns that even though Obama had said that Syria would cross a &amp;quot;red line&amp;quot; if it used gas, the US hadn&amp;#39;t backed up that declaration forcefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It explains Trump&amp;#39;s shift on NATO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it explains his decision to respond to North Korea&amp;#39;s missile tests and nuclear program with displays of intimidating military strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The generals are in charge now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "europe", "name": "t1_dg75b2f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492086764.0, "created_utc": 1492057964.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 53}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650s7y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650s7y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650s7y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650s7y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7eyxz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "live_free", "parent_id": "t1_dg7bxap", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/europe", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Unfortunately both yourself and /u/23PowerZ are incorrect.\n\n--\n\nNorth Korea has been updating it's KN-11 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) and is inching closer to fielding a semi-credible 2nd strike capacity.
