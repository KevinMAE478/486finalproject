It's well known that Kadirov is involved in a lot of shit and acts as part of the mafia(murders, trafficking, laundering money, etc). Why is he still free and/or alive?

Has Putin done anything to stop the phenomenon or punish the chechens doing this? Nope.

So by coming up with anti-lgbt measures, he is doing something good, protecting russian values from the same degradation as in the west.
