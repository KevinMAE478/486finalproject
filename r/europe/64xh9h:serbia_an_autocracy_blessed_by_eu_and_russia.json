What police said? The were just FUCKING JOKING. I was controller on one voting spot, and SNS&amp;#39;s men were shady as fuck. As soon as I go to WC they start talking to each other and calling someone (you musnt use phone while inside), shady as fuck. In rural parts there arent any control against Vucic. He stole so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But. You are right. He would still have more %. Why? Becouse he is great at brainwashing, and becouse of that he has support of elder people who go to vote in much larger numbers than young ones. But if he didnt stole that 20-25% he would have 30% and that means second round. Many didnt even vote becouse of depression where you know he will win. But if there was second round. Vucic vs Jankovic I guarantee he would loose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am depressed af right now.
