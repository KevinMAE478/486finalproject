More of a Robin Hood type. All players got a special enchantment at the end of the campaign, his is his bow which now fires three arrows (weaker shots on the 2nd and 3rd)\n\n2. Theren Stormwind - CN Half-Elf Ranger - former assassin, definitely the strongest of the party (was a little powergamish despite it being all but two player's first games). His enchantments were for his dual shortswords which he used liberally, they basically gave him a wombo combo that only allies could trigger (to help them get more involved since he was unbalancing the combat)\n\n3. Tishnys - CG Dwarf Wizard - Bunny familiar clinging to the bucket helmet, which yes I ruled she could have and gain +1 AC for as a joke :P her bonus was the Book of Elements which gave her non elemental spells bonus effects.\n\n4. Fen Sighnu - CG Human Barbarian - Violence solves everything! She got an AC/STR/CON bonus in the form of \"Stone Skin\".\n\n5. Amber Blackhand - CG Dwarf Cleric - Joined late and made her character into the sister of a fallen NPC, a different dwarf cleric named Oryk. Her bonus was getting a thornmail-like effect to her armor.\n\n6. Bolpee - ?? Wood Elf Bard - The only character that had to be rerolled. Formerly a dragonborn rogue (seen in the illusion). The party encountered him while searching for a lost tribe of wood elves. He got a magic black saxophone thing (he plays sax irl), which spews empowered illusions. The ball bearings around him are a tribute to his former character which used them LIBERALLY (much to the disdain of the rest of the party :P)\n\nThe flaming trident is also a tribute to a friend who lives a state over and was only available for the first session.
