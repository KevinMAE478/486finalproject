Whichever of the several doors (including the exit) players walk through, they will find themselves in an identical room inscribed with the number 2. The next room will have the number 3, and so on. If they turn around and try to \"go back\" they find that the room now has the next number instead of the previous number. If players light a candle, that candle will still be lit in the next room. If at any point a room has a number of lit candles equal to the number room they are in, the doors become exits to the next room. The rooms are large enough that it takes about 10 minutes just to walk through.

It&amp;#39;s held by a very nimble prank loving pixie illusionist who thinks it&amp;#39;s hilarious to watch you fail to get the box. When you do get the box though it turns out the key is a life like flaccid penis you have to... coax... to get in the keyhole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no &lt;del&gt;spoon&lt;/del&gt; key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key only exists in your mind. The characters can poke around inside the lock and from their investigation, can get a description of the lock mechanism and tumblers. They must then draw the key that would open the lock. A correct drawing will cause the key to manifest in their hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys of unusual size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key is microscopic or gargantuan. Perhaps the dungeon itself turns out to be a giant key that must somehow be excavated and moved to another dungeon that&amp;#39;s a enormous lock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NERD PUZZLES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Euclidean dungeons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s so many options here, but I&amp;#39;ll just list a couple. If each face of &lt;a href=\"https://www.robives.com/blog/donutdoughnut_fun\"&gt;this paper torus&lt;/a&gt; is one room of a dungeon, you can make dungeons that wrap around themselves in strange ways without any obvious &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot;. A few days ago, I shared a &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/65gj33/the_chambers_of_chaos_madness_an_abberant_dungeon/\"&gt;5-dimensional dungeon&lt;/a&gt; over on &lt;a href=\"/r/dndbehindthescreen\"&gt;/r/dndbehindthescreen&lt;/a&gt;. The possibilities when you start playing with non-traditional geometries are really boundless and cool, but it&amp;#39;ll take some thought to wrap your own head around it well enough to implement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming puzzles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s one I originally posted &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/5uk8rv/from_my_dungeon_to_yours_a_handful_of_traps/ddvv7nd/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The are 1,000,000 unlit candles in a large room and a tile with the number 1 inscribed on the floor by the doorways. Whichever of the several doors (including the exit) players walk through, they will find themselves in an identical room inscribed with the number 2. The next room will have the number 3, and so on. If they turn around and try to &amp;quot;go back&amp;quot; they find that the room now has the next number instead of the previous number. If players light a candle, that candle will still be lit in the next room. If at any point a room has a number of lit candles equal to the number room they are in, the doors become exits to the next room. The rooms are large enough that it takes about 10 minutes just to walk through. Keep track of time, exhaustion, rations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DnD", "name": "t1_dge99x3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492498003.0, "created_utc": 1492469203.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9ei", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wp3c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge9azs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Asddsa76", "parent_id": "t3_65wp3c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DnD", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The mirrored instructions:\n\nThe player enter a room full of fire, and a scorched piece of paper lies on the ground.
