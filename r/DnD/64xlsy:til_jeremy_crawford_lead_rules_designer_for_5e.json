These sorts of complicated cases constitute a considerable barrier to entry for the casual player: someone who&amp;#39;s always been curious about the game but never had an invitation to play. Some of them will go on to achieve rules mastery, but the majority of casual players will remain lightly invested in the face of the many other options provided by video games and card and board games. If we want to keep these people and grow the hobby we need to better accommodate all levels of player interest. Let&amp;#39;s encourage the existence of lighter, more story-focused versions of the games for players who enjoy that and let hardcore players use all rules and options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DnD", "name": "t1_dg6endx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492054138.0, "created_utc": 1492025338.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -13}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg651c5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 109, "report_reasons": null, "author": "itsactuallyobama", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ukx0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DnD", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Rules put every player on an even playing field.
