So I would put this at about 100 tones of rock per gold of dust. That's about 5/1000th of an ounce of dust per 100 tons of rock. To get enough to make that +1 weapon, you need 2 ounces (1/8th pounds) and you'll need to mine through about 40 thousand tons of meteor.

Your meteor will have to be at least 160 thousand cubic yards.

I would put the Meteor cost and most of the 500gp (maybe 350?) and have them use it in the crafting of the blade itself. An average Longsword weighs in at about 4 pounds so I would use maybe an eighth of a pound of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By my suggestion, it would cost 2800gp per pound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Didn&amp;#39;t see the last bit about how much a meteorite would yield. According to &lt;a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/tons-of-rock-for-an-ounce-of-gold-2013-4\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article, it takes up to about 100 tones of rock to get an ounce of gold. So I would put this at about 100 tones of rock per gold of dust. That&amp;#39;s about 5/1000th of an ounce of dust per 100 tons of rock. To get enough to make that +1 weapon, you need 2 ounces (1/8th pounds) and you&amp;#39;ll need to mine through about 40 thousand tons of meteor. I don&amp;#39;t know how dense these meteors are so I am going to use &lt;a href=\"http://www.edumine.com/xtoolkit/tables/sgtables.htm\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; chart to guess your rock density at... maybe 2 tons per cubic yard. Your meteor will have to be at least 160 thousand cubic yards. I couldn&amp;#39;t find a great comparison but about 30 meteors of this size can fit into the volume of the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Assembly_Building\"&gt;Nasa Vehicle Assembly Building&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DnD", "name": "t1_dgcxr1y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492423019.0, "created_utc": 1492394219.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcwnim", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fresh4", "parent_id": "t3_64oy04", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DnD", "controversiality": 0, "body": "5e\n\nPlayer wants to make a +1 sword.
