To provide information so that the characters can make informed decisions in how their actions will affect the world and how they will be affected by the actions that they choose to take.\n\nThe Player's role is to operate within the world established by the DM and to experience the world they have been provided and then to act in accordance to their character.\n\nI'd underline the last bit as largely it's the player's job to play the game, but playing their character is just as important less the party decides to turn murder-hobo.\n\nThis brings us to an important term that I believe your DM has a struggle with.\n\nPlayer Agency is the go to term in this scenario. Really a few things fall under this term. But I'd argue it is a cardinal rule of roleplaying games.\n\nPlayer Agency includes the following:\n\n1: The player is in control of their character and their own decisions. (This does not include scenarios that involve them failing against a charm spell. These are things)\n\n2: The decisions that they make within the game world have consequences.\n\n3: The player has enough information to be able to feasibly see what those consequences would be before they make them.\n\nExample A: A player decides to run up and punch a Lich in the face. &gt; That player understands they can very easily die.\n\nExample B: The player refuses to give food to an orphan due to X reason. &gt; This orphan turns out to be a god and curses the player with numerous negative effects for their lack of compassion.\n\nThe ultimate goal of DND, and I ran into this very recently in my own campaign as a player and had to talk to my DM is being in control of your decisions. But this isn't limited solely to your own character actions either.\n\nFor example a God appears before a player and says \"Serve me in X.\" The player obviously has two very obvious choices with many others in between. But lets say the character refuses, and is promptly killed by the god for their refusal?\n\nThen was there ever really a choice to begin with? Or was it just the illusion of choice?\n\nTalk to your DM, Player Agency is highly important. It is the only thing that makes the difference between a group of players, both PC and DM coming together to play a game. Or a group of people getting together to listen to someone tell a story.\n\nExplain to him that the only thing that defines who your character is is their ability to react to any given situation and how they choose to do so.. It is what makes your character who they are.

To provide information so that the characters can make informed decisions in how their actions will affect the world and how they will be affected by the actions that they choose to take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Player&amp;#39;s role is to operate within the world established by the DM and to experience the world they have been provided and then to act in accordance to their character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d underline the last bit as largely it&amp;#39;s the player&amp;#39;s job to play the game, but playing their character is just as important less the party decides to turn murder-hobo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This brings us to an important term that I believe your DM has a struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Player Agency is the go to term in this scenario. Really a few things fall under this term. But I&amp;#39;d argue it is a cardinal rule of roleplaying games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Player Agency includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1: The player is in control of their character and their own decisions. (This does not include scenarios that involve them failing against a charm spell. These are things)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2: The decisions that they make within the game world have consequences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3: The player has enough information to be able to feasibly see what those consequences would be before they make them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example A: A player decides to run up and punch a Lich in the face. &amp;gt; That player understands they can very easily die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example B: The player refuses to give food to an orphan due to X reason. &amp;gt; This orphan turns out to be a god and curses the player with numerous negative effects for their lack of compassion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of DND, and I ran into this very recently in my own campaign as a player and had to talk to my DM is being in control of your decisions. But this isn&amp;#39;t limited solely to your own character actions either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example a God appears before a player and says &amp;quot;Serve me in X.&amp;quot; The player obviously has two very obvious choices with many others in between. But lets say the character refuses, and is promptly killed by the god for their refusal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then was there ever really a choice to begin with? Or was it just the illusion of choice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talk to your DM, Player Agency is highly important. It is the only thing that makes the difference between a group of players, both PC and DM coming together to play a game. Or a group of people getting together to listen to someone tell a story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Explain to him that the only thing that defines who your character is is their ability to react to any given situation and how they choose to do so..
