That means in three turns, Spiritual Weapon has overtaken Guiding Bolt and matched Inflict Wounds. Plus, it left your Action free to do more damage (or whatever.)\n\nLevel 3:\n\n* Animate Dead - A single skeleton does 1d6+2 (5.5) damage. That means in 4 turns it has tied Guiding Bolt and is gaining on Inflict Wounds. This only occasionally uses a Bonus Action (to change orders), so it leaves you even more free to do more damage in the mean time. Note that one slot can control 4 skeletons, so at maximum loadout each turn they take is like a 3rd level Guiding Bolt.\n\n* Spirit Guardians - 3d8 (13.5) + 1d8 (4.5)/SL (save for half).  Overtakes Guiding Bolt in two turns, or one turn hitting two enemies. Overtakes Inflict Wounds on the next turn. Takes an Action to cast, just like GB/IW, but at least it leaves your action free from then on.\n\nLevel 4:\n\n* Guardian of Faith - Does 20 damage (save for half instead of miss for none) to anything that approaches until 60 damage has been dealt. Overtakes both in 2-4 ticks.\n\nLevel 5:\n\n* Flame Strike - 8d6 (28) + 1d6 (3.5)/SL, save for half. While very much the poor-man's Fireball, it still does more damage than IW with just two targets struck.\n\nLevel 6:\n\n* Blade Barrier - 6d10 (33) damage (save for half). Overtakes the equivalent GB in just a single tick, IW in two.\n\n* Harm - 14d6 (49) damage, save for half. Straight up stronger than GB/IW, although it can't reduce the target below 1 (that's what Spiritual Weapon is for.)\n\nLevel 7:\n\n* Firestorm - 7d10 (38.5), save for half.
