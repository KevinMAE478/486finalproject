It was fucking crazy. Like me, the dm and other people were actually sweating a bit. So my pc who is an Tiefling rogue is looking for his sister who means everything to him and he would do almost everything to get her back. So our party was fighting a flesh fiend we had encountered in an abandond village. He disguised himself as an angel of pelor but with a really good insight I found out he was lying. Our group had found 2 vials of blood a while ago which as we found out are like pure evil. We thought if we would use it on him it would reveal his true nature. What it actually did was make him even stronger so I thought fuck it ill use it on myself. After that I basicly turned into a 12 foot tall super strong Tiefling. After defeating the fiend my character thought that removing the blood from his body would be a waste of power so I didnt let the party take it away from me again. There was a big argument and most members of the party were just mad at my pc and left. That night my character had a dream. The blood belonged to a dark god who promised me power and help if I would kill all of my party members. I was actually thinking about it at the time and told him that I needed to think about it. The following night the fighter and I were alone together and the party was off somewhere. We were very good friends at the time and he wanted to help me. When he turned around I told the dm that I pulled out my dagger. At this point the entire party just sat there in silence. The fighter noticed it with a very good perception roll and drew his sword as well. We both talked about 5 min with our weapons in hand and as I was about to attack the dm told me that I heard a voice in my head. My sisters voice. After that I instantly dropped the dagger and refused to pick it up. The god was mad at me and decided to kill me. I had to make a bunch of wisdom saving throws as he basicly tried to destroy my mind. After a while there was no use and I fell down to 0 hp. Time for death saves. First one 18, second one an 18 again. In my head I am fucking fighting a bunch of dark tentecals trying to swallow me. Then I fail the first one. As all of this is going on the fighter send someone to get help and tries to revive me. The dm says that I am looking worse so he tries to heal me with a greater potion. Nothing happend. Then he started praying and we all were like holy shit. He never prays. Like he hates the gods. Like a lot. So the dm says ok through that I will have advantage on my next death save. I roll. A natural 1. The enitre groups including me and the dm freak out. Ok next roll. A fucking 17. In my head as I am about to die I feel two hands reaching for me. The first one is the raven queen and the second one is pelor. Two fucking gods at once. And so I awake and we both just collapse on the floor from exhaustion. Ill never forget that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone else have any moments like this.
