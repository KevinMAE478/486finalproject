I had been playing with the same group for a number of years and we really played well together.  We'd start new characters every 6 months or so and rotate DM duties.  \n\nOne of my group mates  had a young fighter.  The character claimed to be of an aristocratic background but from a family on the other side of the continent.  No one had ever heard of the place from whence he came.  There had been a falling out with his father and he was out to prove himself.  The character was flamboyant, inexperienced, and reckless.  My character was an older fighter.  Mid-40s, strong but out of shape.  He'd spent his life as a mercenary and really found no joy in life. \n\nWe had created the characters independently but as the adventure progressed, the two characters meshed.  There was a whole big brother - little brother dynamic that developed.  About a third of the way through the adventure, we were level 5 or something, the younger fighter dies.  Just bad luck on the dice.  Totally unexpected and we had no way to rez him.  I decided that the most in character thing that the older fighter would do would be to bring the remains of the younger character to his estranged father.  I announce that this is what I plan to do.  \n\nWe had 2/3 of the adventure left but this felt right.  It felt organic.  So we took a 2 week break.

I had been playing with the same group for a number of years and we really played well together.  We&amp;#39;d start new characters every 6 months or so and rotate DM duties.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my group mates  had a young fighter.  The character claimed to be of an aristocratic background but from a family on the other side of the continent.  No one had ever heard of the place from whence he came.  There had been a falling out with his father and he was out to prove himself.  The character was flamboyant, inexperienced, and reckless.  My character was an older fighter.  Mid-40s, strong but out of shape.  He&amp;#39;d spent his life as a mercenary and really found no joy in life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had created the characters independently but as the adventure progressed, the two characters meshed.  There was a whole big brother - little brother dynamic that developed.  About a third of the way through the adventure, we were level 5 or something, the younger fighter dies.  Just bad luck on the dice.  Totally unexpected and we had no way to rez him.
