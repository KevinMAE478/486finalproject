Or are you nervous? Excited? Scared? Tense? Unsure? Angry? A mix of all of them? If you are not used to dealing with (or having) huge emotional surges then any emotion could mask itself as anxiety because you are more focused on the fact you're having the emotion than what it is. I, for example, pause movies that are drama's when the drama gets intense.  Cause I don't usually have huge swings of emotion so feelings of dread and what is going to happen are uncommon for me. So I pause and get a drink of water and remember it is a movie and come back and watch it. But that pause drained the whole tension out of the moment. Here's the thing though. I like it better when I don't pause. The release of \"Wow, that was amazing\" is more fun than breaking immersion. But that is me and not you. \n\nNext time you are feeling anxious (and it's not your turn) take a second to look at why. Are you anxious of making the wrong decision? Or are you not actually anxious but something else? If you are scared of messing up then tell the game brb and grab some water. And remember, it's a game. Nobody is going to die, nobody is even going to be mad more than 15 min if everyone dies (then they roll new chars and get excited again). It is just a game. Take this to your real life. 99% of your descions in real life are not going to kill you or radically change the outcome of your life. No, not asking out that person does not mean you missed the love of your life. Saying \"you too\" when they say \"enjoy the movie\" is not world ending. Use the game to help you realize that anxiousness can be controlled and dealt with. \n\nIf you want to go a step further play with a notepad next to you. When you feel anxious jot down what it is about (say the wrong thing in negotiations and we die). Then write down after the game is over what happened (we didn't die but were captured).

Whether it&amp;#39;s going on &amp;quot;autopilot&amp;quot; for a combat (short, simple turns) or just putting myself out of the RP for a little bit by saying my character is sleeping/not paying direct attention/quietly studying I find that not having to think and feel as intensely about my actions as a PC helps. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, just excuse yourself for a couple minutes and try some breathing exercises/have a glass of water to try and calm down a bit. If you&amp;#39;re in the middle of combat maybe let your DM know what you plan to do in-game and let them pilot your character while you take a quick break.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope these tips help, they generally work okay for me! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DnD", "name": "t1_dg8wugi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492185483.0, "created_utc": 1492156683.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9ei", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zsu5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6f5pr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "th30be", "parent_id": "t3_64zsu5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DnD", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You know this is a fucking game right?
