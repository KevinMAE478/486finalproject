But that is because alignment is a broad concept that is not at all rigid. The lawful character can and sometimes will break rules. The chaotic character can and sometimes will follow rules. The good character can and sometimes will do horrible things. The evil character can and sometimes will do wonderful things.\n\nBut it is the general pattern of their actions that makes them what they are. The evil character will mostly be selfish. The good character will mostly be selfless. The lawful character will mostly live inside the rules systems he/she finds worthy of following.

Is this person motivated by the desire to better others (good) or themselves (evil)?\n\nIn short, D&amp;D alignment is a rigid set of qualifiers that sets out to answer a very simple question: Who does your character serve and why?

Let's consider expanding the alignment grid from 2D to 3D, even just for the sake of further fleshing out these rather rudimentary character explanations!\n\nWe can attempt to simply classify a character's alignment in two different categories. **Morality** is one such feature, which contains good, neutral, and evil. The other is **ethics** which contains lawful, neutral, and chaotic. However, it isn't *really* that simple. There is another major category at work here.\n\n**Outlook** is how a character views the world and to what extent they should apply their morality and ethics to it. This also has three different possibilities: passive, neutral, and extreme. Let's take Bob the everyman, just a commoner in a small village. However, he is chaotic neutral. He must be a bad dude, right? Well... not exactly. It depends what his world view is. Let's look at three different scenarios now...\n\n**Passive chaotic evil** Bob grew up a school bully, and his ways never changed. He likes poking fun at people who pass him on the street or come into his shop. He's a bit mean, and putting other people down makes him feel better. He's pretty much a dick, but the party might chuckle at how amusing Bob is or the sly remark to one of the party members. Hell, the party might even like him. **Neutral chaotic evil** Bob is a bit more aggressive. He still owns a shop, but will yell at people who mess up the order of things or don't have the proper change for purchasing something. He's also been known to get into fist fights with anyone who pursues an argument with him. People in town kind of wish Bob would just go away. This is the kind of the guy the party will want to mess with or steal from, because he's a major asshole. **Extreme chaotic evil** Bob is very aggressive. Still has his shop, wants his business to do well, and might end up killing any of the competition or someone in town who has done him wrong in that regard. Maybe he's hired someone else to do the job. Maybe he likes doing the killing himself, doesn't really trust anyone else to do it. This is the kind of guy the party might actively pursue as a villain, especially if Bob directly targets them as threats for his shop. This Bob is criminal. \n\nThis Bob shop owner could be applied to any combination of ethics, morality and outlook. Passive lawful evil Bob might visit competitors and attempt to disturb the flow of their work by chatting with employees, the owner, or persuade people in the shop to come to his. Extreme neutral good Bob is very pleasant, kind to everyone who comes into his shop, and will even support his other competition to some extent. \n\nAs you can see, it's not just a 2D grid of nine choices, but a bit more complex 3D grid of 27 choices. You could even go a step further and say that **power** may play a significant role... extreme chaotic evil Bob would be a different man altogether if he was the baron of a town rather than a lowly shop owner, wouldn't he? However, power is more of an aspect of what they have, rather than who they are. A king could be a passive lawful evil character, which means he'd be more a selfish and a bit of a bully, but not an *extreme* tyrant by any means. But, still an important thing to consider!\n\nI'd love to hear some thoughts on this! Even with 27 possibilities, it's still difficult to directly pinpoint who someone *is*.
