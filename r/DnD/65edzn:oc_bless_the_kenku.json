There&amp;#39;s no mechanical benefit. This isn&amp;#39;t someone abusing a &amp;quot;perks and quirks&amp;quot; system to get a higher ability score and then never playing up their flaws (I&amp;#39;m looking at you, Savage Worlds).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are absolutely welcome to play &lt;strong&gt;your characters&lt;/strong&gt; however you want. But you don&amp;#39;t get to dictate how someone else plays theirs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have pretty strong feelings about certain things, and if I&amp;#39;m the DM I lay down certain rules ahead of time. But once we&amp;#39;ve gotten past session zero, the character belongs to the player. I don&amp;#39;t tell my players that they can&amp;#39;t use a French accent for a dwarf because dwarves are Scottish in my world. I don&amp;#39;t tell them elves MUST be haughty. I don&amp;#39;t tell them halflings have to be chipper all the damn time. And I definitely don&amp;#39;t try to enforce &amp;quot;anti-metagame&amp;quot; rules that don&amp;#39;t make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DnD", "name": "t1_dga0kh5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492245206.0, "created_utc": 1492216406.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9ei", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65edzn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaqzp6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nr1988", "parent_id": "t1_dg9tkay", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DnD", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Where does it say you can't form sentences?
