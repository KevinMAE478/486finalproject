I was DM&amp;#39;ing a one-shot for some first-time players, many of them women.  I had a few misgivings about bringing them to the shop because I&amp;#39;d never been there.  I didn&amp;#39;t know the atmosphere.  But I didn&amp;#39;t have a lot of options.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, most of the night went off without a hitch.  I got my players settled in and we ran through my dungeon.  We&amp;#39;re having a blast, although one of my players didn&amp;#39;t seem to be staying invested.  That&amp;#39;s fine.  It&amp;#39;s her first time, and she wasn&amp;#39;t really sure about the whole D&amp;amp;D thing.  I do my best to give her and everyone else a good first experience with the game, and if they end up liking it, then that&amp;#39;s great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, people&amp;#39;s games started to wrap up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, I noticed a few guys meandering near our table and hovering over some of my players&amp;#39; shoulders.  That&amp;#39;s okay.  Anybody&amp;#39;s free to watch.  But then, it takes a turn for the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A young man decides that it is completely appropriate to pull up a seat at my table and start talking to one of my players WHILE WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR GAME.  What&amp;#39;s worse?  It was my least engaged player.  My player who probably felt the least comfortable in this venue and playing this game.  My friend, who went out of her way to try my hobby, even if she maybe wasn&amp;#39;t interested in the whole tabletop thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This guy does not address the whole table, he addresses her.  And continues to try to talk to her despite her obvious discomfort.  Despite me trying to intercept his attempts at conversation from across the table when I have five million things and several first-time players to manage.  DO NOT DO THIS!  Do NOT fucking do this!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Networking and making friends is fine.  That&amp;#39;s what game shops are for -- meeting new people in your hobby.  But I didn&amp;#39;t walk up to your game, single out the least comfortable member of your party, and proceeed to attempt conversation with them while they are trying to play.  So, kindly don&amp;#39;t fucking do this to my table.  Also, DON&amp;#39;T SINGLE PEOPLE OUT.  You wanna make some new friends?  Talk to the whole group (preferably when we&amp;#39;re DONE playing).  When you pop a squat next to one of my female friends and keep trying to rope them into a conversation they clearly don&amp;#39;t want to have, it is blatantly obvious what you&amp;#39;re trying to do.  And it is blatantly obvious that we all want you to STOP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never had to deal with this.  Maybe I should&amp;#39;ve told him to go away, but that didn&amp;#39;t seem in the spirit of the shop.  At one point, I asked him to stop talking because we were trying to get through combat.  He did...for a second.  I gave another warning, and eventually, he wandered away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He may have just ensured that my friends never want to come to this game shop again.  Perhaps any chance I had of getting them into the hobby has been shattered because their first experience is now associated with a dude creeping on my most vulnerable friend.  So, thanks for that, stranger.  Thanks for violating several unspoken rules to have an awkward attempt at conversation with a girl.  Good fucking job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would hope that the gaming community can be inclusive for everybody.  Anyone should be able to walk into a store and feel at home.  Feel like they have people to support them.  And yes, that does mean talking to new people.  But not when we&amp;#39;re engaged in a game.  Not to a single person amongst a group of six.  That&amp;#39;s offputting.  And it may not be intentional, but it&amp;#39;s predatory.  We all know exactly why he singled out my female friend, rather than engaging all of us.  Why he didn&amp;#39;t try to talk to me or the other guy in the group.  It was apparent to my female friends, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why women so often get excluded from this community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, please, please, please observe basic decency in public venues.  Don&amp;#39;t interrupt games or try to pick up girls.  We&amp;#39;re all trying to have fun, so don&amp;#39;t make anyone feel singled out or vulnerable.  This kills our culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one last point.

I've read through a lot of your activity in this thread, and I don't agree with many of your points.  I can tell you that you're spot-on about my social anxiety issues.  But I'll address your points in turn before we get to that.\n\n1.  You're demonstrating a clear lack of understanding of the situation.  But that's not on you.  You weren't there.  How could you know that I had no other place to do this that didn't require a table fee?  Am I not supposed to bring new players to a public place?  What if they're Internet strangers?  Am I to invite them into my home?  That seems unsafe.  And aren't game shops places where people can come and learn about games?  If new players should never play their first games in a game shop, then you just shut down a lot of people's opportunities to get into a hobby they might enjoy.\n\n2. Yes.  My player was giving off disengaged signals.  I know that.  And I was trying to reengage her before our interruption.  That's part of the DM learning curve -- learning how to get players into the game.  And that places it wholly in my jurisdiction.  Whether that player is having fun is between myself and the player in question.  Not random people of the street.  If a student in a classroom looks uninterested, I would not go and try to talk to them.  That would be rude to the teacher.\n\n3. We did take breaks...  Couple of bathroom and snack breaks.  So, there.\n\n**4.**\n\nAnd here we are at number four.  You've spoken a lot about social disorders in this thread.  You've made a few valid points...  People don't choose to be this way or that.  And it's rough.  I know.  I suffer from severe depression and anxiety.  I can't speak to what it's like to be on the spectrum, but it would appear that there are other people to that end.\n\nWhat I do know about is being an awkward dude.  It sucks.

I&amp;#39;ve read through a lot of your activity in this thread, and I don&amp;#39;t agree with many of your points.  I can tell you that you&amp;#39;re spot-on about my social anxiety issues.  But I&amp;#39;ll address your points in turn before we get to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re demonstrating a clear lack of understanding of the situation.  But that&amp;#39;s not on you.  You weren&amp;#39;t there.  How could you know that I had no other place to do this that didn&amp;#39;t require a table fee?  Am I not supposed to bring new players to a public place?  What if they&amp;#39;re Internet strangers?  Am I to invite them into my home?  That seems unsafe.  And aren&amp;#39;t game shops places where people can come and learn about games?  If new players should never play their first games in a game shop, then you just shut down a lot of people&amp;#39;s opportunities to get into a hobby they might enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes.  My player was giving off disengaged signals.  I know that.  And I was trying to reengage her before our interruption.  That&amp;#39;s part of the DM learning curve -- learning how to get players into the game.  And that places it wholly in my jurisdiction.  Whether that player is having fun is between myself and the player in question.  Not random people of the street.  If a student in a classroom looks uninterested, I would not go and try to talk to them.  That would be rude to the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did take breaks...  Couple of bathroom and snack breaks.  So, there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here we are at number four.  You&amp;#39;ve spoken a lot about social disorders in this thread.  You&amp;#39;ve made a few valid points...  People don&amp;#39;t choose to be this way or that.  And it&amp;#39;s rough.  I know.
