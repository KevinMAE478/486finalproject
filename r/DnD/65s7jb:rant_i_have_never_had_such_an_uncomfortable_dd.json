My character was a 15 year old Aasimar and, when it was noticed how young and exotic she was, she was offered hundreds of thousands of gold pieces in exchange for sleeping with a patron. I believed my character would say no, so I refused. However, none of the players took anything I said seriously despite me saying clearly no and justifying my decision a few times. I was being told to do it regardless of how much it would hurt/ disgrace the character by one very vocal guy and even the DM was listing the different items we could all benefit from if I accepted it. No one seemed to be acting in character and I found it really difficult to separate myself from the situation, especially whilst I was being addressed using &amp;#39;you&amp;#39; by the brothel owner and other players used my name because they&amp;#39;d forgotten my character&amp;#39;s. It felt far too personal. I am rather sensitive when it comes to sexual exploitation and confrontations like this but decided to humour it because it was just a one shot, I didn&amp;#39;t want to ruin everyone else&amp;#39;s time by stopping them from being able to buy cool stuff and I was trying really hard not to seem emotional about it in a group full of guys. After about 20 long minutes of discussing it, I even had to say yes lots of times to get them to move on. I was so uncomfortable and wanting it to just be over. I thought I would just be told &amp;#39;you sleep with the guy then he gives you the gold&amp;#39;, but instead the DM goes into detail about how revolting the patron was and went so far as to give my character chlamydia and have her spirit guide abandon her. Now, sleazy people and harsh consequences exist and I appreciate that the DM wanted to be realistic but this felt especially brutal to me. Couldn&amp;#39;t I have been spared that? What did it really add besides making me feel embarrassed and disgraceful for not having the confidence to stick to my guns and for putting my character in such an awful situation? I wanted her to be a young aasimar so that she would seem more badass but instead it was used as something to fetishize and as an excuse to turn her into an expensive sexual object. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now with that gold, I managed to buy the group some cool gear. Including a nine lives stealer for myself. As awful as that whole encounter made me feel, at least I had an awesome fuckin&amp;#39; sword. Only, that fun was ruined for me once that vocal guy decided to nag me repeatedly to give it to someone else during the fight because they were rolling 20&amp;#39;s and I was having to focus on healing spells for the good of the team. I was adamant I would keep a hold of it and when I eventually got a bit snappy, was told to &amp;#39;chill&amp;#39;. No one else backed me up. I felt very unappreciated as a player since my role in the game seemed to be to whore my character out, buy everyone cool equipment and fuck off to let the big boys have their fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was forced into a situation where my character, a naive 15 year old, had no one advocating to keep her safe, where I was personally uncomfortable and was being peer pressured by the majority of the group, and where after putting myself through something I didn&amp;#39;t really want to do and my character definitely would not have done for the sake of other people&amp;#39;s enjoyment, I&amp;#39;m told to give up the one cool thing I managed to get from all of that.

The fact that the DM either didn&amp;#39;t notice or didn&amp;#39;t care that you were not okay with that and kept going, didn&amp;#39;t shut down the player badgering you, and then described the encounter, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and then punished your character&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for you going through with it reluctantly is another major red flag. That was legitimately sickening to read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another player telling you how to spend your gold isn&amp;#39;t really out of the ordinary, but if you say something about it or don&amp;#39;t seem interested anyone sensible will drop it and let you do what you want with your money. Trying to get a player to give up their equipment is a major red flag though. &lt;em&gt;You do not screw with someone else&amp;#39;s character sheet.&lt;/em&gt; The fact that no one else at the table realized that this was a problem or backed you up when you snapped at them is another red flag. Your character is your character and people trying to play them for you or tell you how to make &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; play experience better is not part of what DnD should be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are 100% not overreacting here. This party has demonstrated a complete lack of care for your character, the DM has shown that they have zero interest in making sure you have a comfortable play experience, your party has shown that they have zero interest in letting you play the game how you want to play it, and everyone at your table has shown they don&amp;#39;t respect you and what you want to do.
