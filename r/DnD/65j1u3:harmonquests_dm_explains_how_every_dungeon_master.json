And the Dungeon Master needs to be ready to pick up the slack if there is confusion or argument over the rules, to KEEP THE GAME MOVING.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is terrible advice for new DMs especially (the type most likely to be looking at this kind of thing), but for all DMs in general. There&amp;#39;s nothing immersion breaking if you look up a rule here and there, so long as you make sure to do it quickly instead of letting debate foster for 10 minutes before deciding you don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His argument for ignoring rules also rests on the idea that you have to know them first, which is not true in my opinion. When you can run your game fine on a basic level, and you don&amp;#39;t know a rule, a homeruling or an ignored rule can work out just fine and you can still correct after a session (as many DMs do) for future cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further arguments like a Lack of Preparation being bad are also categorically incorrect, because it&amp;#39;s way way way too personal per each DM. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially, however, my being opposed to the general message of this article lies in the words he uses repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;KEEP THE GAME MOVING.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, you don&amp;#39;t want to be stuck on something for twenty minutes, everyone understands that. It&amp;#39;s never a question of whether a DM WANTS to be talking about whether you had advantage or not; nobody wants that. But the way he underlines this argument, and constantly repeats it, and the reasons given in this article, are just generally not useful, helpful, or even true for many DMs at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s got a particular way of being a DM, one that is very intense it seems, and that seems to work fine. That&amp;#39;s great. But it&amp;#39;s not a style that needs to be enforced on other DMs as he seems to suggest, and the general tone of the article is unnecessarily belligerent as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DnD", "name": "t1_dgb29er", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492313609.0, "created_utc": 1492284809.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb0v94", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thrownawayzs", "parent_id": "t1_dgawjlj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DnD", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The whole article is to help gm's work on problem areas that HE'S aware of and he thinks might be common problems and offers a solution to them.  \n\nHe says learn the rules and know when to ignore them.
