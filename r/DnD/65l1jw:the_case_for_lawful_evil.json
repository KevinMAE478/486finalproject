However, if there is unrest they might kill someone to maintain order through fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Type 2 - The honorable bad guy, or as some know it the noble demon. If you are unarmed he might give you a weapon because it is dishonorable to kill an unarmed opponent. If he gives you his word he will keep it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Type 3 - Evil and determined to do what they say they will do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Type 4 - Evil and the law is just an extension of it.

Evil characters are SMART...betraying your allies fucks you over pretty quickly in retrospect, and you are better with them than without them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are exceptionally greedy, nobody is realistically going to offer you as much money as you will make with your allies... plus odds are you care about them to an extent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Power hungry - you will have more power with a group of people around you than without them plus they will protect you and them being good makes you less suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadistic - traveling with them means you will always find play toys and you are a lot less likely to get in trouble for killing a criminal that &amp;quot;left you no choice&amp;quot; than anyone else you would get paid to kill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons evil characters would work with good characters... it serves their interests....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lawful evil is great with the long term and allies are pretty good for the long term benefits. This is the same reason why a lot of LE rulers in D&amp;amp;D are actually pretty charitable... the people serve you pretty willingly on their own that way and its less work. Why do you run shelters and soup kitchens, because starving or dead homeless people do nothing to help you. They are at least able to be used for labor this way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want a good show to watch even though it was aimed at kids Gargoyles does an AMAZING job with creating a lawful evil character....
