With everyone combined, I ended up receiving more than &lt;strong&gt;8,000 votes!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, since I received a ton of data, I figured I would share it all with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREFACE/EXPLANATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The votes actually turned out a LOT closer than I thought they would be. In fact, even after 8000 votes, the top 3 classes were within .2% of each other. Every time I checked the top 3, they would be in a different order, or within 5 votes of each other, and the same went for many other classes. I can not in good conscious say that if I held the same vote again, the results would be the same every time. As such, rather than listing them by num in a numbered order, I&amp;#39;m going to assign them tiers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is how the tier system will work. In a &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; scenario, in which the popularity of all classes are equal, every class would have 7.14% of the vote. As such, I set this as the &amp;quot;average grade.&amp;quot; The tier list is set up in equal ranges to effectively give each class a popularity grade. Here is the grading chart below, rounded for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Tier&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Percentage Range&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;11.43-14.29&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;8.57-11.43&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;5.72-8.57&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2.86-5.72&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;0-2.86&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to make this clear, &lt;strong&gt;this tier system is in no way a reflection of the overall quality, viability, or level of enjoyment of each class.
