They said yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last week, they fought an Awakened tree in the middle of a town and burned it to death. This week, they are in a forest &amp;quot;not unlike the one they were just in&amp;quot; the forest opens up to a beautiful scene of an orange and purple sky, and you realize it is twilight. A jet black horse is grazing on a hill far to the left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They start to ask questions, &amp;quot;OK, what about the town last week?
