The shutdown at Berkley was a full two and a half weeks before the pedophilia controversy came out. Their protest was against his right-wing views, as many of them made clear through signs and brief interviews. Not because of pedophilia. Their protest was definitely an extremist one.\nBut if we go off another example of oppression of free speech, we can go to DePaul that used threat of police action to prevent Ben Shapiro (a conservative with nowhere close to extreme views) from speaking at their university. Given, this is a private college, so they are within their rights to do so, but it another example of shutting down prominent right-wing speakers.  \n\nI apologize, my pedophile comment wasn't directed toward Milo (though I can see how that would be unclear), it was merely an example of socially acceptable intolerance.  \nWhy do you believe protesters were against Milo from speaking?  Do you believe any aggression against free speech to be fascism?  I personally do not.\nAn example, what is your opinion of the democrats assaulted at Trump rallies?  Would you consider that to be fascism?  I personally wouldn't.  There's no organized plan for violence, unless you consider Trump to be advocating violence (which I also do not).  \nIt isn't fascist to protest an individual, even when that individual is attempting to practice free speech.  They aren't protesting free speech, they are protesting the *perceived intolerance* (as you put it) of the individual.  I believe resorting to violence would only be fascist if organized/planned.  *An example:* protesting outside of a planned parenthood isn't fascism, a group organizing to bomb a planned parenthood *is* fascism.  It's all about organized extremes.  \n  \n&gt;This is an issue. If a protest physically threatens anyone it's against, and said protest is against general viewpoints (like anti-right/left,) not necessarily a policy or law, then it becomes fascism because you are violently shutting down the counter. Unless the group as a whole condemns the action of the few, at the very least it becomes complacent with fascist behavior and will inevitably lead to fascist behavior if not dealt with as people become more extreme in a community that accepts and will eventually encourage it.   \n\nWith this example, would you consider Donald Trump complacent to fascist behavior since he never condemned the violence at his rallies?  He actually praised the violence after the campaign.  I do not consider this to be fascism, but this seems to fit your definition above, correct?   If Donald Trump is not complacent to fascism, how can we adjust your definition to agree with assessment?\n\n&gt;The punishment of communists in WWII era Europe, particularly in places like Germany is an example. There is no modern equivalent in the US that I know of. As for \"anti-hate-speech laws\" I was speaking generally and should have specified that. This was especially a common sentiment at UPitt (where I attended, myself) during some of the protests of Milo's event as well as Trump's rallies. So while this is anecdotal, I'm certain you've seen these argued at some point. The only common factor being that they are never right-leaning.   \n\nI'll ignore most of this since it is anecdotal.  I will say, in regards to Germany's laws against Nazi's, there is no *perceived intolerance* when it comes to anyone who waves a Nazi flag or aligns with the Nazi Party, there is very clear intolerance.  As we've established, intolerance of intolerance is not fascism, so intolerance of Nazis can not be fascist.   \n  \n&gt;Again, I lacked specification. The democratic base has a good mix of anti-gun activists and heavy-regulation activists. The politicians almost always take the heavy-regulation route for less scrutiny. I'm mobile so I can't provide sources now. If you want them I'll try to get them later.  \n\nAgain, I won't comment much on the anecdotal.  I've never heard of a federal politician advocating for the removal of the second amendment.  I will say, it is not extreme to take a hard stance on gun control if you can provide clear evidence it would result in lives being saved.  Gun control isn't fascist, disarming Americans for the purpose of strengthening the government *is* fascist.  You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you tried to argue Democrats are engaged in this conspiracy.  \n\n&gt;I don't think, and hope I didn't imply, that large government is naturally fascist. But fascist dictatorships have naturally gravitated towards large government due to (in a similar vein of communism,) need of citizen regulation in life and mind.    \n\nI agree.  I'm glad that's cleared up.\n\n&gt;I've seen intolerance of perceived intolerance. That's the distinction. If the right-wing platform was \"kill the gays and enslave blacks\" that would be one thing. But I've seen a whole lot of making the right's view out to be inherently wrong/inherently intolerant, which is just dishonest argument. But when you make out the opposition to be all proponents of an orange hitler, it makes fascist behavior seem like just doing the right thing, which is precisely how fascism becomes a mainstream thing.   \n\nAt what point is it acceptable to be intolerant of *perceived intolerance* (if ever)?  I believe a rational human can interpret Donald Trump's rhetoric and actions towards Muslims as intolerant.  It may not be, though at this point, I wouldn't blame someone for believing it surpasses *perceived intolerance* and enters into the realm of intolerance.  Would you?  \nThe differences of perspective is compelling.  Many Democrats feel that the *perceived intolerance* has crossed a line and needs to be attacked, or else Republicans will enter into the realm of fascism.  Many Republicans feel that the *perceived intolerance* has not yet crossed that line, and the very attack on their *perceived intolerance* IS fascism.  \nHow do we solve this?  The easiest way (to me) is to no longer engage in *perceived intolerance.*  Would you agree?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Going off the Milo bit.

I believe resorting to violence would only be fascist if organized/planned.  &lt;em&gt;An example:&lt;/em&gt; protesting outside of a planned parenthood isn&amp;#39;t fascism, a group organizing to bomb a planned parenthood &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; fascism.  It&amp;#39;s all about organized extremes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an issue. If a protest physically threatens anyone it&amp;#39;s against, and said protest is against general viewpoints (like anti-right/left,) not necessarily a policy or law, then it becomes fascism because you are violently shutting down the counter. Unless the group as a whole condemns the action of the few, at the very least it becomes complacent with fascist behavior and will inevitably lead to fascist behavior if not dealt with as people become more extreme in a community that accepts and will eventually encourage it.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this example, would you consider Donald Trump complacent to fascist behavior since he never condemned the violence at his rallies?  He actually praised the violence after the campaign.  I do not consider this to be fascism, but this seems to fit your definition above, correct?   If Donald Trump is not complacent to fascism, how can we adjust your definition to agree with assessment?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The punishment of communists in WWII era Europe, particularly in places like Germany is an example. There is no modern equivalent in the US that I know of. As for &amp;quot;anti-hate-speech laws&amp;quot; I was speaking generally and should have specified that. This was especially a common sentiment at UPitt (where I attended, myself) during some of the protests of Milo&amp;#39;s event as well as Trump&amp;#39;s rallies. So while this is anecdotal, I&amp;#39;m certain you&amp;#39;ve seen these argued at some point. The only common factor being that they are never right-leaning.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll ignore most of this since it is anecdotal.  I will say, in regards to Germany&amp;#39;s laws against Nazi&amp;#39;s, there is no &lt;em&gt;perceived intolerance&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to anyone who waves a Nazi flag or aligns with the Nazi Party, there is very clear intolerance.  As we&amp;#39;ve established, intolerance of intolerance is not fascism, so intolerance of Nazis can not be fascist.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I lacked specification. The democratic base has a good mix of anti-gun activists and heavy-regulation activists. The politicians almost always take the heavy-regulation route for less scrutiny. I&amp;#39;m mobile so I can&amp;#39;t provide sources now. If you want them I&amp;#39;ll try to get them later.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I won&amp;#39;t comment much on the anecdotal.  I&amp;#39;ve never heard of a federal politician advocating for the removal of the second amendment.  I will say, it is not extreme to take a hard stance on gun control if you can provide clear evidence it would result in lives being saved.  Gun control isn&amp;#39;t fascist, disarming Americans for the purpose of strengthening the government &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; fascist.  You&amp;#39;d be doing yourself a disservice if you tried to argue Democrats are engaged in this conspiracy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think, and hope I didn&amp;#39;t imply, that large government is naturally fascist. But fascist dictatorships have naturally gravitated towards large government due to (in a similar vein of communism,) need of citizen regulation in life and mind.    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree.  I&amp;#39;m glad that&amp;#39;s cleared up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen intolerance of perceived intolerance. That&amp;#39;s the distinction. If the right-wing platform was &amp;quot;kill the gays and enslave blacks&amp;quot; that would be one thing. But I&amp;#39;ve seen a whole lot of making the right&amp;#39;s view out to be inherently wrong/inherently intolerant, which is just dishonest argument. But when you make out the opposition to be all proponents of an orange hitler, it makes fascist behavior seem like just doing the right thing, which is precisely how fascism becomes a mainstream thing.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At what point is it acceptable to be intolerant of &lt;em&gt;perceived intolerance&lt;/em&gt; (if ever)?  I believe a rational human can interpret Donald Trump&amp;#39;s rhetoric and actions towards Muslims as intolerant.  It may not be, though at this point, I wouldn&amp;#39;t blame someone for believing it surpasses &lt;em&gt;perceived intolerance&lt;/em&gt; and enters into the realm of intolerance.  Would you?&lt;br/&gt;\nThe differences of perspective is compelling.  Many Democrats feel that the &lt;em&gt;perceived intolerance&lt;/em&gt; has crossed a line and needs to be attacked, or else Republicans will enter into the realm of fascism.  Many Republicans feel that the &lt;em&gt;perceived intolerance&lt;/em&gt; has not yet crossed that line, and the very attack on their &lt;em&gt;perceived intolerance&lt;/em&gt; IS fascism.&lt;br/&gt;\nHow do we solve this?
