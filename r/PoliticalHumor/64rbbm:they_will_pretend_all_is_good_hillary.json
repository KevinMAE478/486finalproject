Afterward, according to the book, she spent the night locked in a bedroom, crying; in the morning, Trump asked her, \u201cwith menacing casualness, \u2018Does it hurt?\u2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PoliticalHumor", "name": "t1_dg51x08", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491979280.0, "created_utc": 1491950480.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm21", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rbbm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm21", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rbbm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm21", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rbbm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm21", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rbbm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm21", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rbbm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6p5lh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "VegaThePunisher", "parent_id": "t1_dg6os1h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PoliticalHumor", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What goalpost?\n\nDo you know what that even means?\n\nAnd don't slip into cult-mode. \n\nOnly cult members suck his dick that hard. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What goalpost?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you know what that even means?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t slip into cult-mode. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only cult members suck his dick that hard. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PoliticalHumor", "name": "t1_dg6p5lh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492065894.0, "created_utc": 1492037094.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm21", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rbbm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6qnea", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bagelmanman8", "parent_id": "t1_dg6os1h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PoliticalHumor", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is what happens when you confuse a shariablue shill and ask questions not covered by their script  :D\n\nFun watching them squirm though.
