They had trade agreements in place, we had protected local brands such as Cornish pasties and Melton Mowbray pork pies, they have cleaner beaches, the is a peace agreement in Northern Ireland, there is freedom to travel, work, and live throughout the EU, and they had a voice and influence in ongoing and future EU policies.\n\nThe EU works by bringing countries together, and making them stronger through shared agreements on a level playing field, it makes sure that progressive action can be taken without countries being unfairly impacted, and it works for the benefit of the people (as opposed to the benefit of corporations).\n\nSee the funding that the EU provided to deprived areas, parts of the UK received a lot of money from the EU to improve their infrastructure and quality of life.  People say that the UK could fund this itself if it didn't pay into the EU, but of course the reality is different.  Many areas in the UK were immediately concerned and petitioned the UK government (mostly without success) to receive guarantees that they would still receive funding from the UK to replace the funding they received from the EU.  Many of these places were also the places that voted strongly for Brexit - voters who were not even aware of the benefit that the EU brought to them.\n\nOne of the key failings is that the EU doesn't \"advertise\" itself - most actions, particularly beneficial ones are done quietly and not highlighted by the press etc.  This should certainly change - if nothing else, Brexit should be a lesson that the benefits of the EU are not made visible enough.\n\nExamples of the EU being more for the people than for the benefits of corporations:  \n- [Antitrust suit against Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Corp_v_Commission)  \n- [EU forces Apple to inform consumers of their existing rights](http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/mac/eu-law-forces-apple-highlight-two-year-warranty-3348755/)  \n- [EU's policy of right to be forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten)  \n- [Net neutrality in the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/open-internet-net-neutrality)  \n- [EU forces an end to cellphone roaming charges within the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/news/agreement-end-roaming-charges-june-2017_en)\n\nSorry they are mostly IT related examples (as these are ones that are also well known - there are others) - see [here](http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/overview_en.html) for more detail of antitrust in the EU, which it does take very seriously.\n\nThe EU creates opportunity for its citizens through openness.  Free movement, tax-free trading, minimising inter-nation conflict, single currency, etc.\n\nOkay, on to the second part...if it's so great, why did people want to leave?\n\nWell the key to that is misinformation - as I said above, people are not even informed of the benefits of the EU, so they are already missing half of the story...the other half is mostly half-truths or even outright lies.\n\nAn excellent place to start to see examples of this are on the excellent [Euromyths page](http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/euromyths-a-z-index/).  Take a look, really, I mean it - go now!\n\nVarious right wing media continue to peddle their stories, distorting the facts, and other people take it to be the whole truth.  Sure, there are some facets of the EU that aren't great - it's not perfect, see the [Traveling Circus](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/10565686/The-farce-of-the-EU-travelling-circus.html) story for an example ([this is why](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-European-parliament-move-from-Brussels-to-Strasbourg-once-a-month)), but people see the few \"real\" stories as validation for all the \"less than real\" stories.\n\nI trust your Googling abilities, but here are some links to summaries of \"Brexit lies\":  \n- http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-nhs-350m-a-week-eu-change-britain-gisela-stuart-referendum-bus-a7236706.html  \n-  http://brexitlies.com/  \n- http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ipso-rulings-media-eu_uk_58d27bbfe4b0f838c62e298b?ir=UK+Politics&amp;utm_hp_ref=uk-politics  \n- https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/brexit-cps-considers-complaint-that-leave-campaigns-misled-voters\n- http://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/vote-leave-director-admits-won-lied-public/08/02/  \n\nThis is on top of years of \"anti-immigration\" news from the right-wing tabloid press.  Many people have been led to believe that most issues in the UK are caused by immigration and immigrants (as opposed to underfunding in key areas by the government - but that's another story!).  The Brexit campaign was all too willing to use this as leaverage in stirring up support.  Many other people saw the vote as an opportunity to give a slap in the face to the existing British government, some of those voters firmly believing that Brexit wouldn't be a reality (given that the referendum was non-binding, and most pre-referrendum polls returned a majority in the remain camp).\n\nOn top of this, the support for Brexit came mostly from the older generations, and they turned out to vote in much higher numbers than the younger population who felt more connected to Europe.  It's sad that the young people who voted have had their future crippled due to the young people who didn't find the time to mark their box on the ballot slip.  In general it was the [elderly and less-educated](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/how-britain-voted/) that voted for Brexit.\n\nPhew - okay, I'm missing so much stuff, but I've vomited enough words on this for now.

Sure, there are some facets of the EU that aren&amp;#39;t great - it&amp;#39;s not perfect, see the &lt;a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/10565686/The-farce-of-the-EU-travelling-circus.html\"&gt;Traveling Circus&lt;/a&gt; story for an example (&lt;a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-European-parliament-move-from-Brussels-to-Strasbourg-once-a-month\"&gt;this is why&lt;/a&gt;), but people see the few &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; stories as validation for all the &amp;quot;less than real&amp;quot; stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I trust your Googling abilities, but here are some links to summaries of &amp;quot;Brexit lies&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;\n- &lt;a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-nhs-350m-a-week-eu-change-britain-gisela-stuart-referendum-bus-a7236706.html\"&gt;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-nhs-350m-a-week-eu-change-britain-gisela-stuart-referendum-bus-a7236706.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n-  &lt;a href=\"http://brexitlies.com/\"&gt;http://brexitlies.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n- &lt;a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ipso-rulings-media-eu_uk_58d27bbfe4b0f838c62e298b?ir=UK+Politics&amp;amp;utm_hp_ref=uk-politics\"&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ipso-rulings-media-eu_uk_58d27bbfe4b0f838c62e298b?ir=UK+Politics&amp;amp;utm_hp_ref=uk-politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n- &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/brexit-cps-considers-complaint-that-leave-campaigns-misled-voters\"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/brexit-cps-considers-complaint-that-leave-campaigns-misled-voters&lt;/a&gt;\n- &lt;a href=\"http://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/vote-leave-director-admits-won-lied-public/08/02/\"&gt;http://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/vote-leave-director-admits-won-lied-public/08/02/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is on top of years of &amp;quot;anti-immigration&amp;quot; news from the right-wing tabloid press.  Many people have been led to believe that most issues in the UK are caused by immigration and immigrants (as opposed to underfunding in key areas by the government - but that&amp;#39;s another story!).  The Brexit campaign was all too willing to use this as leaverage in stirring up support.  Many other people saw the vote as an opportunity to give a slap in the face to the existing British government, some of those voters firmly believing that Brexit wouldn&amp;#39;t be a reality (given that the referendum was non-binding, and most pre-referrendum polls returned a majority in the remain camp).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of this, the support for Brexit came mostly from the older generations, and they turned out to vote in much higher numbers than the younger population who felt more connected to Europe.  It&amp;#39;s sad that the young people who voted have had their future crippled due to the young people who didn&amp;#39;t find the time to mark their box on the ballot slip.  In general it was the &lt;a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/how-britain-voted/\"&gt;elderly and less-educated&lt;/a&gt; that voted for Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phew - okay, I&amp;#39;m missing so much stuff, but I&amp;#39;ve vomited enough words on this for now.  I hope it gives a flavour of my full feelings, although I will never be able to write it all in one little reddit post.  :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "casualiama", "name": "t1_dg8xllt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492187836.0, "created_utc": 1492159036.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8urr8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t3_656gav", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/casualiama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "casualiama", "name": "t1_dg8urr8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492179907.0, "created_utc": 1492151107.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sxwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656gav", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sxwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656gav", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sxwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656gav", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9teim", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dragredder", "parent_id": "t1_dg90uwo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/casualiama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And racism's defenders from what I've heard.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And racism&amp;#39;s defenders from what I&amp;#39;ve heard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "casualiama", "name": "t1_dg9teim", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492235679.0, "created_utc": 1492206879.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg90uwo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BelgianPete", "parent_id": "t1_dg8yhlb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/casualiama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Brexit has given voice to racism](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/brexit-racism-eu-referendum-racist-incidents-politicians-media).\n\nThere're a lot of bad things coming out of Brexit, but I'd say that is the worst.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/brexit-racism-eu-referendum-racist-incidents-politicians-media\"&gt;Brexit has given voice to racism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;re a lot of bad things coming out of Brexit, but I&amp;#39;d say that is the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "casualiama", "name": "t1_dg90uwo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492198069.0, "created_utc": 1492169269.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8yhlb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dragredder", "parent_id": "t3_656gav", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/casualiama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What do you think is the worst thing to come of Brexit?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think is the worst thing to come of Brexit?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "casualiama", "name": "t1_dg8yhlb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492190741.0, "created_utc": 1492161941.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
