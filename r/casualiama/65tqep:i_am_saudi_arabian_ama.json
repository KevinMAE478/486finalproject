I went to a mixed gender school, and went out to school parties and parties at friend's houses all the time. The girls here don't always dress modestly either, hahah.\n4. They tend to be, yes.

I'm not sure how it is in other places, as Jeddah is the least conservative city in Saudi. I would imagine that in the capital, Riyadh, you also have to cover your hair. \n6. It is important here to note that Saudi Arabia does not have (as far as I am aware) a tourist visa. You can't just come here for a holiday. You can come visit for Islamic pilgrimage, but that's as far as it goes. Many women are invited here for business purposes, for example as representatives of their own companies, and do not require a male companion. Again, I would like to point, my perspective of how things are done here are mainly based on my experiences in Jeddah.

I do what I am supposed to do (I pray 5 times a day, I fast Ramadan etc.), but I don&amp;#39;t really do much more than that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was thankfully raised in a very open minded community and my family is quite &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; as well. I view western women the same way any normal person would, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I had a lot of female friends growing up, so I never really needed to &amp;quot;control myself&amp;quot; per se. I went to a mixed gender school, and went out to school parties and parties at friend&amp;#39;s houses all the time. The girls here don&amp;#39;t always dress modestly either, hahah.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They tend to be, yes. But some things aren&amp;#39;t overlooked. If you&amp;#39;re a tourist or a foreign worker and you&amp;#39;re found making and selling alcohol from your own home, for example, you will not be treated kindly by the law.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This depends a lot on the city. In Jeddah (the city I am in), a simple gown called an &lt;a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f3/74/b6/f374b6ef62cc598f8db9bce5068714f4.jpg\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;abaya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over whatever they&amp;#39;re wearing is enough. I&amp;#39;m not sure how it is in other places, as Jeddah is the least conservative city in Saudi. I would imagine that in the capital, Riyadh, you also have to cover your hair. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It is important here to note that Saudi Arabia does not have (as far as I am aware) a tourist visa. You can&amp;#39;t just come here for a holiday. You can come visit for Islamic pilgrimage, but that&amp;#39;s as far as it goes. Many women are invited here for business purposes, for example as representatives of their own companies, and do not require a male companion. Again, I would like to point, my perspective of how things are done here are mainly based on my experiences in Jeddah. Cities in Saudi Arabia are very different.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not at all, this is why I&amp;#39;m doing this AMA, it&amp;#39;s for people to be able to comfortably ask questions and learn more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "casualiama", "name": "t1_dge4pmm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492492288.0, "created_utc": 1492463488.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdj05m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mjau-mjau", "parent_id": "t3_65tqep", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/casualiama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "1.
