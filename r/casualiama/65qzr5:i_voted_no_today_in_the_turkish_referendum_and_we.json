Considering heads of state also get the utmost medical care. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Turkish Turks think very ill of the Erdo\u011fan Turks living outside. Especially nowadays, because, WTF, Netherlands returned a 70% YES vote. Everybody on the internet and on the street, half-jokingly, suggest a population exchange with the Erdo-Turks in Europe/US/Canada/AUS/NZ and the secular Turks living here, saying &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think the countries in question would even object to that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, one common sentiment/resentment to Erdo-Turks is how they vote for the Leftist/Progressive/Immigrant-Friendly parties where they live to get the state benefits, etc. but vote for the Right-wing parties in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One last joking matter is how they are deliberately sending the country to hell because as matters get worse in Turkey, the economy turns to shit and the Turkish Lira rapidly deteriorates against Euro, USD, etc. And because their salaries are in foreign currency, they get even richer in Turkish standards and can show off and treat themselves when they come to Turkey for the holidays, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, here is the trend for &lt;a href=\"http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=EUR&amp;amp;to=TRY&amp;amp;view=1Y\"&gt;EUR/TRY&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&amp;amp;to=TRY&amp;amp;view=1Y\"&gt;USD/TRY&lt;/a&gt; for the last year, see for yourself how much the Turkish Lira lost against the others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "casualiama", "name": "t1_dgdbga0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492451144.0, "created_utc": 1492422344.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcwuf6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DashneDK2", "parent_id": "t3_65qzr5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/casualiama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Erdogan is 63yo.
