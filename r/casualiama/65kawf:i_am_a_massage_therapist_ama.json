Your answers are your answers, and it's your life so you don't even need to justify anything to anybody. \n\nThat said...I read your answers pretty carefully...respectfully, I'm going to point out some things I find...not sure the word here but...inconsistent?\n\n\n&gt;I also can't get excited about the \"servicing\" aspect of it if it's not just roleplaying with a partner. I imagine I personally would feel pretty used or demeaned\n\nSo many people do so many jobs they aren't excited about or find demeaning. And for so much less money than 100-200k. \n\nYou also mentioned it would affect intimacy with your partner...that makes sense. But looking at it from another angle...you're essentially saying that unfettered intimacy with your partner is worth the difference between 100k-200k/ year and whatever it is you currently make. When I think of all the ways that work-related stress affects people's intimacy, it just seems like a trade-off that someone could work around, especially for that amount of money. \n\n&gt;is because it's a form of sex trafficking disguised as a business, which is both horrendous and inhumane, and also insulting to the reputation of legitimate massage businesses that has grown so positive over the past decade.\n\nYou have a point here...and let's assume you're totally correct about asian massage happy ending places being sex trafficing. (there's a lot of evidence they *arent* but let's ignore that for now)...What does an unskilled immigrant sex trafficked woman have to do with your therapy practice, given your licensing and certification. You would not be working against your will. And customers are savvy. No reasonable person looks down on you as a skilled professional just because an Asian woman across town is giving hand jobs. \n\n&gt;and having massage boiled down to sexual gratification feels really bad when it's something you care about so much that helps so many people\n\nSure...but what if you *weren't* reducing massage merely sexual gratification? What if you were delivering a skilled massage 'and' a happy ending? What if you incorporated it into the therapeutic and relaxation aspects of the session? That was how I meant the question. I just don't buy that a hand job ruins the therapeutic effects of various massage modalities. \n\n&gt;It's not as though I'm not okay with sex work as long as everyone involved is safe and respected, but it's a pain and an insult to have that kind of thing attached to my line of work.\n\nI don't think it's attached per se. Sure, some clients may inquire hoping you will do it, but the vast majority of clients understand that's not something you will do and they don't go in expecting that. \n\n&gt;I dont wanna go to jail or be taken advantage of\n\nFair point. Going to jail seems exceptionally unlikely with a modicum of discretion. And getting taken advantage of...my sense from how many massage schools there are relative to how many therapists can make a living wage is that the massage training industry does plenty of taking advantage of people. \n\n&gt;and I also wouldn't have dropped hundreds of dollars on textbooks in school if I was just gonna get paid to give handies lmao I could've done that without any formal training or loans.\n\nIf you didn't have that training, you probably wouldn't be able to create a viable business offering hand jobs. By viable business I mean a respectable and regular client base. What allows a therapist to set rates at that level and have repeat customers is that they have training.

Your answers are your answers, and it&amp;#39;s your life so you don&amp;#39;t even need to justify anything to anybody. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said...I read your answers pretty carefully...respectfully, I&amp;#39;m going to point out some things I find...not sure the word here but...inconsistent?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I also can&amp;#39;t get excited about the &amp;quot;servicing&amp;quot; aspect of it if it&amp;#39;s not just roleplaying with a partner. I imagine I personally would feel pretty used or demeaned&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So many people do so many jobs they aren&amp;#39;t excited about or find demeaning. And for so much less money than 100-200k. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also mentioned it would affect intimacy with your partner...that makes sense. But looking at it from another angle...you&amp;#39;re essentially saying that unfettered intimacy with your partner is worth the difference between 100k-200k/ year and whatever it is you currently make. When I think of all the ways that work-related stress affects people&amp;#39;s intimacy, it just seems like a trade-off that someone could work around, especially for that amount of money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;is because it&amp;#39;s a form of sex trafficking disguised as a business, which is both horrendous and inhumane, and also insulting to the reputation of legitimate massage businesses that has grown so positive over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have a point here...and let&amp;#39;s assume you&amp;#39;re totally correct about asian massage happy ending places being sex trafficing. (there&amp;#39;s a lot of evidence they &lt;em&gt;arent&lt;/em&gt; but let&amp;#39;s ignore that for now)...What does an unskilled immigrant sex trafficked woman have to do with your therapy practice, given your licensing and certification. You would not be working against your will. And customers are savvy. No reasonable person looks down on you as a skilled professional just because an Asian woman across town is giving hand jobs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and having massage boiled down to sexual gratification feels really bad when it&amp;#39;s something you care about so much that helps so many people&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure...but what if you &lt;em&gt;weren&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; reducing massage merely sexual gratification? What if you were delivering a skilled massage &amp;#39;and&amp;#39; a happy ending? What if you incorporated it into the therapeutic and relaxation aspects of the session? That was how I meant the question. I just don&amp;#39;t buy that a hand job ruins the therapeutic effects of various massage modalities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not as though I&amp;#39;m not okay with sex work as long as everyone involved is safe and respected, but it&amp;#39;s a pain and an insult to have that kind of thing attached to my line of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s attached per se. Sure, some clients may inquire hoping you will do it, but the vast majority of clients understand that&amp;#39;s not something you will do and they don&amp;#39;t go in expecting that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I dont wanna go to jail or be taken advantage of&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fair point. Going to jail seems exceptionally unlikely with a modicum of discretion. And getting taken advantage of...my sense from how many massage schools there are relative to how many therapists can make a living wage is that the massage training industry does plenty of taking advantage of people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and I also wouldn&amp;#39;t have dropped hundreds of dollars on textbooks in school if I was just gonna get paid to give handies lmao I could&amp;#39;ve done that without any formal training or loans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t have that training, you probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to create a viable business offering hand jobs. By viable business I mean a respectable and regular client base. What allows a therapist to set rates at that level and have repeat customers is that they have training. Also, I don&amp;#39;t buy that getting a handy at the end of a massage removes any therapeutic or medical benefit of the session. You could theoretically have both benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question I guess is...forget the unskilled sex workers or the sex trafficked asian women...why would a skilled, trained massage therapist rather labor for 30-50k per year, working side jobs to make ends meet...instead of taking advantage of a niche that allows them to make three to fives times as much? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "casualiama", "name": "t1_dgej4x9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492510385.0, "created_utc": 1492481585.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge9ayo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "throwawaylmt245", "parent_id": "t1_dge89jq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/casualiama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So this is like... actually a pretty interesting question and I'm going to do my best to answer it as sincerely as possible.\n\nAlthough I know not everyone feels this way, even if my partner supported me (and he most likely would as long as I was safe tbh), I don't think I could do it if I were in a relationship.
