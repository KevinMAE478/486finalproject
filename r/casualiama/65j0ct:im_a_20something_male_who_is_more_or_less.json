Yes, there was one already made, but it was awful and didn't even come close to capturing the essence of the book. But I guess that kind of ties into why I hope they actually don't make another one. It's so rare when Hollywood actually does an adaptation right.

It would be so unlikely that a movie studio wouldn't butcher the message of this movie, but I feel we need that story now more than ever. That book predicted the outcome of the modern world to a tee. We keep burying our lives in cheap, meaningless entertainment to drown our sorrows instead of actually confronting the world's problems. We live our lives looking for satisfaction in trinkets and material things and then wonder why we feel so empty. Meanwhile, the ones keeping us fat and happy with cheeseburgers and over-priced clothes are ruining the world one atrocity at a time. So, making another movie adaptation out of this could go one of two ways. Hollywood could either completely ruin it by making it a cheap, generic action flick, or the right people could come together and inspire a generation to change for the better. Probably the former, unfortunately.\n\nMovie -&gt; video game: Inception \n\nYet another rarity in terms of quality, you can't exactly expect a video game adaptation of a movie to be good, but hey, it's been done before. Now think of an open-world action-adventure game of sorts in that kind of world. Jumping back and forth between worlds as a game mechanic has incredible potential. It just has to be put into the right hands. \n\nAlso, *Terminator.* I fucking love the Terminator franchise (minus movies 3 and 4). Think of a Resident Evil-style survival thriller where you're basically just trying to escape and outwit a handful of terminators. They could be killed, but it would basically be next to impossible. It could take place in either the modern world or the future.
