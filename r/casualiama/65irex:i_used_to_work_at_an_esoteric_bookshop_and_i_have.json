From wikipedia: also known as Systemic Constellations and Systemic Family Constellations, it&amp;#39;s an alternative therapeutic method which draws on elements of family systems therapy, existential phenomenology and Zulu attitudes to family. In a single session, a Family Constellation supposedly attempts to reveal a previously unrecognized systemic dynamic that spans multiple generations in a given family and to resolve the deleterious effects of that dynamic by encouraging the subject to encounter representatives of the past and accept the factual reality of the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that I believe or support this anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: he also does consultations though.
