The one and only thing I care about that makes me infinitely happy is to be with a girl and date them, marry them, and experience things together. What about college and if I meet girls there my freshman year? I'd miss out on a lot of opportunities to find someone I'd love if I were to transition I feel. I have a worry I wouldn't find the type of girl I really want so badly if I were to transition also. What if I want kids when I'm older as a male? I feel as though I have a desire to be a young woman, but I can't wrap my head around the idea of me being female when I'm older, and if I'd still like it. The desire stems from mostly clothing and makeup and the idea of having a female body. I don't really have a strong sense of dysphoria however I could live perfectly fine as a male, and I don't mean that in a sense of pretending. I'm still unsure if I'm transgender because of the post-fap guilt as it also is a fetish and desire for me to be female. I don't know what to do really in order to figure it out, and I find it easier when people ask me questions for me to answer in order to figure out my feelings.\nIdk how to figure out if I want to transition or not and it's been five months I've been talking to a gender therapist and I haven't figured out much or made any progress. I'm dating a girl right now and she knows and she's not into girls and like idk. I don't want to live inbetween but I still like being male. I work with my sibling and they're my manager and we car pool together, I don't know if they'd take it well as I've been their sibling for 18 years as how I am, and I've never indicated anything or done anything feminine. I don't have my license because I'm afraid of driving and also I guess I don't want to possibly have to change my picture and marker later. My parents know and are supportive but confused. Supportive where they just want me to be happy but they don't really understand it and the whole dynamic I would have with them would be different because of their opinions/feelings about it. I'd like to figure this out before college but idk.
