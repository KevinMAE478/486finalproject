I just don&amp;#39;t see what it adds to existing metrics of metacognition like the Stroop task I&amp;#39;ve mentioned several times.  That is to say I don&amp;#39;t think that &amp;quot;cognitive reflection&amp;quot; is a meaningful or independent research construct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, all that being said, I think there absolutely room for research that tries to understand why some students are more susceptible to &amp;quot;trick questions&amp;quot; than others.  The three questions in the CRT are right on the money when it comes to representing the sorts of trick questions math teachers tend to use.  As much as I rag on Wikipedia links, the CRT article actual cites an interesting one in this vein:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Szaszi, B., Szollosi, A., Palfi., B. &amp;amp; Aczel, B. (2017).
