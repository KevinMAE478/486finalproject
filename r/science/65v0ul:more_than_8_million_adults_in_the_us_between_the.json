Just telling the therapist that you sometimes have thoughts of hurting yourself is not enough. Most people have unwanted thoughts at some points in their life. The therapist needs to feel like you are truly a threat to yourself or others before a hold can be placed. Just expressing that you have had thoughts is not enough for them to hold you. It needs to be expressed that your thoughts are either serious enough or accompanied by some sort of action which indicates a danger. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_dgdlbpy", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492470413.0, "created_utc": 1492441613.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdkf0t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shifty_coder", "parent_id": "t1_dgdexfc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/science", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It *is* low, because it's only *reported* cases.

At least this is what people will infer from your post. The problem is that this attitude helps nobody. Accepting mental illness or the possibility of its presence in our lives is the first step to seeking help. \n\nYou also make it seem like mental health is a protected word that allows people to do bad things without having to feel guilty, which completely misses the fact that actually, mental health issues, or the behaviours it causes to be exhibited, are more often than not, a source of shame for the individual, not pride. In addition to this, mental health is still a huge taboo issue in most of the developed world, and even worse accepted in developing countries, and so the use of it to justify actions is preposterous in that sense.\n\nThe only thing you could be inferring that I might somewhat agree with is a large incidence of self-diagnosis. Of course very few of us are qualified to diagnose ourselves, but this act of introspection is only harmful if self diagnosis and acceptance is the ending state. This being said, self-diagnosis could be the first step, again, to seeking help, which more people with mental health issues should be encouraged to do. If you really do see somebody commit awful things and state that it's all due to their mental health issues, your first reaction should be to extend a helping hand, or to ask if they've considered help, as it can come in all forms.

At least this is what people will infer from your post. The problem is that this attitude helps nobody. Accepting mental illness or the possibility of its presence in our lives is the first step to seeking help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also make it seem like mental health is a protected word that allows people to do bad things without having to feel guilty, which completely misses the fact that actually, mental health issues, or the behaviours it causes to be exhibited, are more often than not, a source of shame for the individual, not pride. In addition to this, mental health is still a huge taboo issue in most of the developed world, and even worse accepted in developing countries, and so the use of it to justify actions is preposterous in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing you could be inferring that I might somewhat agree with is a large incidence of self-diagnosis. Of course very few of us are qualified to diagnose ourselves, but this act of introspection is only harmful if self diagnosis and acceptance is the ending state. This being said, self-diagnosis could be the first step, again, to seeking help, which more people with mental health issues should be encouraged to do.
