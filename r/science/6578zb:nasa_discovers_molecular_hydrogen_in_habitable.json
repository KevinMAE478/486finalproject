H. Waite et al., Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes. *Science*. **356**, 155\u2013159 (2017).](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aai8703)\n\n&gt; **Editor's Summary:** Saturn's moon Enceladus has a subsurface ocean covered by a layer of ice. Some liquid escapes into space through cracks in the ice, which is the source of one of Saturn's rings. In October 2015, the Cassini spacecraft flew directly through the plume of escaping material and sampled its chemical composition. Waite et al. found that the plume contains molecular hydrogen, H2, a sign that the water in Enceladus' ocean is reacting with rocks through hydrothermal processes (see the Perspective by Seewald). This drives the ocean out of chemical equilibrium, in a similar way to water around Earth's hydrothermal vents, potentially providing a source of chemical energy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; **Abstract:** Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of material erupts from cracks in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument\u2019s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials. The relatively high hydrogen abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of methane from CO2 in Enceladus\u2019 ocean.\n\n", "edited": 1492109721.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-missions-provide-new-insights-into-ocean-worlds-in-our-solar-system\"&gt;Here is NASA&amp;#39;s press release&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;Cassini&lt;/em&gt; findings and an &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/wG-jrJnfI3g\"&gt;accompanying explanatory video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you missed the news last week, &lt;a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-cassini-mission-prepares-for-grand-finale-at-saturn\"&gt;NASA announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Cassini&lt;/em&gt; will begin the end of its mission on April 26th.
