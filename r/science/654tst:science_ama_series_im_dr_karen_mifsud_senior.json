If, however, you start to not ever feel relaxed then you may want to get some advice on how to reduce your stress levels and there are some great charities like MIND and MQ which can be approached for this type of advice. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_dg7leo5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492121572.0, "created_utc": 1492092772.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 39}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7fcik", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 59, "report_reasons": null, "author": "etubrut", "parent_id": "t3_654tst", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/science", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Are the stress related changes to the epigenome permanent, or can they be reversed - perhaps through future medication?\n\nI'm going through my A Level right now and my stress levels are orbital.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are the stress related changes to the epigenome permanent, or can they be reversed - perhaps through future medication?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going through my A Level right now and my stress levels are orbital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_dg7fcik", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492112131.0, "created_utc": 1492083331.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 59}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654tst", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654tst", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654tst", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7m2c8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kodysatdown", "parent_id": "t1_dg7lpjy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/science", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks you very much!

I also want to know your opinion of PTSD-related stress. After all, stress is stress, right?\n\nMy family and friends have made statements as far back as I can remember growing up that I've always had a death wish. I'm still baffled by this at almost age 40. I'm not an extreme person that I know of and am always relaxed when others are freaking out. They've also said that I'm an emotional rock and never get excited about anything even when others are. I have tried to find happiness just like everyone else, but it is fleeting for me since I seem to be happiest when there's lots of stress.\n\nI grew up in a split household that seemed torturous for my older brother, but I wasn't bothered by it. He is still in therapy over an incident that happened with our father when he was 10 and I was 9. We were to live with him for 2 weeks as a trial over the summer, but we were miserable there. At the end, he asked us if we wanted to stay with him permanently. We declined. Our dad was set off breaking shit and threw us down next to his gun cabinet. He pulled out a 38, loaded it, forced it into our hands and screamed at us to pull the trigger. It was my turn after he didn't do it. I remember being upset and confused after getting beat on and now I have this gun in my hand with my dad's forehead at the end of the barrel with him screaming to put him out of his misery. I recall feeling this wave of \"emotion\" that I've only experienced a few dozen times throughout my life. I can't quite describe this emotion as so many people have their own interpretation of it and it sounds like I'm dysfunctional when I compare it to a moment of blissful clarity in which I am fully content with the situation. This \"emotion\" has been most commonly identified as stress by my brother's therapist. The end result of this situation was that I started laughing at my dad for behaving like an animal. I pulled the gun off of his forehead and put it to my own head and told him how stupid he looked. This shocked him into silence. As he stood up, I pushed the safety button back on the gun and tossed it in his chair. My stepmom witnessed this entire thing and did nothing about it, but cry. My dad told us that we were no sons of his and we didn't hear from him again until right before my brother turned 13.\n\nI went on to experience this \"emotion\" of stress a few more times during 2 automobile accidents in which I rolled my car over. Once into a median after my right rear tire blew and later by recklessly driving to blow off some steam.\n\nThis job I was working at was very hectic and required lots of time management in which I had so many people quit or had to be fired as they couldn't keep up with the work at a famous seafood buffet restaurant/night club at the beach. We had nearly 100,000 customers a day during the summer with up to 4 hours of wait time for all of these people to be fed. I was only 16 when I became the head chef of the breakfast buffet and later had much more responsibilities added. When I left the job to enter the military at age 18, I had already worked there as a buffet manager, meat carver, kitchen manager, cold chef, steam chef, fry chef, sous chef, assistant executive chef (2 months as executive chef when the head chef did 60 days in lockup for a DUI), and barkeep(until they got fined for my being underage at the time). I'd be lying if I said that I never felt that emotion during this work period, but I can't pinpoint one single experience to describe feeling like I do about it. Those are some of my fondest memories.\n\nI went into the U.S. Air Force shortly after I turned 18. I signed on to be a weapons specialist since it sounded cool. Anyway, I made it through this life change with that \"emotion\" in full force. All was right with the world as I saw person after person fail portions of the training as they couldn't deal with the stress or just weren't smart enough. Handling explosives sounds much cooler than it really is. Deployments are a different story. They way you train in peacetime is hopefully how you'll work during times of ... need, but the rules go out the window when shit goes down. I got to cross-trained as a field medic so I could be more involved with a few elite teams that I had become friends with. I found it all so fascinating. I did all that I could which was always something that nobody else wanted to do. I didn't mind it at all. Here is where I was asked if I had a death wish since I volunteered for ... stuff. I saw it like this: I want to do all that I can to prevent others from having to do it, whether that was on a gunship, search &amp; rescue, or shitter cleanup. I did it. Being a combat veteran is great, but there isn't combat all the time so as my enlistment ran out, I was ready to go. During the separation process, our group was asked for some of the reasons for getting out. Stress was stated a lot, but most people were looking for time with their families. I was just bored and looking forward to the possibility of finding something else to fill this missing feeling.\n\nI got out and headed back to my hometown. My Granny was in her early 80's and certainly, she could use the help around the house until I figure out what I'm going to do with my life. I caught up with old friends and enjoyed hearing that I hadn't missed a thing while I was away. One night shortly after I moved in, my Granny made us some whiskey sours and talked about everything. She was quite distraught with some of the things I had told her about, but she said that it will pass. The only thing that she really wanted to know was if I am ever going to settle down with a family. Granny jinxed me as I had an IT job working for Perdue and my girlfriend was 5 months pregnant just over a year after that night we had talked. I'm told that this was all to be so stressful, but it wasn't to me. I didn't feel this \"emotion\" when I got married or when my daughter was born.\n\nWe were expecting another child when I got notified that my position at work was no longer needed as they switched around personnel so I decided to go back into the military. I said this to my boss out of anger since I was making damn good money and had another child on the way. The more I thought about it, the more satisfied I became with my decision as the feeling I didn't know that I was chasing had started coming back. It only took 4 months from that day to get my orders to go back to where I had left not so long ago. I was excited to come back with my family and show them around the Army and Air Force bases at Fort Bragg and Pope AFB. Back then, Pope was an Air Combat Command (ACC) base which later turned into an Air Mobility Command (AMC) base, but is now known as Pope Field for the Army. I got sent right back to my old job of teaching, training, evaluating, and certifying weapons crews. This is a highly regarded position to be selected for and was amazed that I was able to get back into my old routine. It was fun discovering that I was able to recall how to do everything without committing any safety violations. It shows that our training really works. In order to shorten this story, I summarize the rest by saying I was injured in the line of duty, but I don't feel that I did anything more than anyone else in my job. There are details here that are commonly dwelled upon whether I'm awake or asleep. \n\nI've been a Disabled American Veteran since my forced medical retirement in 2003. I recovered enough to help my brother out repossessing cars. I became a repossession agent with my own truck working for the same company, but the pay was erratic at best. One week, I recovered more than 30 vehicles and had a huge pay day. I went more than a month without getting anything after this. \n\nWanting a more steady income, I became a Master Correctional Officer for the 3rd largest facility in the state of Maryland. I did this for 7 years before calling it quits when my old military injuries resurfaced and needed to be off my feet for recovery. I still suffer from blood clots and nerve damage from having compartment syndrome in my right leg. Before this happened, I was able to see 192 officers come and go after I was hired. Most quit without warning and many other were fired for various reasons. Exit interviews show that the stress is too much for a thankless job. I've had countless altercations in which I felt this \"emotion\", but I've never been bothered by it.\n\nAt this point, I still suffered from PTSD, but find myself secretly looking forward to episodes as I feel as if I am somebody once again.  I'm a stay at home dad with a wife that works and currently have 2 children that are ages 16 and 14. I'm depressed as I have no life, I've not found any more stress to feel fulfilled, but according to others, I'm not supposed to anyway. Is it possible that I'm addicted to stress? Is stress the right word for this \"emotion\" that I have condensed to describe and how can I get a replacement for this feeling? Thanks for reading this far. Sorry, it's so long. I look forward to your response. Have a great day.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to become addicted to stress and can the lack of it cause depression? I also want to know your opinion of PTSD-related stress. After all, stress is stress, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family and friends have made statements as far back as I can remember growing up that I&amp;#39;ve always had a death wish. I&amp;#39;m still baffled by this at almost age 40. I&amp;#39;m not an extreme person that I know of and am always relaxed when others are freaking out. They&amp;#39;ve also said that I&amp;#39;m an emotional rock and never get excited about anything even when others are. I have tried to find happiness just like everyone else, but it is fleeting for me since I seem to be happiest when there&amp;#39;s lots of stress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a split household that seemed torturous for my older brother, but I wasn&amp;#39;t bothered by it. He is still in therapy over an incident that happened with our father when he was 10 and I was 9. We were to live with him for 2 weeks as a trial over the summer, but we were miserable there. At the end, he asked us if we wanted to stay with him permanently. We declined. Our dad was set off breaking shit and threw us down next to his gun cabinet. He pulled out a 38, loaded it, forced it into our hands and screamed at us to pull the trigger. It was my turn after he didn&amp;#39;t do it. I remember being upset and confused after getting beat on and now I have this gun in my hand with my dad&amp;#39;s forehead at the end of the barrel with him screaming to put him out of his misery. I recall feeling this wave of &amp;quot;emotion&amp;quot; that I&amp;#39;ve only experienced a few dozen times throughout my life. I can&amp;#39;t quite describe this emotion as so many people have their own interpretation of it and it sounds like I&amp;#39;m dysfunctional when I compare it to a moment of blissful clarity in which I am fully content with the situation. This &amp;quot;emotion&amp;quot; has been most commonly identified as stress by my brother&amp;#39;s therapist. The end result of this situation was that I started laughing at my dad for behaving like an animal. I pulled the gun off of his forehead and put it to my own head and told him how stupid he looked. This shocked him into silence. As he stood up, I pushed the safety button back on the gun and tossed it in his chair. My stepmom witnessed this entire thing and did nothing about it, but cry. My dad told us that we were no sons of his and we didn&amp;#39;t hear from him again until right before my brother turned 13.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went on to experience this &amp;quot;emotion&amp;quot; of stress a few more times during 2 automobile accidents in which I rolled my car over. Once into a median after my right rear tire blew and later by recklessly driving to blow off some steam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This job I was working at was very hectic and required lots of time management in which I had so many people quit or had to be fired as they couldn&amp;#39;t keep up with the work at a famous seafood buffet restaurant/night club at the beach. We had nearly 100,000 customers a day during the summer with up to 4 hours of wait time for all of these people to be fed. I was only 16 when I became the head chef of the breakfast buffet and later had much more responsibilities added. When I left the job to enter the military at age 18, I had already worked there as a buffet manager, meat carver, kitchen manager, cold chef, steam chef, fry chef, sous chef, assistant executive chef (2 months as executive chef when the head chef did 60 days in lockup for a DUI), and barkeep(until they got fined for my being underage at the time).
