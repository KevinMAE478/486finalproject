Logjams form on an almost yearly basis and migrate upriver until an avulsion takes place. Logjam-induced floods are here characterized by a sudden deposition of a thick sand layer and the death of forest in a V-shaped area. The Bolivian Amazon offers a unique opportunity to further research on how large wood affects river behavior in lowland tropical settings and how large and frequent forest disturbance events resulting from river logjams affect forest biodiversity and community successions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_dg3vz7g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491915783.0, "created_utc": 1491886983.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ov9l", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ov9l", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ov9l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg47n7c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Voveve", "parent_id": "t1_dg3x8d7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/science", "controversiality": 0, "body": "can you just answer if you know, like, pls?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;can you just answer if you know, like, pls?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_dg47n7c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491944270.0, "created_utc": 1491915470.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3x8d7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "avogadros_number", "parent_id": "t1_dg3w5og", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/science", "controversiality": 1, "body": "The article discusses your question should you opt to actually take a minute and read the paragraph.
