Before getting into my question I just want to thank all three of you for your contributions towards the planet and for taking time out of your day to do this AMA. On to the question(s). \nWell, I am a junior in high school, soon to be senior, and I feel I messed up this and my previous year. I didn't challenge myself, I lost my spark for science (which I've had all my life), and I just didn't really care about school. I didn't get Fs but I did get a lot of Bs and at one point a C-. This also translated into me choosing easier classes for my junior year because I got to choose classes at the end of sophomore year. I only took 2 ap classes this year, one of which is a joke, and my science class is ridiculously easy and I have a pretty terrible teacher who kinda hates himself. Next year I am taking more APs and more challenging classes, but honestly, is it too late? Have I screwed myself over? Is it too late to become a prominent environmental scientist or ecologist? Is there a way to really show I'm up for the challenge college will present? Because I reaaaally hate seeing out planet go to waste and I want to do as much as possible to help. \n2nd question: are you vegan? If not, why? Going vegan is probably the easiest thing you can do for the planet. It reduces the amount of methane and nitrous oxide in our atmosphere and cuts down on deforestation. The dumping of animal waste is also a big contributor to the acidification of our oceans. Eating meat creates a huge demand for food which leads to eutrophication as there are more fertilizers being used to grow this massive amount of food western diets demand. Additionally, all that food used to raised 58 billion animals a year (in the US alone) could be used to aid world hunger. I'm sure you've heard a lot about this but I find myself being quite surprised about the ignorance among people and their food choices. Even among the scientific community, Neil degrasse Tyson and Bill nye, both believe in climate change and are advocates for helping our planet, are in denial (in the case of Tyson) and refuse to give up their tasty ribeyes. \n3rd question: do you ever feel despondent when you see governments (namely the US) and individuals flat out deny that global warming exists despite there being demonstrable evidence proving otherwise? If so, how do you bounce back? If not, what keeps you motivated? \n4th question: do you have any recommendations for green colleges? I'm starting to look at colleges I want to go to and I'm wondering if you know any colleges that focus around being environmentally friendly and have particularly good environmental science or ecology programs. I've looked at humboldt state in California and Colorado school of mines (although school of mines is incredibly expensive when out of state). \nThose are all my question, sorry I wrote so much. But this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I'm trying to squeeze as much out of it as possible. Thanks again, I'd be glad if you even just answer one question.
