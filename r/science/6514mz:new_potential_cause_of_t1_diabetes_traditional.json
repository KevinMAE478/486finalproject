Translational errors represent a major potential source of antigenic peptides to which central immune tolerance is lacking1, 2. Here, we describe an alternative open reading frame within human insulin mRNA encoding a highly immunogenic polypeptide that is targeted by T cells in T1D patients. We show that cytotoxic T cells directed against the N-terminal peptide of this nonconventional product are present in the circulation of individuals diagnosed with T1D, and we provide direct evidence that such CD8+ T cells are capable of killing human beta cells and thereby may be diabetogenic. This study reveals a new source of nonconventional polypeptides that act as self-epitopes in clinical autoimmune disease.\n\n***\n\n**My summary**\n\nType 1a diabetes is a disease that results from the destruction of insulin producing beta cells by the immune system. Most research to date has implicated deregulation of the immune system as the source of the disease - for instance almost all hits from genetic association and linkage studies have been in genes involving the immune system (i.e. HLA alleles, CTLA4 etc.). So the thinking has been that the immune system has gone rogue. This research adds a new wrinkle to this line of thinking. The researchers find that the Beta cells within the pancreas of T1D patients are producing a peptide that they are not supposed to be producing. In fact, this is a peptide that isn't produced anywhere else in the body. So when T-cells see that the Beta cells are making this peptide, the T-cells recognize it as foreign and assume that the Beta cells have been infected by a virus or become cancerous. So the T-cells kill the Beta cells.\n\nIn this model, the T-cells are just doing their job. It is the Beta cells that are broken. So from a therapeutic standpoint, the question becomes can you 1) fix the Beta cells (maybe use Crispr to attempt to delete the DNA encoding the neo-epitope) or 2) train the T-cells to ignore the neo-epitope (a tolerizing vaccine, or clonal deletion of T-cells that are reactive to the eptiope)?\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v23/n4/full/nm.4289.html\"&gt;full research&lt;/a&gt; article, &lt;em&gt;Autoimmunity against a defective ribosomal insulin gene product in type 1 diabetes&lt;/em&gt;, was published in the journal Nature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;\nIdentification of epitopes that are recognized by diabetogenic T cells and cause selective beta cell destruction in type 1 diabetes (T1D) has focused on peptides originating from native beta cell proteins.
