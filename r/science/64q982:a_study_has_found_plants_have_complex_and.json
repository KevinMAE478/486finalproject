We found that roots were able to locate a water source by sensing the vibrations generated by water moving inside pipes, even in the absence of substrate moisture. When both moisture and acoustic cues were available, roots preferentially used moisture in the soil over acoustic vibrations, suggesting that acoustic gradients enable roots to broadly detect a water source at a distance, while moisture gradients help them to reach their target more accurately. \"\n\n\nSo before it's possible to physically sense moisture - there needs to be something that sets the plant off for movement - and that's vibrations.\n\n\nThis is great for scientists to realize, there's so many senses for animals/ plants alike that people just don't understand. The better we understand our senses, the more intrinsically, and accurately, we can learn.
