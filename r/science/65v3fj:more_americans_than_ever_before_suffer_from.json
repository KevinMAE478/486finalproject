We know a lot more about mental illness than in the 1930s-40s or 1850-70s, previous \"Fourth Turning\" crises in which severe psychological distress would not be out of the norm. We just don't have data from times when a panic attack was just called \"apoplexy\" and anxiety was just \"nerves\". It's more accurate to say \"more Americans than ever *recorded* suffer...\".\n\nWe're probably mentally healthier than we were in antiquity. A contributing factor to the Salem witch trials was ergot poisoning, essentially meaning that people were on a constant, involuntary LSD trip. We just notice mental health problems more because \"consumption\" (fatal TB) is a thing of the past and because the food supply and toxicity issues that caused normal people to hallucinate have mostly been solved, making the artifacts of mental illness rarer. Is American mental health worse than it was in 1970, when a college degree meant that you were set for life? Absolutely. Worse than in Salem 1693? No. \n\nThat said, I do believe that people are in worse mental health than at any time in recent memory (or data). This is probably the worst decade, for that, since the 1940s. The 1960s, with assassinations and race riots and Vietnam, may have come close... but on the other hand, our GDP growth was 5%. If you didn't like not being able to afford something, you waited five years for your income to rise and the price to come down. You didn't go in to work, in the 1960s, wondering if you'd get fired or \"reorg'd\" into a demotion or lose your whole career because a 15-year-old not-PC Internet post \"went viral\".\n\nAt any rate, corporate capitalism is in the same state now that Soviet communism was in, thirty years ago, when the Soviet Union started to dissolve. Just as you saw problems of substance abuse and mental ill-health rising in Russia in the 1980s and '90s, you're seeing that in the U.S. now with the so-called \"opioid epidemic\". A system, one that people invested their lives in, is now dying. It's hurting people.\n\nI also think that psychological attrition is late-stage corporate capitalism in WAD (\"Works As Designed\") mode. It was different before the 1980s, because companies invested in people and took a long view. These days? Constant war. You have to fight every day against people who want you not to have your job, whether jealous colleagues or extortive managers or HR bean-counters to whom you're just a +1/-1 increment in a cell in a spreadsheet.\n\nThis is partly because the people up top, the CEOs and boardroom people, are not very smart. I know plenty of wealthy people, and you can take my word on this one. Quants who start hedge funds are smart, but most people in the 7-figure club got there by peddling connections and couldn't tell talent from their own asshole in a lineup. Thus, the only way they can decide who can advance is to set up tournaments of who can suffer the most. (Actually, the relevant social skill is appearing to suffer, and in the right way, without actually suffering so much that you might be part of the attrition.) When people bug out and leave, that's the system WAD. When a 30-year-old programmer tires of the sexual harassment, micromanagement (Agile! Scrum!), and open-plan offices and gets \"open-plan syndrome\"-- which isn't recognized by mainstream psychiatry as anything other than panic disorder, because that's what it actually is-- everyone else moves up a notch. They survived a little bit longer than she did, and they're one head closer to the brass ring. \n\nI'm afraid that this is going to get worse before it gets better. Corporate capitalism absolutely needs to die, just as authoritarian command economies needed to die in the 1980s (if not before). Creative destruction is healthy. However, when a system (even a bad one) collapses, there's a lot of displacement and distress. Most people hate their corporate jobs, but now that those corporate jobs are disappearing and no credible replacement economy exists (the Silicon Valley \"startup\" economy is just a more mean-spirited, psychotic version of the corporate one) we're seeing a lot of anguish. Scarier still, we've seen (and it started in the Tea Party, not in 2016) the rise of populist politicians who are ill-equipped for complex policy roles but absolutely brilliant at capitalizing on a damaged psychological environment. \n\nScary (and crazy) times ahead...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, this isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;more than ever&amp;quot;.
