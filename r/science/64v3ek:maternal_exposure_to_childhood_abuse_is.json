To explore whether familial tendency towards autistic traits-presumably related to genetic predisposition-accounts for this association, we examined whether women who experienced childhood abuse were more likely to select mates with high levels of autistic traits, and whether parental autistic traits accounted for the association of maternal abuse and offspring autism in 209 autism cases and 833 controls. Maternal childhood abuse was strongly associated with high paternal autistic traits (severe abuse, OR = 3.98, 95% CI = 1.26, 8.31). Maternal and paternal autistic traits accounted for 21% of the association between maternal abuse and offspring autism. These results provide evidence that childhood abuse affects mate selection, with implications for offspring health.\n\nAs for why the researchers hypothesize the reason for this association, they note in the discussion section:\n\n&gt;Our results, therefore, suggest at least two alternative possibilities. First, the experience of childhood abuse may affect women in ways that increase her risk of having a child with ASD, as depicted in Fig. 1d. Long lasting maternal inflammation, HPA-axis dysregulation (Heim and Nemeroff 2001; Heim et al. 2000, 2001), and HPG-axis dysregulation has been shown to result from these experiences. It may be that long lasting effects of childhood abuse like these put the developing fetus at increased risk of ASD. \n\nA second hypothesized reason for this association is this:\n\n&gt;Second, it is possible that women who experienced childhood abuse are more likely to select mates who also experienced abuse. The experience of abuse may affect men in ways that subsequently increase risk of ASD in offspring. For example, distinct paternal sperm DNA methylation patterns have been associated with offspring ASD (Feinberg et al. 2015) and paternal stress has been associated with sperm microRNA (Rodgers et al. 2013). Sperm characteristics thus could possibly be a mechanism through which paternal experiences of abuse affect offspring ASD, though no studies have examined this possibility. Thus, several biological pathways could plausibly account for the increased risk of autism in offspring of women exposed to childhood abuse not accounted for by parental autistic traits.\n\n**So it's not clear exactly why this association exists, but it doesn't appear that the researchers suspect the explanation is that women *seek out* different \"personality traits\" in response to their childhood abuse.**", "edited": 1491977815.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;a href=\"/r/science\"&gt;/r/science&lt;/a&gt;!
