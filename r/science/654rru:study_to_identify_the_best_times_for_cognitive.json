Yes. It has its ups and downs. Robot or not, it really just takes time. My slew of undergrad degrees and PhD took 13 years. It depends on how smart you are, your work ethic, luck, and strategy. For example, I couldn&amp;#39;t have done it if I had to do an actual job to pay for school. The first few years of undergrad were more than full-time study paid for with grants and scholarships. After that, because of my smarts/skills, I did interesting research and got paid for it. In grad school I started as a research assistant. The only times I was a teaching assistant it was when it was convenient for my advisors budget.
