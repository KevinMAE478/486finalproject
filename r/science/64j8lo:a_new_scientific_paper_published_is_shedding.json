These waves come in all possible wavelengths, and their presence implies that empty space contains a certain amount of energy--an energy that we can't tap, but that is always there.\nNow, if mirrors are placed facing each other in a vacuum, some of the waves will fit between them, bouncing back and forth, while others will not. As the two mirrors move closer to each other, the longer waves will no longer fit--the result being that the total amount of energy in the vacuum between the plates will be a bit less than the amount elsewhere in the vacuum. Thus, the mirrors will attract each other, just as two objects held together by a stretched spring will move together as the energy stored in the spring decreases.\n\n\nThis effect, that two mirrors in a vacuum will be attracted to each other, is the Casimir Effect.

To some, this finding implies that the vacuum of space could be an enormous source of energy--called \"zero point energy.\"\n\nBut the finding also raises a physical problem: there's nothing to stop arbitrarily small waves from fitting between two mirrors, and there is an infinite number of these wavelengths. The mathematical solution is to temporarily do the calculation for a finite number of waves for two different separations of the mirrors, find the associated difference in vacuum energies and then argue that the difference remains finite as one allows the number of wavelengths to go to infinity.\n\nAlthough this trick works, and gives answers in agreement with experiment, the problem of an infinite vacuum energy is a serious one.

The mathematical solution is to temporarily do the calculation for a finite number of waves for two different separations of the mirrors, find the associated difference in vacuum energies and then argue that the difference remains finite as one allows the number of wavelengths to go to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although this trick works, and gives answers in agreement with experiment, the problem of an infinite vacuum energy is a serious one. Einstein&amp;#39;s theory of gravitation implies that this energy must produce an infinite gravitational curvature of spacetime--something we most definitely do not observe. The resolution of this problem is still an open research question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-casimir-effec/\"&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-casimir-effec/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_dg2m2px", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491861091.0, "created_utc": 1491832291.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 328}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64j8lo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64j8lo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64j8lo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg2qw90", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "octropos", "parent_id": "t1_dg2qtyl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/science", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That was excellent!
