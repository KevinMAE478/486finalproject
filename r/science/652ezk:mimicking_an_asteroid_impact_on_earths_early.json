F\n*Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017*\n*doi: 10.1073/pnas.1700010114. [Epub ahead of print]*\n\n&gt;**Abstract**\n&gt;The Miller\u2013Urey experiments pioneered modern research on the\n&gt;molecular origins of life, but their actual relevance in this field was\n&gt;later questioned because the gas mixture used in their research is\n&gt;considered too reducing with respect to the most accepted hypotheses\n&gt;for the conditions on primordial Earth. In particular, the\n&gt;production of only amino acids has been taken as evidence of the\n&gt;limited relevance of the results. Here, we report an experimental\n&gt;work, combined with state-of-the-art computational methods, in\n&gt;which both electric discharge and laser-driven plasma impact\n&gt;simulations were carried out in a reducing atmosphere containing\n&gt;NH3 + CO. We show that RNA nucleobases are synthesized in these\n&gt;experiments, strongly supporting the possibility of the emergence of\n&gt;biologically relevant molecules in a reducing atmosphere.

In particular, the\nproduction of only amino acids has been taken as evidence of the\nlimited relevance of the results. Here, we report an experimental\nwork, combined with state-of-the-art computational methods, in\nwhich both electric discharge and laser-driven plasma impact\nsimulations were carried out in a reducing atmosphere containing\nNH3 + CO. We show that RNA nucleobases are synthesized in these\nexperiments, strongly supporting the possibility of the emergence of\nbiologically relevant molecules in a reducing atmosphere. The reconstructed\nsynthetic pathways indicate that small radicals and formamide\nplay a crucial role, in agreement with a number of recent experimental\nand theoretical results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance&lt;/strong&gt;\nThe study shows that Miller\u2013Urey experiments produce RNA\nnucleobases in discharges and laser-driven plasma impact\nsimulations carried out in a simple prototype of reducing atmosphere\ncontaining ammonia and carbon monoxide. We\ncarried out a self-standing description of chemistry relevant to\nhypothesis of abiotic synthesis of RNA nucleobases related to\nearly-Earth chemical evolution under reducing conditions. The\nresearch addresses the chemistry of simple-model reducing\natmosphere (NH3 + CO + H2O) and the role of formamide as an\nintermediate of nucleobase formation in Miller\u2013Urey experiment.\nThe explorations combine experiments performed using\nmodern techniques of large, high-power shock wave plasma\ngeneration by hall terawatt lasers, electric discharges, and\nstate-of-the-art ab initio free-energy calculations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We focused our effort on two environments relevant to prebiotic\nchemistry: (i) transformation of an atmosphere exposed a shock\nwave induced by an extraterrestrial body and the resulting impact\nplasma [Early and Late Heavy Bombardment in our solar system\nduring evolution and stabilization of orbits (44)]; and (ii) transformation\nof an atmosphere by an electrical discharge (lightning\nin heavy clouds of dust, vapors, and other aerosols from impact,\nvolcanic activity and evaporation in the early atmosphere) (45).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;\nStarting from this gaseous mixture, we\nhave experimentally and theoretically demonstrated a pathway\nto the synthesis of formamide and the subsequent formation of\nall RNA nucleobases driven by impact plasma or electric discharge&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my attempt of a succinct summary: \nfour RNA bases could be synthesised in high-energy conditions of plasma and electric discharges caused by environmental factors (asteroid impact, volcanic activity).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_dg7e4x4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492109121.0, "created_utc": 1492080321.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652ezk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7basf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "genocidalwaffles", "parent_id": "t1_dg7b8i9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/science", "controversiality": 0, "body": "boom baby", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;boom baby&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_dg7basf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492100566.0, "created_utc": 1492071766.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7b8i9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 58, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GIRATINAGX", "parent_id": "t1_dg7b6i7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/science", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah, so the meteor is like a jumpstarter for life on earth?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, so the meteor is like a jumpstarter for life on earth?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_dg7b8i9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492100380.0, "created_utc": 1492071580.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 58}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652ezk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652ezk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652ezk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652ezk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652ezk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7e5hf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Austernpilz", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ciz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/science", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think that the chance of life forming on a planet that meets the conditions for life to form is basically 1. \n\nAssume you have 100 Solar systems with 100 earths, life will form on every single one.

It is a molecule found in all living organisms, from bacteria to humans, where it exists in a variety of forms, with mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA being the most important ones. RNA is actually a quite simple polymer, made of building blocks called nucleotides. Each nucleotide (NTP) consists of three components: a sugar (ribose), phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. There are four types of such bases: uracil (U), adenosine (A), cytosine (C), and guanosine (G), giving rise to four distinct types of RNA nucleotides. A short fragment of RNA would look like UTAGUCUUGA.\nNow, let's say a cell needs to make a new protein. The information about that protein is located in a specific region (gene) of the cell's DNA (which is a nucleic acid similar to RNA). A new mRNA gets synthesised from that gene and goes to a ribosome (a very large complex made of rRNAs and ribosome proteins). Ribosome reads the mRNA, and builds a protein using the information in the mRNA. The building blocks for this protein (amino acids) are delivered in a complex with tRNAs. Almost every chemical reaction in a cell is catalysed by proteins (proteins that have a catalytic activity are usually called enzymes), but we know a number of examples of reactions carried out by special RNA molecules, called ribozymes (\"ribo\"+\"enzymes\").\nThe modern view on the evolution of life is that the very early proto life forms were ribozymes themselves. I prefer the term ribonucleic replicators, but it is non-canon. Anyway, the idea is that such ancient ribozymes had the most important features of living organisms: they had one or several catalytic functions, could replicate, and evolve (through mutation and natural selection), and might have formed larger aggregates, consisting of several ribozymes with slightly different catalytic functions, giving a competitive advantage to such a structure.
