These thoughts are the most essential to personal topics, they make you connect things to yourself which is certainly helpful in some situations, but it also limits what topics you think about by encouraging you to focus on such a small range of subjects, and that probably encourages egotistical trains of thought. Disabling that could be responsible for the better perspective psychedelics can give you on your own ego and why you leave your usual \"comfort zone\" of default thoughts and think new things for the first time, things that might have been obvious that you just never got to think about because it wasn't connected closely enough to the dnm, which is often where trains of thought either start or lead to.

So I&amp;#39;d think preferred music would sound better on psychedelics with the dnm disabled because you&amp;#39;re actually paying attention to it as if you&amp;#39;ve never heard it before, instead of tuning it out and using it as background noise for your thoughts. Both have uses, as the study implies the quality and usefulness of daydreaming is enhanced when you do this normally, but I&amp;#39;m also consistently surprised by how many, sometimes obvious things, I don&amp;#39;t normally pick up on when listening to music I already know because I can&amp;#39;t hold my attention on it without zoning out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting more speculative the dnm seems to me like a small &amp;quot;closed loop&amp;quot; of topics/thoughts. These thoughts are the most essential to personal topics, they make you connect things to yourself which is certainly helpful in some situations, but it also limits what topics you think about by encouraging you to focus on such a small range of subjects, and that probably encourages egotistical trains of thought.
