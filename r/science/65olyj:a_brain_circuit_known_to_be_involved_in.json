This network also &amp;quot;lights up&amp;quot; when cognitive demand is low and is classically considered responsible for homeostatic tasks and consolidation of learned material. This is where you may confuse mind-wandering and self-reflection with the default mode network: while those tasks are in fact cognitive demands, subconscious consolidation and long-term memory processing would more likely occur when the default mode network is active and cognitive load is low. Thus if music increases activity of default mode network structures, this can be described as one of two phenomena: 1) decreased attention due to the distraction of music increases consolidation activity in the default network; or 2) increased neural activity in the default network due to music initiates consolidation and self-reflection, the less likely but more logical conclusion drawn about the research mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another important thing to note is that the default mode network by definition is a set of functional correlations, meaning it is a result of several interconnected brain structures communicating with each other rather than those structures simply being active. This means that if music simply lights up one of those structures and not others (the amygdala, e.g.) then not a lot is said about the role of music in self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this clears up some generalizations that could be made about the research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_dgcdmx4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492396254.0, "created_utc": 1492367454.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65olyj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcbg0z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "catman2021", "parent_id": "t3_65olyj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/science", "controversiality": 0, "body": "When people sing together physiological (heart rate, respiratory rate) and social (coordination &amp; cooperation) also occurs.
