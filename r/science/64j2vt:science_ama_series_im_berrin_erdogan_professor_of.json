Attach the stigma that those who take those jobs will quickly leave as soon as a better opportunity opens up, and you have a recipe for a lost-lost cause for many outgoing graduates nowadays.\n \nMentors are doing their best to train upcoming apprentice and junior scientists into being as competitive as possible for future positions.  But I remember my boss saying to me that P.I.s need to start taking birth control.  That they're training and overtraining students for jobs that just aren't there.  I get the idea that science should be choosing the best and the brightest, but that doesn't fix the main problem: 1 dozen best and bright candidates, 1 position.\n\nWhat do you think about this birth control idea?  Given that many tenureship applications and other university obligations force the academic pipeline to remain flowing, would you think that this could be a reasonable fix if universities were to shift paradigms and essentially implement more rigid quotas on incoming graduates?

Attach the stigma that those who take those jobs will quickly leave as soon as a better opportunity opens up, and you have a recipe for a lost-lost cause for many outgoing graduates nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mentors are doing their best to train upcoming apprentice and junior scientists into being as competitive as possible for future positions.
