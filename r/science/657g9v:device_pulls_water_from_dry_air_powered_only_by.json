Zeolites are used in Oxygen concentrator seen in nursing homes and are even used on the space station to remove CO2 from the air. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_dg8ygtz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492190671.0, "created_utc": 1492161871.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8qpjx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 67, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pleeky", "parent_id": "t1_dg8k1um", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/science", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; These MOF materials are revolutionary because the energy required to \"clean\" them by heating is really low.\n\nDo MOFs just sit there doing their thing in perpetuity?

0, "body": "The MOF (metal-organic framework) used in this study was MOF-801 which seems to be used to create areas of super-humidity within the gaps of the MOF. \n\n[Here's a paper from 2014 about the water absorbing abilities of MOFs near the same type as MOF-801, and including MOF-801 itself.](http://yaghi.berkeley.edu/pdfPublications/14-watermofs.pdf) Don't worry, it's not behind a paywall.\n\nI'll copy most of the text of the article that the OP is referring to so others can look through it.\n\n\n&gt;We carried out the adsorption-desorption experiments for water harvesting with MOF-801 at 20% RH. A powder of MOF-801 was synthesized as reported (10) and then activated (solvent removal from the pores) by heating at 150\u00b0C under vacuum for 24 hours. The powder was infiltrated into a porous copper foam with a thickness of 0.41 cm and porosity of ~0.95, brazed on a copper substrate, to create an adsorbent layer (5 cm by 5 cm by 0.41 cm) with 1.79 g of activated MOF-801 with an average packing porosity of ~0.85 (Fig. 2A), with enhanced structural rigidity and thermal transport. This particular geometry with a high substrate area to thickness ratio was selected to reduce parasitic heat loss.\nExperiments were performed in a RH-controlled environmental chamber interfaced with a solar simulator. The fabricated MOF-801 layer was placed in the chamber (Fig. 2A), and evacuated under high vacuum below 1 Pa at 90\u00b0C. Water vapor was then introduced inside the chamber to maintain a condition equivalent to a partial vapor pressure of 20% RH at 35\u00b0C, matching the step rise in water uptake for the MOF-801 (Fig. 1A). Vapor was adsorbed onto the sample surfaces by diffusion (Fig. 2B). After saturation, the chamber was isolated from the vapor source. A solar flux (1 kW m\u20132, AM1.5 spectrum) was introduced to the graphite coated substrate layer with a solar absorptance of 0.91 to desorb water from the MOF. This water was then collected via a condenser interfaced with a thermoelectric cooler which maintains the isobaric conditions of ~1.2 kPa (20% RH at 35\u00b0C, saturation temperature of ~10\u00b0C). By maintaining the isobaric condition, all of the desorbed vapor was condensed and harvested by the condenser (25). During desorption, the water harvesting rate (or vapor desorption rate) was continuously monitored with a heat flux sensor interfaced to the condenser. The environmental temperature above standard ambient temperature was necessary to per-form the experiments above 1 kPa; otherwise, a much lower condenser temperature is needed (e.g., ~0.5\u00b0C for 20% RH at 25\u00b0C). Thermocouples were placed on both sides of the MOF-801 layer to monitor the dynamic temperature response.\n\n&gt;Figure 2C shows the temperature of the MOF-801 layer and pressure inside the chamber during the adsorption and solar-assisted desorption experiments. During adsorption, the temperature of the MOF-801 layer first rapidly increased because the exothermic adsorption process, and then slowly decreased as heat was lost to the surroundings. After ~70 min of adsorption, the MOF-801 temperature equilibrated with the surrounding vapor of ~35\u00b0C. At these given adsorption conditions, the predicted water uptake, or potential harvestable quantity of water, was estimated to be ~0.25 kg H2O kg\u20131 MOF, as shown in the upper abscissa of Fig. 2C. For MOF-801, ~0.24 L kg\u20131 of water was harvested per each water harvesting cycle (Fig. 2D), obtained by integrating the water harvesting rate. We further confirmed the experimental result with an adsorption analyzer under identical adsorption-desorption conditions (fig. S2A).\n\n&gt;A theoretical model was developed to optimize the de-sign of the water harvesting process with MOF-801, which was further validated with the experimental data. The mod-el framework was based on mass and energy conservation incorporating adsorption dynamics parameters (27, 28), and the analysis was carried out by using COMSOL Multiphysics (25). The inter- and intracrystalline vapor diffusion through the layer and within the crystals, as well as the thermal transport through the layer, were considered in the model. The theoretical model produced good agreement with the experimental data from the water-harvesting experiment (Fig. 2, C and D). We then investigated the water harvesting behavior under ambient air conditions by incorporating the diffusion and sorption characteristics of MOF-801 at ambient conditions into the theoretical model (25). We per-formed a parametric study, including varying the packing porosity (0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) and layer thickness (1, 3, 5, and 10 mm), and determined the time and amount of harvestable water using a solar flux of 1 sun (1 kW m\u20132) (25). By considering both the adsorption and desorption dynamics, a porosity of 0.7 was predicted to yield the largest quantity of water. At a porosity of ~0.5 or less, the adsorption kinetics is limited by Knudsen diffusion because the crystal diameter of MOF-801 is only ~0.6 \u03bcm (fig. S5). The characteristic void spacing for Knudsen diffusion is a function of packing porosity and the crystal diameter. However, at higher porosities, a thicker MOF-801 layer is required to harvest a sufficient amount of water, but the time scale and transport resistance for intercrystalline diffusion also scales with the MOF layer thickness as t ~ Lc2/Dv, where, t, Dv, and Lc are the time scale, intercrystalline diffusivity, and characteristic length scale (i.e., layer thickness), respectively.\n\n&gt;Simulated adsorption-desorption dynamics for the MOF-801 layer of the optimized packing porosity of 0.7 are shown in Fig. 3 for 1 sun and realistic boundary conditions for heat loss (a natural heat transfer coefficient of 10 W m\u20132 K\u20131 and standard ambient temperature). In this simulation, MOF-801 was initially equilibrated at 20% RH, and the vapor con-tent in the air-vapor mixture that surrounds the layer during desorption increased rapidly from 20% RH to 100% RH at 25\u00b0C. This scenario is more realistic compared to the model experiment described above because water is harvested by a condenser at ambient temperature. Once solar irradiation was stopped, the air-vapor concentration revert-ed to 20% RH for vapor adsorption from ambient air, and the heat from the adsorption process was transferred to the surroundings. A detailed description of the boundary conditions and idealizations in the simulation are discussed in section S8 of the supplementary materials. First, water up-take decreased with time during solar heating and water condensation, and then increased through adsorption, as shown on the simulated water uptake profiles for the MOF-801 layer with a thickness of 1, 3, and 5 mm in Fig. 3. The temperature correspondingly increased and then decreased with time. Continuously harvesting water in a cyclic manner for a 24-hour period with low-grade heat at 1 kW m\u20132 can yield ~2.8 L kg\u20131 day\u20131 or ~0.9 L m\u20132 day\u20131 of water with a layer with 1 mm thickness. Alternatively, per one cycle, a 5 mm thick layer of MOF-801 can harvest ~0.4 L m\u20132 of water. Our findings indicate that MOFs with the enhanced sorption capacity and high intracrystalline diffusivity along with an optimized crystal diameter and density, and thickness of the MOF layer can boost the daily quantity of the harvested water from an arid environment.\n\n&gt;Finally, a proof-of-concept MOF-801 water-harvesting prototype was built to demonstrate the viability of this approach outdoors (Fig. 4A). This prototype includes a MOF-801 layer (packing porosity of ~0.85, 5 cm by 5 cm and 0.31 cm thick containing 1.34 g of activated MOF), an acrylic en-closure, and a condenser, which was tested on a roof at MIT . The spacing between the layer and condenser in the prototype was chosen to be large enough to enable ease of sample installation and visualization. The activated MOF-801 layer was left on the roof overnight for vapor adsorption from ambient air (day 1). The desorption process using natural sunlight was carried out on day 2 (ambient RH was ~65% at the start of experiment). For visualization purposes, we used a condenser with a temperature controller to maintain the temperature slightly below ambient, but above the dew point, to prevent vapor condensation on the inner walls of the enclosure. However, active cooling is not needed in a practical device since the hot desorbed vapor can condense at the cooler ambient temperature using a passive heat sink.\n\n&gt;The formation, growth and multiplication of water drop-lets on the condenser with the change of the MOF layer temperature and time are shown in Fig. 4B. The temperature and solar flux (global horizontal irradiation) measurements during the solar-assisted desorption process revealed a rapid increase in the MOF-801 temperature accompanied with the relatively low solar fluxes (Fig. 4C). Because water harvesting with vapor condensation is done with the presence of noncondensables (air), transport of desorbed vapor from the layer to the condenser surface is by diffusion. Using the experimentally measured solar flux and environmental conditions, and the theoretical model incorporating the vapor diffusion resistance between the layer and con-denser, the MOF layer temperature and water uptake pro-files are also predicted (Fig. 4C). The RHs based on the MOF layer temperature before and after the solar-assisted desorption are ~65% at 25\u00b0C and ~10% at 66\u00b0C and the corresponding equilibrium water uptakes under these conditions are ~0.35 kg kg\u20131 and ~0.05 kg kg\u20131, respectively, at a 23\u00b0C condenser temperature (estimated from fig. S6B). An amount of ~0.3 L kg\u20131 of water can be potentially harvested by saturating the MOF layer with ambient air at a solar flux below one sun.\n\n[Here are images of Figures 1 and 2.](http://imgur.com/a/R9TDc)\n\nKeep in mind that I removed a few paragraphs due to the character limit, which I am fast approaching.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MOF (metal-organic framework) used in this study was MOF-801 which seems to be used to create areas of super-humidity within the gaps of the MOF. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://yaghi.berkeley.edu/pdfPublications/14-watermofs.pdf\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a paper from 2014 about the water absorbing abilities of MOFs near the same type as MOF-801, and including MOF-801 itself.&lt;/a&gt; Don&amp;#39;t worry, it&amp;#39;s not behind a paywall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll copy most of the text of the article that the OP is referring to so others can look through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We carried out the adsorption-desorption experiments for water harvesting with MOF-801 at 20% RH.

[You can find the procedure on the third page of this article which isn't behind a paywall.](http://yaghi.berkeley.edu/pdfPublications/14-watermofs.pdf)\n\nSo how expensive is it to manufacture MOF-801? If sigma-aldrich is anything to go off of... It's not cheap. $680 per KG of [Zicronyl Chloride](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigald/224316?lang=en&amp;region=US) and the standard ~$60 for 1 KG fumaric acid. \n\nChemical manufacturing plants can find ways to reduce costs, but it's still going to be quite expensive for the MOF alone. \n\nThis isn't something that will be used as a cost-effective or even feasible dehumidifier for anyone, but it could certainly lead to something along those lines as we get better at producing MOFs. \n\nThe technology *works*, it's just not cost-effective.\n\n[My last comment in this thread provides most of the OP source article if you want to read over it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/657g9v/device_pulls_water_from_dry_air_powered_only_by/dg8la92/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=science)\n\nEdit: I typed \"a fumaric acid\" instead of \"a solution of fumaric acid\".
