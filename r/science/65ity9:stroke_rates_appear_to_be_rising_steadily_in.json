Clots in the deep veins, usually of the lower extremity, (DVT&amp;#39;s = deep vein thrombosis) are usually caused by being sedentary for long periods (after surgery, etc), having cancer (increases the coaguable state of your blood), hormonal birth control, etc.... DVT&amp;#39;s do not cause strokes, unless you have a defect in your heart that allows blood to go from one side to the other (right to left, bypassing the lungs) directly (blood passes through the lungs before the heart, then the brain), most commonly by a PFO (patent foramen ovale = a hole in the atrial septa, which is the wall between the two smaller top chambers of your heart and congenital). Commonly, strokes (most commonly ischemic = loss of blood flow, vs hemorrhagic = bleeding) is caused by emboli (little bits of clot or debris from different sources) traveling from your heart or carotid arteries (main arteries in your neck bringing blood to your brain) and clogging the small vessels in your brain. Typically, emboli from the heart are from bacterial/fungal veggitations on the valves (from IV drug use, prosthetic valves, etc...) and emboli from the carotid arteries are from unstable plaque (from high cholesterol, etc...). Hemorrhagic stroke are about 20% of strokes and typically occur from ruptured aneurysms (which are usually genetic).  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "science", "name": "t1_dgb1u5e",
