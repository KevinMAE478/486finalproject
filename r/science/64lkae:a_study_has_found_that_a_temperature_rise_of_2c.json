Thats actually about to happen now but the reduction in global temperature caused by it is actually less than the increase we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past 100 years so there won&amp;#39;t be anything close to an ice age. This one is also expected to not last very long, and as a result it wouldnt even reduce the temperature as much as the last one.
