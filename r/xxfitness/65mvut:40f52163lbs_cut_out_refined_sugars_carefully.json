I used a kitchen scale to weigh out the portions, meticulously calculating things. I even stayed away from most fruit, limiting my fruit intake to avocados and berries. I did eat carbs, but I would not eat them after lunch time, and only healthy carbs like quinoa, chia seeds, beans, and sweet potato. I cut out breads, rice and pasta completely. I was consuming 1800 calories a day, I cut my diet to 1500-1600. I ate 6 times a day, no more than 250-300 calories each time, and I try to space them out at regular intervals instead of eating 3 bigger meals. I meal prepped the hell out of things too. I try to put Cayenne pepper into almost everything I eat because I heard it kick-starts the metabolism. I barely use any salt, sometimes just a pinch of sea salt or soy sauce with my chicken or tofu for flavor. I only drink water, herbal tea, or this concoction I make out of water, cucumber, lime, and mint. I don&amp;#39;t drink coffee and have completely cut out alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to do 30 minutes of cardio a day - alternating between the treadmill and elliptical in my condo 6 days a week. I do weights - alternating leg, arm, and core on the machines in the gym. I increased the cardio to 45 minutes a day and increased my intensity while keeping the same number of reps in my weight routine, increasing the weights slightly when they start feeling too easy. I was told not to do too much cardio and risk losing muscle. I walk my dogs at least a total of 90 minutes a day - two shorter 15-minute walks to do their business and one longer hour-long walk. I don&amp;#39;t include my walks in MyFitnessPal because I feel that the calories lost are minimal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have hypothyroidism, but it is under control with pills and TSH/T4 levels have been normal for years now. I&amp;#39;m a shift worker working a different shift every week, even though I actually set an alarm clock to meal times. I used to play a lot of hockey, between 12-15 games a week but because I&amp;#39;m a goalie, it does not involve too much cardio. I would say I burn between 60-120 calories a game, depending on who we&amp;#39;re playing. That has been reduced to maybe 6-8 games a week now that we are in between hockey seasons, but I recently took up ball hockey to make up for the lack of ice hockey. Whenever I&amp;#39;m scheduled to work the evening shift (once every 5 weeks), that gets cut down to maybe 2-4 daytime games. But I drop in on morning yoga classes before work. I do get a good 6-8 hours of sleep a day, but I always wake up every 2-3 hours. My shift-work, the number of hockey games I play, and are things I cannot change easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I weighed myself once last month in the morning, 2 weeks after having my period. I did the same at the same time this month, on the same shift cycle. I was shocked to have gained 8 pounds. I maintained 155lbs when I started. I already felt that my clothes were tighter. Didn&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d gain that much weight especially with the increase in exercise and reduction in food, especially bad sugars and carbs. Weighed myself a couple of days later just in case of water weight, still at 163lbs. I do not feel that I have gained 8 pounds of muscle - the body analysis scale show that it is mostly fat gained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you have anything to suggest to me, please do. I&amp;#39;m tired of doing everything right and yet gaining weight in the process. Before that I was maintaining my weight of 155lbs doing what I did. I need to lose weight because I&amp;#39;m too heavy and it puts too much stress on my joints, especially my knees, ankles and hips, when I&amp;#39;m playing hockey - and I hope to be playing it deep into my 60s.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Title says it all.

If you want to lose a pound a week you need a 3500 deficit for a week, which is a 500 calorie deficit per day. Which is 1300 calories- so you were right before!

Therefore it is possible that she could lose 1 lb per week on 1500 calories if she hits that number 7 days a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she had been around 130 lbs or less, then she would likely be cutting at 1200-1300 like I said.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for pointing it out so that I could correct myself.  I usually enter data into a sheet &amp;amp; have it spit out actual numbers to remove any ambiguity, but it&amp;#39;s the weekend &amp;amp; I was replying from my phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:   See data table below.  If OP wanted she could probably make due with 100g of protein instead of 130 (which would give close to 1g per lb of non-fat mass), &amp;amp; shift those 30g to additional carbs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Basic Info&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Gender&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Female&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Age&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Height&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;5&amp;#39;2&amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Weight&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;163 lbs&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Body+Mass+Index+BMI\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BMI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;29.8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;BMI Category&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Overweight (25 - 29.99)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3x9m7j/spreadsheet_body_composition_nutrition_tracker/\"&gt;*Est.
