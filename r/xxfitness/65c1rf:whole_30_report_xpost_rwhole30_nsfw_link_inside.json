First, last June my dermatologist recommended I give up dairy to see if it helped my acne and I found it had a huge improvement, so I was curious to see if I had any other food sensitivities. Second, I had gotten into a bad cycle of eating too many sweets, so I wanted to have a rule-based break from that. Third, I had enough friends who rave about it and it&amp;#39;s high protein to not interfere with lifting, that I wanted to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of body changes, I lost about 10 lbs and, if not for travel and getting sick while I was on W30, I think my strength progression would have continued. As it is, I didn&amp;#39;t lose any strength (squat: ~180lbs, bench: ~110lbs) despite my lifting game being off. I didn&amp;#39;t realize how much bloat I had before doing this, I thought it was just how my stomach looked. My stomach is much flatter than it was before, though it&amp;#39;s not entirely clear to me what the cause was at this point. My best guess is sugar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My skin actually got a bit worse during this, but it is hard to pinpoint something like that when there are so many other factors (stress, travel, illness) that could contribute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll also say that while many people get &amp;quot;tiger blood&amp;quot; (loads of productive, sustained energy starting about halfway through the program), I did not. I had a good bit of energy in the beginning but I was honestly dragging toward the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stats: F/34/5&amp;#39;8&amp;quot;/171cm&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Starting weight: 144.5 lbs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ending weight: 134.5 lbs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/IEnVH\"&gt;Progress pictures NSFW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the progress pics may not look like much, given that for at least half of the time (probably more) I wasn&amp;#39;t exercising nearly as much as normal, this is pretty impressive. I&amp;#39;m particularly happy with how my back is looking!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of how I handle different foods, I found that I basically didn&amp;#39;t pass gas much on W30, and any farts were pretty much odorless. Upon reintroduction, my beloved legumes caused tons of really stinky farts. I don&amp;#39;t know how they could betray me so! At least soy doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Non-glutenous grains caused no problems, but gluten (or at least gluten + sugar) caused some upset stomach. Not much, but enough that I&amp;#39;m going to be careful about it going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found alcohol reintroduction (wine and whiskey at least) to be no problem. I am not doing a formal reintroduction of dairy. Finding out last summer that dairy is a major contributing factor to my acne has caused me to really limit dairy anyways, so it doesn&amp;#39;t make a lot of sense for me to reintroduce it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really glad I did this, but also really glad that it&amp;#39;s over. I don&amp;#39;t see myself eating this way going forward. I&amp;#39;m glad I can now better understand the tradeoffs I make with my food choices, but I can&amp;#39;t keep going with such a meat-heavy diet. Also, I need an egg break.
