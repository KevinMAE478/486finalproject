Looking at the calendar, the Outlaw Open seemed like a good meet to enter and we had 11 lifters from our small gym in Tigard, OR at the meet. My goals for the meet were to qualify for IPL Worlds which meant that I needed a 744lb total. The sum of my PR&amp;#39;s (not all of which were meet PRs) was 724lbs, so that seemed reachable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our coach does all our programming -- typically we set our training maxes and then train at percentages of those maxes. My meet goal was 250lb squat, 150lb bench, and 350lb deadlift. My training maxes were 225lb, 140lbs, and 330lbs which were close to or at my meet PRs. My coach tuned my training maxes down a little due to my age and needing a bit more recovery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We train 3 nights/week -- Monday used to be Squat, Wednesday was Bench, and Friday was Deadlift. However, after having Anthony Harris spending the summer at our gym last year, our coach decided that we should train some variation of squat, bench, and deadlift each session along with a couple of accessories. As we swung into meet prep, Monday became squat &amp;amp; bench, Wednesday was bench only, and Friday was squat &amp;amp; deadlift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squat:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Opener: 87.5kg/192.5lbs - Easy make.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2nd: 100kg/220lb - Missed due to depth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3rd: 112.5kg/247.5lb - Make. I had my eye on that 744lb total and knew that I needed to make a good 3rd squat attempt and not just repeat my 2nd. Squat depth is my nemesis, but I have never missed a squat due to it being too heavy. I sat in the lifter&amp;#39;s area with my music and just focused on visualizing the squat. I was really proud of this effort. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bench:&lt;/strong&gt;\nBench has been another nemesis -- it took me over a year to progress from 132lb to 142lb and get past that 1 plate bench. But, bench has been going very well in training and I felt strong coming into the meet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Opener: 60kg/132lb - Easy make.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2nd: 65kg/143lb - This was tougher, but was good as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3rd: 70kg/154lb - Miss. My coach gives us a meet day strategy sheet with &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;moderate&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;reach&amp;quot; numbers for each of our attempts. I knew I could take 2 safe 3rd attempts and 1 moderate and hit my 744 goal. I was not feeling all that confident about deadlift and figured I could hit this bench, so despite what I think my coach would have done, I said I wanted to go for the 154. Hindsight being 20/20, that was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadlift:&lt;/strong&gt;\nIn the WPA Worlds in October, by the time we got to deadlift, I was gassed. I got 343lbs off the ground and up to my knees but just ran out of energy there. I also missed 350lbs at our deadlift-only charity meet in December. So, I was more than a little nervous about this event even though deadlift is my strongest and favorite lift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Opener: 130kg/286lbs - Easy make. I usually warm up too fast, but I didn&amp;#39;t time my warm-ups very well and practically ran from the warm-up room to the platform to hit this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2nd: 145kg/319lbs - Make and set the USPA American record (which was previously 314lbs). I hit this in the October meet and have hit it several times since, so I was pretty confident I would get it here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3rd: 160kg/352lbs &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BStrO9Ujm9U/?taken-by=jeronkerridge&amp;amp;hl=en\"&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt; - Make and broke my own record. After my 2nd, I set my butt down, put my headphones on, and got myself focused.

I got Best Female Master&amp;#39;s Lifter and set a new American record for total (previous was 694lbs). I missed qualifying for IPL Worlds by 1.5lbs which was a bummer, but overall, I was very satisfied on the day. This was a 54.5lb meet PR and since my first full power meet in July 2015, I have added 200lbs to my total. I felt like I did a good job of managing my energy throughout the day.
