Eat whole foods, ditch the bars and processed food for micronutrient-rich foods, as detailed by other commenters (I would also add beets, red cabbage, dark leafy greens, and turmeric) and move your focus from protein to complex carbs while training for glycogen recovery. Stretch every day to avoid injury. Epsom salt baths also help. Unrelated to physical training I found that inspiration is a key part in helping me stay dedicated. I read Finding Ultra by Rich Roll, Eat And Run by Scott Jurek and Born To Run by Christopher McDougall every time I start training, just to keep my head in the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "name": "t1_dga173s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492246040.0, "created_utc": 1492217240.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9xgp5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sashms", "parent_id": "t1_dg9x0f1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xxfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's the one through tri-newbies. \n\nI can't remember what it is in later weeks, but in the beginning it's about 6 hours a week.
