Here&amp;#39;s the problem: he doesn&amp;#39;t have the back flexibility to bend over for barbell rows or deadlifts. He can bend over maybe ten degrees with a straight back, but then his spine will curve a lot in order to get his shoulders down enough. I wasn&amp;#39;t comfortable having him do those lifts with so much curve in his spine, but I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do.
