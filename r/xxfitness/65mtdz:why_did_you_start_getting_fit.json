Restricting calories worked. Exercising to exhaustion worked. But none of them made me feel good and I always gained the weight back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend was talking about doing SL5x5, and he has MS, which is a constant worry in the back of my mind. I want him to move his body and stay healthy, so I immediately said, &amp;quot;Okay, let&amp;#39;s do it.&amp;quot; I went with him the first time he lifted and I realized that the 3 big lifts came really naturally to me-- I wanted to top my personal best. I knew when I went back to the gym for the second day of SL while sore as fuck that I was going to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved on from SL to Starting Strength, realized that I was not going to lose weight on SS (which I desperately need to do), and so I hired a coach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really super proud to say that I have only missed 1 workout since late January and I made it up the very next day. Going to the gym is just what I do now. Tracking macros is just what I do now. I feel great and my body is changing for the better. I&amp;#39;m going to be hotter at 31 than I was at 18. That&amp;#39;s a really awesome feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "name": "t1_dgc5hng", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492385442.0, "created_utc": 1492356642.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mtdz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbnhsj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Epoch789", "parent_id": "t3_65mtdz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xxfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "1.
