I have no intention of being a trainer but the women I see training at my big box gym look like absolute crap no pun intended, I mean total crap. To the point where I wonder how the hell they get clients looking like that!! I even had 2-3 women ask me to train them and I'm not a trainer!! If I was I could get a crapload of clients why?? Cause I look the part.\n\nI am a mom of 2 and at the end of the day- An actress cannot show up to a job saying oh I didn't prepare for the role because I'm tired or I don't wanna look the part 365 they literally would have no job. The way they look makes the package and books the job. \nYes social media plays a part but here is the thing everyone who signs up for personal training is signing up for you to sell them a dream. A dream that one day they too could have an amazing body with full blown abs and obliques - A dream that one day their mom bod or dad bod would look like the Adonis they were meant to be. Just the way you sit in the movie theatre and the actress or actor takes you to the story. \nIf you cannot get your body to be an Adonis or whatever the female version why would I trust you to get me there??  You think the guys who are huge and ripped don't have online and offline clients? Yes they do why is that- cause everyone wants to live a dream that one day they too could look like that.. Again my words given with a grain of salt and understand that my goal is to walk around 365 days shredded - its not everyones goal but I've seen women at my old gym even 65 year old women doing it 365 so it can be done. \n\nI guess the question should be - I know people judge me based off the way I look and I don't really wanna change how I look so how can I make something that is primarily about looks appeal to people based on something other than looks- The answer is you cannot- Yes some people want health but majority of people join the gym because they wanna look a certain way. Just my 2 cents take with a grain of salt.  ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a personal trainer so take this with a grain of salt.  I have been on my fitness journey now for the past 2 years and I have had 5 trainers- all guys and 1 girl. Ranging from why did I think that guy had muscles to super hulk had a black baby with 4.4 % body fat trainers. Here is my take on it- I just moved to Florida and I workout by myself no trainer now 7 days a week - lifting and cardio included. I have a fairly clean diet and everywhere I go I get asked am I a personal trainer, do I compete etc, almost daily men come up to me at the gym complimenting my body.
