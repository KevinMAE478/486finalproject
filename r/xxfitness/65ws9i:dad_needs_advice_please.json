My daughter is 15 y.o. and approaching 240lbs.  I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure how much she weighs since I dare not ask.  My wife and I are happily married, 23 years, lived in the same home for 17 years and have two older boys in college (21 and 18).

My two boys are pretty fit but aren&amp;#39;t runners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue is my daughter will not take any advice or help and gets extremely combative whenever either of us try to talk about eating right and exercising. We don&amp;#39;t keep a ton of crap in the house, but she will not eat veggies regularly and will not start an exercise program. Her go-to meal is pasta, or bread.  If we say no to that, she says she&amp;#39;s not hungry and vanishes upstairs to her room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are so concerned about her health but we are beside ourselves on what to do.  She&amp;#39;s met with four different nutritionists over the past 3 or 4 years and all have tried to set up eating plans.  None of which she sticks to for more than a few weeks.  We try motivating her to workout and eat salads, but it never lasts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of this, she insists on wearing these cut-off daisy duke jean shorts and shirts that are too small.  Almost like she&amp;#39;s daring us to say something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the outside she seems happy (when we aren&amp;#39;t harping on her) and she has friends and goes out to the mall and whatever.  She has sleep-overs, etc.  She seems well-adjusted, but I&amp;#39;m afraid deep down she hates being heavy and is just hiding it.  I have no idea what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?  What are we doing wrong? &lt;strong&gt;Are&lt;/strong&gt; we doing this wrong?  I feel like just accepting her the way she is would be giving up and exposing her to the risk of heart disease, diabetes, etc....

Here's what I recommend, having formerly been a 290 lb 15-year-old who went on to lose weight and become a competitive athlete. And I'm finishing an MA in mental health counseling with a focus on obesity and stigma. So on one hand, you could say I kinda know my shit. On the other hand, you could say I am definitely biased. Take your pick.\n\nI'm going to be a bit blunt--not because I don't doubt your concern, but I'm on a phone, k?\n\n1) You are talking about multiple things here: her eating patterns, her weight, her disinterest in listening to you, her wanting to wear daisy dukes, her seeming well adjusted, etc. These may seem like a cohesive pattern of \"wtf is going on with my daughter\"? But it ain't necessarily so.\n\n2) that whole \"wearing stuff like she's daring you to do something.\" Think honestly on whether you would be entertaining that notion if she were thin and adhering to social beauty norms. A lot of people interpret just being fat as \"pushing the envelope\" when, let's face it, people do not generally gain fat to be fashionably risque. If you wouldn't think such things of a thin daughter, then I recommend you drop that attitude like a hot fucking potato. There is nowhere in the western world where your daughter won't know the stigma of obesity, no matter how gentle her friends are. The last person she needs that from is her parents, either overtly or covertly. I would not recommend trying to \"embrace\" obesity--just make sure she knows that her worth to you is not conditional on her size or even what she eats. In any other realm, I would say it's okay to state that you love the person and don't condone their behavior, but that's tricky with obesity because...\n\n3) We really don't know what makes one person fat and another thin. Nutrition scientists just like to pretend they do. There is a lot of evidence pointing to the carbs, especially sugars, as you know. \n\nBut imagine how frustrating it might be if she is eating exactly what her friends eat...and gains weight while they don't. An example from my own life: I eat almost entirely meat and veg. I work out twice a day most days. Think of the folks you know who work out 3 hours a day. I bet a woman weighing 210 lbs is not what comes to mind. \n\n4) Metabolisms vary. Get her to an endocrinologist and make sure she doesn't have any of the usual suspects like PCOS, insulin resistance, hypothyroid, or Cushings. Check her meds, if any--certain antihistamines, psychoactives, and contraceptives make weight skyrocket. Also check C-reactive protein to get an idea of general inflammation, which plays a role in storage of fat.\n\n5) Now how the fuck does one affect change with a teenager. Caveat--I do not have children. However, here are two things that work really really really well with my clients: motivational interviewing (MI) and paradoxical intervention (PI) Also--get her to a counselor IF she is willing.\n\n6a) As a parent, here's what I think will work best: embrace the problem and build rapport. No one wants to hear they're fucking their body up, especially a teenager. Here's my favorite PI: Make plans for a pasta dinner and sit with her and eat that pasta with her. It doesn't have to be every day, but make a point of joining her in that bread eating place once a week. It removes the shame around eating and gives you a foothold in regaining trust. That distaste for her food? I totally get it, but put it in a box in your closet until you talk to your own therapist. As you get to know your daughter who eats pasta, you make it safe for her to consider why she is the daughter who eats pasta. This does not happen overnight. Sometimes it doesn't happen at all. But it is the best way I've seen to get things started.\n\nMI is more complex, but the focus is on removing shame and being with a person whether they are ready to change or not. When I must deal with children, I use this all the time.\n\n6b) Model good eating habits the rest of the time. I don't mean choking down iceberg lettuce and pretending you like it. I mean make dishes that are healthy that you obviously enjoy. When you focus away from what she's doing wrong, it creates the opportunity for her to safely test what you eat without feeling like she's capitulating. Don't \"teach\" her, or she might run off. Let her observe and make judgments for herself. Ditto for exercise. \n\n7) Do some reading if you haven't done so yet. Gary Taubes is good re carbs and sugar. Paul Campos is excellent in the realm of stigma. Also Linda Bacon's health at every size (HAES) as is mentioned by an earlier poster. \n\nKeep in mind that in animal models, given the choice between cocaine and sugar, most rats (who are already demonstrating behaviors in line with cocaine addiction) will drop the cocaine and choose sugar instead. Eating carbs can be extremely addictive both as a behavioral addiction and a substance addiction, so consider the possibility that your daughter feels very out of control.\n\nMuch luck to you. Feel free to PM if I can help further. I so appreciate seeing posts like this. I wish my parents had done the equivalent when I was a fat teenager.\n\nEdit: typos", "edited": 1492468355.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a bunch of things all together.

Take your pick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to be a bit blunt--not because I don&amp;#39;t doubt your concern, but I&amp;#39;m on a phone, k?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) You are talking about multiple things here: her eating patterns, her weight, her disinterest in listening to you, her wanting to wear daisy dukes, her seeming well adjusted, etc. These may seem like a cohesive pattern of &amp;quot;wtf is going on with my daughter&amp;quot;? But it ain&amp;#39;t necessarily so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) that whole &amp;quot;wearing stuff like she&amp;#39;s daring you to do something.&amp;quot; Think honestly on whether you would be entertaining that notion if she were thin and adhering to social beauty norms. A lot of people interpret just being fat as &amp;quot;pushing the envelope&amp;quot; when, let&amp;#39;s face it, people do not generally gain fat to be fashionably risque. If you wouldn&amp;#39;t think such things of a thin daughter, then I recommend you drop that attitude like a hot fucking potato. There is nowhere in the western world where your daughter won&amp;#39;t know the stigma of obesity, no matter how gentle her friends are. The last person she needs that from is her parents, either overtly or covertly. I would not recommend trying to &amp;quot;embrace&amp;quot; obesity--just make sure she knows that her worth to you is not conditional on her size or even what she eats. In any other realm, I would say it&amp;#39;s okay to state that you love the person and don&amp;#39;t condone their behavior, but that&amp;#39;s tricky with obesity because...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) We really don&amp;#39;t know what makes one person fat and another thin. Nutrition scientists just like to pretend they do. There is a lot of evidence pointing to the carbs, especially sugars, as you know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But imagine how frustrating it might be if she is eating exactly what her friends eat...and gains weight while they don&amp;#39;t. An example from my own life: I eat almost entirely meat and veg. I work out twice a day most days. Think of the folks you know who work out 3 hours a day. I bet a woman weighing 210 lbs is not what comes to mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Metabolisms vary. Get her to an endocrinologist and make sure she doesn&amp;#39;t have any of the usual suspects like PCOS, insulin resistance, hypothyroid, or Cushings. Check her meds, if any--certain antihistamines, psychoactives, and contraceptives make weight skyrocket. Also check C-reactive protein to get an idea of general inflammation, which plays a role in storage of fat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Now how the fuck does one affect change with a teenager. Caveat--I do not have children. However, here are two things that work really really really well with my clients: motivational interviewing (MI) and paradoxical intervention (PI) Also--get her to a counselor IF she is willing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6a) As a parent, here&amp;#39;s what I think will work best: embrace the problem and build rapport. No one wants to hear they&amp;#39;re fucking their body up, especially a teenager. Here&amp;#39;s my favorite PI: Make plans for a pasta dinner and sit with her and eat that pasta with her. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be every day, but make a point of joining her in that bread eating place once a week. It removes the shame around eating and gives you a foothold in regaining trust. That distaste for her food? I totally get it, but put it in a box in your closet until you talk to your own therapist. As you get to know your daughter who eats pasta, you make it safe for her to consider why she is the daughter who eats pasta. This does not happen overnight. Sometimes it doesn&amp;#39;t happen at all. But it is the best way I&amp;#39;ve seen to get things started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MI is more complex, but the focus is on removing shame and being with a person whether they are ready to change or not. When I must deal with children, I use this all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6b) Model good eating habits the rest of the time. I don&amp;#39;t mean choking down iceberg lettuce and pretending you like it. I mean make dishes that are healthy that you obviously enjoy. When you focus away from what she&amp;#39;s doing wrong, it creates the opportunity for her to safely test what you eat without feeling like she&amp;#39;s capitulating. Don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;teach&amp;quot; her, or she might run off. Let her observe and make judgments for herself. Ditto for exercise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) Do some reading if you haven&amp;#39;t done so yet. Gary Taubes is good re carbs and sugar. Paul Campos is excellent in the realm of stigma. Also Linda Bacon&amp;#39;s health at every size (HAES) as is mentioned by an earlier poster. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that in animal models, given the choice between cocaine and sugar, most rats (who are already demonstrating behaviors in line with cocaine addiction) will drop the cocaine and choose sugar instead. Eating carbs can be extremely addictive both as a behavioral addiction and a substance addiction, so consider the possibility that your daughter feels very out of control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much luck to you. Feel free to PM if I can help further. I so appreciate seeing posts like this. I wish my parents had done the equivalent when I was a fat teenager.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: typos&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "name": "t1_dge89f6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492496681.0, "created_utc": 1492467881.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ws9i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ws9i", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeb4nk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "troubled_parent", "parent_id": "t1_dge5nji", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xxfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for the reply, Hermione!!

I also think it&amp;#39;s important to talk to her about this from a health standpoint rather than one of aesthetics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other suggestions: try not to buy pasta anymore, because she can&amp;#39;t eat it if it isn&amp;#39;t in the house; make sure that all family food options are healthy...toss out all the sugar, all the junk food and empty fat-soaked calories, and replace them with whole grains and fruits and stuff so that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of you are eating well; give her smoothies made with just fruits and water (don&amp;#39;t load them with yogurt and peanut butter and stuff!); start up a family &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; that involves exercise and drag her along no matter how much she whines; consider putting her back in soccer if it&amp;#39;s been long enough for her to recuperate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, though, she is becoming an adult. There may not be anything you can do. She might have to learn this the hard way. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "name": "t1_dgehrur", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492508776.0, "created_utc": 1492479976.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ws9i", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeixvj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hedonistjew", "parent_id": "t3_65ws9i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xxfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Did taking a break from soccer specifically mean she can't do soccer drills either?\n\nMaybe, since it's been a year and she's been miserable without soccer, you could see about her working with a coach on doing soccer drills so she can get back into playing shape.
