I went to school for sociology/anthropology, and once listened to a very prestigious professor give a lecture on how the Nazi's informed body building. Otherwise, I'm no expert, and so I'm gonna brutalize this, but---\n\nAs Protestantism coupled with the revolution of medicine and increase in life-expectancy, there was created a duty to health, a personal responsibility for one's well being. \n\nConsumer culture and advertisements in the early 20th century began cultivating this new industry, marketing health to everyone. And as the Western world enjoyed an economic boom in the mid-century, there was more leisure time available to pursue this. It opened the door for a \"physical culture,\" even for the working class.\n\nExcept it wasn't just about making sure you were healthy---it became about how you *performed* healthy. It became less about functional or natural movement and more about a visual statement, because, well, capitalism. A famous strongman, in a day and age where physique meant little to comparison to the amusement of their feats of strength, became so good at posing and entertaining the crowd with his flexing that he created the first exercise machines and the first bodybuilding competitions, and profited like a motherfucker, changing the nature of what a strong body would be perceived to be.\n\nIn the early twentieth century there was also a surge in specialized, competitive sports, and there, body building was given room to grow. Once body builders started showing up in motion pictures, popular culture was inundated with them, and a market for the display of a \"masculine\" body and what it conveyed about power blossomed.\n\nThe commenter who mentioned individuality is the closest, I think, to the heart of the matter, as ironic as it is. Exercise that we can all see is indicative symbolically of the force of individuality, which is a powerful concept in the Western world. Everyone is always asking \"Who am I?\" \"Are these pants or those pants more *me?*\" \"Is this what I want to do with my life?\" We have so many choices, and we're always making them, all throughout the day, trying to be faithful to our truest selves. Consumer culture preys on it, creating an environment (of products) for it to endlessly reinvent and reveal itself. Fitness culture just so happens to be intimately entangled in both consumer and identity culture and the morality of hard work. We are constantly consuming bodies, on social media, in magazines and movies.

I went to school for sociology/anthropology, and once listened to a very prestigious professor give a lecture on how the Nazi&amp;#39;s informed body building. Otherwise, I&amp;#39;m no expert, and so I&amp;#39;m gonna brutalize this, but---&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Protestantism coupled with the revolution of medicine and increase in life-expectancy, there was created a duty to health, a personal responsibility for one&amp;#39;s well being. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consumer culture and advertisements in the early 20th century began cultivating this new industry, marketing health to everyone. And as the Western world enjoyed an economic boom in the mid-century, there was more leisure time available to pursue this. It opened the door for a &amp;quot;physical culture,&amp;quot; even for the working class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except it wasn&amp;#39;t just about making sure you were healthy---it became about how you &lt;em&gt;performed&lt;/em&gt; healthy. It became less about functional or natural movement and more about a visual statement, because, well, capitalism. A famous strongman, in a day and age where physique meant little to comparison to the amusement of their feats of strength, became so good at posing and entertaining the crowd with his flexing that he created the first exercise machines and the first bodybuilding competitions, and profited like a motherfucker, changing the nature of what a strong body would be perceived to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the early twentieth century there was also a surge in specialized, competitive sports, and there, body building was given room to grow. Once body builders started showing up in motion pictures, popular culture was inundated with them, and a market for the display of a &amp;quot;masculine&amp;quot; body and what it conveyed about power blossomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The commenter who mentioned individuality is the closest, I think, to the heart of the matter, as ironic as it is. Exercise that we can all see is indicative symbolically of the force of individuality, which is a powerful concept in the Western world. Everyone is always asking &amp;quot;Who am I?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Are these pants or those pants more &lt;em&gt;me?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Is this what I want to do with my life?&amp;quot; We have so many choices, and we&amp;#39;re always making them, all throughout the day, trying to be faithful to our truest selves. Consumer culture preys on it, creating an environment (of products) for it to endlessly reinvent and reveal itself.

This is because, historically, having visible muscle and dark skin meant that you spent all your time working in the fields. Being fat just meant that you weren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;delicate&amp;quot; looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look at Central and South America, the standard is completely different. Primarily, it&amp;#39;s curves. Being slim and having muscles is not necessarily a major part of the standard of beauty, but having big boobs and a big butt is important. I&amp;#39;ve heard my cousins refer to pictures of girls with &amp;quot;thin&amp;quot; legs as having &amp;quot;man legs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for having visible muscle, that&amp;#39;s mostly a standard in North America, Australia, Norway, etc. Typically in places where it&amp;#39;s generally impressive that you have the time and money to put into getting fit or that a woman can be strong and independent physically.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "name": "t1_dgd0adt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492426562.0, "created_utc": 1492397762.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q5a9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcpaqu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "psithyrstes", "parent_id": "t3_65q5a9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xxfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "For me, purely aesthetically and subjectively, it is the shapeliness of it.
