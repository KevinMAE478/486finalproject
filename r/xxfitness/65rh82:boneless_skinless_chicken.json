My go-tos on the grill are: \n- Seasoned with McCormick&amp;#39;s Montreal steak seasoning\n- Grilled and then dip in A1 sauce \n- Marinated in dijon honey mustard sauce\n- Grilled in a kebab (with mushroom, peppers, zucchini, onion, etc) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also do chicken in the crockpot with bbq sauce and then shred it. I eat it like that or put it in bbq chicken salad. I also do teriyaki in the crockpot with pineapple and green pepper. There are also some good simmer sauces out there, too...I love tikka masala and curries. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "name": "t1_dgd0ykx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492427521.0, "created_utc": 1492398721.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rh82", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd15r1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rey_gun", "parent_id": "t3_65rh82", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xxfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Chicken gyros!
