You would literally have to draw labs in the off season, during season, different times of the day, etc. also it would vary from time to time, probably changing each season. \n\nGENERALLY speaking though, during high intensity training our bodies go into 'fight or flight' mode which activates the sympathetic nervous system. The SNS (sympathetic nervous system) focuses the energy of the body on the task at hand and takes energy away from other usual body functions. This includes, increasing cortisol levels, increasing heart rate (during the activity), putting energy into the muscles to complete the task. \n\nEvolutionarily it is used for things like running away from bears. During sports it can and is sustained, allowing for the heightened sense of awareness and ability to do more work and use more energy at peak season. \n\nThen after the season is over you may feel extremely fatigued. That is normal. This is when the body works to return to baseline and rest is necessary to do this. The Parasympathetic Nervous System is responsible for that. \n\nPost season it is important to allow your body to recover. Rest, eat, sleep. A continuous cycle of stressing the SNS with little recovery has pretty terrible outcomes both health wise and athletically. \n\nSo back to SNS- when SNS is more active, cortisol is released. The SNS can also cause a repressed sex drive and reduces sex hormones. This is because the body is in a generally 'stressed' state. It is basically the body saying, \"why reproduce when there is some sort of 'danger' present (remember the evolutionary reason for the SNS activation.)\" In addition there is not enough energy to delegate to the reproductive system.  \n\nThe combination of high activity, lower calorie, and the SNS activation means that there is little, if any, reason for the body to use what energy (calories) it is receiving on reproductive reasons. This includes the loss of menstrual cycle and libido.\n\nYour body may need some more rest. Make sure you are nourishing properly and easing slowly back to activity. \n\nAnyway.

During sports it can and is sustained, allowing for the heightened sense of awareness and ability to do more work and use more energy at peak season. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then after the season is over you may feel extremely fatigued. That is normal. This is when the body works to return to baseline and rest is necessary to do this. The Parasympathetic Nervous System is responsible for that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Post season it is important to allow your body to recover. Rest, eat, sleep. A continuous cycle of stressing the SNS with little recovery has pretty terrible outcomes both health wise and athletically. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So back to SNS- when SNS is more active, cortisol is released. The SNS can also cause a repressed sex drive and reduces sex hormones. This is because the body is in a generally &amp;#39;stressed&amp;#39; state. It is basically the body saying, &amp;quot;why reproduce when there is some sort of &amp;#39;danger&amp;#39; present (remember the evolutionary reason for the SNS activation.)&amp;quot; In addition there is not enough energy to delegate to the reproductive system.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The combination of high activity, lower calorie, and the SNS activation means that there is little, if any, reason for the body to use what energy (calories) it is receiving on reproductive reasons. This includes the loss of menstrual cycle and libido.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your body may need some more rest. Make sure you are nourishing properly and easing slowly back to activity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway.
