I started out running embarrasingly slow at a 15 minute mile and now can do an 10 minute mile and run 5 miles at a 12 minute/mile pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally seeing all the strong women here and in other places is a huge inspiration. This is weird but I love women who are pregnant and still commited to exercise. I also feel especially accomplished when I can run 5 miles or lift heavy stuff on my period. I think there is so much baggage and pressure and societal expectations related to women&amp;#39;s bodies and what we should do or how we should look, and I love defying that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "name": "t1_dgb2jdq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492313979.0, "created_utc": 1492285179.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 59}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jrbz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaz8sn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 52, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BridgetteBane", "parent_id": "t3_65jrbz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xxfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Specific: When you come out of a squat, imagine a piece of newspaper between your feet, and drive your knees outward so that newspaper will tear.\n\nGeneric: The best system is the one you do consistently.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific: When you come out of a squat, imagine a piece of newspaper between your feet, and drive your knees outward so that newspaper will tear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generic: The best system is the one you do consistently.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "name": "t1_dgaz8sn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492309551.0, "created_utc": 1492280751.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 52}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jrbz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jrbz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jrbz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgba1l4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Epoch789", "parent_id": "t1_dgb9oid", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xxfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No thank you.
