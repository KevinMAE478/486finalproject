When I switched to sneakers a half size bigger (and stopped wearing flats that were too small) mine pretty much stopped falling off. However I&amp;#39;ve also moved away from running somewhat and into other kinds of cardio and only run maybe once a week now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My advice would be let it come off naturally if possible. When mine fell off, they actually left a SUPER thin layer of nail so it wasn&amp;#39;t just like an open wound which was nice. They tended to grow back in a few weeks. I could always tell when mine were going to fall off because it was suddenly SUPER thick at the bottom of the nail bed which kind of pushed the rest of the nail off, if that makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "name": "t1_dgbfgh4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492332136.0, "created_utc": 1492303336.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lspr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lspr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeebfu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shandelion", "parent_id": "t1_dgbmg7m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xxfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Because of my allergies I've mostly been running on a flat treadmill, so I don't think it's that :/", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of my allergies I&amp;#39;ve mostly been running on a flat treadmill, so I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s that :/&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "name": "t1_dgeebfu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492504503.0, "created_utc": 1492475703.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbmg7m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mfball", "parent_id": "t3_65lspr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xxfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If it seems like your shoes actually do fit well, it could be from heel slip on downhills making your toes hit the front of the shoe despite a decent fit.
