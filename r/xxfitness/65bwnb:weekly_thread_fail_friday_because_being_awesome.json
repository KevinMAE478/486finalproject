Since you said you're new to working out, it's very common for a person to retain more water once they start using muscles more. This is why it's common for people to actually see the scale move up a bit when they start working out. Yours has remained the same, so you're likely doing fine -some weight+some water. \n\nFor most people, sustainable weight loss will be 0.5-1lb/week, but your weight will fluctuate +/- a few pounds (I see ~3) on a daily and weekly basis depending on when you last ate, when you last pooped, your menstrual cycle, etc etc. So it's not that surprisingly you haven't seen a weight shift yet. Give it another month or so, then reassess. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a fail, it just takes time.
