When I got to uni, I didn&amp;#39;t hold back. If I wanted a pint of ice cream I&amp;#39;d have it. If I wanted a big back of chips, I&amp;#39;d have it. An entire large pizza -- yes. And eat the whole damn thing, every time. It was weird because after a lifetime of EDs, diets, calorie counting, and obsessing over food I was so surprised that I could spend almost 9 months basically eating whatever I wanted. At the same time, though, this wasn&amp;#39;t an &amp;quot;intentional&amp;quot; thing...I wasn&amp;#39;t trying to transform my relationship with food... I was just lazy and found it faster to run down to Sainsbury&amp;#39;s and buy junk then buy a healthy wholesome meal (Note: In all this I actually maintained my weight, because I was doing a lot more exercise in the form of walking to campus). I was also compensating for a lifetime of being deprived of &amp;quot;junk&amp;quot; food by my mother who was very critical of my weight, size, and consumption.  My carelessness, however, did two things: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) First, it &amp;quot;de-fetishised&amp;quot; these foods for me. I grew up in a household where my diet was strictly monitered, so something as menial as a bag of chips or a pint of ice cream was to me so special, so coveted. In eating these foods to my hearts content, they stopped being special. They just became expensive products that&amp;#39;ll set me back several pounds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Once I was able to remove these foods from there pedestal, I could finally realise how shit they made me feel. Ice cream makes my teeth hurt, my tongue hurt, and makes me gassy. As do doughnuts. Also, I noticed that after my spike in sugar levels falls, I get &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; depressed and sad, like sugar withdrawal.

But I&amp;#39;m now definitely more mindful of how these junk foods make me feel (physically) -- and now they&amp;#39;re so much less appealing to me... So now, when I eat large, wholesome, healthy, meals it doesn&amp;#39;t feel like I&amp;#39;m forcing myself to do it, or that the light at the end of my kale and sweet potato tunnel is a guilt free Ben and Jerry&amp;#39;s.
