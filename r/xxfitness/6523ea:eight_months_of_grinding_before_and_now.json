For the first few weeks I just ran on the treadmill (I'm awful at running and hate it, but I did get better at it haha), and did a circuit of the machines in the women's section.  I met my PT and told him I wanted to be strong: he said \"great, we're going to lift and push some real heavy shit.\"\n\nIt took a little while for me to realise that I wanted to be serious, so you're at a good starting point already!  This is just based on my personal experience obviously, but if I were to start again: I'd use cardio as a warm up only, maybe five to 10 minutes (and I'd also just cycle or row, rather than run to save on my knees). Definitely squat! Start with just the bar, or low weight, and get your form right, and add just a little more weight on the last set each time (i.e 5 x 20kgs for four sets, and then try 22.5kg for the last 5. Then next time you squat, do 5 x 22.5kg, and then 1 x 25kg).  \n\nSet yourself actual days too - I used to do a little bit of everything, but now it's more focused like this:\n\nI start every single workout with 10-15 minutes of stretching and foam rolling, no matter what I'm working. \n\nS: core (different kinds of crunches, oblique crunches, planks, etc)\nM: legs/glutes (squats, hip thrusts, leg press, curl, etc)\nT: arms (bench, dips, dumb bell shoulder press, raises)\nW: deadlifts! I recently changed it up so I could get spend a couple hours deadlifting only haha. \nT: rest\nF: legs/glutes: (Bulgarian squats, Romanian deadlifts, hip thrusts, GHR.)\nS: arms/back: (face pulls, single arm rows, bicep curls, lat pull down, preacher curl)\n\nSo try to figure how many days you'll be able to work out per week and focus on one part per day (lower body, upper body, core): even three focussed days will make a big difference over time compared to four or five unfocused days.\n\nSorry this is so much info!

", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aw thank you! I grew up in an awful small country town and didn&amp;#39;t get to see much camaraderie between women until far later than I should have, so I am &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; for lifting each other up - if one sister succeeds personally, it&amp;#39;s great for all of us!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And gosh, wall of text incoming!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I first joined the gym I was very out of shape (not just in appearance but had no stamina or real strength either). For the first few weeks I just ran on the treadmill (I&amp;#39;m awful at running and hate it, but I did get better at it haha), and did a circuit of the machines in the women&amp;#39;s section.  I met my PT and told him I wanted to be strong: he said &amp;quot;great, we&amp;#39;re going to lift and push some real heavy shit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took a little while for me to realise that I wanted to be serious, so you&amp;#39;re at a good starting point already!  This is just based on my personal experience obviously, but if I were to start again: I&amp;#39;d use cardio as a warm up only, maybe five to 10 minutes (and I&amp;#39;d also just cycle or row, rather than run to save on my knees). Definitely squat! Start with just the bar, or low weight, and get your form right, and add just a little more weight on the last set each time (i.e 5 x 20kgs for four sets, and then try 22.5kg for the last 5. Then next time you squat, do 5 x 22.5kg, and then 1 x 25kg).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Set yourself actual days too - I used to do a little bit of everything, but now it&amp;#39;s more focused like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start every single workout with 10-15 minutes of stretching and foam rolling, no matter what I&amp;#39;m working. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;S: core (different kinds of crunches, oblique crunches, planks, etc)\nM: legs/glutes (squats, hip thrusts, leg press, curl, etc)\nT: arms (bench, dips, dumb bell shoulder press, raises)\nW: deadlifts! I recently changed it up so I could get spend a couple hours deadlifting only haha. \nT: rest\nF: legs/glutes: (Bulgarian squats, Romanian deadlifts, hip thrusts, GHR.)\nS: arms/back: (face pulls, single arm rows, bicep curls, lat pull down, preacher curl)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So try to figure how many days you&amp;#39;ll be able to work out per week and focus on one part per day (lower body, upper body, core): even three focussed days will make a big difference over time compared to four or five unfocused days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry this is so much info! Haha I&amp;#39;m just really into it and it&amp;#39;s great to have people to share it with!

I grew up watching my mother constantly diet and struggle with her weight so dieting always had a stigma. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use it in conjunction with MyFitnessPal, to keep track, and it works well to help me decide what I might have for lunch or dinner if I have nothing planned: like I see I still have to try to get to my carb and fat goals, so I&amp;#39;ll eat homemade tortilla chips with chicken, a little melted cheese, a tonne of avocado and spring onions and some Greek yoghurt (essentially nachos :D) and it&amp;#39;s great!  My current macros are pretty crazy: 200g protein, 170g carbs, 80g fat. I&amp;#39;m eating at maintenance at 9000kj, which I rarely actually meet. God bless low sugar chocolate protein shakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "name": "t1_dg8g8dj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492156817.0, "created_utc": 1492128017.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8c2kr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MissMercurial", "parent_id": "t3_6523ea", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xxfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've never heard of IIFYM before and it sounds cool so thanks for that introduction!
