Then I ended up deleting the Before pictures in a moment of frustration, which I still regret.\n\n I only did her workout videos, not her diet advice, and I found I had pretty good results!

I know she'll keep telling you 'it won't hurt if you suck in your stomach', but even when I had definition to my abs... it still hurt after a period of time.\n\n- There were moves I literally could never do, even after ten months of trying. I never improved, and I could never fucking hold them. Eagle abs was one of them. \n\n- I never noticed a difference in my thighs/legs. Even when my arms/abs were improving, my thighs always stayed the same.\n\nOther things that I found curious about Blogilates:\n\n- Cassey NEVER did clamshell moves for your butt. I feel like they're effective, so it was odd she never covered them in her videos.\n- Most of her cardio is not apartment friendly. I understand that it's a lot to ask, but since most of her audience is teens/college/young adults, it's something she should consider.\n- She has a lot of 'no weights, no plank' arm workout videos, but I question their effectiveness. Most of the time I just felt like I was flapping my arms around; I was tired from holding them up, but I didn't feel I was working anything. I *did* get results in my shoulders/arms, but I believe it was from holding planks for so long in her workouts, and doing pushups.\n\nOverall, I think Cassey gets a lot of flack on this site, but I found Blogilates to be a lot harder than people say, and it was effective for me. There aren't many At Home, free videos that plan your workout for you, and she gives you a monthly calendar that's 45 minutes or less. As much as I like the couple at Fitnessblender, I don't want to choose random videos -- I want a schedule so I don't have to think about it. And the Strong Curves at home workout requires equipment I just don't have at home, like sturdy furniture and secure doorframes -- most of my shit is secondhand Ikea, so I'm definitely not working out with it.
