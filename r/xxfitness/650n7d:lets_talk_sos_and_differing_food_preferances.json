That said, if you want to accommodate him, eggs, lentils, nutritional yeast, and Greek yogurt are all good vegetarian sources of protein. I don't do much carbs either, but I will sometimes compromise and mix 2 parts zucchini noodles to one part who grain egg noodle linguini or 2 parts cauliflower rice to one part brown rice or quinoa. In my fianc\u00e9 wants refined carbs, he can make them for himself. I make Korean bowls a lot (galbi sauce protein, rice/cauliflower/quinoa, pickles, sliced fresh vegetables, fried egg), which you could easily make meatless for him.\n\nWe still share grocery bills, but we keep respective supplements separate, and I have way less alcohol so I prefer he gets his own beer.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cook things for me and make the same thing or save leftovers for my fianc\u00e9. I am a good cook, and we both do fairly high protein, so it works that I do most of the fancy dinner cooking. However he eats 1000+ calories more than I do.
