Listen to your joints. Protect your joints. They hurt because something is misaligned or unbalanced or possibly injured. The best person to assess your issues is a physical therapist. They should be able to do an evaluation, check your range of motion, poke and prod, and figure out where to begin.\n\nPersonal experience - I'm often stopped by joints before muscles, and it sucks. It's strange to see myself getting stronger and stronger, but still fail on a basic push-up because my shoulders just don't move comfortably in that direction. When I started doing barbell squats, getting my hands into a position to hold the bar was a strain on the joint. \n\nI have \"dancer knees\" so I've always been hyper aware of my knees, and I find when my trainer throws me on the cardio machines, my knees give out before my body. I find other ways to get cardio.\n\nLower back, too - I thought I had a sciatica flare up, so I did all those stretches you're supposed to do, and I still felt pain in my lower back. I wanted to improve my flexibility, but I'd hit this weird pain and could not even bend forward to touch my toes.\n\nSo I have been there. For the shoulder and lower back issues, I wound up in physical therapy. For my shoulder, I had very tight pecs and I was engaging my traps instead of my lats on lifting. This started a bit of an impingement. I learned how to fix the issue, strengthened the muscles, and can move more easily now. I still do the stretches and shoulder exercises to warm up. I almost always do leg presses upright instead of inclined and make sure to start with a pelvic tilt. \n\nFor the lower back, I also wound up in physical therapy. The issue turned out to be a little bit more of an pelvic alignment problem, but also I had one side weaker than the other. Again, it was stretching, strengthening, and being aware of positions.\n\nFor knees, it's almost always an alignment issue for me. I make conscious effort to push out with my inner thighs when I do squats, which keeps my knees over my toes. Also, practicing with toddler squats with no weight has gotten me better at getting my weight distribution right without hurting my knees. As a dancer, my tendency was to keep my weight on the balls of my feet, which does not work in power lifting. \n\nYou can keep training while you're in physical therapy, but make sure both your therapist knows your workout routine so they can give input.
