Therefore, I&amp;#39;ve seen exactly 0 changes with my body. As much as I want to lift more I just physically can&amp;#39;t. I feel so dang weak even after lifting weights for more than a year!

My form is pretty terrible so after a year of trying to perfect the squat with the barbell I&amp;#39;ve decided to lay off back squats for a while until I strengthen the muscles to get my form right. I believe my problem is that I lean far too forward and my hips shoot up way before the rest of my body. So it&amp;#39;s almost as if I&amp;#39;m doing a good morning in a way.

The first time I started I was at 130s pounds, the second time 140ish, and this time I was at nearly 170, though have dropped to 160 through better diet/no alcohol and still making gains. Either way, my muscle mass was probably the same each time. Both previous attempts, I plateaued at 50 overhead press, 60 bench press, 115 squat, and 110 deadlift, and stayed there for months until I got discouraged and gave up. I did Starting Strength all three times, but when I started to plateau this time around--and with better results!--I switched to Thinner Leaner Stronger, which I started a week ago but have already improved my squat and deadlift. I have learned through trial and error some of the mistakes I made before and figured out things that have helped me. So here is my advice:\n\n1. I was lifting while eating 1200 calories a day, with keto and later IIFYM. ~80 grams of protein was not enough, and neither were my calories. You are probably correct with 100 g, but are also likely to be eating less protein than you think you are if you are not tracking calories and macros.\n\n2. It's not just about eating more protein but when you eat it and what kinds. Especially because you are vegetarian, I would recommend getting a good quality whey protein (I like Designer Whey brand) and maybe some nutritional yeast and try to get other proteins from eggs and yogurt, not just beans and grains, which have way more carbs and arent absorbed the same rate or used the same way as other proteins. \n\n3. Fasted lifting is not for me. Neither is going for high carb low protein pre-gym food. I eat a whey protein, fruit, and yogurt smoothie before going to the gym. I have it with coffee and make sure I stay hydrated. I also make sure that I get some protein in me very quickly after I finish--another whey smoothie or chicken breast or homemade protein brownies or a protein bar if I'm in a rush. This is pretty much my breakfast and lunch, though I eat more on days that I have to go to the gym later in the day. If I get hungry between lunch and dinner, I have a high protein snack--usually some slices of turkey or lox. Despite it seeming like I'm constantly eating, I stay between 1300 and 1400 calories per day, though I won't beat myself up over needing more sometimes or eating under that on non gym days.\n\n3. Consistency is extremely important. As are rest days and getting decent sleep. Alcohol and poor sleep are the worst culprits in bad gym days. \n\n4. I had a number of issues that actually were hindering my progress but not directly related to strength. Small framed ladies like us have small hands. This fucks with grip and therefore form. I'm also much stronger in lower body than upper, so my squats got stalled because I couldn't hold the bar right. I now bring chalk to help with my grip, and I have a cushion that helps me position the bar correctly on my back for squats. I also switched to brand new converse sneakers, which are flat and aren't slippery from outdoor wear. If you can afford squat shoes, that might help with your ankle mobility and form. \n\n5. Warm up properly and wait long enough between working sets. The TLS warm ups are exhausting but help my lifts. I always wait 3 minutes between working sets.\n\n6. Maybe you need supplements, especially as a vegetarian. Not sure where you live, but moving somewhere sunnier seemed to help a lot, possibly in part from the Vitamin D boost. Whey protein would be helpful for hitting protein macros and making sure you have protein in your diet that can be quickly absorbed and put to use. Nutritional yeast is fortified with B vitamins and is high in protein. When I was vegetarian, I got those Bragg's amino acids and seasoned much food with them to make up for various types of amino acid imbalances from a plant-based diet. \n\nFor reference, I got my bench up to 80, my dl up to 150, and my squats to 125 in ~6 weeks--all new personal bests in a much shorter amount of time than the last time I tried lifting--all from being much more vigilant about balancing my diet with my lifting schedule, increasing protein, and modifying programs for my body's strengths and weaknesses. I advise you to up your calories a bit (maybe just 15 percent), track everything, diversify your sources of protein, and see if things get better. Hope this was helpful!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am the same height but much bigger (fatter) than you and am on my third round of trying lifting. The first time I started I was at 130s pounds, the second time 140ish, and this time I was at nearly 170, though have dropped to 160 through better diet/no alcohol and still making gains. Either way, my muscle mass was probably the same each time. Both previous attempts, I plateaued at 50 overhead press, 60 bench press, 115 squat, and 110 deadlift, and stayed there for months until I got discouraged and gave up. I did Starting Strength all three times, but when I started to plateau this time around--and with better results!--I switched to Thinner Leaner Stronger, which I started a week ago but have already improved my squat and deadlift. I have learned through trial and error some of the mistakes I made before and figured out things that have helped me. So here is my advice:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was lifting while eating 1200 calories a day, with keto and later IIFYM. ~80 grams of protein was not enough, and neither were my calories. You are probably correct with 100 g, but are also likely to be eating less protein than you think you are if you are not tracking calories and macros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not just about eating more protein but when you eat it and what kinds. Especially because you are vegetarian, I would recommend getting a good quality whey protein (I like Designer Whey brand) and maybe some nutritional yeast and try to get other proteins from eggs and yogurt, not just beans and grains, which have way more carbs and arent absorbed the same rate or used the same way as other proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasted lifting is not for me. Neither is going for high carb low protein pre-gym food. I eat a whey protein, fruit, and yogurt smoothie before going to the gym. I have it with coffee and make sure I stay hydrated. I also make sure that I get some protein in me very quickly after I finish--another whey smoothie or chicken breast or homemade protein brownies or a protein bar if I&amp;#39;m in a rush. This is pretty much my breakfast and lunch, though I eat more on days that I have to go to the gym later in the day. If I get hungry between lunch and dinner, I have a high protein snack--usually some slices of turkey or lox. Despite it seeming like I&amp;#39;m constantly eating, I stay between 1300 and 1400 calories per day, though I won&amp;#39;t beat myself up over needing more sometimes or eating under that on non gym days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistency is extremely important. As are rest days and getting decent sleep. Alcohol and poor sleep are the worst culprits in bad gym days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a number of issues that actually were hindering my progress but not directly related to strength.
