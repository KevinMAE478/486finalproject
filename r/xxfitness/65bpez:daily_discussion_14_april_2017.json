I've been cutting for just under five weeks and I currently hate my life. I'm a healthy weight, just looking to drop from what I estimated was 28% BF to 22%.\n\nFor the next 7 weeks (hopefully sooner), I have to deal with this stupid cutting crap. Let's start with the TDEE calculator. It's great in theory but incredibly frustrating in actual use. Last week it said my TDEE was 2700 calories and that to get to my goal by my goal date, I can eat 1900 cals a day. Cool, so I increase this weeks to 1900 a day and all of a sudden my TDEE has dropped to 2300 and now I can only eat 1700 cals a day so my weight isn't going down. All this despite the fact that I am *significantly* more active this week. Makes no sense. From now on though, I'm just sticking with 1700, no more changes. If it ends up being too little, oh well I'll just have a more miserable but slightly faster cut.\n\nThen there's this stupid period thing. I started birth control so I didn't have to put up with this. I haven't gotten one in months and I think it's fucking with my water retention. (I do recognize it's probably a contributor to the TDEE spreadsheet problem, but it's still really frustrating). It's also miserable. I hate it.\n\nThen there sodium! Why is there so much salt in everything?! I can barely keep my diet under the MAX \"healthy\" limit of 2300 let alone get it below the AHA recommendation of 1500. Then to top that all off if I want to enjoy myself on the weekends I end up eating twice as much sodium as I have all week which causes bloating which throws my weekly average off and also my measurements (I take measurements on Sunday, the day after I usually eat out..that was bad planning). I'm always right around my calorie goal so I know it's not actual weight but UUUGGGHHH.\n\nAlso water intake. I drink a 12 oz coffee in the morning with breakfast and then strive for 2 liters throughout the rest of the day. That's not a lot of water if you really think about it but I'm just genuinely not that thirsty! Any less than 2 liters though and I can almost immediately see an uptick in my weight from water retention. \n\nI absolutely loathe calorie counting. Once I start, I'm all in. I'm practically obsessive about every bite I eat. If I can't track it, I will not eat it. Period. My poor husband wants to go to all these places that don't have nutrition information and I won't go with him because in my mind I can't eat it. We had a work BBQ recently and the only thing I ate was mini brownies because it was the only thing I could track. I've been to cookouts every weekend for the past couple weeks and while everyone around me is eating and having a great time, I'm sitting there starving because I can't track what they're eating. I will eat anything...as long as there is a calorie count attached to it. It's especially aggravating because I'm not at all like this when I'm not cutting. I'll eat whatever I want, care only mildly about calories, and just monitor my weight weekly. But cutting season? Oh no, it's game over for spontaneity.\n\nThen there's the lack of progress in the gym. My entire goal is to get stupid strong and that's next to impossible on a cut. I know strength training is important on a cut and luckily I haven't lost any strength but it still feels like every workout is a waste of time. They're so difficult and tiring. I'm following the progression of the program but i don't actually feel any progression. I was pretty stoked to test my maxes after this block was over but I highly doubt I made any decent progress because of this dumb cut. \n\nI think I'm done now. Thanks for reading. Hope your days are going better than mine.\n\nEdit: Also! I would kill to get a dexa scan but i I can't find one for the life of me.
