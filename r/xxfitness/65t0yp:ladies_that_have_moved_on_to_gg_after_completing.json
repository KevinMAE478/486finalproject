GG has a lot of low rep exercises (3x5 squats and deadlift for example) and I&amp;#39;m finding this to not feel as hard on my muscles. I feel like it doesn&amp;#39;t fatigue them as well and that I&amp;#39;m not getting that same workout feeling. I know a lot of programs push high weight lower reps (ie SL). Just wondering if you guys still saw progress doing this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) I&amp;#39;m running ABAC. For weeks 1-4, that means I&amp;#39;m doing barbell hips thrusts once, single leg hip thrust (ugh) once, and barbell glute bridge twice. This seems like a step back as the end of BB had me doing some sort of hip thrust for all 4 exercises and glute bridges don&amp;#39;t do as much for the glutes according to Bret. Is there a reason for that? Is GG the next step after BB or is it an entirely different program which might mean you are taking some steps backward?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) I have seen results from BB. If you&amp;#39;ve done GG after, did you seem comparable progress/results? Do you regret doing it? Would you have rather have done another program? I hear great things about thinner leaner stronger. But I&amp;#39;ve also heard that having a whole chest day and doing such a 5 day split is kind of useless because you&amp;#39;re not hitting your muscles enough (once a week). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tldr: Not loving GG, but saw great results and has fun with BB, should I stick to it or switch programs?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI finished up BB last week and I've done 2 GG workouts.
