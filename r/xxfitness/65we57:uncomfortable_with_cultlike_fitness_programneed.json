I sympathize with the desire not to lose out on the fees you will have lost, but if I were in your shoes, I would not only never return to this class, but would also e-mail or message at least one, if not all, of the instructors, stating that I just wanted to work out in peace not form an entirely new social group, that I wouldn&amp;#39;t be returning because I did not want to be involved in all of this, and specifically requesting that they not contact me again. I would also block all of the people involved on any social media (which I am not on anyway because I find it all entirely too invasive). It may come across as harsh, but they do need to be told in no uncertain terms that while this approach may be working for some, it is patently offensive to others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "xxfitness", "name": "t1_dgdtwon", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492480126.0, "created_utc": 1492451326.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 70}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65we57", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryzy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65we57", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge1n2l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CanadianKC", "parent_id": "t1_dge0wt0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/xxfitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ouch!  $99/mth??
