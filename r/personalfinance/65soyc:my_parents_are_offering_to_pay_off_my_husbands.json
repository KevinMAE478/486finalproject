It&amp;#39;s not worth your time to make a deal with them if you have the same rate.  2 reasons:  1. Stafford and some other loans are life insured by the federal government, so if the lendee dies before it&amp;#39;s paid off, the debt is cleared for the estate.  2. You can deduct the interest you pay from your federal taxes if you have a student loan from a bank, you can&amp;#39;t take the deduction if you have a repayment plan with the parents.  Just like any other business transaction, don&amp;#39;t enter into it if it does not benefit you.  The parents requiring you to make the same payments and terms as the original loan is a bad deal for you because of the above reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dgcwobh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492421541.0, "created_utc": 1492392741.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcwg2q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pfthrowaway30", "parent_id": "t1_dgcwefn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ask my parents for a lower rate?
