One in February, one in April, one in June, one in August, one in October, and one in December. It's a strategy called a ladder. Each is for $500 and at Capital One (formerly ING) they are currently offered at 1.30% APY. The basic savings rate there is currently 0.75%. Every other month one comes due and rolls over to a new rate. The (current) oldest one is the June CD, which is earning 0.75% because that was the rate in June 2016. In an environment where rates are moving, the ladder strategy allows one to keep some money at the best rate, and also take advantage of the better rates offered on longer term CDs (12 mo pay better than 6 mo), while also having money available in the short-term because they come due at a regular pace. These CDs obviously paid off better when I first bought them years ago at 4+% interest, but, when the recession hit at least I had locked in the 4% for an extra many months while the rate kept dropping to 2% then even down to near 0.5%. For a while, during the start of the recession, the CD rate was *lower* than the savings rate. It would still have been smart to buy a CD then, because savings rates eventually fell even further before the CD would have expired. For example, the savings rate may have been 3.75%, but the 12-month CD rate was only 3.5%. However, that rate is guaranteed over the 12 months. By the time it would have expired, the savings rate had dropped to 2% and kept falling.\n\nIt's also better to break up the money into multiple smaller CDs because of the potential penalty if an emergency comes up. A bank may charge 3 months interest as a penalty for breaking the CD early. If it's all in one $3000 CD, but I only need $1000, I'd have to pay the penalty on the percentage of the whole $3000 to access what I needed. By having the money in smaller chunks, I'd only have to break two $500 CDs, and pay the penalty on the percentage of $1000, cutting the fee by two thirds. \n\nGenerally, in most cases, the interest offered on a CD is independent of the size of a CD, so $1000 in one CD earning 1% is the same as $10 in one hundred CDs at 1%. At least at CapOne. I just chose $500 as a manageable amount. \n\nAs CD rates are rising, I'm thinking of increasing my ladder to another six CDs so I'd have one roll over every month. Once rates seem to be at a \"top\", or stop rising, I might start converting them to 24 month CDs so I can lock in an even better rate for a longer period of time, while still keeping the monthly/bi-monthly pace at which I can take the money out without penalty if needed.\n\nI'm also watching how fast rates go up. It's almost at the point where it's worth paying the penalty on the lowest-rate CD (3 months of interest at the low rate) just to immediately roll it over into a higher-rate CD. If rates suddenly 'pop' up higher, the interest earned at the better rate would probably pay for the penalty of breaking the old rate CD early. At this point, I think I'd only make 50 cents on the deal for breaking a 0.75% CD early to put the money in a 1.30% CD.
