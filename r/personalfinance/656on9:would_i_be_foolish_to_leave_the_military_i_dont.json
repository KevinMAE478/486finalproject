Redone here:\n\nIt's a bit tricky to answer to answer because you're both (1) making a lot and (2) have the two biggest budget-busters covered for you (housing and healthcare). Let's say for argument's sake that you decide on government employment in the DC area. I picked this because this is not an uncommon decision for former military officers (you yourself just mentioned the possibility of federal employment above) and because all of the financial information is readily available online. Only you know what you want and what kind of job you may be capable of getting. I'm just going to illustrate how even a similar or larger paycheck won't go anywhere near as far as you may imagine.\n\nIF you manage to come in at a GS-13 (which honestly, if your entire education/ work experience is undergrad plus 5 years in the military, probably won't get you there, but you'd possibly have a chance but ONLY because of your veterans' status....), you'd be looking at about [$95k](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/pdf/2017/DCB.pdf). From that, you'd have taxes, healthcare, retirement (both mandatory and optional) taken out. \n\nI put you as living in Virginia (least taxes in the area) and on the [Virginia Aetna HDHP](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/plan-information/premiums/2017/nonpostal-hmo.pdf) at $140/mo and on a standard dental plan at $30/mo. Your healthcare deductible is $1500 and your dental deductible is $100 (so you should contribute at least $130/mo to a Health Savings Account, which I'll take from your paycheck). Your post-tax mandatory pension contribution is 4.4%, and I put your traditional (not Roth) TSP at 5% to get the match (but this is the bare minimum advisable-- you really, really should do 10% or more, especially if you haven't been contributing yet). \n\nAnd about that pension. It\u2019s not half as generous as the military\u2019s (literally. It basically boils down to either 1% or 1.1% depending on age and how long  you\u2019ve worked of the average of your highest three annual salaries times years in service). In other words, If you work for 25 years, you will get 25%, maybe 27.5% of your high three average whereas now if you work 17 more years, you get 50% of... your highest? Last? I would link to the site that explains the federal pension, but it is out of date (it shows certain types of employees eligible for 1.7% of high three but that has been phased out for at least some types, and I\u2019m not sure if it has been for all) so I consider that site suspect to the point I wouldn\u2019t rely on it. It is **possible** that some classes of employee still get 1.7% of the high three which means (**if** this still exists) that you need to work 30 years to get 50% of your high three average. None of this is a bad deal, mind and the only people you'll hear complain about it don't know what they're talking about. But it's still a far cry from the military pension (and rightfully so).\n\nAll of that will leave you with $4700/mo (I used Paycheck City to calculate that-- 2 allowances). Then you've got to pay rent in the DC area. Let's call that $2000. This is obviously where you\u2019ve got the most choice but this is a reasonable ballpark if you want to live alone. Can be had for less generally (there are $1500 one-bedrooms inside the Beltway if you\u2019re not too picky about neighborhood and don\u2019t need to be near transit, significantly less if you share, but also can be much, much more, obviously). Utilities a further $200. Just looked it up\u2014BAH for an O02 here is $2200 so heh, let's just stick with it and you can adjust as you like.\n\nYou've now got $2500/month where you currently have $4600 soon to be $5200 (that is your take-home minus your $1500 soon to be $900 in rent/utilities). And in this scenario, you\u2019re saving the bare minimum for retirement and nothing for emergencies/ travel/ down payment. If you want to maximize TSP at $1500/month your after taxes/retirement/healthcare/rent/utilities total is $1800/month. Totally doable because that's all discretionary. People\u2014whole families\u2014live on that or much less all the time (but note the lack of car insurance/ car payment in these calculations!).  It\u2019s just a really different set of circumstances than what you\u2019ve gotten used to and does not leave a ton of room for savings for fun things.\n\n\nNow, you may not move to the DC area. I just picked it because I'm familiar with it and it does seem to not be an uncommon spot for folks in your situation to land (also, if you\u2019re talking federal employment in not-DC, the salary is different. OPM works on locality pay). But the overall math stands. You are almost definitely making more now than you will outside of the military (that GS-13 is in no way a done deal especially the way federal employment is going these days) and you've got the two biggest budget items covered and a pension that kicks in sooner and pays more than anything you\u2019ll see outside (that\u2019s if you even find an employer with a pension because those are a rare breed these days. Federal may even do away with it in favor of a plan that has a higher TSP match. I looked for the article but can\u2019t find it, sorry).\n\nNone of this is any reason to say you shouldn\u2019t leave. You absolutely should do what is best for your long term goals, and if your long term goals are not the military, then you should spend the next 2 years getting yourself in financial shape and frame of mind for a major change. Just be sure you\u2019re realistic on HOW major of a change that will be, so that you can get yourself in that frame of mind.\n\n*Edit: made the pension thing clearer. I forgot the \"times years in service\" part*\n\n*Edit 2: Yay math typos in a math-heavy post. You've got $4600 after tax/retirement/rent/healthcare now.

Utilities a further $200. Just looked it up\u2014BAH for an O02 here is $2200 so heh, let&amp;#39;s just stick with it and you can adjust as you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve now got $2500/month where you currently have $4600 soon to be $5200 (that is your take-home minus your $1500 soon to be $900 in rent/utilities). And in this scenario, you\u2019re saving the bare minimum for retirement and nothing for emergencies/ travel/ down payment. If you want to maximize TSP at $1500/month your after taxes/retirement/healthcare/rent/utilities total is $1800/month. Totally doable because that&amp;#39;s all discretionary. People\u2014whole families\u2014live on that or much less all the time (but note the lack of car insurance/ car payment in these calculations!).  It\u2019s just a really different set of circumstances than what you\u2019ve gotten used to and does not leave a ton of room for savings for fun things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, you may not move to the DC area. I just picked it because I&amp;#39;m familiar with it and it does seem to not be an uncommon spot for folks in your situation to land (also, if you\u2019re talking federal employment in not-DC, the salary is different. OPM works on locality pay). But the overall math stands. You are almost definitely making more now than you will outside of the military (that GS-13 is in no way a done deal especially the way federal employment is going these days) and you&amp;#39;ve got the two biggest budget items covered and a pension that kicks in sooner and pays more than anything you\u2019ll see outside (that\u2019s if you even find an employer with a pension because those are a rare breed these days. Federal may even do away with it in favor of a plan that has a higher TSP match. I looked for the article but can\u2019t find it, sorry).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of this is any reason to say you shouldn\u2019t leave. You absolutely should do what is best for your long term goals, and if your long term goals are not the military, then you should spend the next 2 years getting yourself in financial shape and frame of mind for a major change. Just be sure you\u2019re realistic on HOW major of a change that will be, so that you can get yourself in that frame of mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: made the pension thing clearer. I forgot the &amp;quot;times years in service&amp;quot; part&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 2: Yay math typos in a math-heavy post. You&amp;#39;ve got $4600 after tax/retirement/rent/healthcare now. You will soon have $5200&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg822nj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492139611.0, "created_utc": 1492110811.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg80bf9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CoastieKid", "parent_id": "t1_dg7zvq8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The BAH is included in this figure.

I was lucky in that I was still in the 15% tax bracket from 2016 (with standard deduction &amp;amp; exemption).  But I&amp;#39;ll probably still sit in the 25% tax bracket this year with standard deduction and exemption.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on Traditional vs Roth 401(k)s?
