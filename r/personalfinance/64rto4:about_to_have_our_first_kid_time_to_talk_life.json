And since we both make very good salaries, the idea was to base insurance on the amounts owed for a mortgage, student loans, and what it might cost to send the kids to college. This led us to purchase a term policies of about $500k each. This is much less than 10x our salaries, but would ensure that a surviving spouse had no debt and that the kids college funds were topped up. In fact, given that we have since paid off the student loans, it is likely more than we need. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would suggest that you haven&amp;#39;t truly laughed unless you have had a 14 year old threaten to &amp;quot;Menendez you so hard&amp;quot; for teasing him about his wardrobe at the dinner table. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg60var", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492039845.0, "created_utc": 1492011045.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5feyk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "guiltyandstupid", "parent_id": "t1_dg534px", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh my gosh, that is quite possibly the dumbest and most paranoid way to think ever.

That's a potential gain of .21% a year on your investment. That's less than a savings account which has no risk. This has a very real risk as it only pays out if you live.
