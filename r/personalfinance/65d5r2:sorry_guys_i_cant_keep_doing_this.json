Your personal finance is for you and your wife to work out amongst yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I&amp;#39;ve witnessed, I think that sometimes we glaze over the reality that our lifestyles cost us more than just our income.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time is finite. It is a non-renewable resource, and for some hard-working individuals, we realize too far down the line that we have made investments with our time and/or energy that yield excellent financial stability, but we are in relational debt up to our chins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is this: emotional investment, time, memories, and relationships with the people we provide for financially, may cost us more than we realize. My wife enjoys the benefits of financial stability, but if the only things I have in my portfolio are &amp;quot;kick ass at my job&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;make sure we&amp;#39;ll have income when we&amp;#39;re 65&amp;quot; then I&amp;#39;m doing a shitty job of investing in her, and I&amp;#39;m not fulfilling the job requirements I signed up for on our wedding day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you already see that you don&amp;#39;t want to put your goals of parenting, and settling down on the side burner any more, then that&amp;#39;s awesome! You&amp;#39;re disciplined enough to knock out most of your debt in a relatively short amount of time; go celebrate! You set goals with your love and you guys did it, together! I hope you know that what you&amp;#39;ve already accomplished is worth being &amp;quot;shout from the rooftops&amp;quot; kind of proud over. Be as proud of yourself as you are when the people you love most do incredible things! Also, be proud of yourself for being aware of your family enough to see that there&amp;#39;s more to living a life worth living than being debt-free. Still make that a goal, because you don&amp;#39;t want that debt forever, but give yourself some wiggle room to make memories. Time and energy are every bit as much of a resource to be responsibly managed as our finances. Keep it up, sir.

Sell it once you get the chance if you're unsure about your company's stability and/or if you don't want to learn about stocks, and you will earn the percent discounted off the top.

If you become skilled in this, you could SAVE a significant amount of money by beating the realtors at their game, spotting things that need to be repaired before closing and getting the current owners to cover all that. Don't cheap out on the home inspection or feel pressured by the realtor to bid before you're ready. But, do realize that the tens of thousands of dollars that you save with learning to negotiate well means that you can shave that many weeks off for earlier retirement. Same concept applies for other big ticket expenses, like preparing to become parents--you can save a lot of money if you research tips in advance to avoid falling for things you don't need.\n\nHope this helps!

For example, if your company offers you a 10% discount on their stock, and you sell it immediately when they let you, you make 10% off the top. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check to see what other benefits your workplace offers. Not sure if your workplace has a complimentary/discounted gym and massage service. Companies like Google offer also offer their employees 1/2 off movie tickets at the local Cinemark and AMC theaters, discounted concert tickets, a board game library, and 2 free beers on tap (BYO growler to fill up and bring home).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can use your free time to read up on how to best negotiate buying a home, what red flags to look for and questions to ask about each home (get some free books from the library and google/reddit search, etc.). If you become skilled in this, you could SAVE a significant amount of money by beating the realtors at their game, spotting things that need to be repaired before closing and getting the current owners to cover all that. Don&amp;#39;t cheap out on the home inspection or feel pressured by the realtor to bid before you&amp;#39;re ready. But, do realize that the tens of thousands of dollars that you save with learning to negotiate well means that you can shave that many weeks off for earlier retirement. Same concept applies for other big ticket expenses, like preparing to become parents--you can save a lot of money if you research tips in advance to avoid falling for things you don&amp;#39;t need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps! Best of luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dga1ve5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492246943.0, "created_utc": 1492218143.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9cj7v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 22, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MLAlternate", "parent_id": "t1_dg9apq8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you.

Even for seasoned home buyers, it's expensive.  There are so many what if's.  Right now if you are living in an apartment or a rental home and your roof leaks, your landlord deals with it.  Bust pipe?  Landlord.  Water heater decides do the fuck you dance at 4 am on a Federal holiday?  Landlord has to deal with it.\n\nThe water heater gives you the middle finger at 4 am on a Sunday, neighbor's tree branch decides to bust your office window 2 weeks later, 2 months later the pipes freeze and busts the pipes in the kitchen sink and 6 days later you discover a hornets nest in the attic?  If you are renting, your land lord deals with that shit.  You own your own home well....now you gotta figure out who to call and how to pay for it.  I've seen that kind of stuff happen here on reddit-so much has come up trying to fix the house they can't make the car payment, light bill or water bill.  Savings is blown, credit cards are blown.\n\nFar too many times I've read here stories about how \u201cI grew up poor.  I'm tired of not owning my own home.  I'm tired of driving a piece of shit car held together by super glue and twigs.  I'm tired of not having nice things.  I'm tired of not having a nice vacation.  I'm tired of xxx because I grew up poor/my parents were cheap bastards and never did that sort of thing &lt;insert reason why you must have xxxxx items&gt;\u201d and the next thing they know, they are deeper in debt than ever before.

Yes, you guys may be making 80 or 90 grand a year right now....but what if?  What if the wife gets in a car accident.  Shit hits the fan and she can't work and you guys have massive medical bills and life goes spiraling out of control?  Seen that happen as well.  What if you and your business partner have a falling out and you are forced out of the company?  What if things are great for the next 5 years work wise than out of the blue shit happens and company goes under, gets bought out, partner leaves, business takes a free fall and profits drop to record low numbers?  Just...what if??  \n\nCan you handle a house payment, a car payment, kids, student loans, medical issues?\n\nAll of that may happen.  None of it may happen.  \n\nI get it.  I do.

Not only will you now have greater peace of mind and sanity, but you will have a more solid financial foundation and see real progress toward a secure financial future. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg9ptxa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492231181.0, "created_utc": 1492202381.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d5r2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9srye", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "randallphoto", "parent_id": "t3_65d5r2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I probably would have made the same decision.
