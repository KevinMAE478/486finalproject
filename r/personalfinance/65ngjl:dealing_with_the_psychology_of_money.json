I didn\u2019t grow poor. I mean we weren\u2019t wealthy but we were comfortable, so I never really had to worry about money growing up. However, when I graduated from college and moved out on my own for the first time in a new city with a new job stress about money definitely started weighing on me as I wrestled with whether or not I would be able to support myself. However, after about a year when it was clear that I would be ok given that I was able to consistently put away more savings that concern morphed more into what should I do with this savings? Should I spend more? But I don\u2019t want to spend frivolously. And I don\u2019t want to overspend? Should I give more?... What really helped me get over this fear was to start journalling about what my priorities were in life. This really help me clarify what I want to accomplish and that what I should use my money and how I should invest it for that goal. Because at the end of the day money is just a tool. One that can help you to be financially stable at first and then once that stability is established it's merely a tool for you to accomplish your goals whatever they might be. But again for me I had to first know what my goals were before I could decide how to use money to achieve them. Below were the journal questions that helped me get started:\n\n1. First, focus on the financial area of your life. What is your annual income? What does your cash flow look like? How much money do you have in savings and investments? What is your total net worth?\n\nNext\u2026what does your home look like? Where is it located? Does it have a view? What kind of yard and landscaping does it have? Is there a pool or a stable for horses? What color are the walls? What does the furniture look like? Are there paintings hanging in the rooms? What do they look like? Walk through your perfect house, filling in all of the details.\n\nAt this point, don\u2019t worry about how you\u2019ll get that house. Don\u2019t sabotage yourself by saying, \u201cI can\u2019t live in Malibu because I don\u2019t make enough money.\u201d Once you give your mind\u2019s eye the picture, your mind will solve the \u201cnot enough money\u201d challenge.\n\nNext visualize what kind of car you are driving and any other important possessions your finances have provided.\n\n2. Next, visualize your ideal job or career. \u00a0Where are you working? \u00a0What are you doing? With whom are you working? What kind of clients or customers do you have? What is your compensation like? \u00a0Is it your own business?\n\n3. Then, focus on your free time, your recreation time. \u00a0What are you doing with your family and friends in the free time you\u2019ve created for yourself? \u00a0What hobbies are you pursuing? \u00a0What kinds of vacations do you take? \u00a0What do you do for fun?\n\n4. Next, what is your ideal vision of your body and your physical health? \u00a0Are you free of all disease? \u00a0How long do you live to? \u00a0Are you open, relaxed, in an ecstatic state of bliss all day long? \u00a0Are you full of vitality? \u00a0Are you flexible as well as strong? \u00a0Do you exercise, eat good food, and drink lots of water?\n\n5. Then move on to your ideal vision of your relationships with your friends and family. \u00a0What is your relationship with your family like? \u00a0Who are your friends? What is the quality of your relationships with your friends? \u00a0What do those friendships feel like? \u00a0Are they loving, supportive, empowering? \u00a0What kinds of things do you do together?\n\n6. What about the personal arena of your life? \u00a0Do you see yourself going back to school, getting training, attending workshops, seeking therapy for a past hurt, or growing spiritually? \u00a0Do you meditate or go on spiritual retreats with your church? \u00a0Do you want to learn to play and instrument or write your autobiography? \u00a0Do you want to run a marathon or take an art class? \u00a0Do you want to travel to other countries?\n\n7. Finally, focus on the community you live in, the community you\u2019ve chosen. \u00a0What does it look like when it is operating perfectly? \u00a0What kinds of community activities take place there? \u00a0What about your charitable work? \u00a0What do you do to help others and make a difference? \u00a0How often do you participate in these activities? \u00a0Who are you helping?\n\nHope this helps!
