These factors can be mitigated by owning the house for a long period of time, but that means you should be committed to staying in the area for a while before jumping into home ownership.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg6388u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492042417.0, "created_utc": 1492013617.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg61yty", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "throwingnumbers1", "parent_id": "t1_dg5k9vd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I guess the way I saw it is that with a mortgage I'm investing in a home that I can resell whereas rent is a black hole with no return.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess the way I saw it is that with a mortgage I&amp;#39;m investing in a home that I can resell whereas rent is a black hole with no return.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg61yty", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492041054.0, "created_utc": 1492012254.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5k9vd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Arrch", "parent_id": "t1_dg56uu3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; My main concern is that if I'm paying rent I'm throwing away half my income for the month\n\nAs opposed to throwing away almost half your income towards interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance and probably PMI?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My main concern is that if I&amp;#39;m paying rent I&amp;#39;m throwing away half my income for the month&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As opposed to throwing away almost half your income towards interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance and probably PMI?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg5k9vd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492006889.0, "created_utc": 1491978089.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ur4h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5728d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pcbzelephant", "parent_id": "t1_dg56uu3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can you stay at your parents for a bit and stop saving and throw all your money to your student loans and car.

I am sure some are, but most people make mistakes, overspend sometimes or get into what are obviously stupid financial situations in retrospect.    \n\n&gt; I don't need that much money just sitting \n\n* In my opinion, the only money that should be \"sitting\" is your emergency fund.  So some of it should just be in an Ally or other high yield savings (which means 1% right now, haha) basically doing nothing -- there for emergencies.  This should be 3-6 months of expenses depending on personal choice, stability of job and safety net (e.g., it sounds like you could move back in with your parents easily in a pinch).  Other than that, get that money working for you -- paying down debt, or accruing gains retirement, or going on a vacation, or buying an XBox, or whatever the hell you want.  You just need to make sure you aren't screwing yourself over later.  **Time** is the most important aspect of retirement planning, and if you are late 20s, I am sorry to say you are a bit behind if you don't have a fair amount saved for retirement (and you've missed a long bull market that has been going for several years). Very simply, if your money doubles every 10 years (which is a pretty solid return, something like 7.5% over the long run), the 4th double, that is at 40 years invested is HUGE, because it has already doubled 3 times.  $5,000 --&gt; $10,000 --&gt; $20,000 --&gt; $40,000 **--&gt; $80,000!** That 4th double is larger than all the other ones combined.  If you start at age 22, the 4th double is at age 62 and you probably have even more time for gains before you retire (e.g., if you retire at 67).  If you start at 32, the 4th double is at age 72, likely after you are retired and are drawing money from your retirement accounts to live making the 4th double smaller as well.  This is a very simplified example, it is definitely more complex than this.  Obviously, we don't have time machines or we would all be billionaires, the point is, get started!\n\nHere is how I would prioritize:\n\n* Pay off the credit card debt by December no matter what -- this shouldn't be hard because you have the money right now, sitting in a savings account doing nothing -- but this could screw you over pretty bad depending on the terms.  Better not to have to deal with it and just make sure you aren't carrying credit card debt.\n\n* Determine if your loans are fixed or variable interest, this could be different per loan.  Your car insurance does seem high to me, but insurance costs are highly variable by state, age, car, etc.\n\n* Immediately pay off the 5.7% and 5.3% student loans, unless your car loan is at a higher percentage.  How much is left on your car loan, and what is the interest rate?\n\n* Make a plan for housing, and establish a budget for after you move out.  Say you're going to spend $1250 a month on housing, then see how it feels to live at home NOT having that money.  Put it toward whatever loan is the highest interest rate, or invest in in a IRA.  Your big loan is pretty low interest, and if it is a fixed rate, I personally wouldn't try super hard to pay it off early, Id rather invest that while you are still quasi-young.\n\n* If you've never lived away from home, it is a big step to owning your own place and renting out the rooms. It seems like in your area you could have zero housing costs if you could get into the right place, but that probably won't change if you rent an apartment for 6-12 months.  Are you planning on staying in this area long term?  To sort of hedge, I would plan to live with a roommate for 6-12 months and see what it is like.  If renting appears to be \"slightly\" more expensive, it may actually not be.  There are big expenses that come with owning a house or condo, but they are different.  Usually condo association dues will cover large capital expenditures (e.g., new roof, new water heater) but you still pay into the association.  For houses, it is all up to you.  If you move in and your furnace immediately dies, you need to buy a new one.  Many people don't factor this into their budget when buying houses.  They just assume their mortgage + taxes + insurance is everything.  Nope!\n\n* Think about your personal and financial goals.  Are you going to get more schooling? Are you thinking of getting married or in a long term relationship? Do you want kids?  All of these things drastically change your financial plan, but none of them are impossible to plan for.  People flit through life never having a plan for anything, so simply thinking about it, making some kind of plan and trying to execute -- knowing that plans are very prone to change -- puts you ahead of the game.
