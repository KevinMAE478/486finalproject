Sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders and are the best shot this kiddo has at a stable future. I hope it works out for you! One thing I don't think anyone has addressed (probably because this is not a CPS page) is that your age might be a barrier. The state I worked for (MO) did not allow adoptions under the age of 21. We DID allow something called a \"kinship\" placement, though; this is where you would provide all the care for the child, but he would still technically be \"in\" foster care. This would go on until you are 21. At that point, assuming everything is going smoothly, you would be able to adopt him. \n\nIs this kid located in another state? It is a pretty long and annoying process to get an ICPC (interstate) placement arranged. It IS worthwhile - but you should definitely know it can take several months!\n\nIs this child recently in foster care? The first priority of any foster care case is to reunite with the family member they come in from. So, if he was removed from his mother's care, she would be given at minimum a year to go through counceling, drug treatment, parenting classes, etc to try to get him back. The courts REALLY don't like removing a kid very far from a parent who is working to get custody again, because they want to provide every opportunity for the relationship to be salvaged. So, if this is a new case, they are probably not anywhere close to looking for an adoptive home. It could be a year or more before they are, and during that time, the kiddo will need a place to stay that's in driving distance from mom.\n\nRegarding adoption by family. There is a legal requirement for the family to give priority first to any other parent (is the dad in the picture? Do they know who dad is?), then to any interested grandparent. Another family member would not be considered unless these other people were not options. In many families, this is an all-out battle to the death. So it is important that everyone is on the same page. \n\nFinally... When the child's case goal turns from \"reunify with mom\" to \"find an adoptive home\" (again, usually a year or longer into an open foster care case), the first people the worker will look at are the people the child has lived with during the case. If there was a family member the child lived with, they'll get priority. If there was no family nearby and the kid lived in a foster home, it's not a clear cut answer. Your best bet to get custody is to stay involved in the case all the way through. Attend the court hearings if you're able. Attend all \"family support meetings\" (where everyone is brought up to date on the case). Call to check in with the caseworker and make sure you know what's going on. Be a support resource for the kid (calling them up, getting to know them, providing them with clothing/toys/hygiene supplies/etc to show that you are willing and able to support them). Those things go a LONG way in your favor when it comes to the \"adoption staffing.\" The adoption staffing is a big meeting that the case worker, juvenile officer, Guardian Ad Litem (the child's appointed attorney), and even parents/grandparents participate in where potential adoptive resources (yourself, a foster parent who cared for the child, another relative, whoever) are officially interviewed for adoption and the participants choose who is the best possible caregiver for this child. Like I said earlier, family IS given preference, but it's more important that the kiddo feels comfortable with the person and that they are going to provide a stable home. So like, \"cousin I don't know very well\" might be lower on the totem pole than \"foster parent who's cared for me for the last year\" at that point. That relationship you build, and the support you provide, and your participation in the length of the case, those are the things that will tip the decision in your favor. But even then - age discrimination does play a factor. Many people will look at your age and think you can't do it. Your ability to show that you are stable and reliable are very important.
