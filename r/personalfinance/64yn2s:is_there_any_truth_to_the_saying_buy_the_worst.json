And then it becomes a money pit to just get it back to being operational.

Renting a room in my buddy&amp;#39;s trailer has definitely taught me how to manage and prioritize living arrangements, and has changed my mind on some of the things I thought were a &amp;quot;must&amp;quot; for a house.  I ended up realizing that I could manage with a lot less than I thought, and that my biggest needs in a living space were space (seriously, my buddy&amp;#39;s trailer was &lt;em&gt;cluttered&lt;/em&gt; af), the ability to sort and organize that space, security, and access to good utilities including internet.  As long as my house is roomy, uncluttered, secure, and I have a good connection to the internet, I&amp;#39;mma be happy.  I can keep the outside looking decent, but the inside is the biggest battle, and it&amp;#39;s a lot easier when you have space.  So my house shopping has focused on square footage and use of space, whereas before, I was focused on questions like &amp;quot;How new is the fridge?  Does it have a big lawn (I don&amp;#39;t even &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; a lawn, I just wanted one for silly reasons), does it have lots of fancy windows and arches and stuff, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg6fvhp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492055387.0, "created_utc": 1492026587.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6dqeg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 36, "report_reasons": null, "author": "abqrick", "parent_id": "t1_dg6asa3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Worrying about what others think is a recipe for misery.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worrying about what others think is a recipe for misery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg6dqeg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492053187.0, "created_utc": 1492024387.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6asa3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 86, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fouxfighter", "parent_id": "t1_dg5zy6l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would add one more to your list..\n4) How emotionally secure are you?\n\nSeeing all your neighbours having better housing, better things, better quality of life in general takes an emotional toll that not everybody can handle...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would add one more to your list..\n4) How emotionally secure are you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing all your neighbours having better housing, better things, better quality of life in general takes an emotional toll that not everybody can handle...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg6asa3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492050157.0, "created_utc": 1492021357.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 86}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yn2s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6d02w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rhiaaryx", "parent_id": "t1_dg5zy6l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "One correction to the walls thing: unless it's plaster and lathe.

There's really nothing you can do to it that would make it worth more. We will assume that it appreciates at the same rate that all other comps do in the neighborhood. We'll be conservative and peg the appreciation at 4% per year so that in 5 years, the house has appreciated 20%. In 5 years, the house is now worth 480K as is all other houses in the neighborhood. (sidebar - this is not how the market actually works, but let's make it simple)\n\nIt's worth some more money, but once you take out the closing costs (let's assume 4% on the buyer's side and 6% on the seller's side - remove all other extra purchases needed for moving). Let's assume you put 20% down. That's 96K out of pocket (down payment+closing) during the purchase and then another 29K for closing costs on the sell. In 5 years, your mortgage amount is going to be about 290K given a standard interest rate and no extra payments. That means\n\n**450K (final check amount after closing costs) - 290K = 160K back in your pocket. Given that you put in about 96K up front, you gained about 64K in equity. Not bad!**\n\nHouse B is purchased at 325K. It needs some work and you have to put in some remodels. Some of it are purchased renovations and some of it is sweat equity (doing the renovation yourself). Let's say you put in 50K of work into it. Your final all in number is 375k and you have the house the way you want it and comparable to the neighborhood.\n\n325K at 20%+closing is 78K out of pocket for the purchase + 50K remodel for a total of 128K. Let's say that the house is now comparable to House A and sells the same amount as House A at 480K. The difference is that with your purchase price at 325K, your remaining mortgage balance is now at 235K. Let's do the math.\n\n**450K (final check amount after closing costs) - 235K = 245K back in your pocket. Given that you put in 128K of your own into the house, you gained about 117K in equity. That's a lot more!**\n\nNow, there are a lot of assumptions in this, but I just wanted to give you the picture of why you want the \"worst house\" in the neighborhood instead of the best one. That doesn't take into consideration lower monthly payments from buying a 325K house instead of a 400K house, lower property taxes for the most part since the appraisal will come in lower, and the house the way you want in instead of accepting however the house was sold to you.\n\nIt's not easy though.\n\nYour remodel costs can quickly spiral out of control. A house that might just have little problems on the surface could suddenly have huge problems (sewer line broken, mold, cracked foundation, replaced roof). Those are pretty much non-negotiable items in terms of replacement and will completely screw over your remodel budget. Unpermitted work from the previous owner most likely will need to be permitted and if you have a county inspector that doesn't think it's up to code, you're going to have to tear it all down and try again. There's going to be a lot of personal stress in the makeover and emotional stress if you have an SO. Lots of fights over stupid things like the handles on the cabinets or what color the door frames should be. It sounds little, but it's pretty hard on a relationship.\n\nYou want to make sure your \"worst house\" can be renovated to be comparable to the other houses in the neighborhood. No use in buying a 3/2 with 1100 square feet when it will never sell as much as the 3/2 with 1600 square feet. No point in buying a house that's below market when your renovation budget will exceed the comparables in the neighborhood.\n\nIf you want a short summary to ease your mind or sell it to your SO (the harder part), here you go:\n\n* You will have more equity if you buy the \"worst house\" in the neighborhood and renovate it to make it comparable to the rest of the houses\n* Your monthly payments will also be lower (lower mortgage payment and lower property taxes) and you will have less invested overall (depending on if you have the cash on hand or credit for the remodel)\n* Be mindful of your remodel budget. Don't buy the worst house if the foundation is cracked and the roof needs replaced. You will never be able to recoup your investment\n* Prepare yourself for the stress and hardships of a remodel. It's very taxing to be doing constant work on your house. Most people will still be working while this remodel is going on and it can exhaust you quickly. Always over budget and over estimate how much time it will take.\n* Make sure the house you buy can be fixed up to the rest of the houses in the neighborhood.", "edited": 1492011472.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general thought is that you get the most equity out of buying the worst house in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider two case examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;House A is purchased at 400K and is a perfect remodel and the comparables are equal to the neighborhood. There&amp;#39;s really nothing you can do to it that would make it worth more. We will assume that it appreciates at the same rate that all other comps do in the neighborhood. We&amp;#39;ll be conservative and peg the appreciation at 4% per year so that in 5 years, the house has appreciated 20%. In 5 years, the house is now worth 480K as is all other houses in the neighborhood. (sidebar - this is not how the market actually works, but let&amp;#39;s make it simple)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth some more money, but once you take out the closing costs (let&amp;#39;s assume 4% on the buyer&amp;#39;s side and 6% on the seller&amp;#39;s side - remove all other extra purchases needed for moving). Let&amp;#39;s assume you put 20% down. That&amp;#39;s 96K out of pocket (down payment+closing) during the purchase and then another 29K for closing costs on the sell. In 5 years, your mortgage amount is going to be about 290K given a standard interest rate and no extra payments. That means&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;450K (final check amount after closing costs) - 290K = 160K back in your pocket. Given that you put in about 96K up front, you gained about 64K in equity. Not bad!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;House B is purchased at 325K. It needs some work and you have to put in some remodels. Some of it are purchased renovations and some of it is sweat equity (doing the renovation yourself). Let&amp;#39;s say you put in 50K of work into it. Your final all in number is 375k and you have the house the way you want it and comparable to the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;325K at 20%+closing is 78K out of pocket for the purchase + 50K remodel for a total of 128K. Let&amp;#39;s say that the house is now comparable to House A and sells the same amount as House A at 480K. The difference is that with your purchase price at 325K, your remaining mortgage balance is now at 235K. Let&amp;#39;s do the math.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;450K (final check amount after closing costs) - 235K = 245K back in your pocket. Given that you put in 128K of your own into the house, you gained about 117K in equity. That&amp;#39;s a lot more!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, there are a lot of assumptions in this, but I just wanted to give you the picture of why you want the &amp;quot;worst house&amp;quot; in the neighborhood instead of the best one. That doesn&amp;#39;t take into consideration lower monthly payments from buying a 325K house instead of a 400K house, lower property taxes for the most part since the appraisal will come in lower, and the house the way you want in instead of accepting however the house was sold to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not easy though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your remodel costs can quickly spiral out of control. A house that might just have little problems on the surface could suddenly have huge problems (sewer line broken, mold, cracked foundation, replaced roof). Those are pretty much non-negotiable items in terms of replacement and will completely screw over your remodel budget.
