Do things step by step in order of importance or, depending on your pain level, do things in the order of what areas cause you pain. Do not let your doctor railroad into doing things in an order that doesn't work for you, but keep in mind that once you start something (like your root canal) make sure you do every step in s timely manner.\n\nRoot Canals can come in a variety of steps, the minimum would be 3. It can go up to 5 to 6 steps depending on the exact amount of work that need so be prepared that it will take time.\n\nIf you need help paying for your work ask your dentist if they accept Care Credit, Wells Fargo Health Advantage and Lending Club. Care Credit and the Wells Fargo card are basically like credit cards, but they have different interest rates and, depending on your office, will have different payment dates. Wells Fargo goes up to 24 months (at least that's what we accept in our office). Lending Club is more like a personal loan. The best part about these options is that if you pay it off on time, then you won't have to pay interest. If you fail to pay it off on time then the interest will starts from the original amount (for Care Credit and Wells Fargo) or will start at the remaining amount (Lending Club). For all of these options you will pay your dental office up front and select the plan that determines how long you have to pay off the amount (the time depends on the agreement your dental office makes with the vender on what the time limit will be). They are worth looking into.\n\nHowever, if you make $20,000 and you need $10,000 worth of work, odds are they won't give you the full $10,000. They will either decline your request (which I've rarely seen happen) or they will tell you what they will allow you to have. You can also sign with a co-signer which could greatly help your chances of being accepted, but if you decide to do that make sure the card is in YOUR name as primary. If it's not, the dental office won't be able to accept the payment unless the person whose name is on the card is there to sign some forms the day you intend to pay, especially with Care Credit (the rules towards the dental office are strict).\n\nI agree that getting work done at a clinic or a dental school is a good way to go if you are worried about your finances. Make sure to take a copy of your x-rays with you if you decide to get work done at one of those two places if you choose not to go to your dentist for this work.\n\nEdit/Update: Also, look into some dental insurance if you can afford it or if your job provides it for you. PPO plans are the best since they allow you to go to any office, but if you have a DMO or HMO plan, you'll have to find an office that accept that that plan. Paying for your own insurance is tricky. Most self-pay plans don't cover much or they have ridiculous waiting periods. One of them will make a wait a year after your diagnosis before covering any amount of treatment. \n\nFrom here on I'm speaking as someone who is working in a Delaware office. If you're under 21 you would be eligible for Medicaid and that should cover a high portion of your bill. If you're over 21, look into United Health Care Health Options. There are two types of Health Options. The first will only cover and exam, cleaning and x-ray one time a year and the second will cover an exam, x-ray, cleaning and give you $1,000 worth of treatment.
