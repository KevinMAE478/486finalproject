After a few months of large extra payments, I just happened to check how they applied the last few auto-debits and they conveniently adjusted it so there was almost nothing going towards the high-interest one and almost everything going towards the lowest-interest one. Did it for 2 months before I caught it and demanded they change it and to know why. They made up some reasoning that didn&amp;#39;t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg4h7fs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491955969.0, "created_utc": 1491927169.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64r458", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64r458", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64r458", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg56ayg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "franchyze922", "parent_id": "t1_dg55vfo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ok, thanks for the reply.
