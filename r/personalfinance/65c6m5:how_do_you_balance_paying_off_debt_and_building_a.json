There are a few reasons why we are doing it this way.\n\n1) Emotionally, it doesn't feel like it's really \"our\" money, if we actually owe it elsewhere. I'm an accountant and spend a lot of time working on financial statements, so I think of our finances in terms of the balance sheet. Our net worth is equal to what we own, less what we owe. So if we have $10K in the bank but owe $25K to Sallie Mae, our net worth isn't $10K...it's *negative $15K.* Simply put, that $10K isn't really \"ours\"...it's owed to another party. **It just happens to be sitting in our bank account for the time being.**\n\nThis came home to us in very real terms a number of years ago, while we were making payments on an old debt that my ex had allowed to go to collections (and legally still had my name attached to it, even though it was assigned to him in the divorce). So yes...I was on the hook for it, like it or not. The balance of the debt was about $4K at the time. We were in the middle of an expensive move and job change, and had socked away about $4K in our bank account to help with the transition. Then, in the middle of the stress of the move, we missed one payment. One. The collection agency immediately went to court, got a judgment against us, and deducted the $4K directly from our bank account. One minute we had money...the next we didn't. Our entire savings account, gone, just like that.\n\nWhen we got over the shock, it became clear to us...when you're in debt, your money isn't really yours. That $4K in our savings account could legally become the property of the collection agency, because even though we had \"possession\" of it, it was owed to someone else. \n\n2) We find we're much more effective when we focus on one thing at a time. It also helps that we're a little \"uncomfortable;\" we both would like a bigger emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses), but we find that discomfort useful, because the more nervous we are, the more urgency we'll feel about paying off that debt!\n\n3) The old question that works in so many situations: *\"If I hadn't done it, would I do it?\"* Say we had a credit card with a $0 balance, and $0 in the bank. Would we run out and take out $5K on the credit card, so that we could put that $5K in our savings account? Of course we wouldn't. No way on earth. We'd just buckle down and save our money going forward. But that is exactly what we ARE doing, if we pile up $5K in savings while allowing our credit card balance to remain at $5K. It is exactly the same thing.\n\nSo yeah, there seems little point to us in stocking up a huge pile of cash instead of paying off our debt, when we know for certain that once that pile of cash equaled the amount of debt we have, we'd immediately write a check to pay off our debt. If, for example, we have an extra $1000 a month in the budget. We could, in theory, save $500 a month and send $500 a month to Sallie Mae. But what's the point, when the MINUTE our Sallie Mae debt becomes equal to our savings account balance (say, $5000 left on the student loan debt, and $5000 in the bank), we're simply going to write a check to pay off the debt, bringing both balances down to $0. We may as well have sent the whole $1000 monthly to Sallie Mae from the beginning...it amounts to the same thing.\n\nI do think it's important to have SOME emergency fund, because life is going to throw curveballs, and within reason it's best to be able to pay for them with cash instead of going further into debt for them.
