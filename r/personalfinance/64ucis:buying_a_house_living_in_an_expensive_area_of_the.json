The first house we put an offer in we actually did go over asking for a house that was smaller then what we wanted (a lot smaller) and they did not given get back to us since there were 10 offers higher then ours. So we decided to regroup and we started looking at houses that had either been on the market for awhile, needed major work or had the first sale fall apart. The house we ended up buying was one that needed major work. The previous people had way to many people living in the house. It was not full blown hoarder level but it was close. There were dirty dishes in every room of the house and the garage looked like it was holding at least twice what the space was designed to hold. There had been a rat problem that they had addressed prior to listing the house (so no live ones) but there was still clean to be done. The attic had no insulation (had to be removed for the rats) and there were electrical, plumbing, termite and flooring issues. The second bathroom need to be gutted to address on the leaks (the tub leaked, the sink, 4 separate pipes as well as mixing copper and galvanized pipe.) The house was priced lower then any other house in the neighborhood. We still went in under their asking price. They ended up meeting us in the middle and we were under contract. After the house inspection found a few more problems they came down in price some more. In the end I think we ended up getting the house for close to 100k under what market should have been if it was not a hot mess. The main part of the reno took us close to 4 months. The first month we rented a dumpster and just worked on demo every single day. It was super tiring work. We had to rip out the carpet and then in places like the kitchen 4 different levels of flooring since they had just keep adding one on top of the other. After the demo was done we did the flooring. (I would have liked to paint first but if you are super accommodating to contractors timelines they cut you a deal, so we took saving money over ideal timing. We did not feel comfortable doing the flooring ourselves since the house had some leveling issues we wanted fixed). After the flooring was done we focused on the master bath. It only had two real problems. The toilet was semi broken (and gross) and the vanity was broken. The shower, while dated was really nice and kinda cool and retro. We installed the toilet ourselves and bought an untopped vanity at Lowe's. We went to a marble store to see how much it would be to get marble for the top of it since the vanity was sooooo tiny. There was a couple there who had bought a HUGE slab to do there backyard kitchen and they overheard us asking if the company sold such tiny pieces so they said we could have their scrap which was more then what we needed. So we got free marble and just had to pay to get it cut to size. After that we moved into a very very unfinished house to save money since paying both a rent and mortgage is a special kind of awful. We hired an electrician and plumber for the stuff we were not comfortable doing but we tried to tackle as much as we could. We checked out a ton of home improvement books from the library and watched so many how to you tube videos. There are still a million little projects to do but man I LOVE this house. I also know so much more. I can fix drywall, rewire an outlet, sweat copper pipes, and most contractors are super willing to help you learn the basic parts of their trade. The plumber was always happy to check on our work, same with everyone else.
