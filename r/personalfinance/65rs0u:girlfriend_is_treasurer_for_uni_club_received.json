This is a professor who is responsible for overseeing club activities and ensuring there isnt anything fishy going on, she also needs to tell the club president that she doesn&amp;#39;t appreciate being misinformed and misled for the presidents personal gain and will be reporting him to the student government, as well as the dean in charge of club conduct. If the scholarship was meant for the club, it would have been awarded to the club as a whole with the treasurers name on it as well with something along the lines of: payable to (club name)&amp;#39;s treasurer (gfs name). Or would have just listed the clubs name and the school would have received it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please tell her that as a past president this is 100% not ok for the person to do and that if she doesnt report him, he will continue to do this to others, or even advise future presidents/officers that they can get away with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dgd4ja2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492433232.0, "created_utc": 1492404432.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 92}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rs0u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rs0u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rs0u", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdb5mf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Autodidact420", "parent_id": "t1_dgd8vo7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Or she's just popular \n\nUndergrad politics isn't exactly about being competent lol", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or she&amp;#39;s just popular &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Undergrad politics isn&amp;#39;t exactly about being competent lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dgdb5mf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492450122.0, "created_utc": 1492421322.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd8vo7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "The_Philosochef", "parent_id": "t1_dgd5ii9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I assumed that as well.

This is likely enough to scare the president if she is doing something wrong, and rumors might start, drama could ensue.\n\nYour GF should contact the office that awarded the scholarship right away to ensure it is for her specifically, and not for the club as a whole. You already know this, but getting it in writing is key. She can even share the situation that the president is trying to absorb the award for the club, and that will get a strong response from them that would restore any lost reputation or ill feelings in the club from rumors or remarks made by the pres about your GF. If by some miracle the president is right, then your GF still done nothing wrong just by checking. Plus any honest person wouldn't make a stink about it to start with. However, I don't think she's honest. The problem is probably bigger than just this scholarship.\n\nThe basic fact of the matter is that in every organization that there needs to be more than one person aware of every financial change that is happening. Every member will see this is true. That means it goes always through the account and can be monitored by the treasurer, president, and faculty mentor. Obviously, things need to be agreed upon for spending in whatever procedures there are (vote, discussion, etc.), but no money should go into or out of the account without at least these three people being able to verify it. \n\nThat's the biggest problem with the organization as I see it. Have your GF find and speak to the faculty mentor for the organization about a) who has access to the account, b) if he or she has records of the account's activity, and c) how she can go about getting added onto the account. \n\nIf he or she tries to strongarm or mislead her, she needs to speak to whoever is in charge of student organizations as a whole on campus. Just remember the organization should have ZERO expenses that are done outside the bank account, that's the tipoff to me. The president may indeed buy a plaque, but will pocket the rest of the money. The school may have given money for the plaque also, and she can get the full $250. \n\nTL;DR: That money belongs to your girlfriend unless she hears otherwise from the scholarship office.

This is likely enough to scare the president if she is doing something wrong, and rumors might start, drama could ensue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your GF should contact the office that awarded the scholarship right away to ensure it is for her specifically, and not for the club as a whole. You already know this, but getting it in writing is key. She can even share the situation that the president is trying to absorb the award for the club, and that will get a strong response from them that would restore any lost reputation or ill feelings in the club from rumors or remarks made by the pres about your GF. If by some miracle the president is right, then your GF still done nothing wrong just by checking. Plus any honest person wouldn&amp;#39;t make a stink about it to start with. However, I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;s honest. The problem is probably bigger than just this scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The basic fact of the matter is that in every organization that there needs to be more than one person aware of every financial change that is happening. Every member will see this is true. That means it goes always through the account and can be monitored by the treasurer, president, and faculty mentor. Obviously, things need to be agreed upon for spending in whatever procedures there are (vote, discussion, etc.), but no money should go into or out of the account without at least these three people being able to verify it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the biggest problem with the organization as I see it. Have your GF find and speak to the faculty mentor for the organization about a) who has access to the account, b) if he or she has records of the account&amp;#39;s activity, and c) how she can go about getting added onto the account. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he or she tries to strongarm or mislead her, she needs to speak to whoever is in charge of student organizations as a whole on campus. Just remember the organization should have ZERO expenses that are done outside the bank account, that&amp;#39;s the tipoff to me. The president may indeed buy a plaque, but will pocket the rest of the money. The school may have given money for the plaque also, and she can get the full $250. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: That money belongs to your girlfriend unless she hears otherwise from the scholarship office. And she needs to be added onto the account regardless with the help of the faculty mentor. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dgd90w4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492443062.0, "created_utc": 1492414262.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rs0u", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcp083", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 32, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TarotFox", "parent_id": "t3_65rs0u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is sketchy.
