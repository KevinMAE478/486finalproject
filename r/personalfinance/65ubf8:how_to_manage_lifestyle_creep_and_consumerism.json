So for the things you want to buy, make a list and prioritize.  There&amp;#39;s something to be said about completely owning a reliable car, so maybe buy a new one last.  New couch? New TV? Sure, go for one.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, don&amp;#39;t do it all at once.  Maybe buy one new thing each month.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a difference between buy a new TV because you&amp;#39;ve got a 5 year old 1080p 36&amp;quot; TV and you want a new 60&amp;quot; 4k TV and replacing your 1 year old 60&amp;quot; 4k TV with a brand new ULTRA HD 8k 62&amp;quot; TV just because you can.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really in to board games and video games, and one thing I do to control my spending is to constantly ask myself &amp;quot;When will I play this?  Who will I play this with?  Will it provide a different experience than the other games I have?&amp;quot;  and assess whether I&amp;#39;m going to spend the money or not from there.  Also, I bought a house within the past year, and while we have empty rooms and need furniture, etc... we don&amp;#39;t have to do it all at once.  So, like the other things we want to buy, we assess and prioritize and take it one day at a time.    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dgdiquj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492467032.0, "created_utc": 1492438232.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ubf8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ubf8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ubf8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ubf8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdivlc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "salt_water_swimming", "parent_id": "t1_dgdhgri", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;I don't see the point in living a bare bones frugal lifestyle now just so I can continue to live a bare bones frugal lifestyle for the rest of my life\n\nAgain, no one is suggesting this. \n\nThe point of early retirement isn't to just walk away from earning money.

We actually have a couple different savings accounts, for different long-term goals, and partition out our savings each month by %. So if we are saving $1000 this month, $500 might build up our emergency fund (50%), $250 goes into the car repair/replacement account (25%), $100 of it goes to the \"Christmas\" fund (10%), the rest, $150 (or 15%), is left to save toward that new couch or other major purchase we're working towards. \n\nWe find this helpful for three reasons - first, because it motivates us to save more. If we want that new item faster, the only way is to pump up ALL our savings this month, because the new purchase gets a percentage of overall savings.
