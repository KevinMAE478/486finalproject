If you can do basic cabling, know how to make a loopback plug and what it's for, and understand some basic [subnetting](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html) and networking, you're more capable than half of the field techs I deal with on a daily basis and ready for \"smart-hands\" (physically rack-n-stack and make connections to assist remote engineers) contract work at any of a number of shops.\n\nSo, you read some configuration manuals at cisco.com and that stuff is not for you? Consider a two year degree at your local community college. Tuition is cheap enough that you could probably afford the monthly payments with your current income, but definitely fill out the [FAFSA](https://fafsa.ed.gov/) to see what you qualify for first. Two years from now you could be earning $30/hr or more with a nursing degree.\n\nMore school isn't your bag? Look into the trades (plumbing, carpentry, HVAC, electrical).

Your money is better spent on getting a cheap router, switch, and wireless access point off Ebay to practice with at home. Subscribe to &lt;a href=\"/r/Cisco\"&gt;/r/Cisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/r/ccna\"&gt;/r/ccna&lt;/a&gt;, etc and ask questions. Learn how to crimp an Ethernet cable and punch down a &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/66_block\"&gt;66-Block&lt;/a&gt;. If you can do basic cabling, know how to make a loopback plug and what it&amp;#39;s for, and understand some basic &lt;a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html\"&gt;subnetting&lt;/a&gt; and networking, you&amp;#39;re more capable than half of the field techs I deal with on a daily basis and ready for &amp;quot;smart-hands&amp;quot; (physically rack-n-stack and make connections to assist remote engineers) contract work at any of a number of shops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, you read some configuration manuals at cisco.com and that stuff is not for you? Consider a two year degree at your local community college. Tuition is cheap enough that you could probably afford the monthly payments with your current income, but definitely fill out the &lt;a href=\"https://fafsa.ed.gov/\"&gt;FAFSA&lt;/a&gt; to see what you qualify for first. Two years from now you could be earning $30/hr or more with a nursing degree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More school isn&amp;#39;t your bag? Look into the trades (plumbing, carpentry, HVAC, electrical). You can make a lot of money as an electrician, for instance. Get a job as an apprentice, pulling wire, fetching tools, cleaning up. Learn skills and study for the certification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg48mop", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491945763.0, "created_utc": 1491916963.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 61}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pabj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pabj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pabj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pabj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pabj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg48bfn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 25, "report_reasons": null, "author": "madkowdzs", "parent_id": "t1_dg487xo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Gotcha.

Look through jobs on places like LinkedIn, monster.com, indeed.com, etc. Look at entry level and temp/contract jobs you think you'd enjoy and look at the requirements for the job. That'll give you an idea of where you'll need to work on your education. Keep in mind requirements is a pretty loose term for most places so if you don't meet it 100% you may still get it. If you want to get into IT support. Start with A+ and research best practices for diagnosing problems and different technologies that go into making a system work. You may find it leads you to a different sector of IT that you may enjoy. Udemy.com has some sales on A+ classes today that you may grab as well if you want something not so self lead. They are like $10 right now but they seem to have sales all the time so don't spend the $200 it usually goes for. They have some others too if you're interested in networking or ITSEC.
