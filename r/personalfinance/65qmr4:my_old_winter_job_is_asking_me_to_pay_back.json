This means if you did 10 appointments and made $100 in commission, you would be paid the minimum of $170 instead of the commission. However, if you made $250 in commission then you would be paid that instead of the minimum of $170. It is an either or scenario.\n\n- If an item or set is returned then the commission warned from that sale will be deducted from your next paycheck or requested in the form of a check if you no longer work for them. This was the case with my $200 returned commission and I had to write a check.\n\n- However, if that returned commission would place you below the minimum pay then it gets a little more complicated. Let's say you made $250 in commission on 10 appointments but had a return for a homemaker set that accounts for $150 of that. Now your pay for that week has to be recalculated because you've only made $100 in commission and would be owed the minimum of $170 instead of the commission. So really, you owe $80 instead of $150.\n\nReally, this should have been explained to you and it sucks that it wasn't. I know Vector can be a little high pressure since the  branch manager makes commission on all your sales too, but it's an easy product to sell and they pay really well if you stick around. I got up to 35% commission before I left and was making almost $1500 a week working only the hours I wanted to. I don't work for them anymore obviously, but I believe in the product and have more than $2000 worth of cutlery from them that I won in sales competitions.
