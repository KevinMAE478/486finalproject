If you think it costs you more to continue having citizenship and paying taxes, you can request to renounce your citizenship, pay a one time hefty tax where the taxation system looks at ALL your worldly goods, possessions, earnings, etc, and taxes it as such. However, this can mean that your account is cleared, nothing is owed, and you are free to leave, and can re-enter the country at any time as a citizen of your actual resident country. This is fair and reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly coming into a whole heap of money, deciding that you will not pay the tax on it, trying to get rid of your citizenship before the tax obligations for this money are due, and then saying, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not part of your country anymore, you can&amp;#39;t touch me,&amp;quot; is the bad idea. That&amp;#39;s when the IRS says, &amp;quot;We want our share. Or you can&amp;#39;t come in.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the tax avoidance thing that people are cautioning the OP against. There&amp;#39;s a difference between finding a legitimate method to not pay a tax within the law (such as a contractor saying, &amp;quot;I earned $20,000 dollars this year but had to buy $1000 dollars of equipment to make this business, so you can only tax me on $19k of earnings&amp;quot;), up to and including relinquishing all the elements of citizenship, and trying to avoid paying by lying, obscuring the truth, or committing acts which mean the OP intends to prevent the IRS having their share.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg4b9p4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491949240.0, "created_utc": 1491920440.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4aodo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ottomottomun", "parent_id": "t1_dg49xww", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "isnt he sort of trying to avoid a tax though?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;isnt he sort of trying to avoid a tax though?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg4aodo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491948496.0, "created_utc": 1491919696.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg49xww", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "budlejari", "parent_id": "t1_dg48o4w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, he can enter again, if Homeland Security determine that he didn't give up his citizenship to defraud the government of taxes.
