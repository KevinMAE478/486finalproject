Its a place to park your car to sleep or set up a tent so you can stretch out and focus on your next move. Look for a higher paying job or side jobs. Get a couple of 5 gallon water bottles fill up at gas stations and you could set up a sun shower maybe a hula hoop and a shower curtain and rings if youre shy hang it up so you can shower outside and feel private at your campsite. Stand on a rubber mat dig a lil trench for the water to wisk away so youre not standing in mud. Use a laundromat when you must. Save as much money as you can for an apt. deposit or wait for your tax return. Keep your head up look for opportunities and anyone that rents places that could hook you up. These are just ideas to get by when you dont want to spend any cash other than food.
