They might not be able to help you with things as they did earlier because they have a test or project do that is really important. Try talking to a librarian if your kid&amp;#39;s school isn&amp;#39;t good.

There's lots of examples here that fall into this too; read to him, do homework with him, go to his little league.

And your story is proof of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Kids don&amp;#39;t do well in school if they&amp;#39;re worried about if they&amp;#39;re gonna eat tonight, or if their dad/mom&amp;#39;s boyfriend is going to get drunk and start a fight at home. Your mom worked as hard as she could to make sure you had a stable home situation, if you can do the same for your kid then you&amp;#39;re ahead of a surprising (and depressing) number of parents and kids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Kids care about what their parents care about. Successful parents can make it clear to their kids by lesson and example that things like education, following the rules, working hard, and knowing your shit matter. There&amp;#39;s lots of examples here that fall into this too; read to him, do homework with him, go to his little league. If you care about them, so will they. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can provide stability and engage yourself and them in good activities they&amp;#39;ll have a better lot in life than you.
