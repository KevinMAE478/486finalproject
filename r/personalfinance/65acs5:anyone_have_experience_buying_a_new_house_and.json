That's $15,600 a year in rental revenue.\n\nYour current expense is $1,100/month. Let's factor in common 1% of property value for maintenance/repair. So that's $1,600 a year in cost. If you do go with a property manager, fees varies from 4-10%, but lets say its 5% a month of rent for lower cost area like Montana ($65/month or $780 a year). You're now looking at a total expense $15,580.\n\n**Rental income:**\n\n$15,600/year\n\n**Expense:**\n\n* $13,200/year (mortgage/insurance/tax)\n* $1,600/year (maintenance/repair)\n* $780/year (property management)\n\n$15,580/year.\n\n**Cash flow:** $20 a year :)\n\nSo you're barely making any money on the rental. You can save money by playing landlord which can be a time sink with added stress (filtering tenants when you have little experience can often be difficult). Repair and maintenance is probably going to be a little lower since its a newish home - but again, better to budget for it than be cash flow negative later.\n\nAnyways this is perfectly fine if you want to keep the property and simply let it break-even (and eventually own the home mortgage free) - but for many people the numbers probably won't qualify it as an investment opporutnity given the cashflow is nil. Yes the home value has appreciated, but you certainly don't buy into investment properties banking on appreciation.\n\nI'm not sure how much you still owe on the home, but based on your income you can probably still qualify for a new home at 350k - that's something you should discuss with a mortgage officer/broker to run the math on (and no, you won't be able to leverage the rental income into your new home loan given its basically breaking even in expense).\n\nI personally failed at being a landlord after trying for awhile, and these days we just pay a flat rate property management company for our properties. It's a lot of work and its certainly not free money.

That's 400/mo for you to pocket, so it's definitely nice to have that $4800 a year of low effort income. However, you'll have to pay taxes on this, and you'll want to funnel a good portion of it away in a savings account specifically for repairing and maintaining that rental property.\n\nYou may consider hiring a property manager to find tenants do most of the heavy lifting for you. From what I read, they usually take 50% of the first months rent, and then 10% of the months rent after that... so all in all that's going to significantly eat into your profits but that's going to minimize the effort you have to put into it.\n\nOne of your most important tasks is properly screening tenants. The internet is chalked full of horror stories of terrible tenants who do WELL over their security deposits worth of damage. Some stories have a happy ending where the tenants end up paying for some of the repairs, others do not end so well.\n\nI'm interested to see the rest of the replies here since I'm also looking into this. \n\nIn my own research, I've found that it seems to be more lucrative to buy very cheap properties and rent them out (possibly with section 8 vouchers). So, instead of rent 1 $100,000 house for $1200 a month, they're renting 3-5 $25,000 5-600/mo each with dirt cheap mortgage payments.

That&amp;#39;s 400/mo for you to pocket, so it&amp;#39;s definitely nice to have that $4800 a year of low effort income. However, you&amp;#39;ll have to pay taxes on this, and you&amp;#39;ll want to funnel a good portion of it away in a savings account specifically for repairing and maintaining that rental property.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may consider hiring a property manager to find tenants do most of the heavy lifting for you. From what I read, they usually take 50% of the first months rent, and then 10% of the months rent after that... so all in all that&amp;#39;s going to significantly eat into your profits but that&amp;#39;s going to minimize the effort you have to put into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of your most important tasks is properly screening tenants. The internet is chalked full of horror stories of terrible tenants who do WELL over their security deposits worth of damage.
