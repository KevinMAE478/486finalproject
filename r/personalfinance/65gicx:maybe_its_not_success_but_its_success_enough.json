I know his feeling and was there myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let us travel back in time 20 years. I was a happily married man with two kids, a beautiful wife, 10 acres in the country, a 3 bedroom ranch and a garage with all the tools a man needs and several he doesn&amp;#39;t, a kick ass truck, riding lawn mower and guns. I was 35 years old and the world was mine. The little woman and I both had good jobs, she a line supervisor at a factory and me a sports editor. We each had our own vehicles and were the middle-est of middle class. My credit score was so high, it had to take a urine test every time I needed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Five years later, my credit score was lower than a dog&amp;#39;s ass scraping on the carpet. The short story is: divorce. Followed by a shit ton of bad decisions with a soon-to-be second ex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My two kids, who I had custody of, and I ended up homeless for a week. We were finally barely able to secure an apartment, a two bedroom on the outskirts of town, but we had shelter. Two of the things my second ex had going for her, aside from her physical flexibility, was the ability to lie her ass off about where my paychecks were going and racking up credit card debts in my name. I am not a smart man and was slow to get to the point where I divorced her, but I was too late. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There I was, broke as hell. I had to hock my Canon camera equipment to have enough money to feed us for a week. It was so bad, the Christmas tree was a Christmas Pole with two strings of lights we couldn&amp;#39;t afford to keep lit, and the gifts were crap that weren&amp;#39;t wrapped. I hit a low so bad I broke the law, rationalizing that it was the only thing I could do to get by for another week. Thank God I didn&amp;#39;t get caught.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stress of worry gnawed at me. My sleep suffered, the only reason I didn&amp;#39;t gain weight was because I didn&amp;#39;t have food in the house most of the time. I had nothing and my thoughts often went to how easy it would be to just GTFO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I am not a smart man. I&amp;#39;m not good looking or a relation to anyone with money. The law breaking scared me so bad, I think I poo-ed myself a little when I finally realized where I was in life and how close I came to spending five years locked up. I may not be a handsome man, but I&amp;#39;m too pretty and frail for prison and I&amp;#39;m rather fond of my kids and enjoy seeing them regularly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rock bottom was the thought that no one was going to help me. At some point, I realized, I shouldered all the responsibility for me. I called myself a pussy, grabbed myself by the scruff of the neck and told myself to grow up. It took me more than nine years to do finish the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems like life may have passed me by because I spent every extra cent on paying off all those debts. I gave up nights out with friends and vacations, new toys and new clothes I didn&amp;#39;t need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, at middle age, everything is paid off. My kids are grown and working at jobs. Having kids grow up while I supervised was so much fun, I got a couple more rental kids, one from Norway, the other from Hungary. I also took in a couple of strays who shared our home for a while when they needed shelter. It is fricking amazing to see kids who others gave up on become doctors and engineers, teachers and supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do I have? A modular home in a park. It&amp;#39;s not a mansion, needs new carpet and some work on the vinyl siding. I drive an old truck that needs work, but I can do it with the few tools I have in my shed. My vacation are mission trips to Kenya and Dominican Republic to build houses and teach. My bills are paid now and I sleep well, except for the prostate bullshit that comes with age. What I thought I was missing out on in life, wasn&amp;#39;t what I found was important and fulfilling. I&amp;#39;m a minimalist by nature I guess.

I can&amp;#39;t guarantee you&amp;#39;ll be happy, but it feels gooder to not have bills than it does to have them hanging around your neck like heavy cow bells, banging continually reminding you they are there.
