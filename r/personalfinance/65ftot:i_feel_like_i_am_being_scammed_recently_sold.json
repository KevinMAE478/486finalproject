They initiated the process about a year ago but at the time I hadn&amp;#39;t found a home to buy yet.  That took about 4-5 months, at which point the plan was to sell it to this person directly (no real estate agent involved).  Come to find out they had issues obtaining a loan and the entire process dragged on for many months.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So during this time, I already moved into my home and would stop by the condo to check up on things and get mail.  I noticed that I would start to get mail with this person&amp;#39;s name with my condo&amp;#39;s address on it.  I chalked it up to incorrect mailing lists and didn&amp;#39;t think too much about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Faster forward to more recently, the sale went through and it went from being a bank loan situation, to the person buying it with cash.  OK, that&amp;#39;s fine.  Lawyers drew up paperwork, which of course exposes a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of private information to both parties.  I am almost positive they now have my current home address and might even have my SSN.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I need to add that the buyer is from a foreign country (cultural and language barrier), so all the various steps needed to buy a home were not familiar to them.  Fairly basic steps (like the bank checking you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; had gainful employment) had to be explained to them and even then I am not sure they understood it.  I spent a lot of time communicating with them and trying to explain the various steps involved with buying a property.  In a typical real estate transaction, the buyer and seller don&amp;#39;t even meet each other until the day of the signing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This whole cash situation seemed fishy because this person went from not having any money to having it in cash in a fairly short amount of time.  We closed very recently.  I was on edge for a few days until the checks cleared from my bank and the full amount is now listed in my account.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So fast forward to today.  I get a package in the mail addressed to myself (name is slightly misspelled), and the person it came from sort of/kind of looks like this person&amp;#39;s name (again, they have a foreign name, so its not some super common name like Bob or Chris).  The package was a single black towel from a department store (directly from them).  So strange.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, I immediately jump to the conclusion that the buyer is trying to pull some scam with an inexpensive item, and this is their first attempt at using my information, but I don&amp;#39;t know how to proceed or even know what to do at this point.  Could it be a totally weird coincidence?  Maybe, but seriously what are the odds?  I already checked my bank acount and no weird new transactions appear.
