Sign her up for low income lunch at school\n6. Apply for [Medicaid/Healthcare](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/issue-briefs/health-care-foster/)\n7. Apply for [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/programs/tanf)\n8. Contact [211](http://211.org/). A free service by United Way\n9. Declare her as a dependent on your taxes. [United Way](https://www.unitedway.org/myfreetaxes/) can help with that too\n10. Find local non-profits, charities and churches. Reach out for help. Research organizations specific to your situation, one example I found from a quick google search is [Nation Association for Children of Alcoholics](http://nacoa.org/). I don't know anything about them specifically but you get the gist.\n\n\n\n[More information](https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/outofhome/kinship/support/financial/)\n\nThis isn't going to be easy, don't forget to take care of yourself too.\n \n* Talk to your teachers and academic advisor, let them know what's going on and they can help make accommodations for you when necessary. If you don't, they're going to treat you like every other 20 year old without such huge responsibilities.\n* Find a support network. Talk to a therapist if you have access to one through your school. Talk to single moms, and others in similar positions. \n* Lean on support where you can get it\n\n\nAs for your sibling\n\n* Get them back into school\n* Talk to their teachers \n* Get them free tutoring when possible\n* Help them apply for FAFSA and scholarships their junior(?) year.

I was also a college student. He now works at a great job and has a beautiful family. He's way more successful that I am. He was older than 12, though. At that time, I was really concerned with him being okay emotionally so I tried to be extra stable. I kept the house clean and stayed home all the time I could. Some advice I have now is kind of based on being almost 40 and making too many mistakes. So here goes.\n\n1) Stay in school. It's so much easier to finish when you're young. \n\n2) Don't take out loans. The debt will kill you later. Just use your grants like you have been. \n\n3) Professors love to be supportive of their students. Tell them in person what's going on. They will be more forgiving if you have a late assignment or something and you already told them. They may extend deadlines for you as well. \n\n4) everyone here covered the SNAP, etc. Good advice with calling 211 and agencies but one tip: dealing with these helping services can be stressful, too. It's a lot of paperwork and red tape. Some standing in line and biting your lip and swallowing any sense of pride you have. Do try to connect with people with kids to get the scoop before you go if possible. For example, I went to an energy assistance office once and found out they only take the first 12 per day and you have to have all paperwork ready or else you're turned away. So, yeah. In that case, getting up at 5 am to stand (literally) in line was my only option to be #5 and get seen. \n\n5) another service I didn't see mention was subsidized childcare. In PA it was called CCIS. The welfare office can help with that. If you find a great, caring person to help with childcare they might be a good resource as well. I wouldn't leave sibling home alone too much, even at 12. \n\n6) saying the word subsidized reminded me of housing assistance. You may now qualify for Section 8 which is a voucher. You can still choose where you live (with limitations), but it covers a portion of your rent. Or other housing assistance that is out there. \n\n7) finances &amp; budgeting are hard, even for people that make six figures. So many people live on the edge but would never admit it. Save every penny you can--there are tons of frugal living blogs that have great ideas. Read as much as you can (after this semester's over) about money and saving and budgeting. They also offer free budgeting classes at community help organizations so you could start keeping an eye out when you're in those places. \n\n8) write everything down that you need to find out about. As in, make a list so you have it on paper. It will help stop the worrying. \n\n9) loving the crap out of your sibling is the most important thing, and I know you do or else you wouldn't do this. Trust your instincts and protect sibling at all costs and as much as necessary.\n\n I wish I could be more helpful, but I don't want to overwhelm you. You'll be okay. You'll get the hang of it. Bright side is, it's almost summer, so hopefully you'll have some extra free time to get things situated for the fall when your sibling goes back to school.  \n\n\n\nMore friendly version on the eyes.

I was also a college student. He now works at a great job and has a beautiful family. He's way more successful that I am. He was older than 12, though. At that time, I was really concerned with him being okay emotionally so I tried to be extra stable. I kept the house clean and stayed home all the time I could. Some advice I have now is kind of based on being almost 40 and making too many mistakes. So here goes. 1) Stay in school. It's so much easier to finish when you're young. 2) Don't take out loans. The debt will kill you later. Just use your grants like you have been. 3) Professors love to be supportive of their students. Tell them in person what's going on. They will be more forgiving if you have a late assignment or something and you already told them. They may extend deadlines for you as well. 4) everyone here covered the SNAP, etc. Good advice with calling 211 and agencies but one tip: dealing with these helping services can be stressful, too. It's a lot of paperwork and red tape. Some standing in line and biting your lip and swallowing any sense of pride you have. Do try to connect with people with kids to get the scoop before you go if possible. For example, I went to an energy assistance office once and found out they only take the first 12 per day and you have to have all paperwork ready or else you're turned away. So, yeah. In that case, getting up at 5 am to stand (literally) in line was my only option to be #5 and get seen. 5) another service I didn't see mention was subsidized childcare. In PA it was called CCIS. The welfare office can help with that. If you find a great, caring person to help with childcare they might be a good resource as well. I wouldn't leave sibling home alone too much, even at 12. 6) saying the word subsidized reminded me of housing assistance. You may now qualify for Section 8 which is a voucher. You can still choose where you live (with limitations), but it covers a portion of your rent. Or other housing assistance that is out there. 7) finances &amp; budgeting are hard, even for people that make six figures. So many people live on the edge but would never admit it. Save every penny you can--there are tons of frugal living blogs that have great ideas. Read as much as you can (after this semester's over) about money and saving and budgeting. They also offer free budgeting classes at community help organizations so you could start keeping an eye out when you're in those places. 8) write everything down that you need to find out about.

I know back then I was not at all open to anything like counseling, but something like that could make a huge difference.\n\nEven if OP's sister is not willing, it could be helpful to OP. Any kind of support system. Perhaps OP could take advantage of counseling services available with whatever insurance they have or get, looking out for that option if  there are choices.\n\nA little disclaimer: I'm not necessarily an advocate for 12 step programs as much as finding people who have gone through similar things and can help you do the same, and that seems like a readily available way to do so.\n\nIn a few years, if not sooner, or (hopefully not) even already, she'll be doing stupid things teens do, doubly so with teens of alcoholics.

I was denied because the money from my GI bill was over the limit for 2 people in my state. \n\nApply for Medicare/Medicaid for her. She almost certainly will qualify. Whether or not you do, I have no idea but it doesn't hurt to try.\n\nEnroll her in counseling. This is a big thing that cannot be overlooked. She's young and regardless of her personality she (and you too) just went through a major life changing event. It will be to both of your benefit to get professional help to process what happened and get adjusted to your new life. She's going to act out and blame you for things and project feelings that she had for her parents on to you and it's going to hurt big time and make you question why you're putting yourself through this. My sister did with me and it was very demoralizing at times. If I wasn't in counseling through it I don't think I would have made it. Self image is a big concern for kids like her. She's just about to hit puberty if she hasn't already and her primary reference for relationships has been unhealthy. That is going to be one of the primary issues you and counseling will have to deal with. It took a couple of years to get through to my sister that she was worth more that the jerk boys that she was falling for. And oh boy the self sabotage. That is going to be a slow road for her to learn how to feel safe and that she's allowed to be happy. But you'll get through it. You've already gone this far, I know you won't give up on her. Eventually she will believe it too.\n\nThe good thing about counseling is that a lot of places adjust the fee based on income. If you/she qualifies for Medicare then it should be free, it was in my state.  Most ACA healthcare plans have coverage for mental health services too so please don't let the thought of cost stop you or her from getting help. One more thing about counseling, only go to a place where you and she will see a licensed counselor. When you call, you straight ask the person on the phone if whoever you'll be seeing is licensed. DHS, local domestic violence shelters and your insurance company are all places you can get free information and referrals to good nearby licensed counselors.\n\nOne bit of general parenting advice that some people don't understand: don't be afraid to be the bad guy. She is going to need structure majorly in the near future. Your role for the next few years will be \"parent\". As she gets nearer to being an adult you can try to transition from a parent-child relationship to a sibling relationship. But throughout that, your decisions need to be respected. That doesn't mean to get authoritarian but punishments, curfews, who's allowed over, that stuff needs to be respected enough that she holds to them. The way I did it was with a family talk. I tried to encourage her to take responsibility for her own life as much as possible because my overall goal was for her to be a healthy independent adult. So we sat down and talked and made up a list of chores and things she is responsible for like doing homework and cleaning her room, and the consequences for if she did them or didn't do them. Then I gave her a few days to think it through and if there was anything she felt wasn't fair she could argue her side of it. It worked pretty well for us, and she did argue a few points that we changed because of it. It was a good way to help her find her voice and feel like she had some control over her life. Like she argued for a later curfew and bed time and got those. On the other side, the condition to have her phone and for me to pay the bill was she turns in all her homework and gets A's. When she started slacking and stopped turning in her homework, I took her phone and let it shut off. It was a metro pcs phone so it was cheap already and there's no late fee if you don't buy minutes for a couple of months.\n\nWell I'm already late for work :) if you have any other questions feel free to ask. I was in your situation and it's going to be a struggle, there is no way around that. But eventually you will make it though. Good luck!\n\nedit: words for clarity\n\nOh! I forgot something else. Bus passes! I got her a bus pass and rode it with her a few times so that she could learn to do it on her own to get to and from school. My school ID let me ride for free and her school ID let her get a reduced rate. It was how we both got around for a while because it was a lot cheaper than paying for parking on my campus.

It is especially important for your younger sister as well because she is growing and needs healthy food to grow well and avoid health issues from eating junk. If you need to think of it this way, it is better to spend a little more money and cook good food than it is to spend even more money on health stuff trying to fix health problems from eating junk all the time. Plus you both will feel better while living life and doing what you need to do.\n\nYour temptation might be to stock up on lots of TV dinners and things like that. When you're talking about a tight budget, its actually the more expensive thing you can do. Heres a few personal tips for food things I have done myself as a broke bachelor that will keep you guys eating well but not break the bank (oftentimes you can get this stuff with foodstamps as well).\n\n----------------------------\n\n1. **rice and beans** - learn to love them. extremely cheap but can be used in so many things as well as being very fulfilling. beans are a good source of protein and rice carbohydrates. together they are considered a super carbohydrate and will keep you full for a while. even if just eating rice and beans without anything else, throw a bit of spices in it, onion powder, pepper, red pepper flakes, etc.\n2. **Seasonings**: salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cumin, parsley. Even with just those 7 spices you can make any cheap bland food into something tasty. You can get them for $1 each cheap at dollar stores.\n3. **Sparkling water** - if you like fizzy drinks but want to stay healthy, these are a great cheap way to satisfy that while being cheap and a healthier alternative. You can also mix a bit of juice with it as well.\n4. **Peanut butter** - need I say more on this one? buy in bulk\n5. **chicken** - The meat of life. buy these in the large family pack and get some freezer quart bags. when you bring home the family pack, divide the breasts out into 1 or 2 pieces, put into frezzer bags and throw in the freezer. when you need to make dinner, take one bag out and put it in the fridge to defrost during the day.\n6. **kitchen basics**: Flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, corn starch, brown sugar, vanilla. With these things you can make pancakes, tortillas, peanut butter cookies, coat chicken for frying, and they are also used in countless recipes. Keep a stock of these items in airtight containers and they will last a while and can be used for many things.\n7. **canned goods** to keep: Black beans, corn kernels, refried beans, tomato sauce. I almost always have these because they can be used for numerous things, they're tasty and cheap to buy in bulk packs. Go to the dollar store to get them for cheap.\n8. **Fresh produce**: lettuce, carrots, onions, celery, apples, oranges, peppers, garlic. You can use these things in so many ways. \n9. **Other basics**: milk, eggs, butter, cheese (not American, block of cheddar, spicy jack, a less processed cheese), bread.\n10. **Pasta** - super cheap and you can put so many things on it.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Other tips**\n\n1. **crockpot**: with classes you might be limited on time to make stuff. go to a thrift store if you can or ask if anyone has an extra crockpot. look up slow cooker meals. take your sundays to make a bunch of freezer bag slow cooker meals. then if you have a busy day, dump one into the crockpot, turn it on and when you come home, you both have a good meal.\n2. **buy in bulk**. Don't look for whatever the cheapest price for 1 item, if your store shows it, look for the price per quart/pound/case and find the cheapest price per large quantity. it might feel expensive to spend maybe $15 for 20 rolls of paper towels, but in the long run you're stretching your money the best it can buy getting the most per $ you spend.\n3. **Avoid eating out** - this is a big one. It's ok once in a while, but consider this a treat and a special occasion. It is important to still give yourselves a little something, like if its one of your birthdays. When you do, set a budget for yourself and make sure your bills are taken care of.\n4. **Cook bigger meals and save leftovers in the freezer for future meals**, such as when you're sick or can't cook. From experience, certain things keep better in the freezer. Anything with rice or pasta in it don't do this with. Works better for more sauce and meaty items such as lasagna, pizza and soups. \n5. **TJ Maxx/Homegoods/Thrift stores** - excellent place to get cooking apparel much less expensively. All you need is a good chef's knife, a wood cutting board (no glass or plastic) and a few cooking utensils (slotted spoon, serving spoon, ladle, plastic/wood spoons for stirring, spatula). Dramatically cheaper than new and you can sometimes find really nice stuff.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Cheap recipes**\n\nFinally, here's a few cheap and easy recipes that are very tasty that you can try based on some of these items I've listed:\n\n1. **Basic Italian tomato sauce** - don't spend money on premade. All you need is a can of tomatoe sauce, Italian seasoning, parmesan cheese and a tin bit of olive oil. Bring sauce to a simmer in a pot. Crush Italian seasoning between your palms into the sauce. Add some paremesean. Add some salt and pepper to taste.\n2. **Alfredo sauce** - same as tomato sauce, you can make it yourself for cheap and way better. 2 TBSP of butter, 2 TBSP of flour. Melt the butter in a pot. Add in flour. It will start to form almost a dough (this is called a roux). Simmer slightly for a minute. *Gradually* add 1 cup of milk or half and half (plain, non flavored stuff). It will thicken into a white sauce. Add a bunch of parmesan cheese. You now have homemade alfredo sauce!\n3. **Southwest chicken salad** - cook up some chicken with taco seasoning (cumin, salt, pepper, hot Mexican chili powder), cut up some lettuce, black beans, corn. Crush some tortilla chips over it and shred some cheddar cheese. Mix half ranch and hot sauce to make a spicy ranch. Extra easy and very tasty.\n4. **Corn, Rice and Keilbasa**. Learned this recipe from a college roommate. Cook up a cup of rice in rice cooker or on the stove. Saute some Keilbasa in a frying pan to brown. Add rice and a can of corn (drained). Season with taco seasoning. Extremely cheap and very tasty.\n5. **Pastina (small ball pasta) and butter** - this was a childhood meal I had but it was nostalgic and tasty. This for the parent is for those don't really want to cook days but kids still will love it. Cook up some pastina or aci de pepe (small ball pasta) and season with butter and parmesan. Very tasty, craving some myself right now actually haha\n\nHope this helps as a good start for food. It's often overlooked but does tie into finances as it is a basic life necessity. Done right you can still eat well, eat satisfying food, but not break the bank.

Kods can be moody especially when tired, now add on horomones going crazy inside because its a  pubescent aged child. Being taken away from your mom at 11 has to be quite devastating, even if s/he doesn't lead on, it is on the inside. Please be sure to give him/her hugs often, ask the child if s/he is ok and let him/her know you are there to listen when s/he needs it. S/he may not have had this normal nurturing behavior offered to him/her before but s/he deserves it. Let the child know everything will be ok. Maybe you could also talk to school about setting him/her up with counceling sessions there - it would be best for him/her even if s/he doesn't know it. Also I'd like to suggest you make his/her teachers aware of their home situation so they can be more  sensitive of what all s/he is going through. Please be very careful of who you trust to care for this child too  whether they are just going to a friends house or they keep the child when you are away.

I, having kids both of your ages, just want to mention a few other important things that will help you both along the way... Try to remember even in your difficult times, do your best to remain patient with your younger sibling. Reality is, it  can be hard sometimes. Kods can be moody especially when tired, now add on horomones going crazy inside because its a  pubescent aged child. Being taken away from your mom at 11 has to be quite devastating, even if s/he doesn&amp;#39;t lead on, it is on the inside. Please be sure to give him/her hugs often, ask the child if s/he is ok and let him/her know you are there to listen when s/he needs it. S/he may not have had this normal nurturing behavior offered to him/her before but s/he deserves it. Let the child know everything will be ok. Maybe you could also talk to school about setting him/her up with counceling sessions there - it would be best for him/her even if s/he doesn&amp;#39;t know it. Also I&amp;#39;d like to suggest you make his/her teachers aware of their home situation so they can be more  sensitive of what all s/he is going through.

Just trying to do your best while not working against yourself does wonders, really. It's good you asked for advice in a place where many people can offer it.\n\n2) Relax. That doesn't mean let your guard down about important stuff. That means try to enjoy even the tough times where and when you don't know what you're doing. A bit of happiness makes doing the hard stuff so much easier. Or, in the words of Mary Poppins, \"A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down.\"\n\n3) Be a team of happiness. If your background is so troubled you're taking care of your sibling at such a young age because the parents are unfit, then it will probably be tempting and reflexive to fall back on habits you learned there. Don't. Your sister at 12 is probably quite intelligent or has the capacity to be, even if she's lost much of that naturally because of what she (and you) have been through. She is capable at her age of doing what works and helps and being responsible for herself, at least somewhat. You should agree to work together instead of forming a primarily parent-child or dominant-submissive or older/younger dynamic. You are on the same side and you can be happy together. Neither of you knows exactly what you're doing, but you'll figure it out together. Knowing this and being a _team_ of happiness will make EVERYTHING easier for both of you. I don't think I can over-emphasize this. Being more experienced, you know the world kind of sucks. So does your younger sister. But what will make it all better is that your home is now with each other and you're always working for each other's good ~ both of you. This will save you money, frustration, time, misunderstanding, energy.\n\n4) I bet people on this will have fantastic advice for you, but I just want to say that I'm very impressed at the idea of you. Because I didn't grow up in a team of happiness (quite the contrary), and since I now have nothing to do with my sisters because they never really recovered from the effects of our narcissistic father (see narcissistic personality disorder), I could weep at the idea of someone taking such responsibility for me or taking responsibility for someone like you have.\n\n5) In the same vein as a team of happiness, don't forget what it feels like to hug each other and open up, to love at heart. We all need to be loved. If we can even feel it for each other, without the world or our negative experiences interfering, we're in the right place to make important decisions on how to move forward.\n\nBest of luck, OP :-)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t taken the time to read any of the comments below, but my advice in general is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Be responsible.

Because I didn&amp;#39;t grow up in a team of happiness (quite the contrary), and since I now have nothing to do with my sisters because they never really recovered from the effects of our narcissistic father (see narcissistic personality disorder), I could weep at the idea of someone taking such responsibility for me or taking responsibility for someone like you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) In the same vein as a team of happiness, don&amp;#39;t forget what it feels like to hug each other and open up, to love at heart. We all need to be loved. If we can even feel it for each other, without the world or our negative experiences interfering, we&amp;#39;re in the right place to make important decisions on how to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best of luck, OP :-)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg7d5qb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492106263.0, "created_utc": 1492077463.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6534gm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7zb83", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Phlink75", "parent_id": "t3_6534gm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Don't forget to go after mom for child support.
