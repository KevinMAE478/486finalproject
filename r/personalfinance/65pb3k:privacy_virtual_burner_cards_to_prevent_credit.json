It's more than just a burner. Here are a few examples of where I've found value. \n\n1. The burner. I just use it on sketchy sites for purposes, and sometimes for pre-auths for sites that I may not want to pay after a free trial but don't want them to have real card info if I merely forget to cancel before their deadline. It'll let them preauth the $1 but won't allow a subsequent transaction downtown the line. If I actually find the service valuable I'll go back and add a new payment method.\n\n2. The cap. If I want a variably priced service but never want to spend over an amount I'll use this setup. Meaning I'm fine with $5/mo but will never want billing to go to $150/mo if it just got out of hand without my paying attention, I'll set a cap at $10/mo. Now no worries. \n\n3. Multi-card, multi-vendor. I also use it for a board I serve on. Each subcommittee gets their own monthly budget and I've not needed to pass out the main card number  for their online spending pool. It can be set to a monthly recurring $50/mo for online whatnots.\n\n4. Suspension. Once you do have a recurring payment going you can pause or kill it very easily. Preventing accidental charges if you've made arrangements with the company to suspend an account or something. \n\n5. Unlimited, but vendor dedicated. You can also lock a card to a specific vendor. Meaning it won't work for target, but it will work for amazon. \n\nI love this system. It's terrific. It puts me back in the driver's seat with my cards. It can feel more like the control I inherently have with cash but with the ease of digital.\n\n!! Do watch out for their account selection if you add multiple accounts as funds sources. I've found it only reliable when tied to a single fund source account. It seems to use the default regardless of the selection made at purchase. Unless they've fixed that by now. \n\nEDIT:  About Returns:\nPrivacy handles returns just fine in my experience. It's blind to the vendor. They just process the return and Privacy accepts the return transaction on the burned card and routes the cash to your source account. I had no issues with a few internet-based returns I've performed. ", "edited": 1492359799.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using Privacy for a while, and for internet ordering using it&amp;#39;s terrific. It&amp;#39;s more than just a burner. Here are a few examples of where I&amp;#39;ve found value. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burner. I just use it on sketchy sites for purposes, and sometimes for pre-auths for sites that I may not want to pay after a free trial but don&amp;#39;t want them to have real card info if I merely forget to cancel before their deadline. It&amp;#39;ll let them preauth the $1 but won&amp;#39;t allow a subsequent transaction downtown the line. If I actually find the service valuable I&amp;#39;ll go back and add a new payment method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cap. If I want a variably priced service but never want to spend over an amount I&amp;#39;ll use this setup. Meaning I&amp;#39;m fine with $5/mo but will never want billing to go to $150/mo if it just got out of hand without my paying attention, I&amp;#39;ll set a cap at $10/mo. Now no worries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-card, multi-vendor. I also use it for a board I serve on. Each subcommittee gets their own monthly budget and I&amp;#39;ve not needed to pass out the main card number  for their online spending pool. It can be set to a monthly recurring $50/mo for online whatnots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspension. Once you do have a recurring payment going you can pause or kill it very easily. Preventing accidental charges if you&amp;#39;ve made arrangements with the company to suspend an account or something. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlimited, but vendor dedicated. You can also lock a card to a specific vendor. Meaning it won&amp;#39;t work for target, but it will work for amazon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love this system. It&amp;#39;s terrific. It puts me back in the driver&amp;#39;s seat with my cards. It can feel more like the control I inherently have with cash but with the ease of digital.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;!! Do watch out for their account selection if you add multiple accounts as funds sources. I&amp;#39;ve found it only reliable when tied to a single fund source account. It seems to use the default regardless of the selection made at purchase. Unless they&amp;#39;ve fixed that by now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  About Returns:\nPrivacy handles returns just fine in my experience. It&amp;#39;s blind to the vendor. They just process the return and Privacy accepts the return transaction on the burned card and routes the cash to your source account. I had no issues with a few internet-based returns I&amp;#39;ve performed. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dgc7hwi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492388168.0, "created_utc": 1492359368.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pb3k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc7tk6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "slayerdork", "parent_id": "t3_65pb3k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Can I use a credit or debit card as a funding source instead of my bank account?\n&gt;We don't support credit or debit cards for use as funding sources at the moment, but we are planning to add this functionality in the future!\n\nhttps://privacy.com/faq\n\nThis is whole bag of nope for me, you basically give this company your bank account details and if there is any fraud on the cards issued you would have to deal with Privacy directly instead of your bank.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can I use a credit or debit card as a funding source instead of my bank account?\nWe don&amp;#39;t support credit or debit cards for use as funding sources at the moment, but we are planning to add this functionality in the future!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://privacy.com/faq\"&gt;https://privacy.com/faq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is whole bag of nope for me, you basically give this company your bank account details and if there is any fraud on the cards issued you would have to deal with Privacy directly instead of your bank.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dgc7tk6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492388605.0, "created_utc": 1492359805.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pb3k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pb3k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pb3k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pb3k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd3d8d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "swbr", "parent_id": "t1_dgcl64p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Didn't know this.
