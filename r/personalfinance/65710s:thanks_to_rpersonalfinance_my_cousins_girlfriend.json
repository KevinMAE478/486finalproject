A couple days ago, my cousin was talking to his girlfriend about a new job she&amp;#39;s been trying to get. After a bit of inquiring, he said that it was for $46/hour w/ no experience necessary, and that he was going to try to get it too. It sounded too good to be true, but it was none of my business.\n Fast forward to today, he told me his girlfriend got the job, and they sent her a check that she was about to cash (~$2400) to buy equipment. IMMEDIATELY I remembered that post, and fortunately I was able to find it and show him this is a common scam. I didn&amp;#39;t want to rain on their parade or seem jealous that she got a &amp;quot;well paying job&amp;quot;, so I told them just to call the bank on the check just to be sure. His girlfriend was literally waiting in line at her bank, right about to deposit it, when he called her to check...Sure enough it was fraudulent and she&amp;#39;s contacting the local fraud department to report this!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: This is in Phoenix, AZ...be careful out there&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: glad a lot of people could read this!
