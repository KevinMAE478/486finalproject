I took the same hit when I first started with videography and my old Canon XL1S was not a writeoff.  But when I started photo, I had the business already running and wrote off everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no, &lt;strong&gt;you don&amp;#39;t have the right to deduct it&lt;/strong&gt; (and I&amp;#39;d be careful using that tone when doing taxes, it&amp;#39;s all just boring rules).  Here is an explanation of section 179:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.section179.org/section_179_deduction.html\"&gt;http://www.section179.org/section_179_deduction.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here is the official IRS page on 179:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946/ch02.html\"&gt;https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946/ch02.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note the records part.  Also 2012-2015 counts as a hobby:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/five-basic-tax-tips-about-hobbies\"&gt;https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/five-basic-tax-tips-about-hobbies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and you can&amp;#39;t deduct more than the hobby income, which was zero during those years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t make the rules, but I do ask that my accountant does her best to play fair and smart within those rules.  So consider this your first lesson in starting a business.  You need to start the business 100%, not just go from a hobby to profession.  You setup all legal docs, tax docs and prep, sales tax, insurance, and everything else on year 1.  Small price to pay compared to getting audited. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg43a3r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491935125.0, "created_utc": 1491906325.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pafj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pafj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pafj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pafj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pafj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pafj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4a401", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "redzij", "parent_id": "t1_dg49yad", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Gotcha thank you!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotcha thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg4a401", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491947758.0, "created_utc": 1491918958.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pafj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pafj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pafj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4nmwe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chaser30", "parent_id": "t1_dg4n6nd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh, right.
