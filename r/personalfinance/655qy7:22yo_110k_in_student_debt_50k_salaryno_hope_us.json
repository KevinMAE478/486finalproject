You can learn a lot of that with MOOCs, if you don&amp;#39;t know it already.  You could also try to get a higher paying job in a field you are not as interested in, then run a small consultancy for social media or something like that depending on your skillset and network.  There are thousands of options.  Don&amp;#39;t limit it to &amp;quot;MOVE SOMEWHERE CHEAPER OMG OMG OMG&amp;quot;.  People are giving you shit for living in NY, but seriously your rent is only $980 a month and its not like you&amp;#39;re living in Manhattan.  Yes, you could move to the rural south and pay $400 a month for a 3BR house, but do you WANT to do that?  If your SO lives in Nashville, you might be paying MORE than $980 for a 1 BR (although I assume you&amp;#39;d split) as average 1 BR in Nashville is $1249.  It&amp;#39;s all dependent on the details of your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, 7% on student loans seems almost criminal given the low interest rates.
