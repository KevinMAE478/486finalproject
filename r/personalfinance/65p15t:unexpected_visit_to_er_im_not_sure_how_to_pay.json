It doesn't sound like your experience will cost as much as mine thankfully but it might be good information to know regardless. \n\n* **Make sure every bill has been sent to your insurance.** In my case I had a 3 hour period were I technically wasn't covered, and I had a bill with charges across my whole stay billed as if it was in the time frame where I didn't have insurance. I've had to call the insurance multiple times to get them to split the bill into uninsured charges and insured charges. As of today it's still not fixed, but jokes on them because while its still \"processing\" I'm still not paying. \nPerhaps more relevant to you though is that I've had bills that should clearly be under my insurance and were not because \"they never got my information\" when I was at the hospital. \n\n* **What makes that even more annoying to deal with is the fact that even though your stay was entirely at a hospital, you may very well receive like I did bills from places other than the hospital.** The Doctor you saw might bill through a professional group, the hospital will send a room for any room you were in (extra if it was an ER room), if anyone came in to draw blood they'll send a separate bill, the anesthesiologist will have their own separate bill too. \n\n* **Ask about charity programs, they could have multiple income brackets that you'll fall into.** The hospital I dealt with had a 100% off bracket, 75% off, 50% off, and 25% off brackets. You give them your income info and a copy of every medical bill you get and they'll write off a percentage. Unfortunately any bill outside the jurisdiction of the charity program you might have to beg to comply, or they might have their own charity program. This can either go good or bad, in my case the hospital's charity program was much nicer with income information and their math seemed to take into account life expenses ~ I myself landed in their 50% off bracket. My other bills charity program simply took my income and nothing else -- needless to say nothing came of them; but it was worth it to try.  \n\n* **If you have multiple bills from the same source, you can probably merge them all into 1 account to make paying easier.** It might make negotiating a payment plan easier because the billing department can then clearly see how much your charges have added up, and you're not just dealing with a single bill with a potentially low amount.\n\n* **When calling to negotiate a payment plan, low-ball everything.** Ask for a low of a payment as possible, say you can only pay $10 a month if need be. This way, the person you're negotiating with will have to come up with their lower number for you.

All in all though, medical bills don't accumulate interest so its only in your best interest to get the payments down as low as possible before paying off the bills with the higher monthly payments ~ or however you want to tackle paying this all off. \n\nHopefully any of that helps ~ Best of luck to you", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have actually gone through a near identical situation to this back last October, so I&amp;#39;ll throw in my 2 cents.
