(Am in the U.S.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I attended this comm college for one semester back in 2008. Took one class that I passed and wanted the credit transferred to my university. When I contacted the school they informed me of a $2000 balance from 2008 for a semester I registered for and ended up dropping. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even got an A grade in one of the classes. Ridiculous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They said they sent me to collections, however, I have never received anything from that. They have my proper current address, my credit report shows nothing.
