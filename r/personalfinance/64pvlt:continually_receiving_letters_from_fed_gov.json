You don't need to wait to apply. In fact, you have to apply *first*, and they will set your repayment of your loans based on your income (Income-Based Repayment).

This is my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to get to a point where I&amp;#39;m just touching the interest on my loan, I&amp;#39;d have to be paying $1400/month (and the principle would stay nearly the same by the end of 20 years). If I pay $2000/month, I could pay it off in 20 years, but my husband and I do not have $2000/month to spare. It&amp;#39;s cheaper for us to stay on IBR and put $500ish per month in savings (for the inevitable gargantuan tax bill) whilst making low IBR payments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks, federal government! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PSA: Fuck grad school.
