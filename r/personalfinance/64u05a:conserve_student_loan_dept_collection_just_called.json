While what they were doing was likely *not* a violation in itself, it depends on specific details of the conversation your HR person had with them that you may not be 100% aware of. The call was recorded and legal inquiry can prompt review and possibly get you an award/settlement if there was a violation. \n\n2) Unlike most collection situations, it's a bad idea to be out of touch with your federal student loan servicer/PCA. They may do a shit job of actually helping, but they have zero incentive to fuck you over once you're this far behind. If they're contacting your HR person, it's likely to start wage garnishment. You can head that off pretty easily, but only by taking their calls. Ignore any and all advice you find about ceasing contact, withholding payments, developing \"leverage\", etc. None of that means anything when dealing with federal student loans and once garnishment goes into place it will take months to remove it. \n\n3) Tell ConServe you want to rehabilitate your loans and don't take no for an answer. The only situation where you can't do this is if you rehabilitated in the past and are back in default. In almost all other situations this is something you are legally entitled to do. By rehabilitating, you pay 9 monthly payments based on an income-driven formula (as low as $5/mo) and then you're current again. It's a small hassle to set up, but once it's done your life and credit report will thank you. \n\nBonus) Once rehabilitation is complete, DO NOT STOP MAKING PAYMENTS! So many people do this that it hurts to think about. When you're out of default, they send you from a PCA to a servicer. Confusing as hell and most people freak out when they go from an income-based rehabilitation payment to a full-sized payment again with zero notice. This is normal and just reflects a failure in how the Department of Education handles account transfers today. Call the new servicer and ask for an Income-Driven Repayment Plan (specifically PAYE or RePAYE in most cases, but do the research and choose based on your own needs). Again, you are *entitled* to this option, it is not a favor you are asking for or something they can turn you down for outright.
