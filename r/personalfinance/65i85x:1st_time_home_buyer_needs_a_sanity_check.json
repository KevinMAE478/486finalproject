I felt pretty confident in our budget plan...until I browsed this site and saw the landslide of comments on various threads encouraging people NOT to buy that house they love, but to be more conservative and stay well within their means. I still think our plan is financially solid, but I want to be sure we&amp;#39;re planning to spend appropriately for our income. Details below. Please weigh in!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 30, and make ~ 130k/year. I consider my future employment prospects to be pretty stable, but clearly there are never guarantees. My wife is home with the kids for now, but plans to go back to work once the kids are in school. Again, for now no guarantee of income there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been renting my entire life. Today we rent a house for $2600/month and have been able to save ~ 15-20k/year in the last 2 years. We are debt free and have ~ 130k in savings. My goal is to upgrade the house we live in and keep our lifestyle constant without straining our finances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our ideal house would cost ~ $670k, with prices in the places we want to live seemingly rising by the day. We would put ~ 100k down (15%) and finance the rest with a 30yr mortgage. Monthly payments would be roughly $2700/month BUT once you add in property taxes, PMI (ugh), HOA, insurance you&amp;#39;re at ~ $3500/month. Add in a 1% monthly fund for maintenance, etc and now you&amp;#39;re at $4000/month, $1500 more than rent! The only thing working the other way is the tax break for mortgage interest which should offset ~ $300/month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short: Our DTI would be ~ 32% depending on what you include, our savings would be mostly invested in the house and I estimate our saving power drops from $20k/year to $8k/year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this a reasonable burden? Are we taking on too much house? I didn&amp;#39;t think so, but I&amp;#39;ve been using the argument that our income is likely to go up and so we&amp;#39;ll eventually be saving significantly again. But if &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; happens (lost job, medical disaster, whatever), there&amp;#39;s a chance we can&amp;#39;t afford our home. Equally, if you worry about &amp;quot;something&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; all the time, you can never move forward in life! So what do you say, &lt;a href=\"/r/personalfinance\"&gt;/r/personalfinance&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the responses! I expected the blow-back!

It&amp;#39;s not the Bay Area, but housing costs are very high if you want to live somewhere with reasonable schools (we have 3 kids so thats a must) that&amp;#39;s not a 45 minute + commute to work. In our geographical constraint, the lowest 4 bed homes starts at $500k. Median houseprice is $535,200 which includes many smaller homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchase price of the house we&amp;#39;re renting would be ~ $600k.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between $500k and $670k is 1) age of home, 2) sq footage, 3) &amp;#39;modern&amp;#39; layout, kitchens and whatnot. Yes we could get a $500k house but it would feel like a downgrade from the rental...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am against renting for longer. 1) House prices are rising very fast in the pacific NW so additional saving don&amp;#39;t do much for me. 2) I simply look forward to ownership the walls I sleep in and it would be a big source of personal pride :) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the continued population increases in the pacific NW, the rising house prices beyond national averages and long term historical trends, I definitely consider owning a home here a good investment. Of course it has risk, but that&amp;#39;s no different than if I asked an investment broker what I should do with $100k in savings at age 30 - invest it and take some risk while you&amp;#39;re still young(ish!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are able to save significantly right now because we live quite frugally, more by choice than anything. We drive simple cars that we own, we don&amp;#39;t really eat out, we don&amp;#39;t have expensive tastes in clothes or hobbies etc. I don&amp;#39;t need that lifestyle to change too much, I just want a nice home to hang out with the family in :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside: I contribute 5% to 401k off the top, employer also contributes 5%.

Rule of thumb you can usually borrower 3x your income, and that's for everything (cars, mortgage, etc).  Based on that you would borrow max around $400k, you're talking about borrowing $570k.\n\nI am guessing that you live in an area with high real estate prices and this is basically the only way you're going to get a nice house in an area that you want to live in.  But those first few years are going to suck because you're going to put something like half of your take-home pay into your house.  Guessing your after-tax take-home is something like $7500/mo, you're talking about spending $4000 or  more than 50% just on housing.\n\nHowever there are some ways that this can make sense:\n\nYour first mortgage payment will include $821 in principal and it will increase from there, for example after 3 years this will be $922.  This is arguably not an \"expense\" since you're paying down your mortgage and increasing equity in your house.  You'll pay down the mortgage at roughly $10k per year for the first few years.  After a few years due to this and the house appreciating you may be able to get rid of the PMI which will save you some money.\n\nDepending on what kind of house you're buying, a 1% annual fund for maintenance sounds kind of high, unless you're aware of problems or work that needs to be done.  You're talking $6700/year or $560/mo for maintenance.  I have owned my house for 15 years and I don't think I've put $6700 into it for maintenance the whole time.  Upgrades definitely but not repairs.\n\nIn a few years your oldest kids will probably be in full time school which will free up your wife's schedule to work,  and that additional income can make a big difference in your finances.\n\nYou should get at least cost-of-living increases for the next few years and that additional income will help, meanwhile if you get a fixed-rate mortgage your payments will stay the same.\n\nFrom both a lifestyle and financial perspective I don't think you want to be lifetime renters.  There are a lot of non-financial benefits to owning your own house especially with a family, the kids are more likely to have a stable house and stay in the same schools, and you can fix up and upgrade the house as you want.\n\nBasically my analysis is that the 2-3 years after you buy the house you'll be really tight financially so you're going to be eating at home a lot and not taking nice vacations. And you need to be sure that your job is stable and that you're not going to want to move for any other reason for at least 5 years because if you did you may have to sell the house at a loss which would really wreck your finances.\n\nGood luck!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the numbers you&amp;#39;ve given you&amp;#39;re stretching into the house a bit.

You&amp;#39;ll pay down the mortgage at roughly $10k per year for the first few years.  After a few years due to this and the house appreciating you may be able to get rid of the PMI which will save you some money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on what kind of house you&amp;#39;re buying, a 1% annual fund for maintenance sounds kind of high, unless you&amp;#39;re aware of problems or work that needs to be done.  You&amp;#39;re talking $6700/year or $560/mo for maintenance.  I have owned my house for 15 years and I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve put $6700 into it for maintenance the whole time.  Upgrades definitely but not repairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a few years your oldest kids will probably be in full time school which will free up your wife&amp;#39;s schedule to work,  and that additional income can make a big difference in your finances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should get at least cost-of-living increases for the next few years and that additional income will help, meanwhile if you get a fixed-rate mortgage your payments will stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From both a lifestyle and financial perspective I don&amp;#39;t think you want to be lifetime renters.  There are a lot of non-financial benefits to owning your own house especially with a family, the kids are more likely to have a stable house and stay in the same schools, and you can fix up and upgrade the house as you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically my analysis is that the 2-3 years after you buy the house you&amp;#39;ll be really tight financially so you&amp;#39;re going to be eating at home a lot and not taking nice vacations. And you need to be sure that your job is stable and that you&amp;#39;re not going to want to move for any other reason for at least 5 years because if you did you may have to sell the house at a loss which would really wreck your finances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dgalp7d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492288907.0, "created_utc": 1492260107.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i85x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaqvfj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SnarkOfTheCovenant", "parent_id": "t3_65i85x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My household is in roughly the same income range without the good financial shape and the thought of a 600k+ house terrifies me.
