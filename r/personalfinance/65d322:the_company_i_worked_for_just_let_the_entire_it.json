Most states have a \"buffer week\" that will not pay out in the first week, but you need to get the ball rolling right away so your severance can cover the rest.\n\n2) Create/Update a LinkedIn Profile and be sure to change your job title to \"SEEKING EMPLOYMENT IN [AREA]\". Many recruiters, agencies, and even FTE places use it for headhunting purposes, and keeping it up-to-date to \"All-Star Status\" will put you in the front of the search results (don't bother with the premium membership, the free basic is just fine). Try to get some Endorsements in there from fellow coworkers as well so your claims of experience can be backed by other people (whether you like them or not is irrelevant really, just like real business!).\n\n2) Update your resume. No really, some people forget to do this and shoot themselves in the foot as a result of outdated details (I had SAS on my original resume I had to start sending out in December, haven't touched it in 10 years...whoops). \n\n3) Create a cover letter template that leaves empty fields for the company you'd be sending your resume to (the rest can be fluff saying you'd be a perfect fit, you're a highly skilled Google Fu black belt, blah blah blah, but it gives you something that many require). It may seem somewhat pointless, but it can help with those job opportunities that demand one.\n\n4) Set a weekly goal for the number of jobs you are going to apply for and stick to your guns until you have an OFFICIAL job offer in your hands (see #5). Personally I went with a minimum 1-2 applications filed a day, Monday-Friday. Many states require you to show proof of looking for work to qualify for unemployment, so this will help with that. Be sure to write down the name of the company, the method of applying (website/contact name/etc.), and the date you filed so it makes your weekly check-in that much easier.\n\nFor tech jobs, aside from the obvious recruiters, I cycled the same application between offers on LinkedIn, Indeed.com (got the job I have now through this site), Dice.com, and Craigslist. Mix it up and keep a profile active the whole time so Employers can see you in the light you want (then turn off notifications and gracefully turn down offers for interview once you do have a job of course).\n\n5) DO NOT STOP LOOKING, EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU'VE NAILED AN INTERVIEW AND THEY SAY THE OFFER IS IMMINENT. I've had two jobs that I had gotten as far as salary negotiations and \"waiting for HR to send the official offer\" that fell through and couldn't reach anyone at those companies after the fact (sidenote: employers/recruiters, at least give us the decency of informing us we weren't selected, please? It's bullshit to leave people hanging like that for weeks).\n\n6) Take this opportunity in downtime to improve your technical knowledge by watching videos and reading up on new programs that you could potentially get certifications for to boost your employability. Some states even offer assistance to unemployed people to get certifications/2-year courses fully paid for, so check your local Unemployment Office for details.\n\n7) Most importantly: do not lose your confidence or undersell yourself when job hunting. You weren't let go due to performance or incompetence, so don't let it impact you mentally. Sure, it is ROUGH to suddenly have the floor drop out from underneath you, but things can and will get better if you stay focused. \n\nI got my contract extensions rescinded and was immediately let go without notice on Christmas Eve 2016, then on the way home THE SAME DAY I hit some scrap metal and blew a tire out on the highway. You want a 1-2 punch, try having to give up Christmas for the wife and kid that year and paying $250 for car repairs.\n\nFast-forward 3 1/2 months of unemployment but focus and dedication on my end, and not only do I have a fulltime job yet again (that I chose from two other offers that came to me at the same time), but I'm getting paid more than I have my entire career with amazing benefits. \n\nJust stay focused, don't despair, and you can make it through outsourcing.

If you want something more aggressive, other people have posted those type of suggestions.\n\n\n**Rent -** I know your pain. Your best option here is to get a roommate.

Some apartments will let you move around inside the apartment with no extra charges - so if you got a roommate who could live at your location, just work with your apartment complex to move up to a 2b.\n\n**Car -** Given what you've said, you seem to understand that's a lot of money for that salary, but with only $8k left in payments that's a difficult one. You might could save some on the car insurance. I (27M) have a good driving record and use Geico. My insurance is $75/mo. I can't really do better for this topic without specifics (namely, what car do you have?).\n\n**Phone -** If you can deal with 4gb/mo of data, you could get a new phone at Verizon and the total cost would only be $60-70/mo. Other networks should be even cheaper, or you could drop down to a 2GB plan for a total (with phone) $40-50/mo. Bringing your own phone would drop these costs a little further.\n\n**CC -** I don't have any experience here.\n\n**Internet/TV -** That depends ENTIRELY on where you live. I have an internet-only plan from Comcast that gets over 50mb down for $45/mo. There's a lot to watch on the internet.\n\n**Utilities -** If you owned a house, had good cash flow, and were looking at lowering your utility costs/carbon footprint regardless of upfront costs... then you could look at getting new appliances or something? In an apartment, you're pretty much out of luck. I'd wager that it's functionally impossible to significantly change your utility bills. I do know that some companies offer year round fixed pricing, so you might can gain some stability that way (just make sure you do the math first)\n\n**Subscriptions -** That one's up to you, but again, there's a LOT to watch on the internet. XBL is $5/mo, but it's content is harder to replace. Spotify and Netflix are $10/mo each, so maybe consider just watching YouTube and other streaming websites (the streaming sites aren't the top of the ethics pyramid, but watch out for yourself before you watch out for multi-billion dollar companies)\n\n\nEdit - formatting\n\nEdit 2 - A decimal error lead me to make the silly comment that XBL was 10x cheaper than it actually is.\n\nEdit 3 - Car stuff", "edited": 1492221486.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My approach here is entirely based on modifying your existing setup.
