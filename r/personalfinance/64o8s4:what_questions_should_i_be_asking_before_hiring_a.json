Perhaps the most important thing about handling money is to not do anything with it you do not understand. The premise that the only way to successfully invest is to hand your money to a money person who does magical black box things with it is very flawed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There certainly are the occasional financial advisors who will manage your money well, even if they aren&amp;#39;t interested in teaching you about what they are doing. BUT if you are handing them money because they have a nice office and a bunch of letters after their name, and they cannot explain to you in simple terms how they will be growing your money (and showing you a nice track record of doing so in good and bad times), they certainly may be focused more on what they get out of it than what you get out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg4cm4e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491950843.0, "created_utc": 1491922043.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o8s4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o8s4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3v7ve", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hawkspur1", "parent_id": "t1_dg3uhk4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It depends on what they're doing \n\n$100-$400 for someone charging hourly", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends on what they&amp;#39;re doing &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$100-$400 for someone charging hourly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg3v7ve", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491914426.0, "created_utc": 1491885626.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o8s4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3wpw2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ronnnnn", "parent_id": "t1_dg3uhk4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I see $200-$300 most commonly. many firms require a minimum of $150/hr or more to be charged if one does hourly planning.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see $200-$300 most commonly. many firms require a minimum of $150/hr or more to be charged if one does hourly planning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg3wpw2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491917178.0, "created_utc": 1491888378.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o8s4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o8s4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o8s4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o8s4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o8s4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o8s4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4inz7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Econ0mist", "parent_id": "t1_dg4gdar", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "99% of clients won't understand their IPS, which is the problem.
