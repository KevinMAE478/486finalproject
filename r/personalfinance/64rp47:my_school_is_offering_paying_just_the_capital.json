Different currencies have different risk free interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MXN Government 5 year bonds are currently paying 7%, compared to US Government 5 year bonds which are paying ~1.9% so if USD is your frame of reference you should subtract ~5% from 8.5% and consider it closer to 3.5%ish equivalent in USD. That&amp;#39;s a fairly low interest rate that isn&amp;#39;t necessarily worth paying off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 10% discount is a big factor and is likely worth doing. It depends on whether you have other good opportunities to use that money or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg598f1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491988980.0, "created_utc": 1491960180.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp47", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4z8vy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "deliciouspuppy", "parent_id": "t3_64rp47", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "given that you probably will go with this route regardless, you probably just want some validation. and here you go, go for it! that said, make sure you pay back your dad in things that money can't buy, like spending quality time with him, showing your appreciation, etc. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;given that you probably will go with this route regardless, you probably just want some validation. and here you go, go for it! that said, make sure you pay back your dad in things that money can&amp;#39;t buy, like spending quality time with him, showing your appreciation, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg4z8vy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491975918.0, "created_utc": 1491947118.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
