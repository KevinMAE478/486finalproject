Avoiding PMI is the consistently worst advice I see here. Yes, PMI is total BS (you pay the insurance for your own default, removing all risk for the lender?!), but a principled stand against is likely to cost you tens of thousands of dollars. Maybe more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most important, in 3 years, it&amp;#39;s extremely likely that interest rates will increase by more than than the PMI because they&amp;#39;re currently near historic lows and the Feds are raising the key interest rate (which strongly correlates with the mortgage rate). Sure, you&amp;#39;ll avoid the ~0.5% PMI (which usually expires after you get 20% equity), but you may end up paying 2%+ more in the base interest rate (which never expires).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, even if you could afford the 20% down payment, given that the current interest rates (even with PMI) are well below the average long term index fund return, you&amp;#39;d still be better off putting the minimum down and investing the rest. This is what I did, even though I could have put 20% down. That is, I chose to pay PMI, and have thousands of dollars more because of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "name": "t1_dg3n5d0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491903447.0, "created_utc": 1491874647.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ls0i", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg36ucp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "boylston243", "parent_id": "t3_64ls0i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I didn't put down 20%.

That you rolled your PMI costs into your loan doesn&amp;#39;t really address people&amp;#39;s concerns when they are suggesting you avoid PMI -- anybody can roll a monthly cost into a 30 year mortgage easily enough, but the reason people bother to mention it is to suggest you try to go the route where you don&amp;#39;t pay it at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you put down 5%, you paid PMI. You either paid it up-front, it was paid out the backend through your loan deal and while it wasn&amp;#39;t directly out of your pocket, it was your money that ultimately funded it, or you paid higher interest rates than you would have without PMI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no bank that has been in business for more than a couple years gave you that high-risk loan at zero additional cost.
