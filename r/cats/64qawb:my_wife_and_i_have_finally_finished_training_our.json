I don&amp;#39;t know how much it costs, i think I recall it being around $35 or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It consists of a plastic frame that attaches easily to the porcelain rim of the toilet, and three plastic trays. The first tray (red) covers the bowl completely, and is filled with litter. At this first stage, you take away the cat&amp;#39;s litter box and get her used to jumping onto the toilet to do her business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once she&amp;#39;s comfortable, you switch it out for the orange tray, which has a hole in the middle, and the rim is filled with litter. Thanks to the litter, she still knows this is where she goes, but she will get used to seeing water in the toilet (and she&amp;#39;ll play in it at first).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you move to the last stage, the green tray, which still has a bit of litter in the rim, but now she&amp;#39;s squatting over the water and going for the most part. She&amp;#39;ll get used to the idea of the water hiding the scent better than litter, but she may still try to &amp;#39;bury&amp;#39; it afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once she&amp;#39;s comfortable, you take the whole thing off and leave the toilet&amp;#39;s seat down and she&amp;#39;ll just squat and go. Depending on the cat it can require a lot of patience (it took us about 5 months, including setbacks and one very large setback due to a surgery to fix an umbilical hernia).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can be annoying to have the cat fling litter all over the bathroom during the early stages, but I would say it&amp;#39;s worth it to be able to have a cat in an apartment and not have a litter box or the accompanying litter box smell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cats", "name": "t1_dg4aj5h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491948308.0, "created_utc": 1491919508.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg49qu0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Raezzordaze", "parent_id": "t3_64qawb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cats", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just curious if you used a specific, developed method or if it was something more organic and off the cuff?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just curious if you used a specific, developed method or if it was something more organic and off the cuff?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cats", "name": "t1_dg49qu0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491947282.0, "created_utc": 1491918482.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhta", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qawb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhta", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qawb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4k2ps", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LockeProposal", "parent_id": "t1_dg4jarp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cats", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It took us like 5 months, but eventually you get there.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took us like 5 months, but eventually you get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cats", "name": "t1_dg4k2ps", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491959090.0, "created_utc": 1491930290.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4jarp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "theaveragehousecat", "parent_id": "t3_64qawb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cats", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've been trying this for 2 months and progress is very slowly being made ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying this for 2 months and progress is very slowly being made &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cats", "name": "t1_dg4jarp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491958246.0, "created_utc": 1491929446.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhta", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qawb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhta", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qawb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4n7hz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LockeProposal", "parent_id": "t1_dg4kyo4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cats", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Briefly considered it, but no.
