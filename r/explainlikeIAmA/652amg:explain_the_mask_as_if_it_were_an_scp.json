Data analysis is inconsistent in determining what material the subject is made of. The mask appears to be carved in a way that gives the mouth a subtle smile, though examination discovered that the expression appears to change when viewed at different angles.

The subject begins to act in disregard for their own safety and the safety of others, and seem to possess some form of control over reality, though the extent of control is unknown. The subject behaves irrationally and seems to warp reality for their own amusement.

No effect was recorded until 10pm, during which time 2777-2 attempted to perform a containment breach. Weapons proved ineffective. 2777-2 was successfully distracted by an improv troupe that had, until that point, been a secret of several level 2 security staff. Dr. [REDACTED] committed suicide in one of the skits, and members of the audience reported that it was very funny.\n\n**Test 2777-3:** January 13, 1995. D-class personnel was given the mask at 4am, with the improv troupe from the 2777-2 test on standby, minus one member, and a full 30-piece orchestra to be safe. 2777-3 insisted on performing magic tricks, resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED].
