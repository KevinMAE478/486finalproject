I found I had to add a bit more water (a little less than 1/4c) to get the dough to pull together properly in the mixer.\n\nAfter preheating the oven to 525F and rolling out the dough in my cast iron pan, I baked the crust 10 minutes, then topped it.  Toppings were simple: canned tomato sauce with crushed red pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, basil and oregano; mozz and white cheddar; pepperoni.  Put it back in for 12-15 minutes.\n\nMy first attempt wasn't horrible, but it was dense.  This was due to three things:\n\n* For some reason I heated the water to activate the yeast, likely killing a lot of it\n\n* Room temp was too cool (it was 67F out and I had the windows open for the breeze), likely killing more - the dough barely rose\n\n* I cut the dough into halves rather than thirds, so I couldn't roll it out very thin in my 12\" cast iron\n\nThe second time out, I made sure my water was no hotter than 100F.  When proofing, I set the dough bowl on top of my oven, which I had going at 150F.  I found that stacking the bowl on a heavy pan kept it at just over 76F.  The dough rose beautifully.\n\nI cut it into thirds this time, allowing for a much thinner crust.  It crisped up nicely and was very light and had a better flavor.  Next time I might use bread flour and add some herbs to the crust, but overall, I'm happy.\n\nI have one ball of fail dough left that I'll probably use to make a couple empanadas or something just to use up.", "edited": 1492356493.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/pizza-and-flatbread-dough-235704\"&gt;pizza and flatbread dough recipe from Epicurious&lt;/a&gt;.
