Well, that&amp;#39;s what in my opinion was the absolutely least interesting thing about ST. The &amp;quot;overall concept&amp;quot; was just a few clich\u00e9s (&lt;a href=\"/spoiler\"&gt;otherworld monster; supernatural kid; secret government agency=bad; a bunch of slightly bullied nerds=good&lt;/a&gt;) melded together.

But, thats true just bearly: IMHO, I think just one of them is interesting - the missing kid&amp;#39;s mother (I suck at names). Other then that I find every character one-dimensional and boring. Everybody was clearly and definitely good or bad from the very start, with basically no deviations from the first or second impression I got about them.

But yeah, the atmosphere didn&amp;#39;t seem particularly great to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fourthly (is that a word?), the writing. OMG, there were just so many things I hated. From characters not communicating when they clearly should (&lt;a href=\"/spoiler\"&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re going to haunt unknown monster, that nobody believes in except for your mother, who might be the only one who saw it clearly and who is getting crazy, because noone belives her.
