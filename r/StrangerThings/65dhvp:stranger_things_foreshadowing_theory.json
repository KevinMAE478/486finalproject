With the coming arrival of Season 2 this seems like a great time.

But first let me point out how well thought out and written Stranger Things is, there is some amazing foreshadowing in Dialogue and Camera work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The DnD board game being by far the earliest and most obvious foreshadowing, presenting things like the Demigorgon and the Veil of Shadows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;#39;s also extremely subtle foreshadowing such as in Chapter 2: The Weirdo on Maple Street.  At  29:20, Eleven refuses to let Lucas leave the room and the group experiences the first moments of her Telekinetic powers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/xDeJvLM.jpg\"&gt;In this scene there are quick cuts to when the door slams that show 3 DnD pieces.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They seem to be a fighter (Mike), warlock (Dustin) and ranger (Lucas) class. The class is less important than what happens to the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/iGdjFLs.jpg\"&gt;One piece is shaken but remains standing that&amp;#39;s Mike, in Episode 3 he loses confidence in Eleven when Will&amp;#39;s fake body is found, but we see later that he still brings Eleven home he&amp;#39;s just very mad at her.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One piece falls down that&amp;#39;s Dustin he loses total confidence and has to be convinced to restart the search for Will, but he&amp;#39;s far easier to convince than Lucas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucas whose Ranger piece falls off the top of the drawer, his confidence is completely broken in Eleven, he does not trust the weirdo, and this mistrust continues throughout the Chapters leading to the biggest internal conflict in the group which separates everyone for a short time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucas is without a doubt a Ranger class. This is signified by his use of the slingshot, it&amp;#39;s also demonstrated by the DnD pieces, and &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/U0WjP3m.jpg\"&gt;Will even has a drawing of the 4 of them which seems to present Dustin as a Theif/Rogue class, Will as the Wizard, Mike as the Paladin/Fighter, and Lucas as the Ranger.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically I wanted to point this symbolism out as proof that the Duffer Brothers and the writing team really thought things through about the show. Specifically foreshadowing and some symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we know, or believe, Eleven isn&amp;#39;t dead. &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/AeVQjof.jpg\"&gt;This is most supported by the scene where Hopper leaves food including Eggo Waffles in a box out in the woods and the fact that she seemed to be absorbed by the remnants of the Demogorgon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The theory really begins here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First let me state that there are actually 3 realms that we see in the show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earth Realm \u2013 where the show takes place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vale of Shadows or Shadowplane or it&amp;#39;s title in the show The Upside-Down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inbetween place or The Psychic Realm \u2013 This is the psychic realm that Eleven can enter, it allows her to access the minds of Russian military diplomats and steal secrets, she can do almost any psychic thing here. It seems to be a lot like Cerebro in Xmen, although we know it also connects to the Upside-Down in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now allow me to state the portions of the theory itself:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eleven is the Demogorgon&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shadow-walking&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eleven is Yoda&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will the Wise (I&amp;#39;ll just mention his potential changes throughout the wall of text)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eleven is the Demogorgon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ufH9Qek.jpg\"&gt;I mean this quite literally, the Demogorgon is her parallel, her dark reflection and in many ways her manifestation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 5: The Flea and the Acrobat \u2013 Around 39:00 -\u201c(Lucas) But did you ever stop to think that maybe she is the Monster?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe this is meant to demonstrate the parallel between the monster and Eleven so that the audience can draw further conclusions about the properties of the worlds. It&amp;#39;s unclear as to whether or not Lucas meant this literally or figuratively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 6: The Monster\u2013 Around 42:40 - \u201c(Eleven) Mike I&amp;#39;m sorry... The gate I opened it, I&amp;#39;m the Monster.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s quite obvious that Eleven only says this because of the feelings of guilt and shame for creating so many problems. Eleven sadly also has a bit of a victim&amp;#39;s mentality and is quick to blame herself for all of these problems even though it wasn&amp;#39;t her fault. Disregarding the emotional concept of Eleven believing herself to be the Monster, I do think this scene is meant to have a double meaning in that she is literally the monster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 5: The Flea and the Acrobat \u2013 Around 6:40 - *\u201c(Dustin) The Vale of Shadows is a dark reflection or an echo of our world. It is a place of decay and Death, a plane out of phase, a place of monsters, it is right next to you and you don&amp;#39;t even see it...\u201d *&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why I describe the Demogorgon as being both a manifestation and a parallel/reflection. It is an echo of Earth Realm. Meaning our world determines the reflection. Which means it is possible that the Demogorgon is both a manifestation and Eleven&amp;#39;s counterpart. They do not have to be mutually exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which then lends a layer of symbolism to the appearance of the Demogorgon. Nancy and Joyce both describe the Demogorgon as \u201cLooking like a Man but with no face.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demogorgon is a reflection of Eleven&amp;#39;s abusers specifically Papa or Doctor Brenner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4: The Body \u2013 Around 33:30 \u201c(Jonathan) This man that you saw what&amp;#39;d he look like... (Nancy) It was almost like he, like he,... (Jonathan) Didnt have a face?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could even view the Demogorgon in a broader sense as the evil of men/mankind in general that Eleven experiences. There&amp;#39;s potentially some subtext as woman are the shown victims of both the Scientists and the Monsters. Eleven, Barbara, Nancy and Joyce are the primaries. (Of course there were other people killed, the hunters in the woods who had shot the deer)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demogorgon and Eleven are also paralleled because they appear to both have psychic powers. We know that Eleven can target individuals for psychic visibility but it seems impossible to communicate with them. At least at her current level of power. If she could she would&amp;#39;ve contacted Will a long time ago and told him to go to the Department of Energy to escape. However, Eleven was able to actually communicate and touch the Demogorgon in the Psychic Realm, there&amp;#39;s even some evidence to suggest that the Demogorgon was seeking her out beforehand and she ran from it. Regardless, it&amp;#39;s their connection that created the rupture and opened the Gate to the Upside-Down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eleven is the Demogorgon theory also explains why Eleven appears to die at the end of the show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/9gdlJpt.jpg\"&gt;Eleven kills her reflection in Earth Realm and the remnants of the Demogorgon banish her. In a way they forced her to shadow-walk to the Upside-Down to take it&amp;#39;s place since it&amp;#39;s parallel was killed in Earth Realm.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Death of Eleven&amp;#39;s counterpart also causes the Portal to close which is why she cannot just go through Mirkwood back to the department of energy and return to Earth Realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of people believe the portal to be open because how could Hopper and Joyce escape with Will if the portal shut? However, if you recall, these portals take awhile to close. The one Will was taken through may have lasted until the morning and Nancy&amp;#39;s portal through the tree took some time to close and these are tiny holes. The original gate was massive and probably took far longer potentially a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m sure most people know this, it&amp;#39;s probably the first question everyone wanted an answer to at the end of the show. The reason Hopper is leaving the food in that box. He&amp;#39;s feeding Eleven because what happens in our realm happens in the Upside-Down. A little more on this later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow-Walking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 5: The Flea and the Acrobat \u2013 Around 6:40 - \u201c(Lucas) But how do we get there...(Dustin) You cast Shadow-walk...(Lucas) In real life dummy...We can&amp;#39;t shadow-walk but, maybe she can\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When watching the show you automatically think Eleven is shadowwalking when she transfers her mind to the other realm. I did. But I&amp;#39;m starting to think that&amp;#39;s not shadow-walking at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because as stated that&amp;#39;s how you get to the Upside-Down, but we know that the Upside-Down looks nothing like the Psychic Realm. The Psychic Realm seems to encompass both realms and therefore is some sort of Inbetween place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s Shadow-Walking?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/h302jPS.jpg\"&gt;At the end of the season when Will is in the bathroom and he vomits the slug he seems to have a vision of the Upside-Down.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think that was a vision at all. I think Will shadow-walked and potentially disappeared from Earth-Realm for a moment or that his mind shadow-walked and he has a presence there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way this was a true depiction of shadow-walking, but Will is untrained in this power and can&amp;#39;t quite control it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/53CX0ko.jpg\"&gt;There is an image in the Season 2 Trailer where Will is in the Department of Energy Laboratory with his Mom Joyce.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think Will is going to reveal his powers to his Mom which will cause her to seek help from the Department of Energy, likely make contact with them through Hopper. I think in this image he is shadow-walking and perhaps in a coma-like state and that he&amp;#39;s doing this to bring back Eleven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember what their Science/AV teacher Mr. Clarke said when asked about the Vale of Shadows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 5: The Flea and the Acrobat \u2013 Around 19:20 \u201cEcho of the material world where necrotic and shadow magic rule\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that Will the Wise has become his Wizard and taken on powers from his exposure to the Upside-Down, that he now has Necromantic Shadow magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor X-Yoda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were noticeable amount of references to Yoda and Professor X in regard to Eleven:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2: The Weirdo on Maple Street \u2013 Around 21:15 - \u201c(Mike) Ready are you what knows you of ready, his names Yoda, he can use the force to move things with his mind\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/uOZAblR.jpg\"&gt;A clear parallel between Yoda and Eleven that relates her telekinetic powers to the force.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4: The Body \u2013 Around 16:20 - \u201c(Mike) I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s about that I think somehow she is channeling him... (Dustin) Like Professor X...\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here she is related to Professor X as being able to communicate with others. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 8: The Upside Down \u2013 Around 43:20 \u2013 Will has awoken in the hospital and they&amp;#39;re talking to her about 11 \u201c(Dustin) She&amp;#39;s basically a Wizard...(Lucas) She has superpowers...(Mike) More-like a Yoda\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again another reference to Yoda. I think this goes beyond references and analogies especially because it was mentioned again at the end of the show. I think this foreshadows two things. One that Eleven&amp;#39;s death has made her more powerful than we can possibly imagine. And two this is a reference to her return but not a physical return, at least not right away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is perhaps going to be more or less a \u201cForce Ghost\u201d for some time before her physical return. I don&amp;#39;t know how this will happen, she may develop a connection to Will because of his new powers or Mike because of their love connection. She may even be able to help them out with her powers at their request a la \u201cBeyond Two Souls\u201d (a video game about connected spirits).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The force ghost portion of the theory makes a lot more sense if  if Eleven&amp;#39;s corporeal body was destroyed. But I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the case. However...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The destroyed body theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Previously my theory was a little different and so this is sort of a summary of that because I think it&amp;#39;s also interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically everything is the same except Eleven&amp;#39;s body was destroyed, she exists as a consciousness within the inbetween but has become \u201cmore powerful than you can possibly imagine\u201d she now exists as Mike&amp;#39;s protector very much like \u201cBeyond Two Souls\u201d in that she can literally monitor him and be with him all the time if she wants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has been moving the food Hopper places to let them know she&amp;#39;s still alive while she figures out a way to communicate with her friends. She eventually creates a connection with Mike or Will. By the end of the season Will develops \u201cNecrotic\u201d magic or Necromancy and raises Eleven from the dead so that she can defeat the Thesselhydra. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t imagine that the show would get that weird or dark. Although I think the show is going to get a lot darker and start to incorporate concepts that are more magical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thesselhydra Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One last thing regarding Season 2: The Thesselhydra isn&amp;#39;t some weird giant Hydra, it&amp;#39;s a Giant Arachnid. &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/VcIjkMq.jpg\"&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure many people have pointed this out, it&amp;#39;s seems obvious because of the 8 legs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see in The Hobbit, not Lord of the Rings, a dark figure called the Necromancer, who is secretly Sauron, establishes himself in a place called Dol Guldur in Mirkwood, shortly after Giant Spiders infest Mirkwood these spiders are spawn of the Ungoliant a giant spider from the 1st age.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See the parallel? Will the Wise has returned to his home in Mirkwood with Necromantic powers. Expect a giant spiderling invasion of the town in addition to the Ungoliant aka the Thesselhydra. And only Eleven and some Fireballs can stop them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also note that this time it&amp;#39;s Will who has the connection with the Thesselhydra, that is after-all his drawing. Now maybe he was just drawing the Thesselhydra for their RPG use, but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s it. He knows the darkness is coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/7DcILDc.jpg\"&gt;This is Will&amp;#39;s house isn&amp;#39;t it? Do you think he&amp;#39;s shadow-walking or in a dream? Or have the realms begun to merge at this point?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Notable Things/Predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven will be adopted by Hopper or her Mom (Terry) will snap out of it take her back and Hopper will start dating Terry. Either way Hopper becomes Eleven&amp;#39;s caretaker. (Remember when Hopper visited Terry with Joyce and Terry&amp;#39;s sister kept saying that he would&amp;#39;ve gotten along really well with Terry, foreshadowing baby)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Shadow-walking to retrieve Eleven will work quite early on but I think the problem is Will won&amp;#39;t be able to control this power and he will accidentally merge the Realms &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dustin has mild Divination magic or you could see it as Luck Magic and he&amp;#39;s quite possibly the smartest of the five members of the gang. Which is why Mike refers to him as Mr. Fantastic and why he always seems to be able to predict things like when the Demogorgon/Thesselhydra is coming, what attack to use to defeat it (remember that the first fireball failed, he wanted to cast protection), and that the lunch lady kept a massive pile of pudding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL:DR&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 Eleven literally was the Demogorgon and when she killed it she killed herself and transformed into a \u201cForce Ghost\u201d and banished herself to the Upside-Down. Will the Wise has returned with  some level of necromantic shadow powers. Meanwhile the Ungoliant a.k.a. Thesselhydra, a giant Arachnid, has been growing in Mirkwood and is about to hatch spiderlings that will ravage the town as it reaches it&amp;#39;s full size. Will must use his new founds powers to bring back Eleven and defeat the town terror... and Dustin has spidey-sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**(There is a TL:DR at the bottom)**\n\nI made this post right after I watched Season 1 but it was right around the show released so I deleted it and have been waiting to post this.

Earth Realm \u2013 where the show takes place.\n\n2. The Vale of Shadows or Shadowplane or it's title in the show The Upside-Down.\n\n3. The Inbetween place or The Psychic Realm \u2013 This is the psychic realm that Eleven can enter, it allows her to access the minds of Russian military diplomats and steal secrets, she can do almost any psychic thing here.

However, if you recall, these portals take awhile to close. The one Will was taken through may have lasted until the morning and Nancy's portal through the tree took some time to close and these are tiny holes. The original gate was massive and probably took far longer potentially a day or two.\n\nAnd I'm sure most people know this, it's probably the first question everyone wanted an answer to at the end of the show. The reason Hopper is leaving the food in that box. He's feeding Eleven because what happens in our realm happens in the Upside-Down. A little more on this later.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Shadow-Walking**\n\nChapter 5: The Flea and the Acrobat \u2013 Around 6:40 - \u201c(Lucas) But how do we get there...(Dustin) You cast Shadow-walk...(Lucas) In real life dummy...We can't shadow-walk but, maybe she can\u201d\n\nWhen watching the show you automatically think Eleven is shadowwalking when she transfers her mind to the other realm. I did. But I'm starting to think that's not shadow-walking at all. \n\nBecause as stated that's how you get to the Upside-Down, but we know that the Upside-Down looks nothing like the Psychic Realm. The Psychic Realm seems to encompass both realms and therefore is some sort of Inbetween place.\n\nSo what's Shadow-Walking?\n\n[At the end of the season when Will is in the bathroom and he vomits the slug he seems to have a vision of the Upside-Down.](http://i.imgur.com/h302jPS.jpg)\n\nI don't think that was a vision at all. I think Will shadow-walked and potentially disappeared from Earth-Realm for a moment or that his mind shadow-walked and he has a presence there. \n\nEither way this was a true depiction of shadow-walking, but Will is untrained in this power and can't quite control it. \n\n[There is an image in the Season 2 Trailer where Will is in the Department of Energy Laboratory with his Mom Joyce.](http://i.imgur.com/53CX0ko.jpg)\n\nI think Will is going to reveal his powers to his Mom which will cause her to seek help from the Department of Energy, likely make contact with them through Hopper. I think in this image he is shadow-walking and perhaps in a coma-like state and that he's doing this to bring back Eleven.\n\nRemember what their Science/AV teacher Mr. Clarke said when asked about the Vale of Shadows:\n\nChapter 5: The Flea and the Acrobat \u2013 Around 19:20 \u201cEcho of the material world where necrotic and shadow magic rule\u201d\n\nIt's possible that Will the Wise has become his Wizard and taken on powers from his exposure to the Upside-Down, that he now has Necromantic Shadow magic.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Professor X-Yoda**\n\n\nThere were noticeable amount of references to Yoda and Professor X in regard to Eleven:\n\nChapter 2: The Weirdo on Maple Street \u2013 Around 21:15 - \u201c(Mike) Ready are you what knows you of ready, his names Yoda, he can use the force to move things with his mind\u201d\n\n[A clear parallel between Yoda and Eleven that relates her telekinetic powers to the force.](http://i.imgur.com/uOZAblR.jpg)\n\nChapter 4: The Body \u2013 Around 16:20 - \u201c(Mike) I don't think it's about that I think somehow she is channeling him... (Dustin) Like Professor X...\u201d \n\nHere she is related to Professor X as being able to communicate with others. \n\nChapter 8: The Upside Down \u2013 Around 43:20 \u2013 Will has awoken in the hospital and they're talking to her about 11 \u201c(Dustin) She's basically a Wizard...(Lucas) She has superpowers...(Mike) More-like a Yoda\u201d\n\nAgain another reference to Yoda. I think this goes beyond references and analogies especially because it was mentioned again at the end of the show. I think this foreshadows two things. One that Eleven's death has made her more powerful than we can possibly imagine. And two this is a reference to her return but not a physical return, at least not right away.\n\nShe is perhaps going to be more or less a \u201cForce Ghost\u201d for some time before her physical return. I don't know how this will happen, she may develop a connection to Will because of his new powers or Mike because of their love connection. She may even be able to help them out with her powers at their request a la \u201cBeyond Two Souls\u201d (a video game about connected spirits).\n\nThe force ghost portion of the theory makes a lot more sense if  if Eleven's corporeal body was destroyed. But I don't think that's the case. However...\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**The destroyed body theory**\n\nPreviously my theory was a little different and so this is sort of a summary of that because I think it's also interesting.\n\nBasically everything is the same except Eleven's body was destroyed, she exists as a consciousness within the inbetween but has become \u201cmore powerful than you can possibly imagine\u201d she now exists as Mike's protector very much like \u201cBeyond Two Souls\u201d in that she can literally monitor him and be with him all the time if she wants. \n\nShe has been moving the food Hopper places to let them know she's still alive while she figures out a way to communicate with her friends. She eventually creates a connection with Mike or Will. By the end of the season Will develops \u201cNecrotic\u201d magic or Necromancy and raises Eleven from the dead so that she can defeat the Thesselhydra. \n\nBut I can't imagine that the show would get that weird or dark. Although I think the show is going to get a lot darker and start to incorporate concepts that are more magical.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Thesselhydra Prediction**\n\nOne last thing regarding Season 2: The Thesselhydra isn't some weird giant Hydra, it's a Giant Arachnid. [I'm sure many people have pointed this out, it's seems obvious because of the 8 legs.](http://i.imgur.com/VcIjkMq.jpg)\n\nYou see in The Hobbit, not Lord of the Rings, a dark figure called the Necromancer, who is secretly Sauron, establishes himself in a place called Dol Guldur in Mirkwood, shortly after Giant Spiders infest Mirkwood these spiders are spawn of the Ungoliant a giant spider from the 1st age.\n\nSee the parallel? Will the Wise has returned to his home in Mirkwood with Necromantic powers. Expect a giant spiderling invasion of the town in addition to the Ungoliant aka the Thesselhydra. And only Eleven and some Fireballs can stop them.\n\nAlso note that this time it's Will who has the connection with the Thesselhydra, that is after-all his drawing. Now maybe he was just drawing the Thesselhydra for their RPG use, but I don't think that's it. He knows the darkness is coming.\n\n[This is Will's house isn't it? Do you think he's shadow-walking or in a dream? Or have the realms begun to merge at this point?](http://i.imgur.com/7DcILDc.jpg)\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Other Notable Things/Predictions**\n\n1. Eleven will be adopted by Hopper or her Mom (Terry) will snap out of it take her back and Hopper will start dating Terry. Either way Hopper becomes Eleven's caretaker. (Remember when Hopper visited Terry with Joyce and Terry's sister kept saying that he would've gotten along really well with Terry, foreshadowing baby)\n\n2. Will Shadow-walking to retrieve Eleven will work quite early on but I think the problem is Will won't be able to control this power and he will accidentally merge the Realms \n\n3. Dustin has mild Divination magic or you could see it as Luck Magic and he's quite possibly the smartest of the five members of the gang. Which is why Mike refers to him as Mr. Fantastic and why he always seems to be able to predict things like when the Demogorgon/Thesselhydra is coming, what attack to use to defeat it (remember that the first fireball failed, he wanted to cast protection), and that the lunch lady kept a massive pile of pudding.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**TL:DR** \u2013 Eleven literally was the Demogorgon and when she killed it she killed herself and transformed into a \u201cForce Ghost\u201d and banished herself to the Upside-Down. Will the Wise has returned with  some level of necromantic shadow powers. Meanwhile the Ungoliant a.k.a. Thesselhydra, a giant Arachnid, has been growing in Mirkwood and is about to hatch spiderlings that will ravage the town as it reaches it's full size. Will must use his new founds powers to bring back Eleven and defeat the town terror... and Dustin has spidey-sense.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null,
