Back then (when skyscrapers were still fairly new) they idea was to make buildings more and more stiff.  Basically brute-forcing through the problem the way that engineers are used to.  Have a big load?  Use a big beam.  Have a bigger load?  Bigger beam!  Unfortunately with wind and tall buildings, that's a problem that has very diminishing returns in terms of cost for structure vs. height.  So instead of brute force, engineers began applying other principles like harmonics to the problem, giving us these!  \n\nTwo examples of the brute force method in Chicago.  The first is the John Hancock.  It's a beautiful example of taking very basic engineering and super-sizing it to the calculated loads.  The X-bracing and the fact that the tower is tapered combine to make an incredibly strong building to resist the loads.  People hadn't dared to really do that before because they were wary of putting the X-Bracing on the exterior the way the Hancock has it.  It would ruin the view from inside and they thought that it would tank any sellability of the units within (the Hancock was designed as a mixed use building, including condos).  Surprisingly, the uniqueness more than made up for that and having a unit with a cross-bar in it became desirable!  \n\nThe second good example is the previously mentioned Sears Tower.  The goals from the beginning were very intimidating and there was a lot of concern over how to do it affordably.  Then finally one day, the engineer had a revelation.  A single tower could bend and break easily at the required height. But a [bundle of towers](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cEbNOcWDO8g/hqdefault.jpg) would be able to push back against each other and resist whatever wind loads tried to topple them!  \n\nBoth buildings were designed by architect Bruce Graham and engineer Fazlur Kahn working under the firm Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill.  ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sears Tower and others of its time approached resisting winds in a different way than Taipei and other tuned mass damper buildings.  Back then (when skyscrapers were still fairly new) they idea was to make buildings more and more stiff.  Basically brute-forcing through the problem the way that engineers are used to.  Have a big load?  Use a big beam.  Have a bigger load?  Bigger beam!  Unfortunately with wind and tall buildings, that&amp;#39;s a problem that has very diminishing returns in terms of cost for structure vs. height.  So instead of brute force, engineers began applying other principles like harmonics to the problem, giving us these!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two examples of the brute force method in Chicago.  The first is the John Hancock.  It&amp;#39;s a beautiful example of taking very basic engineering and super-sizing it to the calculated loads.  The X-bracing and the fact that the tower is tapered combine to make an incredibly strong building to resist the loads.  People hadn&amp;#39;t dared to really do that before because they were wary of putting the X-Bracing on the exterior the way the Hancock has it.  It would ruin the view from inside and they thought that it would tank any sellability of the units within (the Hancock was designed as a mixed use building, including condos).  Surprisingly, the uniqueness more than made up for that and having a unit with a cross-bar in it became desirable!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second good example is the previously mentioned Sears Tower.  The goals from the beginning were very intimidating and there was a lot of concern over how to do it affordably.  Then finally one day, the engineer had a revelation.  A single tower could bend and break easily at the required height.

The bolt he tightens is a slip critical connection. Two rough surfaced plates connected by a single, very large bolt, which is tensioned to an extreme force. These two plates can rotate relative to each other about the bolt. For a known coefficient of friction and a given length of the pendulum, different tensioning forces can be used to alter the rotational stiffness of the pendulum. Knowing the mass hanging from the pendulum, you can directly alter the pendulums natural frequency (wn = sqrt (k/m) ). Knowing this, and knowing the structures first natural frequency (the most prominent one), we make wn of the pendulum be out of phase of the buildings natural frequency. This is why you have to &amp;#39;tune&amp;#39; the damper. If tuned incorrectly, you could actually amplify the structural response by having the damper oscillate in phase with the building. This is basically constructive/destructive wave interference in practice. Where we control one wave to purposely cancel an unwanted wave being experienced by the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "educationalgifs", "name": "t1_dga5gmy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492252002.0, "created_utc": 1492223202.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w708", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65edhn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9u19j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "twitchosx", "parent_id": "t3_65edhn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/educationalgifs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Should have had part of the gif being the real one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohKqE_mwMmo", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should have had part of the gif being the real one &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohKqE_mwMmo\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohKqE_mwMmo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "educationalgifs", "name": "t1_dg9u19j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492236505.0, "created_utc": 1492207705.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w708", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65edhn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w708", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65edhn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9sqlr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CoryDeezNutz", "parent_id": "t1_dg9pqap", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/educationalgifs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "el productoooo", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;el productoooo&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "educationalgifs", "name": "t1_dg9sqlr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492234825.0, "created_utc": 1492206025.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9pqap", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "userexec", "parent_id": "t3_65edhn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/educationalgifs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah that's the shit.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah that&amp;#39;s the shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "educationalgifs", "name": "t1_dg9pqap", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492231060.0, "created_utc": 1492202260.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w708", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65edhn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w708", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65edhn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9t8ty", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mcjacver", "parent_id": "t1_dg9s8k3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/educationalgifs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Like this.](https://imgur.com/gallery/50QAw) ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/50QAw\"&gt;Like this.&lt;/a&gt;
