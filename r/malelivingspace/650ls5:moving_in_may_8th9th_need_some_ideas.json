I work from home quite often but at the same time it&amp;#39;s just nice to have for games &amp;amp; entertainment purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is iffy. I&amp;#39;d love to have friends over and have them stay with me. Only problem is this being a 1/1. I got a 1/1 for the sole purpose to be able to just focus on myself for the next few years and not really dabble in relationships. That and it forces me to realize how much clutter I had and to get rid of it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "malelivingspace", "name": "t1_dg82mo9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492140216.0, "created_utc": 1492111416.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg81qfy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "l80", "parent_id": "t3_650ls5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/malelivingspace", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Congratulations!\n\nWhat *I* would do with the space isn't necessarily what you should do with it :) \n\nQuestions to ask yourself:\n\n1.
