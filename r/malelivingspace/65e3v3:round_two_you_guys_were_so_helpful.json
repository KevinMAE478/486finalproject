Really digging that office nook. \n\nNow, in my opinion, you need some more art on the walls, some plants, and a few odds and ends to really finish it off.\n\nIn picture one, on the left side of your kitchen cabinets, you could put some art next to the cabinet, but far enough away from the TV that it doesn't blend in. \n\nPicture 4 -- the shot of your hallway. Looks pretty bare in there. I'd put a long picture or two along the walls, maybe a shelf for your keys, coats, and mail. You could also play with something along [these](http://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Light-up-your-entranceway-with-some-stunning-images.jpg) lines. Not sure if you have a closet on the left side of that hallway or not, but you could put multiple pictures like the link (ex 3 in a column x 4 in a row).\n\nThe wall with the air duct on it. A floating shelf with some knickknacks, a plant, or just art above the light switch would go nicely. Under the light switch, I'd set a tall plant with a nice pot on the ground.\n\nBookcase looks great! Shows your personal flair and interests. Not too cluttered, not too empty. \n\nTV is a bit too high for my liking (as others have mentioned), but may work well for you if you watch from your desk at times. Cables can be hidden, though not a huge issue. A square ottoman similar to [this](http://www.grounddancer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Modern-wood-coffee-table-reclaimed-metal-mid-century-round-natural-diy-padded-square-ottoman-coffee-table-with-storage-detail.jpg) (though a touch smaller) may serve you well as a coffee table.\n\nPlace looks absolutely great, glad it's worked out well for you!

Really digging that office nook. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, in my opinion, you need some more art on the walls, some plants, and a few odds and ends to really finish it off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In picture one, on the left side of your kitchen cabinets, you could put some art next to the cabinet, but far enough away from the TV that it doesn&amp;#39;t blend in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Picture 4 -- the shot of your hallway. Looks pretty bare in there. I&amp;#39;d put a long picture or two along the walls, maybe a shelf for your keys, coats, and mail. You could also play with something along &lt;a href=\"http://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Light-up-your-entranceway-with-some-stunning-images.jpg\"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; lines. Not sure if you have a closet on the left side of that hallway or not, but you could put multiple pictures like the link (ex 3 in a column x 4 in a row).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wall with the air duct on it. A floating shelf with some knickknacks, a plant, or just art above the light switch would go nicely. Under the light switch, I&amp;#39;d set a tall plant with a nice pot on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bookcase looks great! Shows your personal flair and interests. Not too cluttered, not too empty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TV is a bit too high for my liking (as others have mentioned), but may work well for you if you watch from your desk at times.
