I played 1-3....again....right before Andromeda came out. I love Mass Effect and BADLY wanted this to be awesome. I have N7 clothes, models of the Normandy...hell, my wife's PC is named Edi. Andromeda just does not feel like a Mass Effect game.\n\nI'll start all this...something I put on Facebook back on the 3rd...by saying IN MY OPINION (which doesn't seem to matter here if the opinion differs from yours it's bandwagon hopping)...\n\n\"At this point I\u2019m about 47 hours into Mass Effect: Andromeda and just wanted to jot down and share my thoughts on the game. First, I am enjoying it. I really dig the addition of the jump pack and what it does for combat\u2026and running around in general honestly. The Tempest is pretty cool and the Nomad is the best land vehicle ever in the Mass Effect franchise. It\u2019s an interesting story and there are nods to the original trilogy troughout. You have some interesting companions and a cool bad guy with some questionable motivations that makes him more than just a generic big-bad.\n\nHowever\u2026\n\nIt does not feel like Mass Effect. It has most of the hallmarks\u2026the alien races you know, a cool ship, familiar weapons and powers, relationship building, deciding which crew member you want to sleep with\u2026all the good stuff. But it also feels like someone who liked Skyrim a bit too much wrote this as some kind of Mass Effect fan fiction. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I DID enjoy Skyrim, though for me, it was a far cry from the orgasmic experience a lot of people made it out to be (plus, they aren\u2019t fucking dragons\u2026they are wyvern\u2026.dragons have 4 legs and wings).\n\nMass Effect is a story driven by missions (and a reasonable number of side missions) that take you to various locations in space and occasionally on the surface of some random planet. Andromeda takes place occasionally on a ship or space station, but mainly running or driving around on the surface of a planet. There are way, way, WAY too many side quests that belong more in Skyrim or MMO\u2019s that have really no point being in the game. This leaves you with a cluttered map, indistinct waypoints, fighting off random bad guys and animals, etc. It\u2019s stuff that hasn\u2019t been in a Mass Effect game and really didn\u2019t need to be. It\u2019s tacked on, offers nothing but a list of \u201chere\u2019s some shit you can do\u201d, and takes away from the main story.\n\nThere is also the (ultimately pointless) addition of crafting using resources you collect with a scanner. You can use these to make items from blueprints you find, yadda yadda yadda. You add modifications and tweak the appearance of what a weapon fires. And none it makes anything that much better than a stuff you find or buy at a vendor. Again, another pointless addition that adds nothing to the overall narrative and just tacks on \u201cshit you can do.\u201d\n\nNow\u2026for that overall narrative. While it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s unfortunate they fall back on the \u201crelics of an unknown ancient race\u201d thing. That was 1-3\u2026they were Prothians. Liara loved them until Javik turned out to be kind of a dick. We\u2019ve been there.\nStill, it\u2019s an interesting story\u2026but not without some hiccups.\n\nQuestion for ya, in Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3\u2026who were your favorite companions? \n\nWho did you like the most in your crew? Who did you like talking to the most? Pick your number 1 crew member.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nDid you name a human not named Jack or Katsumi? No, you probably didn\u2019t. The humans were pretty damn dull. Ashley was a boring, untrusting, xenophobe. Kaiden was\u2026well\u2026for the majority of people, boring for a half a game then dead. Miranda was bitchy, but somewhat dull bitchy. Zaeed, cool that he founded the Blue Suns, boring otherwise. James wasn\u2019t bad\u2026I dug his eggs\u2026but really didn\u2019t care all that much.\n\nOh, yeah, and Jacob. I almost forgot about Jacob. Because, well, fuck Jacob.\n\nGarrus, Liara, Wrex, Grunt, Thane, Mordin, Tali, Legion, Samara, EDI\u2026these were the cool kids.\n\nHell, when Mordin died\u2026Martie teared up. Double hell, when I did a full play-through, 1-3, as fem-Shep and had a relationship with Garrus all the way through\u2026.when they say goodbye in 3? I teared up!\n\nThat shit was heartbreaking!\n\nThose were the people you cared about. Not the humans (again, save Jack and Katsumi).\n\nAndromeda?\n\nToo many fucking humans.\n\nAnd none of them as interesting as the exceptions mentioned above. (I\u2019m going to asterisk that with a \u201cyet\u201d. Cora Harper might be an exception well down the road\u2026she shares the same last name as the Illusive Man). Peebee and Drack are cool, Vetra and Jaal aren\u2019t too shabby. Even one of your occasional conversational companions, your pilot, a Salarian named Kallo is better to talk with than pretty much any of the humans. But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll spend more time talking with Jaals people, the Angara.\n\nAnd Christ, can that be a slog.\n\nGot another question for those of you who played 1-3: What all can you tell me about this culture and history of the Asari, Turian, Salarian, Quarian, Krogan, Drell, Batarian, Hanar, Elcor, Geth (heretic and not), Prothian, and Reaper \u201cpeople\u201d?\n\nGo ahead, take your time.\n\nWhen you\u2019re done\u2026it still won\u2019t be as much as you\u2019ll know about the Angara. And you just won\u2019t care. Especially if you\u2019re talking with a female Angara because you\u2019ll just be enthralled at how fucking weird the character models look\u2026.from the face to the malformed, gumby looking bodies\u2026it\u2019s just not good. And it gets even more odd when Jaal takes his shirt off\u2026.I mean seriously, people. Five years and that\u2019s really the best ya got?\n\nBut back to their history. Who gives a shit? That\u2019s the problem. With all the other races I listed that give you bits here and there, occasionally a good chunk at once, but it left you wanting to know more. They made the characters interesting and then you wanted to know about em. They do the reverse here and it does a great disservice to the game and the noble Angara people. They dump SO MUCH info on you, you gloss over, get that thousand yard stare, and just\u2026.don\u2019t\u2026.care.\n\nI\u2019m a fucking Pathfinder, not damn cultural xenoanthropologist.\nNow that brings me to being a Pathfinder. Bioware/EA said this is not the start of a new trilogy and really, that could explain their desire to cram all this into one game. But that also means they fall back on the traditional hero\u2019s journey.\n\nIn Mass Effect, you were already a bad ass. You were N7. The game starts with you being made a BIGGER badass in becoming a specter. That\u2019s not a normal story. That made it different. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the traditional hero\u2019s journey can be done really well (Dragon Age: Origins\u2026need I say more?).\n\nBut here it just seems\u2026.meh.\n\nYou\u2019re young, unproven, thrust into a situation you\u2019re not prepared for\u2026.blah blah blah. It\u2019s not BAD, it\u2019s just not as interesting as you\u2019d hope from Mass Effect.\n\nThis is a lot of bitching, I know, but don\u2019t think I don\u2019t like the game. I do. It\u2019s a good game.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the problem.\n\nMass Effect wasn\u2019t a good game. Mass Effect was a great game. You really cared. Not just about Shepherd either.\n\nAfter all\u2026there is no Shepherd without Vakarian.\n\nThere could be more to it. Like I said, I haven\u2019t finished it. I just don\u2019t see this game tying up all the loose ends or creating excitement for the next installment. I don\u2019t see something as cool as a rogue artificial intelligence on the moon killing a bunch of people in 1, getting stolen by the Illusive Man and used as the basis of the Normandy\u2019s AI in 2, only to get a body and be your sexy-ass AI crew member AND ship in 3, ever happening here.\n\nI\u2019m sure there will be interesting questions left unanswered\u2026but I just don\u2019t really care as much.\n\nSo, while I\u2019ll certainly enjoy getting through Andromeda, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m really looking forward to playing it again. And again, and again, and again like I did with 1-3.\n\nSo for now, Bioware/EA\u2026..you can keep your Andromeda Initiative logo and your Tempest outline patch.\n\nI\u2019ll end up back on the Normandy getting my N7 gear together.\"\n\nAgain, it's not your opinion (and I'm not going to stoop to calling you a fanboy despite the bandwagon hopping grenade being lobbed my way), but it sure as shit is mine. \n\nI've simply had a better time playing For Honor with my friends than playing a Mass Effect game that departs too much from what made the first three more unique and interesting.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like hell I am.
