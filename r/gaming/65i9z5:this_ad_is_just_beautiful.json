When the hype dies, the sales fall off a cliff.  I really don't know anything at all about their supply chain, but it seems that Nintendo has been increasingly reliant on \"off-the-shelf\" hardware ever since the Wii.  For example, there was a little \"ATI\" logo stamped on the Wii because Nintendo used a regular graphics card for that console, and so ATI \"owned\" part of that device.\n\nSo I'm guessing they don't have a ton of vertical integration for hardware manufacturing.  Compare that to Apple, which has been aggressively working to own as much of their hardware manufacturing process as possible, even going as far as to manufacture their own CPUs (iPhones have an \"A9\" chip or whatever, while other smartphones just buy hardware from companies like Samsung, AMD, nVidia, Qualcomm, etc).\n\nThe downside of 100% vertical integration is that if Nintendo wanted to make a new Zelda, they would have to control, manage, and pay for everything that Zelda runs on-- the silicon, the enclosure, the LCD screens, the joysticks, even the plastic game cases and printing of brochures.  It's insane when you think about it.  The upshot is that when you have complete control over everything, you can \"stop the presses\" at a moment's notice.\n\nSo Nintendo doesn't do vertical integration.  Again, I have no insider info, but it's become increasingly clear simply by Googling around.  For example here's a [Polygon article](http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/11/13597620/nes-classic-edition-teardown) that shows the NES classic is just a bunch of off-the-shelf hardware crammed into an offically trademarked plastic box.  And this makes perfect sense.  It's also notable that the Nintendo Switch is also completely outsourced, from the nVidia graphics to the USB-C port, microSD slot, Bluetooth, HDMI, etc.\n\nIt makes sense for them too-- they're a software company that happens to be in the advantageous position of being able to make such incredibly high quality software that people are willing to buy custom hardware just to play it.  Imagine if EA Games tried to sell a console, and it was the only way to play games featuring their intellectual property.  Holy shit, that would be their single biggest blunder.\n\nBut I digress:  The NES Classic is \"Nintendo\" only in terms of IP.  They're just buying electronics from various hardware manufacturers, gluing them together, installing an emulator, and slapping their logo on it.  It's a fun product, but we all know it isn't going to last.  And here's the thing:  Nintendo surely gets a better deal on all this third-party hardware than you or I would, but only because they're placing massive bulk orders.\n\nAnd that's the kicker, in my opinion.  They might have sold a ton of NES Classic consoles, but the holiday season is over and the hype is sure to die soon.  Say they placed an initial order for 500 million \"Mali400MP2\" GPUs to build all these cute little consoles, and they got a quote from the manufacturer saying it would cost 50 cents per unit.  Good news:  They recovered that 250 million cost by completely selling out!  But they know the hype is going to die, and buying another 500 million seems like it might be overkill.  Maybe they order 250 million.  Except now that the order is smaller, the cost per unit has jumped up to 75 cents per unit (I am completely making these numbers up).\n\nSo it's a gamble that gets increasingly risky the longer you play.  They already made a ton of money from the NES Classic, but as the hype dies, they'll have to make smaller orders and the cost per unit is going to increase.  My guess is that they're still licking their wounds from what happened with the Wii.  Those things sold shockingly well, until they woke up one morning and suddenly nobody wanted a Wii anymore.  I bet that there was a very specific \"oh shit\" day at Nintendo HQ when they saw that Wii sales had plummeted while they had millions of optimistically-built units sitting in their warehouses.\n\nTo me, cancelling the NES Classic is a good example of \"quit while you're ahead\".  I can't imagine how much the Wii is still burned into the memory of every executive at Nintendo.  They built something so popular that it became a global social phenomenon, and then suddenly it just died, and they had their worst fiscal year in ages.  Because they'd bought and assembled a bunch of Wiis that would never be sold.\n\nI'll admit that this is way too long of a response to \"WHY!?!?\" but I do find it interesting.  I'm only just starting to understand terms like \"vertical integration\" myself, but it does help to clarify why certain things are the way they are.  Comparing Nintendo to Apple is very illuminating.  Both companies have insane brand recognition, but they do business very differently.  Ever since Steve Jobs died and Tim Cook became the CEO, people have been predicting the death of Apple.  Instead, their stock price has more than doubled since the day he died.  Jobs was the charismatic leader, but Cook is the king of the supply chain.  He's pushed for vertical integration, and it's been working beautifully.  Apple makes a crap product like the Watch?  They just scale back production.  \n\nBecause of vertical integration, Apple can fine-tune their manufacturing to such a precise degree that they'll keep selling Apple Watches right up until the last profitable watch is sold, even though it's clearly a failing product.  On the other hand, Nintendo sells products that they don't build, so they have nowhere near the degree of granularity when it comes to predicting how their things will sell tomorrow.  Neither company can predict the future, but Apple can change everything in a relative instant, while Nintendo has to make an educated guess about how the world is going to look 6 months down the line.\n\nAlso, I'm guessing the cancellation of the NES classic is going to conveniently correspond to a sudden influx of Classic NES games being sold for the Switch on the Nintendo eShop, along with various limited-edition consoles and themed peripherals.  That being said, I fucking love Nintendo and hope I can die without seeing them go out of business.  People who claim that the Switch is currently a $350 Zelda game are basically right, and I don't give a flying fuck.  100% worth it.  \n\nOn a final note, if you wanted an NES Classic and couldn't get one or don't want to get price-gouged from a hoarder-reseller, I'd do this:\n\n1. Buy a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Model-A1-2GHz-64-bit-quad-core/dp/B01CD5VC92/)\n2. Put it in an [NES Case](https://www.amazon.com/Old-Skool-NES-case-Raspberry/dp/B01M4OOY4U/)\n3. You could buy [2 USB NES Controllers](https://www.amazon.com/EEEKit-Nintendo-Controller-Computer-Raspberry/dp/B01N9K6QE3/) for the price of a fancy sandwich, but why not class it up a bit and get some [Bluetooth SNES Controllers](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Bluetooth-Controller-Classic-Joystick/dp/B014QP2H1E/)?  Also, if you have unused PS3 controllers laying around and don't mind the lack of authenticity, skip this step.\n4. Buy a [microSD card](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-microSDHC-Standard-Packaging-SDSQUNC-032G-GN6MA/dp/B010Q57T02/) (32 gb is massive overkill for NES ROMs, but if you bought nicer controllers then you'll probably find yourself wanting to try out some SNES/N64/Playstation games)\n5. Download [lakka.tv](http://www.lakka.tv/) and follow the very simple installation instructions.\n6. Get NES ROMs from the internet, they're almost easier to find than porn.\n\nTotal cost (including the NES controllers and the microSD card) rounds up to $85.  And a cheaper Pi will play NES games just fine, nor do you HAVE to buy the $20 NES-themed plastic case I just randomly found on Amazon.  Plus you're not limited to the games that were included on the NES Classic, and once you get bored with playing 30 year-old games there are plenty of other things to do with a Pi...  Like write unnecessarily long Reddit posts, which I've just finished doing!", "edited": 1492278502.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first I was surprised as well, but the more I think about it, it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The NES Classic is selling like hotcakes because of hype.  When the hype dies, the sales fall off a cliff.  I really don&amp;#39;t know anything at all about their supply chain, but it seems that Nintendo has been increasingly reliant on &amp;quot;off-the-shelf&amp;quot; hardware ever since the Wii.  For example, there was a little &amp;quot;ATI&amp;quot; logo stamped on the Wii because Nintendo used a regular graphics card for that console, and so ATI &amp;quot;owned&amp;quot; part of that device.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m guessing they don&amp;#39;t have a ton of vertical integration for hardware manufacturing.  Compare that to Apple, which has been aggressively working to own as much of their hardware manufacturing process as possible, even going as far as to manufacture their own CPUs (iPhones have an &amp;quot;A9&amp;quot; chip or whatever, while other smartphones just buy hardware from companies like Samsung, AMD, nVidia, Qualcomm, etc).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The downside of 100% vertical integration is that if Nintendo wanted to make a new Zelda, they would have to control, manage, and pay for everything that Zelda runs on-- the silicon, the enclosure, the LCD screens, the joysticks, even the plastic game cases and printing of brochures.  It&amp;#39;s insane when you think about it.  The upshot is that when you have complete control over everything, you can &amp;quot;stop the presses&amp;quot; at a moment&amp;#39;s notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Nintendo doesn&amp;#39;t do vertical integration.  Again, I have no insider info, but it&amp;#39;s become increasingly clear simply by Googling around.  For example here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/11/13597620/nes-classic-edition-teardown\"&gt;Polygon article&lt;/a&gt; that shows the NES classic is just a bunch of off-the-shelf hardware crammed into an offically trademarked plastic box.  And this makes perfect sense.  It&amp;#39;s also notable that the Nintendo Switch is also completely outsourced, from the nVidia graphics to the USB-C port, microSD slot, Bluetooth, HDMI, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes sense for them too-- they&amp;#39;re a software company that happens to be in the advantageous position of being able to make such incredibly high quality software that people are willing to buy custom hardware just to play it.  Imagine if EA Games tried to sell a console, and it was the only way to play games featuring their intellectual property.  Holy shit, that would be their single biggest blunder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I digress:  The NES Classic is &amp;quot;Nintendo&amp;quot; only in terms of IP.  They&amp;#39;re just buying electronics from various hardware manufacturers, gluing them together, installing an emulator, and slapping their logo on it.  It&amp;#39;s a fun product, but we all know it isn&amp;#39;t going to last.  And here&amp;#39;s the thing:  Nintendo surely gets a better deal on all this third-party hardware than you or I would, but only because they&amp;#39;re placing massive bulk orders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the kicker, in my opinion.  They might have sold a ton of NES Classic consoles, but the holiday season is over and the hype is sure to die soon.  Say they placed an initial order for 500 million &amp;quot;Mali400MP2&amp;quot; GPUs to build all these cute little consoles, and they got a quote from the manufacturer saying it would cost 50 cents per unit.  Good news:  They recovered that 250 million cost by completely selling out!  But they know the hype is going to die, and buying another 500 million seems like it might be overkill.  Maybe they order 250 million.  Except now that the order is smaller, the cost per unit has jumped up to 75 cents per unit (I am completely making these numbers up).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s a gamble that gets increasingly risky the longer you play.  They already made a ton of money from the NES Classic, but as the hype dies, they&amp;#39;ll have to make smaller orders and the cost per unit is going to increase.  My guess is that they&amp;#39;re still licking their wounds from what happened with the Wii.  Those things sold shockingly well, until they woke up one morning and suddenly nobody wanted a Wii anymore.  I bet that there was a very specific &amp;quot;oh shit&amp;quot; day at Nintendo HQ when they saw that Wii sales had plummeted while they had millions of optimistically-built units sitting in their warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, cancelling the NES Classic is a good example of &amp;quot;quit while you&amp;#39;re ahead&amp;quot;.  I can&amp;#39;t imagine how much the Wii is still burned into the memory of every executive at Nintendo.  They built something so popular that it became a global social phenomenon, and then suddenly it just died, and they had their worst fiscal year in ages.  Because they&amp;#39;d bought and assembled a bunch of Wiis that would never be sold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll admit that this is way too long of a response to &amp;quot;WHY!?!?&amp;quot; but I do find it interesting.  I&amp;#39;m only just starting to understand terms like &amp;quot;vertical integration&amp;quot; myself, but it does help to clarify why certain things are the way they are.  Comparing Nintendo to Apple is very illuminating.  Both companies have insane brand recognition, but they do business very differently.  Ever since Steve Jobs died and Tim Cook became the CEO, people have been predicting the death of Apple.  Instead, their stock price has more than doubled since the day he died.  Jobs was the charismatic leader, but Cook is the king of the supply chain.  He&amp;#39;s pushed for vertical integration, and it&amp;#39;s been working beautifully.  Apple makes a crap product like the Watch?  They just scale back production.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of vertical integration, Apple can fine-tune their manufacturing to such a precise degree that they&amp;#39;ll keep selling Apple Watches right up until the last profitable watch is sold, even though it&amp;#39;s clearly a failing product.  On the other hand, Nintendo sells products that they don&amp;#39;t build, so they have nowhere near the degree of granularity when it comes to predicting how their things will sell tomorrow.  Neither company can predict the future, but Apple can change everything in a relative instant, while Nintendo has to make an educated guess about how the world is going to look 6 months down the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;m guessing the cancellation of the NES classic is going to conveniently correspond to a sudden influx of Classic NES games being sold for the Switch on the Nintendo eShop, along with various limited-edition consoles and themed peripherals.

You also have to protect yourself from weather and from environmental dangers.  Rain makes you slip off cliffs as you're climbing.  You have to take off metal equipment in a thunderstorm.  You need heat resistance (which you get from clothing or consumables) in order to traverse a desert, cold resistance for snowy areas, flame resistance for a volcanic area and etc. This makes the game feel like less of a theme park and more like an adventure filled with challenges and skill-based exercises.  \n\nAnother thing that sets it apart is the level control you have on the world.
