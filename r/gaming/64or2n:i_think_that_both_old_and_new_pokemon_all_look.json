That was 2002. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay heres some new pokemon with pointy eyes: &lt;a href=\"http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/8/84/784Kommo-o.png\"&gt;kommo-o&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/8/8b/697Tyrantrum.png/600px-697Tyrantrum.png\"&gt;tyrantrum&lt;/a&gt; There&amp;#39;s also a lot of other eye types. And eyes based on a circle can have a lot more expression variations than angry triangle with a tiny pupil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And some old pokemon with circle eyes: Psyduck, slowpoke, pikachu, farfetch&amp;#39;d, poliwag etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically they changed their art style before 2002 and people are still complaining about it. I don&amp;#39;t know a lot about anime but it seems like it&amp;#39;s gotten less pointier since the 90s in general. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gaming", "name": "t1_dg485do", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491945064.0, "created_utc": 1491916264.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh03", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64or2n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg451ue", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 32, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dwaatwood", "parent_id": "t3_64or2n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nice cherry picking.
