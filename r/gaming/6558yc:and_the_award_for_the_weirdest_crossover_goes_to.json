Magic works a little differently each game. In the first game the basic spells like fire, blizzard, thunder get three levels in the predictable JRPG name schemes, and cost 1mp. As well, there are other typical JRPG spells like Stop and Gravity.  There are special techniques which use typical JRPG names like Ars Technica, Ragnaraok etc. and use 3+ mp. In KH1 max natural mp is 10 if you choose magic in the beginning phase, it can get higher with items. \n\nIn KH2, you get 100mp and spells use varying amounts of mp. Once your mp is used up it's on a timer and then refills. The spells are the same, except the way they work is a little different. In KH1 fire, and blizzard are projectiles, and thunder zaps the targeted enemy. In KH2, magic is much more dynamic and much more fun. Fire creates a ring of flames that flies around you for a second, great when surrounded. Blizzard works more like a cone with very limited range. Thunder is pretty similar in both games. As well as the above, in KH2 the magic works in a combo. I believe it's three normal strikes, and then a final more powerful, visually grander strike. \n\nKH2 also introduced a system calls Forms, where you join powers with one or more of the original party members (not the world guest) and change how your combat mechanics work. There are four forms (technically five, or six if you're playing final mix). Valor form needs Goofy and is focused on melee. Wisdom uses Donald and is focused on magic use. Master uses both and is balanced between melee and magic. Final form also uses both and similar to Master, except it's balance is leaning more towards magic use, but also with strong melee. There's also a chance that when you use a form you could potentially go into Anti Form, which uses both Donald and Goofy. This form is kind of a punishment for over use of the forms, as it disables reactions, defensive moves, items and magic use. However, it's a very fast form and though it's individual strikes don't hit very hard, you can still take decent chunks with its combos. Every time you use a form it ticks a counter that increases the chance that you'll turn into Anti form instead of whichever form you chose. That counter resets to 0 after you return from Anti. Once you earn Final Form, this goes away and you no longer enter Anti Form. The Final Mix release of the game also included Limit Form, which uses neither party members.

Magic works a little differently each game. In the first game the basic spells like fire, blizzard, thunder get three levels in the predictable JRPG name schemes, and cost 1mp. As well, there are other typical JRPG spells like Stop and Gravity.  There are special techniques which use typical JRPG names like Ars Technica, Ragnaraok etc. and use 3+ mp. In KH1 max natural mp is 10 if you choose magic in the beginning phase, it can get higher with items. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In KH2, you get 100mp and spells use varying amounts of mp. Once your mp is used up it&amp;#39;s on a timer and then refills. The spells are the same, except the way they work is a little different. In KH1 fire, and blizzard are projectiles, and thunder zaps the targeted enemy. In KH2, magic is much more dynamic and much more fun. Fire creates a ring of flames that flies around you for a second, great when surrounded. Blizzard works more like a cone with very limited range. Thunder is pretty similar in both games. As well as the above, in KH2 the magic works in a combo.
