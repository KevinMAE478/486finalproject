Nick had seen a log some ways around the field, maybe half a kilometre from a fenced off clump of forest. Between the lot of them they rolled the log over to a hole blown into the ground from an earlier excercise, whipped out notepads and did some calculations before finally setting two charges. They get some distance, get behind cover and are discussing optimal timings when Nick hears a deep voice dripping with command behind him, \"Oh, what's this excercise?

Where else are you going to learn Feilding electronics repair, or demolitions!\n\nWhich brings us to our tale! My uncle was lucky enough to be on his first demolitions course, bright eyed private he was and keen to add a qualification for a slightly bigger pittance, but what do you want for a part time job anyways? They'd done all the book work and theory, the safety and calculations and then was the time to put it into practice: actual excercises in the field (literally an open field with holes blown in it) with real explosives!\n\nThey had a set list of excercises to work through and upon completion of the second last my uncle and his fellows trudged back to the quarter master's to get their last allotment of compound for the excercises. Upon spying the literal hundreds of kilos of remaining explosives behind the QM my uncle asks, \"Oh, so the others aren't far through then? You've still got quite a bit of explosive left!\"\n\nThe QM looks up from his clipboard and shrugs, \"Actually most are just about finished.\"\n\nMy uncle scoffs, \"Typical ADF, not enough logistics when it's really needed, way too much when it's utterly superfluous. I really pitty you poor blokes who have to lug all that back after the excercises!\"\n\nGod above only knows what was going through the mind of this older, defence force inured QM, he surely must have known what was coming after he said what he said next. \"Actually the whole lot has been marked for disposal. I'll have to get rid of any that's left here at the end of the day...\"\n\nI wasn't there of course, but I like to think those words lingered in the air, a weight, a *gravitas* behind them akin to a hundred thousand generals giving somber addresses. A weight to great that I imagine a singularity formed with two branching quantum paths, one less interesting, and the one I thank the gods above I happen to reside in today.\n\nMy uncle asked, \"So can we get our last lot of explosive for the final test, and thrown in whatever you don't feel like disposing of yourself, mate.\" Surely a wry wink accompanied this.\n\nFive minutes later my uncle and his buddy are stomping back to their group laden down with 40 kilograms of explosives *above what was required for them to successfully finish the course.* \"Holy shit! Private Nick! What the hell are you doing? Did you mug the QM? Are we all in for a courts martial?\"\n\nMy uncle, sweating heavily replied, \"Nah, mate, she'll be right. We've got to finish these excercises so we can,\" he looks around, \"have some fun!\"\n\nThey finished up their excercise, got ticked off by the instructor who was similarly enthused with Private Nick's idea, and then they were one more. Nick had seen a log some ways around the field, maybe half a kilometre from a fenced off clump of forest. Between the lot of them they rolled the log over to a hole blown into the ground from an earlier excercise, whipped out notepads and did some calculations before finally setting two charges. They get some distance, get behind cover and are discussing optimal timings when Nick hears a deep voice dripping with command behind him, \"Oh, what's this excercise? It's nothing I recognise from the outline.\"\n\nWith horror burning through his soul my uncle turned around, to find a general who was obviously observing the training. Now my uncle, Private Nick, figures that someone who's a General probably has a bullshit detector finely tuned to absolute perfection from years of dealing almost exclusively with other officers. He saw he had two options: lie, and try to get through the mental gymnastic hurdles of subsequent questions on the holes in his first story; or tell the truth in the hopes that being technically not in breach of any direct orders would be enough to save him.\n\nHe looked to his instructor who's transfixed and turned very white. *Well,* he reasons *can't get busted lower than private...* \"Sir, I'm happy to explain...\" \n\n&gt; Explanation ensues\n\n\"... So you see I thought we could set two charges off with similar but offset times, one to sit in the bottom of the hole, over which we positioned the log, and the other, smaller, strapped to the back of it to send it towards the forest over there.\"\n\nThe General listened intently, \"Sort of like a tennis serve?\"\n\n\"Uh. Yeah...\"\n\n\"And is this the minimum safe distance?\" the general enquired, getting down on the ground with the trainees and instructor.\n\nFinal preparations were made and a show was put on by some earnest Privates and one grateful instructor for a general that day. They couldn't even find most of the log in the end, but they did find a shard of it as big as a grown man's leg about 600 metres into the forest.

It&amp;#39;s nothing I recognise from the outline.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With horror burning through his soul my uncle turned around, to find a general who was obviously observing the training. Now my uncle, Private Nick, figures that someone who&amp;#39;s a General probably has a bullshit detector finely tuned to absolute perfection from years of dealing almost exclusively with other officers. He saw he had two options: lie, and try to get through the mental gymnastic hurdles of subsequent questions on the holes in his first story; or tell the truth in the hopes that being technically not in breach of any direct orders would be enough to save him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He looked to his instructor who&amp;#39;s transfixed and turned very white. &lt;em&gt;Well,&lt;/em&gt; he reasons &lt;em&gt;can&amp;#39;t get busted lower than private...&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Sir, I&amp;#39;m happy to explain...&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Explanation ensues&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;... So you see I thought we could set two charges off with similar but offset times, one to sit in the bottom of the hole, over which we positioned the log, and the other, smaller, strapped to the back of it to send it towards the forest over there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The General listened intently, &amp;quot;Sort of like a tennis serve?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uh. Yeah...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And is this the minimum safe distance?&amp;quot; the general enquired, getting down on the ground with the trainees and instructor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Final preparations were made and a show was put on by some earnest Privates and one grateful instructor for a general that day. They couldn&amp;#39;t even find most of the log in the end, but they did find a shard of it as big as a grown man&amp;#39;s leg about 600 metres into the forest. After receiving permission from the general to operate a quick search outside the approved area, of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gaming", "name": "t1_dg5j4y3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492004338.0, "created_utc": 1491975538.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh03", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64uc9c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5crga", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SnoTheLeopard", "parent_id": "t3_64uc9c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Stick win every time", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stick win every time&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gaming", "name": "t1_dg5crga", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491993720.0, "created_utc": 1491964920.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh03", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64uc9c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5dbrr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "The_Fattest_Camel", "parent_id": "t3_64uc9c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Man I miss playing this game", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Man I miss playing this game&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gaming", "name": "t1_dg5dbrr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491994504.0, "created_utc": 1491965704.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh03", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64uc9c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5e259", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jsting", "parent_id": "t3_64uc9c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This looks like something out of Just Cause 2.
