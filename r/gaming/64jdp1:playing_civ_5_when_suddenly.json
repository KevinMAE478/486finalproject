The game is semi-historic, in that history alliances and events (such as Austria acquiring all of Hungary through royal marriage) usually happen, but not always. Anyway, here is a list of some aspects of the game that I really appreciate:\n\n* Asymmetric starts - Not everyone starts as a major power. It's easier to learn the game with a major power, but starting as a tiny nation with only a couple provinces can be really fun and satisfying. You can start as France or the Ottoman Empire, sure, but you can also start as Portugal, Eithiopia, the Iroquois, or a one province daimyo in Japan. Nations in Europe will get many benefits throughout the game such as favorable trade routes and faster technological development, but it a skilled player isn't entirely hamstrung by playing as a small nation or playing outside of Europe.\n\n* Cause of War - You need a cause to go to war in this game. Well, technically you can declare war without a cause, but there are some major penalties for doing that. Instead, you have to fabricate a claim against them, have a trade dispute, or be a very religious nation that has taken special decisions or ideas to be able to use religious differences as a cause of war. Every nation also declares who their major rivals are in the world, and every nation can the reasons the other nations around them have for going to wars. But because of that there is a much more dynamic diplomacy system. Nations can easily identify who hates their rivals, and who would be willing to help them against specific enemies, and then you can spend time building up relations. As a player it often becomes like a puzzle to find the right set diplomatic alliances and actions that will let you maneuver into wars with nations you want land from without having stronger enemies called in to the war.\n\n* Warscore - Peace deals to end wars are not arbitrary. Instead, each war has a wargoal, which is given by whatever the cause of war was (could be to take one nation's captial, or to take some land that you have claimed as your own). Winning battles, occupying land, and achieving the wargoal improve your warscore and losing any of those will cause it to decrease. When you draft terms of peace, you can only take as much as your warscore will allow. Even if you have 100% warscore (meaning you have occupied all of the enemy's provinces), you can only take so much in a peacedeal. Each province has a cost, and all the provinces in one nation could very well require a lot more than 100% warscore in a peace deal. So that means you can only take a chunk out of a large nation in one war, not the whole thing. I recently played a game as Scotland. It took me about 5 wars to take all of England. In the first war I took a little bit of land and peaced out before England built a new army (because the would have been able to afford it and I wouldn't have). The second war France called me into, but they have me a couple provinces from England when we won so that was good. Then in the 3rd war I was able to take London and force England to break some of it's alliances. Then the 4th and 5th wars to mop up. Took about 60 years. \n\n* Manpower - There are only so many men available and of-age to fight in your army. You have a manpower pool, and building and reinforcing troops brings that number down. If you lose and army, you have to replace it with mercenaries (expensive) or out of your manpower pool. And once your manpower is out, then it takes 10 years to fully replenish (you get a small amount each month). If your manpower is out and your army is all dead, it will take 20 years to rebuild both. So fighting a war of attrition can have a huge impact your future ability to wage war for awhile.\n\n* Taking and holding land - In Civ type games rebellions only happen if you are doing something wrong. In EUIV, rebellions will happen unless you are doing absolutely everything right. If you take land by force, the people you take it from won't be happy. When you take a province you have to spend time to establish that it is a core part of your empire. The more land that you hold that is not considered a core part of your empire, the higher your over-extension is and the more likely it will be for rebels to spawn. There are systems in the game so that you don't just take the land, you have to spend time/effort consolidating your power, or else face the consequences of being too overextended. But there are other ways around this too. You conquer a nation and turn it into your vassal, or force them to stop considering other territories core parts of their empire.\n\nAlso, this list is definitely not exhaustive either.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You start in the year 1444 with basically any nation you want in the entire world.
