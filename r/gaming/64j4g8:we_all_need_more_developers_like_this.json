The following is something called *accelerated backwards hopping* or ABH. (There are closely related techniques for forwards, AFH, and strafing, ASH.) Hopefully the following is at least mostly accurate; I can't substantiate some of the details of the explanation, and I'm not sure how much is me reasoning about what kind of bug could cause it.\n\n*Ahem*.\n\nA long time ago, in a galaxy fa... actually this galaxy, now that I think about it, there was bunny hopping. In a lot of games, you can jump jump jump faster than you can walk. So if you want to get somewhere quickly, you bunny hop. (You see bunny hopping variants in Portal 2, for example, where there's no ABH.)\n\nHowever, you shouldn't be able to go as fast as you want, so the game wants to limit your speed when bunny hopping just as it does when you're walking. (Imagine getting a lot of speed by falling or something, then maintaining that speed by hopping. That's what they want to avoid. The original HL2 release also had a bug based off of bunny hopping where you could gain speed indefinitely when jumping.) So if you're going faster than it wants when you make a jump, it slows you down.\n\nHowever, there's a bug in the Orange Box version of the Source engine in limiting your speed. In that it kind of does the opposite in some situations.\n\nIn real-world terms instead of game terms, suppose the game wants to limit you to 5 mph. You're going 7 mph when you make a jump. What the engine tries to do in that case is say \"hey you're going 2 mph too fast; I'm going to subtract 2 from your speed.\"\n\nNow, \"speed\" is not really speed; it's sort of more a velocity thing. Forward is speed, and backward is negative speed. So suppose in the above example you're going backwards at 7 mph. Now your speed is really -7 mph, so the game has to *add* 2 mph instead to limit you to -5 mph. And it does this. So far so good.\n\nHowever, what happens with ABH is you confuse the game. You're going backwards at 7 mph (speed: -7 mph) but make the game think you're going forwards. Because the game thinks you're going forward, it subtracts 2 mph from your speed -- but now you're going at -9 mph, even faster than you were. Next jump, it subtracts 4 mph, and now you're going at -13 mph, then -21 mph, etc.\n\nAFH is basically the same except in reverse: you fool the game into thinking you're going backwards when you're going forwards, and the game tries to slow you down by adding to your speed.\n\nThis works, to my knowledge, all the Orange Box games. (As an aside, it's probably fair to say the original HL2 release and the Orange Box HL2 release are almost different games to speed runners. :-)) I think one of the best demos of ABH/AFH is from the HL2 speed run DWaHMoV, which [does the Highway 17 and Sandtraps chapters in a little over 3 minutes total](https://youtu.be/NV-AWxqYAgc?t=2507). [*Edit*: I'm not sure what Orange Box engine HL2's current record is. I wouldn't be surprised if DWaHMoV has been beaten, but it looks like with [old engine it's well under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnFjTG9J-T8), though Highway 17/Sandtraps is a little slower -- no ABH in that one.]", "edited": 1491850068.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At some point will have to look for a writeup on just how the hell the physics glitches in that game (for fast running/etc?) work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might be able to explain the fast running one, though I probably way out of date in terms of techniques so there could be something else you&amp;#39;re talking about.
