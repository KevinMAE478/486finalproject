It's usually heterogeneous countries (where the rulers and ruled are different ethnic groups) that this happens.\n\nLook at Japan for instance. They refuse to accept Syrian refugees, or multiculturalism.\n\nThey're a society that's 99% homogeneous and how bizarre! No race riots there. No concentration camps.\n\nThe only time the Japanese committed mass murder was when they took over Manchuria, and felt quite free to slaughter Chinese people.\n\nSame thing happened with the Armenian genocide in Turkey. The people ruling Turkey weren't the same ethnicity as the Greeks, Armenians and Kurds, so they had no problem whatsoever in ethnically cleansing them.\n\nSame thing with Hitler and Jews and Gypsies in Germany.\n\nOr look at the white Spaniards in Mexico among the Aztecs. Why do you think Mexico is such a shithole today? It's because a European elite runs things and the white people there don't see themselves as fellow countrymen with the Native Americans over whom they rule.\n\nMexicans who look like this: http://prodpquotes.info/prodp/static/uploads/author.pic.aca8503709cb9302.41727475726f204573636f626172207920566567612e6a7067.jpg\n\n...don't give a crap about Mexicans who look like this: http://bcmd.org/Websites/yourbcmd/images/Partnership/photos/Tijaltepec-Mixteco-People-Group900wide-900x600.jpg\n\nThe sad reality is: Democratic forms of government arose in homogeneous countries, where everyone was the same race (hence had at least some ability to eventually blend in and gain upward mobility). Societies that have multiple races generally mark Group A as the elite and Group B as the slaves; and, due to the racial difference, they suffer a permanent underclass status that can't be overcome with a change of clothing, or the adoption of a similar religion.\n\nHomogeneous countries are incubators for democracy because democracy is the assertion that *a people* has a right to self-determination. (Meaning: A representative of the nation is from the same group as the rest of the nation in question.)

They refuse to accept Syrian refugees, or multiculturalism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re a society that&amp;#39;s 99% homogeneous and how bizarre! No race riots there. No concentration camps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only time the Japanese committed mass murder was when they took over Manchuria, and felt quite free to slaughter Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same thing happened with the Armenian genocide in Turkey. The people ruling Turkey weren&amp;#39;t the same ethnicity as the Greeks, Armenians and Kurds, so they had no problem whatsoever in ethnically cleansing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same thing with Hitler and Jews and Gypsies in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or look at the white Spaniards in Mexico among the Aztecs.
