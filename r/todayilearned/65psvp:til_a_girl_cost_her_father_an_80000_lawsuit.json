Timbaland and whatever friends he had over came by. Usher was there once. I have to give it to that girl&amp;#39;s mom thorough. She knew we&amp;#39;d be drinking, so instead of just trying to stop it, she had everyone put their car keys in a basket that never left her sight, and if you wanted to leave you had to find her and she&amp;#39;d decide whether or not you seemed ok to drive home. Anyone unable to do so was able to stay there or they called a cab or whatever, not 100% sure which since I never needed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than crazy rich kids, the school had its fair share of drama. One of the math teachers was in a relationship with a senior for a while. My chemistry teacher sophomore year slept with 2 students (he was fresh out of college). My senior year, a football coach was fired and arrested for sleeping with another student. The weirdest though was the band teacher and his wife, who was a substitute teacher/helped teach music. She was one of his students when she was in high school. Idk if they were together at the time, but it&amp;#39;s still freaking weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best memory I have of high school though was doing battlebots (called BotsIQ for the high school competition) my junior year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dgd6197", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492436203.0, "created_utc": 1492407403.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcs78i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 36, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Feel_Chaser", "parent_id": "t1_dgcm4fu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Tell us more stories...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell us more stories...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dgcs78i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492415596.0, "created_utc": 1492386796.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcm4fu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 205, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gulliver_thwy", "parent_id": "t3_65psvp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So this girl was actually the year under me.
