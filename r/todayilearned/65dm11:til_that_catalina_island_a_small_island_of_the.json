The article states that the herd was \u201cbrought to the island by the Lasky organization, which filmed the picture.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the key part: After filming was complete, says the article, \u201cJesse Lasky made the Island a present of the herd\u2026\u201d\n\nFrom these humble beginnings, one buffalo begat another and we arrive today at our herd of between 150 and 200 bison.\"\n\n\n[...]\n\n\"Could we finally have our answer?

Howard.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I couldn\u2019t find Jesse Lasky\u2019s name associated with the film anywhere. (As an interesting aside, that 1925 film was Gary Cooper\u2019s film debut in an uncredited role).\n\nAlso, the fact that the film was released nearly a year and a half after the buffalo were brought to the Island doesn\u2019t disprove anything, but it doesn\u2019t help either.\n\nI\u2019d love to get a copy of this film and watch it for myself.\n\nBut, unfortunately, like the vast majority of silent films, it is officially classified as a \u201clost film\u201d and therefore in all likelihood it is gone forever.\n\nI guess it\u2019s safe to say that those wily buffalo still have us all stumped.\"    \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thundering_Herd_%281925_film%29\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thundering_Herd_%281925_film%29&lt;/a&gt; - 1925 film (there was a re-make of the film in 1933 too).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1925 film = actual buffalos involved.
