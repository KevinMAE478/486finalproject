The other theory is the opponent-process theory, which deals with how some colors seem opposite of one another and, when mixed, don&amp;#39;t look like either color but something new (red and green like doesn&amp;#39;t look reddish-green, but yellow).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order for the mantis shrimp to have good color vision, it needs multiple, uniquely different, photoreceptors to perceive the visual world, which it certainly has (much more than trichromacy,   septendechromacy?). But, without any evidence of opponency that can compare/contrast those cone types, it leaves them with only the ability to detect if light is present, but not how different some wavelengths of light are from one another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, consider what a little mantis shrimp, under water, could do with color vision. Chances are, not a lot, but it may have some use in detecting light at a larger range than we can, further into the UV spectrum maybe to help detect which way&amp;#39;s up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg5v1cx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492032894.0, "created_utc": 1492004094.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5si5y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "battlebornCH", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ectz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What does this mean?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg5si5y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492028962.0, "created_utc": 1492000162.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ectz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kage52124", "parent_id": "t1_dg4xm2k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They definitely do have lots of different photoreceptor types, but it's unlikely they have 16 dimensions of color.

The colors that we see are combinations of three so-called primary colors, which are sums of the spectral response of certain bands of electromagnetic wavelengths. These bands roughly correspond to \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\" - as our normal, healthy interpretation goes. The camera also produces three primary colors with the same principle, but the spectral bands don't match the human vision perfectly. For example, in human vision the \"red\" and \"green\" primaries have a lot overlap, whereas the camera \"red\" and \"green\" are typically more widely separated.\n\nIn this explanation, I will discuss digital cameras. Film cameras are not far off, but it's a different topic.\n\nThe camera spectral bands typically include some of the ultraviolet (on the blue primary), and some of the infrared (on the red primary), but that isn't helping - it only makes the primaries even more different from those of the human vision, which means that reproduction of proper-looking colors with a monitor or on print gets that more difficult. Yes, you can capture the near-infrared LED of the remote controller blinking with the camera, but you can't see its \"color\" in any meaningful manner.\n\nActually, if you look at the color of the LED captured by the camera, it probably appears purple. Now why on Earth would it be purple and not red? The camera spectral response of the blue primary typically extends so far to the red end that it *also* captures some of the near-infrared radiation. This kind of inoptimalities in the camera color reponse is not helping with color interpretation at all. The colors of the camera have to be mapped to our expected colors (approximated by standard monitor and print color models) mathematically. The further the primary colors are off to begin with, the less faithfully the expected colors can be reproduced.\n\nSo, the fact that the camera records some ultraviolet and some infrared radiation does not help us see \"more colors\". It helps us detect electromagnetic radiation at a wider band. From photography point of view, that's a problem, not an improvement. I could keep on going on with the explanation, but there are entire books written about this topic. How could one expect to reveal but a glimpse of that in a couple of short paragraphs? Hopefully I managed to make the point.\n\nBut there's something else:\n\nFor other than photography purposes, the digital camera's ability to record a wider spectrum becomes useful. The colors of the camera are produced by a color filter array. Remove the color filter entirely, and you get a strong, wide-spectrum monochromatic (greyscale) signal that helps you detect things in low light or with very short exposures (reducing possible motion blur). The red part of the color filter usually extends quite far to infrared, and the infrared part is cut off (to some extent) with an infrared filter. Get rid of that, too, and improve the near-infrared performance.\n\nOr do the opposite: place a wide variety of different color filters in front of the image sensor and get a hyper-spectral \"color\" image that's alike nothing we can experience. Or maybe split the incoming light into a spectrum, like with a prism, and record the narrow bands from different positions. (Then you would move the camera to scan the complete view.) The hyperspectral camera has applications for example in industrial inspection, food safety and military.\n\nAs a side note, almost all modern cameras use CMOS image sensors, while CCD is being phased out. The primary light-capturing feature, the photodiode, is similar in both. From the camera user point of view, there is no big functional difference, just differences in price and performance (increasingly for the advantage of the CMOS technology).\n\nP.S. It is important to understand that \"color\" is not a physical quality. Visible light is just a certain, suitable part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Even the pure spectral colors are not the \"real\" colors of those electromagnetic wavelengths - they're our interpretation of the relative stimulation of our three types of photoreceptor cells. Without different types of photoreceptor cells, we definitely would not see no variation in color at all, just in intensity.
