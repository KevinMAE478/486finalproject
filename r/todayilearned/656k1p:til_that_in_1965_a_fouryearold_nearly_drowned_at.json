As it was rather dark and cool, I remarked to Joey that it \"Seemed later than 5, and later than August\".   After unpacking Emilio was eager to plunge in.   High tide was rolling in and the sea was rough... but we were brave.   I took Emilio out about 100 feet never letting go of his wrist.    After about half an hour, we saw the Richmond crowd arrived and we went in to greet them (**at bottom of comment).    Emilio wanted to go back out in the water, and Salvatore (Richmond Crowds Father) was more than eager to accompany him.   Shortly thereafter Mario arrived and he and I decided to go with Salvatore and Emilio who were bobbing in the waves about 20 feet further out than I had previously taken him.  Reaching the two, Salvatore had a look of despair on his face that put a chill up my spine.  \"I can't get him back in\". He exclaimed.  We all grabbed a portion of Emilio and headed for shore.   It didn't take us long to realize no matter how much we swam we were not getting any closer to shore.\n\n&gt;This was a long sweeping beach, gently curving from about a mile away, but about 100 feet past us, it jutted back out to sea.  During high tide this created a whirlpool which became our prison.   We were not being pulled out to sea, but we were also not allowed to swim in any direction.  After about 5 minutes of the three of us pulling Emilio with one hand, and swimming towards shore with the other, we realized we were still going nowhere.  A surfer complete with wet suit was within shouting distance.  We swallowed what pride we may have had, and begged for assistance.  Upon his arrival, Emilio was placed on the board, and we started our journey in.  Well, at least we thought we were, but after a few minutes we realized we were still not making progress.   A second surfer seeing our predicament arrived on the scene.  With 2 surfboards and 5 \"men\" battling the waves, we started to make progress.  That's when the \"Tidal\" wave hit.  It took  Salvatore and actually rolled him about 30 feet past us closer to shore.  The two surfers also went flying but were tethered to their boards with a 10 ft line so they did not go far.  Mario and I managed to maintain our deathgrip on the boards and remained in place.   We all bobbed to the surface, but there was a \"minor\" problem.  Emilio was nowhere to be seen.   How would we explain this to Jeannine (Emilio's mother), who we found out later was watching all this from the shoreline and thought how nice of us to show Emilio how to surf.    Eventually, Salvatore surfaced, as I said, 30 feet closer to shore, but he did not know where Emilio was either.  As it turned out, Emilio was cheated of his burial at sea, and as he surfaced about 10 feet closer to shore than where Salvatore appeared.  Salvatore quickly latched onto him and headed for shore.  We had also cleared the Vertex, thanked the surfers and headed in.  Emilio, complete with large scratches on his chest from hitting a rock, was running up the beach proudly exclaiming to his mother and everyone within earshot that it was his first day at the beach and he almost drowned and how cool it was.  As for we men, our late summer tans for the most part, hid our red glow.

My uncle later said \"I think I may have been able to swim out by myself, but I couldn't do it while making sure (me) didn't drown.\" - It's funny, because at the time, I remember thinking - If he would let go of me I could probably swim more easily.  As an adult, I see his point, you can't risk letting a kid drown.  Either way, it's not just being able to swim, or being comfortable in water, there are elements in the ocean that if you are not familiar with, will fuck you up.   It's sort of like petting a dog with rabies, but the dog isn't foaming at the mouth to give you a warning sign yet.\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492181369.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a relevant story, and although I had typed it all out, I remembered I had my dead grandfathers version - and I find his better - it&amp;#39;s always funnier when someone else puts it into words.

Those are year leases, so we would randomly pop in throughout the summer to get stuff set up. \n\nOne weekend I was up there by myself and on Sunday afternoon I got stoned and watched Liar Liar 3 times and passed out. By the time I woke up, it was pretty late and I had to work on Monday morning. So i hop in my hand me down 89 Chevy Celebrity station wagon and head home for a 90 minute drive. \n\nI'm rocking down the highway, singing along to the radio when the steering wheel locks and the car dies while going about 60mph. I spin around a few times and end up in a v shaped sloped patch of grass in between the north and southbound lanes of the highway. The V shaped grass is filled with water from a recent rain and even though I can start the car, I'm not going anywhere. Someone had already pulled over to the shoulder and he waded through the water to my window. He was like holy shit, you missed hitting at least 3 cars by inches, man. Since it was Sunday so there were no Help Trucks on the highway so I needed a tow truck. While we are waiting, I need to call my dad. My dad is like \"you fucking idiot, I told you to leave earlier, blah blah blah. So the guy takes my phone and he's like \"listen I am a father myself and I am here with your son, he is ok and I will stay with him until he is on his way home\". It was a clutch move. \n\nAnyway, when the truck comes he pulls my car like the 10 feet back onto the shoulder. He wants $120 and he only takes cash. So the hero guy hands me the $40 that I am short and I pay the tow truck dude. \n\nI tell hero man, hey give me your address and I'll send you the $40 bones. He tells me \"I got a kid your age just pay it forward\". Ok, so off I go. \n\nA year later, I'm driving around in my college town after a snow storm. All the snow was plowed up onto the sidewalk so people were walking in the edge of the street. Some lady is carrying her groceries and a car comes around the corner and absolutely slams her. I saw it in slow mo as the grill took her out at the shins and she flopped onto the hood and smashing her face at the base of the windshield. When the car hit the breaks, it kind of shot her forward. She landed in a snow bank on her back, blood flowing out of her forehead. I stop the car and use my shirt to pressure the wound. To the driver's credit, he stuck around and he's going \"uh uh I was thinking about work uh uh\". I said shut the fuck up and call 911 and he does. I keep this woman awake until the cops and ambulance show up. I give a witness statement and I go home. \n\nA few weeks later I get a call from the police. The lady made it but she was fucked up with multiple broken bones, including both legs. She is requesting my phone number and they want my consent. Sure why not. She calls me, thanks me, I even visit her in the hospital. \n\nMonths later, the woman calls me and invites me over for dinner. I call back to decline and identify myself to the guy that picks up. He says, \"caniusethischair54? I know you, we met a year ago on the highway. Susan is my wife\". I was like fuck I guess I don't owe you that $40.
