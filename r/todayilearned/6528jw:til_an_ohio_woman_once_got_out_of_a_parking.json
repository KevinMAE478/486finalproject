It didn't make the news or anything but what happened is I passed out while driving, I have seizures all the time but in this instance it was my first. It happened while in lunch break at school. I was driving my father's SUV and cutting across an empty parking lot when I had my first seizure. The SUV went through a giant bush, across a road, through someone's fenced in front yard and into the house. I woke up to my friends screaming in the car and a large man banging on my window. I rolled down the window and he reached in and grabbed the keys from the ignition. He said I could have them back when the cops arrived because I had to be high, drunk, or plane stupid to crash into a house. \n\nThe police showed up and asked for my license, insurance, and registration. I was freaking out because I had never had a seizure until then. The officer searched the car for drugs and alcohol and found nothing. The man who took my keys tried to order the officer to check again because he \"saw it all go down\" and \"they gotta be high officer\". The officer searched the car again, then my and my friends, didn't find anything. He asked me if I needed a medic and I said I wasn't sure because I didn't know what happened. \n\nHe saw that I was visibly shaken and had me sit down in the grass in the shade away from all the people. A pretty large crowd had gathered by this time and the home owners had arrived to see their fence with a massive hole in it, tired marks through their yard, and my dad's Chevy Blazer sticking out of the corner of the front room of their house. \n\nThe home owner's were furious and screaming at me because the man who took my keys kept telling them I was high and he found me passed out and that I tried to flee the scene. My friends just stood there in shock and when the honenowners asked them what happened they both said that we were heading back to school from lunch, I was driving, and just fell over into the passengers lap. The kid in the back reached over and tried to steer because we cut across a road that was very busy around the noon hour. He told them that they couldn't hit the brakes because my body stiffened up and my foot had the gar pedal firmly planted on the floor. \n\nThey estimated that we were going about 5mph through the parking lot and about 40mph when we hit the house. The fence slowed us down considerably and we hit the house right on the corner so the car would have went through one wall, then directly out another exterior wall of it had been going fast enough. \n\nThe officer said he saw no need to give me a field sobriety test and demanded the man give back my keys. The home owner's got my insurance info and the officer made everyone leave except for me, my friends and the homeowners. The officer told all of us what I would be charged with and given citations for: Failure to Maintain Control, speeding, reckless driving (for cutting across the road way and for driving through the giant bush), property damage X 4( for the house, fence, yard, and bush), truancy, because we were now late getting back from lunch, and driving while medically impaired. \n\nHe handed me all the tickets, gave the home owners his card and witness statements plus my insurance info, and left. I told the home owner's I was sorry and that nothing like that ever happened to me before and they said they were glad I was ok and that it wasn't that big of a deal. They had calmed down a lot once the man who took my keys left and the officer couldn't find drugs or alcohol and after my friends who were still horrified told them what happened. \n\nThey said they'd call my dad and talk to him about wether to have insurance cover the damages or have me come help them fix the house, yard, and fence. The old man shook my hand and the old woman gave me a big hug and said everything was going to be okay and that I should get some rest, take the rest of the day off of school and see a doctor right away. \n\nWhen I got home I told my dad (who is a cunt by the way) what happened and he didn't believe that I wasn't drunk or stoned. Then the cops called him and told him I wasn't drunk or stoned. He still didn't believe me. Then the home owner's called him and said the same thing and by that time he had already beaten the living shit out of me, but was beginning to come around. Then both insurance companies called him, this all happens within an hour of me getting home. Both insurance companies, his auto, their homeowner's, agents both said the police report showed no mention of intoxication or drugs in the car and that if he took me to a neurologist and the neurologist did a CT Scan, MRI, and EKG ( the one with the probes on your head where you stare at a black and white tv that they flash on and off over and over again ) and they could prove I had a seizure the home owner's insurance would cover all the damages including the damage to his truck. I would just be responsible for paying the fines and helping the home owner's install a new fence. \n\nWe went to the doctors and they showed that yes I was epileptic and had a massive seizure and my license was suspended because of it. \n\nI got ready to go to my court date to pay all the fines, which totaled about $5000, which was a huge amount for a 16 year old kid in the mid 90's to have to pay. \n\nWhen I got to the court house I got called up to state wether I was going to plead guilty, no contest, or not guilty and fight the charges. Just before I got up to speak to the judge I noticed that on all the tickets, the officer wrote down the wrong date of birth. My birthday is 12/31, December 31st, the officer wrote 2/31 or February 31st. A day that does not exist even in a leap year. \n\nWhen the judge asked me how I wanted to proceed I went full blown Perry Mason and  asked, \"your honor may I approach the bench?\" Shocked he sort of snickers and said you may and turned to the bailiff and laughed. When I got to the bench I showed him the stack of tickets and handed him my driver's license. \n\nHe just looked at everything inquisitively and said, \"and what is this all supposed to mean?\" \n\nI asked if o could approach the bench again in order to show him and he said, \"yes please do because I'm not seeing what you are trying to show me here.\" \n\nI then said, \"your honor if you would please just look at the information listed under Defendant and read it\" he read it out loud and then said, \"ok\" I then gave him back my driver's license and said \"could you read the information on my state issued ID please\" \n\nHe read the license and I saw his face go white and then laughter build up inside of him until he burst out in a fit of laughter. The bailiff asked if he was okay and he showed the bailiff and the clerk what I had just showed him. They grabbed a calendar and flipped to February and all laughed. \nBy this time the whole courtroom was confused and whispering about what was going on. The officer who gave me the tickets was there, walked up to me and asked how I was doing and if I was feeling better since the incident. I said yes and thanks for asking but I may have found an error in your paperwork. He looked at me puzzled and the judge told him to approach while trying to contain his laughter. The officer looked at the paper work, the license and the calendar, realized what he had done, hung his head in shame and walked out of the court room. The judge, clerk and bailiff just kept laughing until he left the room. \n\nWhen the judge finally composed himself he looked at me and asked if, \"I was in law school?\" I said no, that I was in high school.

", "edited": 1492111311.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got out of few tickets for an error like this. It didn&amp;#39;t make the news or anything but what happened is I passed out while driving, I have seizures all the time but in this instance it was my first. It happened while in lunch break at school. I was driving my father&amp;#39;s SUV and cutting across an empty parking lot when I had my first seizure. The SUV went through a giant bush, across a road, through someone&amp;#39;s fenced in front yard and into the house. I woke up to my friends screaming in the car and a large man banging on my window. I rolled down the window and he reached in and grabbed the keys from the ignition. He said I could have them back when the cops arrived because I had to be high, drunk, or plane stupid to crash into a house. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The police showed up and asked for my license, insurance, and registration. I was freaking out because I had never had a seizure until then. The officer searched the car for drugs and alcohol and found nothing. The man who took my keys tried to order the officer to check again because he &amp;quot;saw it all go down&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;they gotta be high officer&amp;quot;. The officer searched the car again, then my and my friends, didn&amp;#39;t find anything. He asked me if I needed a medic and I said I wasn&amp;#39;t sure because I didn&amp;#39;t know what happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He saw that I was visibly shaken and had me sit down in the grass in the shade away from all the people. A pretty large crowd had gathered by this time and the home owners had arrived to see their fence with a massive hole in it, tired marks through their yard, and my dad&amp;#39;s Chevy Blazer sticking out of the corner of the front room of their house. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The home owner&amp;#39;s were furious and screaming at me because the man who took my keys kept telling them I was high and he found me passed out and that I tried to flee the scene. My friends just stood there in shock and when the honenowners asked them what happened they both said that we were heading back to school from lunch, I was driving, and just fell over into the passengers lap. The kid in the back reached over and tried to steer because we cut across a road that was very busy around the noon hour. He told them that they couldn&amp;#39;t hit the brakes because my body stiffened up and my foot had the gar pedal firmly planted on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They estimated that we were going about 5mph through the parking lot and about 40mph when we hit the house. The fence slowed us down considerably and we hit the house right on the corner so the car would have went through one wall, then directly out another exterior wall of it had been going fast enough. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The officer said he saw no need to give me a field sobriety test and demanded the man give back my keys. The home owner&amp;#39;s got my insurance info and the officer made everyone leave except for me, my friends and the homeowners. The officer told all of us what I would be charged with and given citations for: Failure to Maintain Control, speeding, reckless driving (for cutting across the road way and for driving through the giant bush), property damage X 4( for the house, fence, yard, and bush), truancy, because we were now late getting back from lunch, and driving while medically impaired. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He handed me all the tickets, gave the home owners his card and witness statements plus my insurance info, and left. I told the home owner&amp;#39;s I was sorry and that nothing like that ever happened to me before and they said they were glad I was ok and that it wasn&amp;#39;t that big of a deal. They had calmed down a lot once the man who took my keys left and the officer couldn&amp;#39;t find drugs or alcohol and after my friends who were still horrified told them what happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They said they&amp;#39;d call my dad and talk to him about wether to have insurance cover the damages or have me come help them fix the house, yard, and fence. The old man shook my hand and the old woman gave me a big hug and said everything was going to be okay and that I should get some rest, take the rest of the day off of school and see a doctor right away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home I told my dad (who is a cunt by the way) what happened and he didn&amp;#39;t believe that I wasn&amp;#39;t drunk or stoned. Then the cops called him and told him I wasn&amp;#39;t drunk or stoned. He still didn&amp;#39;t believe me. Then the home owner&amp;#39;s called him and said the same thing and by that time he had already beaten the living shit out of me, but was beginning to come around. Then both insurance companies called him, this all happens within an hour of me getting home. Both insurance companies, his auto, their homeowner&amp;#39;s, agents both said the police report showed no mention of intoxication or drugs in the car and that if he took me to a neurologist and the neurologist did a CT Scan, MRI, and EKG ( the one with the probes on your head where you stare at a black and white tv that they flash on and off over and over again ) and they could prove I had a seizure the home owner&amp;#39;s insurance would cover all the damages including the damage to his truck. I would just be responsible for paying the fines and helping the home owner&amp;#39;s install a new fence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We went to the doctors and they showed that yes I was epileptic and had a massive seizure and my license was suspended because of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got ready to go to my court date to pay all the fines, which totaled about $5000, which was a huge amount for a 16 year old kid in the mid 90&amp;#39;s to have to pay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got to the court house I got called up to state wether I was going to plead guilty, no contest, or not guilty and fight the charges. Just before I got up to speak to the judge I noticed that on all the tickets, the officer wrote down the wrong date of birth. My birthday is 12/31, December 31st, the officer wrote 2/31 or February 31st. A day that does not exist even in a leap year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the judge asked me how I wanted to proceed I went full blown Perry Mason and  asked, &amp;quot;your honor may I approach the bench?&amp;quot; Shocked he sort of snickers and said you may and turned to the bailiff and laughed. When I got to the bench I showed him the stack of tickets and handed him my driver&amp;#39;s license. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just looked at everything inquisitively and said, &amp;quot;and what is this all supposed to mean?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked if o could approach the bench again in order to show him and he said, &amp;quot;yes please do because I&amp;#39;m not seeing what you are trying to show me here.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then said, &amp;quot;your honor if you would please just look at the information listed under Defendant and read it&amp;quot; he read it out loud and then said, &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; I then gave him back my driver&amp;#39;s license and said &amp;quot;could you read the information on my state issued ID please&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He read the license and I saw his face go white and then laughter build up inside of him until he burst out in a fit of laughter. The bailiff asked if he was okay and he showed the bailiff and the clerk what I had just showed him. They grabbed a calendar and flipped to February and all laughed. \nBy this time the whole courtroom was confused and whispering about what was going on. The officer who gave me the tickets was there, walked up to me and asked how I was doing and if I was feeling better since the incident. I said yes and thanks for asking but I may have found an error in your paperwork. He looked at me puzzled and the judge told him to approach while trying to contain his laughter. The officer looked at the paper work, the license and the calendar, realized what he had done, hung his head in shame and walked out of the court room. The judge, clerk and bailiff just kept laughing until he left the room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the judge finally composed himself he looked at me and asked if, &amp;quot;I was in law school?&amp;quot; I said no, that I was in high school. He said, &amp;quot;high school? And started laughing again&amp;quot; at this point I was puzzled because they were reacting in such a manner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The judge looked at me and said, &amp;quot;young man, you are going to become a great lawyer one day, case dismissed.&amp;quot; And banged his gavel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked, &amp;quot; is that it? Do I need to pay any fines or court costs?&amp;quot; And the judge just said, &amp;quot;due to a clerical error all charges are being dropped and the case is dismissed the officer will handle the court costs, I hope you feel better soon and have a nice day.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They gave me back my license which had a medical suspension on it, but they waived that in leu of the case, so after 30 days I was able to drive again instead of having to wait a year without having a seizure to get it back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw the officer when I was leaving the courtroom and he was smiling and said he was sorry for the mixup and to drive safe in the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got home and my dad (who is a cunt by the way) wanted to see the court papers and know how much I had paid in fines.
