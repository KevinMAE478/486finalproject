He died not even a year into this transfer and because he died in a jet accident and was part of the airforce, things got discombobulated and a lot of people believed he died in an airforce test as opposed to a space-related test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, a lot of people did not realize he was an astronaut until decades later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why he wasn&amp;#39;t on the memorial. It was thought he died in a military related test when it was actually a space related test offshoot of the military. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he was an astronaut, but he died before he could really go far with it. And everyone thought his death was for airforce stuff because he hadn&amp;#39;t been doing the space stuff for very long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kinda sad really, but it was cleared up years later and he finally got the recognition he deserved. So it has a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dga7pwv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492255305.0, "created_utc": 1492226505.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga2c6q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "deadlyenmity", "parent_id": "t1_dga14i7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He died in an aircraft accident just like pretty much everyone else", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He died in an aircraft accident just like pretty much everyone else&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dga2c6q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492247592.0, "created_utc": 1492218792.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga14i7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lucafox", "parent_id": "t1_dg9rwf0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Evidently it had nothing to do with his race and everything to do with how he died.
