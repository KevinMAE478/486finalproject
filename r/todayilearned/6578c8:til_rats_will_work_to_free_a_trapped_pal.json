However, if an individual can receive \"altruism\" without \"reciprocating\", then that individual gains an advantage.^2 Obviously, it works, because the \"reciprocal\" part requires \"learning\", in the sense that we must remember all of the individuals who have ever cheated us (or, at least, enough of them to generally protect against being taken advantage of). However, being able to recognize and remember other individuals (and their level of debt) requires evolution.\n\nAside from mental hardware needed to recognize others (and there's no other reason to remember others), you can't simply \"learn\" reciprocal altruism, because it requires a minimum number of members of a community to do it. If one individual in a community uses reciprocal altruism, then they'd be willing to give up resources to every other member, while never getting anything in return, and therefore that individual would be less likely to survive. Reciprocal altruism requires a \"seed\" number of individuals to work, and therefore must be an extension of altruism between family members (which works, because an altruistic member would be helping their own genes, in a relative, to survive - hence bees, termites, etc.) That is, it started with siblings, cousins, aunts/uncles, etc., and - by natural \"mistakes\" in judging who is related - expanded out to strangers, and continued to survive due to being a non-zero-sum game.\n\n^1 If I give you a half-pound of food from my store of three pounds when you're starving, then you can give me a pound of food later, and we both benefit more than if I let you die.\n\n^2 If you don't give a pound of food back, you still benefited, and you have a pound more food than if you paid me back.\n\n", "edited": 1492117614.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are just artificial constructs we create.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No!

It seems so random, compared to three groups of insects, but... it&amp;#39;s literally the only known &amp;quot;social&amp;quot; mammal.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you do something because it&amp;#39;s better for you later, it&amp;#39;s a learned survival technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOT LEARNED!! It is evolved. Since reciprocal altruism is a non-zero-sum game,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; it benefits those who play by the rules. However, if an individual can receive &amp;quot;altruism&amp;quot; without &amp;quot;reciprocating&amp;quot;, then that individual gains an advantage.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Obviously, it works, because the &amp;quot;reciprocal&amp;quot; part requires &amp;quot;learning&amp;quot;, in the sense that we must remember all of the individuals who have ever cheated us (or, at least, enough of them to generally protect against being taken advantage of). However, being able to recognize and remember other individuals (and their level of debt) requires evolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from mental hardware needed to recognize others (and there&amp;#39;s no other reason to remember others), you can&amp;#39;t simply &amp;quot;learn&amp;quot; reciprocal altruism, because it requires a minimum number of members of a community to do it. If one individual in a community uses reciprocal altruism, then they&amp;#39;d be willing to give up resources to every other member, while never getting anything in return, and therefore that individual would be less likely to survive. Reciprocal altruism requires a &amp;quot;seed&amp;quot; number of individuals to work, and therefore must be an extension of altruism between family members (which works, because an altruistic member would be helping their own genes, in a relative, to survive - hence bees, termites, etc.) That is, it started with siblings, cousins, aunts/uncles, etc., and - by natural &amp;quot;mistakes&amp;quot; in judging who is related - expanded out to strangers, and continued to survive due to being a non-zero-sum game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; If I give you a half-pound of food from my store of three pounds when you&amp;#39;re starving, then you can give me a pound of food later, and we both benefit more than if I let you die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; If you don&amp;#39;t give a pound of food back, you still benefited, and you have a pound more food than if you paid me back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg86dq7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492144321.0, "created_utc": 1492115521.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg85gs1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BoHackJorseman", "parent_id": "t1_dg81c1b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "These are just artificial constructs we create.
