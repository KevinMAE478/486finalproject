Occasionally, the man would share his food with the dog, even though the man didn&amp;#39;t have much for himself. The man taught the dog tricks, even going so far as to teach him how to bark to popular tunes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, one night in the year 1999, the man went out for a delivery, never to return. The dog sat in front of the pizzeria where the man worked, waiting for his master to return, for twelve years. One thousand years later, the man returned to that pizzeria and found his dog dead and petrified. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His relative, who was a renowned scientist, offered to revive the dog by creating an exact clone. The man refused, believing that the dog had lived a full life after he had disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg4t4fz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491968892.0, "created_utc": 1491940092.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 191}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rw2l", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rw2l", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rw2l", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4p436", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 137, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tm1337", "parent_id": "t1_dg4oz6d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Bless you.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bless you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg4p436", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491964617.0, "created_utc": 1491935817.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 137}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rw2l", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4vfwo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Stealthy_Bird", "parent_id": "t1_dg4oz6d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He has his own statue near Shibuya Station!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has his own statue near Shibuya Station!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg4vfwo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491971465.0, "created_utc": 1491942665.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4oz6d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 88, "report_reasons": null, "author": "UncleBenZene", "parent_id": "t1_dg4kbxc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hachiko.
