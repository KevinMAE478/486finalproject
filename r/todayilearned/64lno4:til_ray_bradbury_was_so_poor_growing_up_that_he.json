Either you do write every day, and you have a motivational boost from Ray Bradbury, or you become motivated to write every day because Ray Bradbury said you should, or you decide you're going to be a great writer just to spite Ray Bradbury for saying you weren't. Very few people are going to give up on their dream just because Ray Bradbury said they weren't taking it seriously.\n\nThat being said, a lot of professional writers write *vast* quantities because sales and the margins are very low. There are lots of authors who wrote only one or two books in their lives, but they are usually hobbyists with other incomes. People who need to rely on words for a living push out vast quantities, especially in Ray Bradbury's day. There used to be a writing term in the 50s, being a Millionaire. That meant you wrote a million words every single year - 2739 per day. At a penny a word, the going rate for magazines at the time, that made a reasonable income. There were double, triple, and even a few rare quintuple millionaires. \n\nEven in modern writing, Steven King recommends you write a minimum 2,000 words a day if you expect to make a living out of it. The barriers to entry for publishing have dropped dramatically in the last ten years and there is a much bigger push on marketing, but you still need the content to sell. If every book you write is going to sell 10,000 copies and you get $1 per copy then you need at least two books a year to maintain a *barely* acceptable standard of living, and ideally three or four books a year. Once you cut out prose during editing, you're easily getting past that 2,000 words per day quota. \n\nImagine being an author as being like a touring musician. If you were a band on tour you'd be playing a gig nearly every night because you *need* the cash and you *need* the publicity. The nights you're not playing a gig you're trying to get material for the next album, or doing a publicity event. It's the same principle for writing.\n\n", "edited": 1491914241.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can also be considered a motivational technique, the way the army advertises &amp;quot;99% need not apply&amp;quot; or whatever. Either you do write every day, and you have a motivational boost from Ray Bradbury, or you become motivated to write every day because Ray Bradbury said you should, or you decide you&amp;#39;re going to be a great writer just to spite Ray Bradbury for saying you weren&amp;#39;t. Very few people are going to give up on their dream just because Ray Bradbury said they weren&amp;#39;t taking it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, a lot of professional writers write &lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt; quantities because sales and the margins are very low. There are lots of authors who wrote only one or two books in their lives, but they are usually hobbyists with other incomes. People who need to rely on words for a living push out vast quantities, especially in Ray Bradbury&amp;#39;s day. There used to be a writing term in the 50s, being a Millionaire. That meant you wrote a million words every single year - 2739 per day. At a penny a word, the going rate for magazines at the time, that made a reasonable income. There were double, triple, and even a few rare quintuple millionaires. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even in modern writing, Steven King recommends you write a minimum 2,000 words a day if you expect to make a living out of it. The barriers to entry for publishing have dropped dramatically in the last ten years and there is a much bigger push on marketing, but you still need the content to sell. If every book you write is going to sell 10,000 copies and you get $1 per copy then you need at least two books a year to maintain a &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; acceptable standard of living, and ideally three or four books a year. Once you cut out prose during editing, you&amp;#39;re easily getting past that 2,000 words per day quota. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine being an author as being like a touring musician. If you were a band on tour you&amp;#39;d be playing a gig nearly every night because you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; the cash and you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; the publicity. The nights you&amp;#39;re not playing a gig you&amp;#39;re trying to get material for the next album, or doing a publicity event.
