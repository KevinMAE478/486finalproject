From paying to pirate?\n\nBecause the other way is more common. At least in my case, as I got older, had more disposable income, less free time, and more to lose if I got busted for pirating some crappy movie or game that I wasn't sure if I wanted to buy (I always bought the ones that I cared about, with the exception of a few games in the early 2000s when I was really broke and felt pretty safe), I stopped pirating. The last thing I pirated was probably ten years ago, and a lot of the things that I did pirate led me to interests I wouldn't have already had. \n\nCase in point, I'm an avid gamer. Have been almost 30 years. I got into Warcraft and Xwing because of copied discs along with photocopied manuals to circumvent the \"DRM.\" I bought every entry in those series to date and sunk a couple of years into WoW. I got into The Elder Scrolls because of a pirated copy of Morrowind, and I've bought Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim (twice). I got into Battlefield and Call of Duty because of pirated copies, and have bought many iterations in those series since. A lot of my interests started with piracy. I missed Fallout and Fallout 2. \n\nBy the time that Mass Effect and Fallout 3 had come out, I was mostly done pirating. And I've never played any games in either of those series. I suspect that if Mass Effect and Fallout 3 had come out 5 years sooner, I would have pirated them, played them, loved them, and bought copies of the subsequent releases in the series. \n\nPeople convert from paying to pirate when they feel they can't afford to pay. Some also do it because they're selfish and don't care. Whatever. But people convert from pirate to paying in droves when they get more disposable income and find something that they love. I don't condone piracy, but the idea that it's purely lost sales and that it doesn't lead to extra sales is silly. \n\n&gt;And I never get a straight answer when I ask the simple question when people talk about pirating movies/music/games, why do people think they have the right to someone's work without compensation? Doesn't matter if it's great, garbage, whatever. It's up to the creator/owner of that work to distribute (or limit distribution) how they see fit, period.\n\nSure, absolutely. Not in dispute. People don't do it because they think they have a right to.

From paying to pirate?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the other way is more common. At least in my case, as I got older, had more disposable income, less free time, and more to lose if I got busted for pirating some crappy movie or game that I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if I wanted to buy (I always bought the ones that I cared about, with the exception of a few games in the early 2000s when I was really broke and felt pretty safe), I stopped pirating. The last thing I pirated was probably ten years ago, and a lot of the things that I did pirate led me to interests I wouldn&amp;#39;t have already had. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Case in point, I&amp;#39;m an avid gamer. Have been almost 30 years. I got into Warcraft and Xwing because of copied discs along with photocopied manuals to circumvent the &amp;quot;DRM.&amp;quot; I bought every entry in those series to date and sunk a couple of years into WoW. I got into The Elder Scrolls because of a pirated copy of Morrowind, and I&amp;#39;ve bought Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim (twice). I got into Battlefield and Call of Duty because of pirated copies, and have bought many iterations in those series since. A lot of my interests started with piracy. I missed Fallout and Fallout 2. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time that Mass Effect and Fallout 3 had come out, I was mostly done pirating. And I&amp;#39;ve never played any games in either of those series. I suspect that if Mass Effect and Fallout 3 had come out 5 years sooner, I would have pirated them, played them, loved them, and bought copies of the subsequent releases in the series. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People convert from paying to pirate when they feel they can&amp;#39;t afford to pay. Some also do it because they&amp;#39;re selfish and don&amp;#39;t care. Whatever. But people convert from pirate to paying in droves when they get more disposable income and find something that they love. I don&amp;#39;t condone piracy, but the idea that it&amp;#39;s purely lost sales and that it doesn&amp;#39;t lead to extra sales is silly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And I never get a straight answer when I ask the simple question when people talk about pirating movies/music/games, why do people think they have the right to someone&amp;#39;s work without compensation?
