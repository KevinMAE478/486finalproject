She didn&amp;#39;t want to serve breakfast meats because they weren&amp;#39;t very healthy(aka, they weren&amp;#39;t low-fat. Did I mention she studied in the 80&amp;#39;s?), but she was also fixated on the concept of &amp;quot;breakfast food.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Breakfast food&amp;quot; consisted of things like bagels, waffles, pancakes, cereal, you know, that sort of thing. It was blasphemy to eat food for breakfast that was not &amp;quot;breakfast food.&amp;quot; The issue was, pretty much the only &amp;quot;breakfast food&amp;quot; that had any staying power(fats and proteins) was eggs, and we were only allowed to have them a couple times a week because they were high in something(cholesterol, maybe?) she didn&amp;#39;t like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, point is, I&amp;#39;d be really hungry(sometimes even progressing to weak and shaking if I didn&amp;#39;t get a mid-morning snack before lunch) about 1-2 hours afterwards, because all I was allowed to eat was a bunch of carbs and maybe a bit of fruit, because that&amp;#39;s what people eat for breakfast. All I wanted was to eat some of last night&amp;#39;s leftovers, but no, that&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;dinner food&amp;quot; and apparently the world will end or something if you eat &amp;quot;dinner food&amp;quot; for breakfast.
