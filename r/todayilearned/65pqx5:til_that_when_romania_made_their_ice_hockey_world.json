In light of this, a lot of Romanians felt their own sovereignty was being threatened and somewhat understandably began to doubt the ability of England and France to protect the country. Any hope of help from either country came to an end after France was absolutely fucked by Germany.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A political group called the Iron Guard which held anti semitic values took advantage of the common people&amp;#39;s fears, which eventually led to Romania joining the axis powers with the reason being sheer self-preservation in late 1940.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though romanian troops were responsible for the persecution of a quarter million jews, the majority of romanian jews survived those terrible times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After dropping from the axis, Romania declared all out war on Germany.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not condoning Romania&amp;#39;s actions as a whole. However it must be understood that a far right anti semitic group took advantage of the common romanians&amp;#39; fears of losing sovereignty over their own country, something which Britain and France had guaranteed and FAILED to protect, which is what led to them joining the axis in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dgd0gjr", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492426800.0, "created_utc": 1492398000.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pqx5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pqx5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pqx5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pqx5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcyeqd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jdf121", "parent_id": "t1_dgcyd3c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Absolutely", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dgcyeqd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492423940.0, "created_utc": 1492395140.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcyd3c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LatePaper", "parent_id": "t1_dgcxk52", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I just hate that people downvote what they don't like.
