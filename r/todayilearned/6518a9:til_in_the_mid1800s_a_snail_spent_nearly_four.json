Now it awoke to find itself crawling on the surface of a delf basin in the heart of London! Great care was taken of this 'helix rediviva.' It was placed in a tall glass-jar, eighteen inches high, with considerable space to move about in, and supplied with food, which it ate readily, though in small quantities. Cabbage-leaves formed its favourite repast, and were preferred to lettuce or any other vegetable. In this tranquil state of existence it remained till March 1851, when it resumed its torpid condition, shut itself up in its shell, and took an eight months' nap, awaking once more on the 9th of November to eat cabbage-leaf and perambulate the circumference of its glassy prison. Though quite lively, it again became torpid on the 15th, as if conscious the season of the year was not propitious, and never afterwards emerged from its shell. It was found dead, and perfectly dried up, in March 1852. Such was the end of the Egyptian snail, and it was with some feeling of regret that its death was recorded.\n\nThis is some /r/wholesomememes shit here.

Great care was taken of this &amp;#39;helix rediviva.&amp;#39; It was placed in a tall glass-jar, eighteen inches high, with considerable space to move about in, and supplied with food, which it ate readily, though in small quantities. Cabbage-leaves formed its favourite repast, and were preferred to lettuce or any other vegetable. In this tranquil state of existence it remained till March 1851, when it resumed its torpid condition, shut itself up in its shell, and took an eight months&amp;#39; nap, awaking once more on the 9th of November to eat cabbage-leaf and perambulate the circumference of its glassy prison. Though quite lively, it again became torpid on the 15th, as if conscious the season of the year was not propitious, and never afterwards emerged from its shell.
