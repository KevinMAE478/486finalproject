If the compartment was sealed when the ship sank then the air in the room will be at atmospheric pressure. Water pressure increases by 1 atmosphere every 30 feet of depth, so if you cut a hole at 45 feet down then water rushes up into the room and compresses the air until its pressure matches that of the water. Thus the air pressure in the compartment would more than double almost instantly and anyone trapped in there would die an excruciating death due to gas embolism as the pressure forces nitrogen bubbles into their bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dgdekud", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492459942.0, "created_utc": 1492431142.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcvfo7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mfowler", "parent_id": "t1_dgcsotw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 1, "body": "What if you cut the hole from below?

They move on a ramp, wedge-like, and there were about maybe six or eight dogs all the way around every oval-shaped door. One of those dogs was inverted, which means that it was actually holding the door partway open, and there was quite a flood coming through that. The men on the other side, we could hear them screaming, and they were frantically trying to undog the door.\n\n&gt;**Donald R. Lennon**:\n\n&gt;You can dog or undog a door from either side, I take it.\n\n&gt;**Archie P. Kelley**:\n\n&gt;Yes. But I had sailors helping me dog it down. I looked at my boss, Commander Harper. Most of the men in the compartment were with Vic Delano, who had come from the main battery control, another compartment that had started to flood. They had all escaped into central station, our compartment, and then dogged down their door to the flooding Main Battery Control. So the door I was dogging down was then the only watertight door available to central station. I looked at Commander Harper, who was a few feet away from me, and he looked at me, and I could tell by the expression on his face . . . my unspoken question was, \u201cShall I open the door?\u201d His face indicated he didn't want me to open the door. But all my life I've worried about that, because when we unflooded--unwatered--the ship later, we found their dead bodies there. And I realized that I was the one who had killed them. However, there were forty men on our side, so the question is, \u201cCould we have undogged the door rapidly and let the men in, then closed it against all that water pressure?\u201d Well, almost everybody I've talked to said, \u201cNo, no way!\u201d\n\n&gt;The same thing happened on the submarine SQUALUS.
