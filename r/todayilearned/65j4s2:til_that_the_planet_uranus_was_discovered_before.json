Orbits a star,\n\n2. Has sufficient gravity to assume a spheroid shape, and \n\n3. Has cleared its orbit. \n\nIn your link, they're suggesting using only criterion 2. I'm not sure why they wouldn't use 1 as well since otherwise this would include various moons. The author of the article doesn't seem to be paying attention since they say this would bring it back to 9 planets, but it would actually make the number at least 25 or so when you include all the dwarf planets (currently objects that satisfy criteria 1 and 2) and a bunch of moons. They also show a diagram with the asteroid belt but not puting Pluto in its own \"belt\" which is misleading.  \n\nThe people making this proposal criticize criterion 3 stating that no planet satisfies this due to objects crossing their orbit. However criterion 3 is actually more complicated than just orbit clearing and has considered this point. The definition of orbit clearin excludes resonant objects, which means that even though Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit, it is in resonance with Neptune and they never actually come close to each other, and so it wouldn't be counted. Criterion 3 also doesn't claim that there are no objects in the same orbit. Instead there are are measures of how much an object has cleared its orbit such as mass of object as a percentage of all other masses in the same orbit. Using this measure, all the current planets make up more than 99% of the mass in their orbit, while the the highest percentage for a dwarf planet is Ceres at only 33% (Pluto is 8%). \n\nSo the issues I have with this is that it goes backwards in the sense of calling moons planets which we haven't done since ancient Greece (when the moon and sun were planets) and also would include Ceres again which we now call an asteroid.

", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current definition of a planet is an object that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orbits a star,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has sufficient gravity to assume a spheroid shape, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has cleared its orbit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In your link, they&amp;#39;re suggesting using only criterion 2. I&amp;#39;m not sure why they wouldn&amp;#39;t use 1 as well since otherwise this would include various moons. The author of the article doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be paying attention since they say this would bring it back to 9 planets, but it would actually make the number at least 25 or so when you include all the dwarf planets (currently objects that satisfy criteria 1 and 2) and a bunch of moons. They also show a diagram with the asteroid belt but not puting Pluto in its own &amp;quot;belt&amp;quot; which is misleading.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people making this proposal criticize criterion 3 stating that no planet satisfies this due to objects crossing their orbit. However criterion 3 is actually more complicated than just orbit clearing and has considered this point. The definition of orbit clearin excludes resonant objects, which means that even though Pluto crosses Neptune&amp;#39;s orbit, it is in resonance with Neptune and they never actually come close to each other, and so it wouldn&amp;#39;t be counted. Criterion 3 also doesn&amp;#39;t claim that there are no objects in the same orbit. Instead there are are measures of how much an object has cleared its orbit such as mass of object as a percentage of all other masses in the same orbit. Using this measure, all the current planets make up more than 99% of the mass in their orbit, while the the highest percentage for a dwarf planet is Ceres at only 33% (Pluto is 8%). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the issues I have with this is that it goes backwards in the sense of calling moons planets which we haven&amp;#39;t done since ancient Greece (when the moon and sun were planets) and also would include Ceres again which we now call an asteroid.
