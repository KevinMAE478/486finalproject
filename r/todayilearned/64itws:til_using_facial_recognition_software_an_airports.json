Designing and deploying a computer vision and machine learning model mature enough to detect and correctly identify yawning in real time is a decidedly nontrivial task, especially for hand-occluded and variably oriented faces such as those shown in their ad. The only supporting sources for the claim are the coffee company&amp;#39;s ad itself and some PR fluff. &lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; they did it ... but this sure looks like bullshit to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: To be clear, &amp;quot;facial recognition&amp;quot; is only one stage of the yawn-detection problem. The fancy mesh graphic they show in the ad is obviously a post-production mockup to make it look &amp;quot;sciencey&amp;quot; and not part of any sort of working model.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg39n25", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491886695.0, "created_utc": 1491857895.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64itws", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg357gr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DonatedCheese", "parent_id": "t3_64itws", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm surprised it wouldn't raise the price for people that looked sleepy, since they're probably willing to pay more for a cup than an alert person that just wants some coffee.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m surprised it wouldn&amp;#39;t raise the price for people that looked sleepy, since they&amp;#39;re probably willing to pay more for a cup than an alert person that just wants some coffee.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg357gr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491882073.0, "created_utc": 1491853273.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64itws", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg39smx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ultimategrid", "parent_id": "t3_64itws", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Does it differentiate between yawning and say... screaming?\n\nBecause I personally like the idea of the vending machine politely dispensing dozens of coffees following engine failure.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does it differentiate between yawning and say... screaming?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because I personally like the idea of the vending machine politely dispensing dozens of coffees following engine failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg39smx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491886862.0, "created_utc": 1491858062.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64itws", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64itws", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg2h4rp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Secondsmakeminutes", "parent_id": "t1_dg2gjog", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 1, "body": "World record for vending machine from full to empty was set that day", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;World record for vending machine from full to empty was set that day&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg2h4rp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491852623.0, "created_utc": 1491823823.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg2gjog", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 89, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Landlubber77", "parent_id": "t3_64itws", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not to be outdone, a different vending machine dispensed free tampons to any woman it thought looked like she was being a bitch.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone, a different vending machine dispensed free tampons to any woman it thought looked like she was being a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg2gjog", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491851173.0, "created_utc": 1491822373.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 89}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64itws", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg2tmaf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KaptinKrazy66", "parent_id": "t3_64itws", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Reads interesting article about cool yawning coffee machine.
