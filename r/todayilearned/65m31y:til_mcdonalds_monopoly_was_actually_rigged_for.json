And as if we were both right in that moment, on the same mental page, our eyes met, and we both knew instantly what must happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We delivered 2 routes worth of papers on Sunday to about 300 subscribers.  We couldn&amp;#39;t only pull some of the inserts...we had to pull them ALL, lest somebody get suspicious and ask their neighbor why they didn&amp;#39;t get a Monopoly game piece in their paper.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we went through all 300 paper&amp;#39;s worth of advertisements and pulled out 300 monopoly game pieces.  We finished up bundling, delivered the paper route as fast as we could so we could get home and reap our rewards - we were convinced we would be millionaires...there was no way we COULDN&amp;#39;T find Boardwalk and Park Place...I mean, we had 600 GAME PIECES.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t match anything.  We pulled game pieces all afternoon and didn&amp;#39;t have one properties worth of matches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d never felt so defeated in our lives.  If anything, all it did was add more frustration to a long tradition of Sunday hating.  And we couldn&amp;#39;t exactly brag about taking all the pieces because we were convinced word would get out and our boss would fire us from our route, and we couldn&amp;#39;t risk our hundredaire status at the time.  So we told nobody.  Only the two of us share that moment of defeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s a silver lining to every cloud, ours would be this:  In moments where life has us down, for whatever reason, all we have to do is remind one another, &amp;quot;at least it&amp;#39;s not like Monopoly.&amp;quot;  People look at us weird as they try to understand the remark.  But my brother and I know.  We know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dgbz09l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492374050.0, "created_utc": 1492345250.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m31y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbsllw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JournalistInSweden", "parent_id": "t3_65m31y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "These guys were first arrested September 11th 2001.\n\nI am assuming McDonalds planned 9/11 to take heat off them.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These guys were first arrested September 11th 2001.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am assuming McDonalds planned 9/11 to take heat off them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dgbsllw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492354207.0, "created_utc": 1492325407.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m31y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbov6e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "highlyannoyed1", "parent_id": "t3_65m31y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Pearl received the two-year prison sentence and must pay restitution of $786,500 at $50 a month.\n\nLOL", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pearl received the two-year prison sentence and must pay restitution of $786,500 at $50 a month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LOL&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dgbov6e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492346361.0, "created_utc": 1492317561.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m31y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbow5h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gijoe750", "parent_id": "t3_65m31y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ha I remember as a child jumping into dumpsters so that my uncle could collect more of those game pieces.
