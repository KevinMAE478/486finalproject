If Kroger orders 10 cases of a certain hotdog and they have a single case left and their expiration date is say 5/15/2017 then they should donate them say 15-30 days before the expiration(would vary a lot by food, some don&amp;#39;t last like hotdogs). Maybe they could get some sort of partial payment from the producer for them not selling and then the producer and Kroger could both take a tax break on donating. Some way to distribute the losses among different parties and make them not so bad.
