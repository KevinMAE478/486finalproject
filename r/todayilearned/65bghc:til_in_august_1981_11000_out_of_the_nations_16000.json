Due to the threat of one of these wildcat strikes, the Carter administration had built a plan to deal with it. When the strike did occur, Reagan started followed the plan, but did give a cooling off period, after which he would declare the strike illegal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PATCO leadership had the members convinced that (1) ATC was irreplaceable; (2) pilots, being union members would support them and refuse to fly; (3) airlines would pressure the government; (4) Reagan would never declare the strike illegal; (5) if he did, they would be pardoned after the contract was settled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s where they were wrong:\n- The US military had enough controllers to keep the lights on while new controllers were trained. \n- The Airline Pilots&amp;#39; Association and PATCO already had some bad blood and ALPA believed that the PATCO deal would give them more prestige and better benefits than their own pilots.\n- Deregulation of the airlines had occurred a couple years before, but with the recession airlines were getting crushed trying to maintain unprofitable routes. The strike allowed them to cancel routes they had previously committed to.\n- Reagan knew he had already conceded too much and was angered that PATCO backed out of their agreement.\n- PATCO was dissolved when the strike was declared illegal, so no agreement could be made, thus no clemency and every one of the strikers remained ineligible for federal employment until Bill Clinton pardoned them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg9lyy4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492226542.0, "created_utc": 1492197742.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 78}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bghc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bghc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bghc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9a9l2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "johnnybarbs92", "parent_id": "t1_dg91plw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's a popular theory that the West wing takes place in a universe where Reagan was never elected.
