Maybe there&amp;#39;s a place for that in the future as well. Maybe there&amp;#39;s a middle ground where we use the rainforest for humans in a sustainable way that doesn&amp;#39;t involve cutting it down?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg6lmvl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061579.0, "created_utc": 1492032779.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650pju", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650pju", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650pju", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650pju", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650pju", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650pju", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650pju", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8hb7m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "heyhowareyaa", "parent_id": "t1_dg8ha5v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "nah dude ur the fool......fool", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;nah dude ur the fool......fool&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "todayilearned", "name": "t1_dg8hb7m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492158307.0, "created_utc": 1492129507.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8ha5v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DennisJM", "parent_id": "t1_dg8g30t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yup, as I presumed.
