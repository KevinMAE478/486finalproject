Maps like Fort, Amiens, and Argonne at least have some sembience of pathing and lanes, but it also has multiple choke points that are again prone to explosive spam that makes progression and movement stagnant, save for some unique instances where the opposing team fails to reinforce a specific area, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying all maps should be tightly laned COD-esque junctions, but even going back to BF4, maps like Flood Zone, Zavod, and Langhan Dam had multiple ideal paths though the map abundant with cover and effective flanking routes. On almost all BF1 maps you can almost always point to where ~90% of the action is every single time. I think this is why people would rather stay back, play more passively, and snipe, etc. from long ranges&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Battlefield", "name": "t1_dg6jcoc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492058977.0, "created_utc": 1492030177.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rdgw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp3e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rdgw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp3e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rdgw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp3e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rdgw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp3e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rdgw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp3e", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg57iqw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NarwalObaizd", "parent_id": "t1_dg53d6b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Battlefield", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Saving up for one.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saving up for one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Battlefield", "name": "t1_dg57iqw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491986767.0, "created_utc": 1491957967.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg53d6b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "boomrektnub", "parent_id": "t1_dg4zt4t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Battlefield", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And research before buying so you don't buy a $500 potato", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And research before buying so you don&amp;#39;t buy a $500 potato&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Battlefield", "name": "t1_dg53d6b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491981203.0, "created_utc": 1491952403.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4zt4t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PeterPansCumSock", "parent_id": "t1_dg4t5l3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Battlefield", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just buy a pc", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just buy a pc&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Battlefield", "name": "t1_dg4zt4t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491976607.0, "created_utc": 1491947807.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rdgw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp3e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rdgw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp3e", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5xug0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NarwalObaizd", "parent_id": "t1_dg5mm73", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Battlefield", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yea.
