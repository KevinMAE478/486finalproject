The further out, the more spread after sustained fire. Tap firing was more effective but because of that would mean much slower time to kill over something like an assault rifle which had weapons better suited to longer range outside of the high rate of fire weapons. \nSo you gave up advantages at different distances based on what weapon you picked, but tap firing was still viable, but obviously bullet drop and a much slower rate of fire due to tap firing, meant weapons better suited to range could burst or just be more accurate at those distances. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In bf1 the lmgs are lasers after a few bullets, the automatico doesn&amp;#39;t even require you to ADS, shotgun range is insane and sniper rifles can 1 shot body shot you.
