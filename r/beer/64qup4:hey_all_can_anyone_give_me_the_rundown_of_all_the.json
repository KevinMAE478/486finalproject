The thing to understand here is that most of these \"styles\" are not really defined. The types of fruited sours, for instance, that people are drinking in America sort of all fall under a blanket of \"wild ales,\" etc. But there are a few distinct styles with historical backgrounds.\n\nBerliner Weisse: You can think of these as similar to a tart version of German hefe, with less yeast character. Thing is, in the style's original historical incarnation, it may not have been sour at all, or very lightly acidic at the most. However, in America since it became popular, they've pretty much all been at least moderately tart. A standard Berliner Weisse will be unfruited, but many are strongly citric, almost lemony. They range from mildly tart to face-puckeringly tart. The \"short weisse\" you refer to is a brand of Berliner Weisse from Smuttynose.\n\nGose: If you took the basic bones of Berliner Weisse, and then added spice and salinity, you basically get gose. They're all defined by having some salt in the beer; the only style you regularly find salt. Most classical goses also have coriander as a signature spice, but you can find other spices as well. Westbrook Gose is a pretty perfect example of the style as interpreted by American brewers--also more tart than the German original.\n\nKettle sours: These are sour beers produced by quick, non-barrel processes. The beer is infected and allowed to sour in the brew kettle or mash tun itself, before the process is stopped. Effectively, this means the pH is lowered and the beer is tart before you even do the boil, cool it and ferment it. The process is very popular now with younger breweries and small breweries that want to produce sours, but don't have the time and resources to work with barrels, etc.\n\nBeyond this, it almost becomes pointless to have labels. There are a LOT of different ways to make a sour, and \"sour\" only implies a lower pH than normal, but it's a big range. Tartness can be only lightly perceptible, or overpowering. It can be achieved with wild yeast, and it can be achieved with souring bacteria such as lactobacillus and pediococcus. Some of these beers are aged in neutral oak. Some are aged in former wine barrels. Some are aged in former spirit barrels.
