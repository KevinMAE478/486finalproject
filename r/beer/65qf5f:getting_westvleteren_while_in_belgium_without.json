Brussels kind of sucks.

Brugge is cool, old medieval town, super fun to walk around in. The beer isn't as good, but Cambrinus is cool, the random pubs you'll find on BA/RB are okay (Stamine de Garre is fun for how hard it is to find, but the beer is just okay and it can get *crowded*). There's one place in Brugge whose name I can't remember that's pretty cool, if you're thinking about going there I'll look it up. It's on the outskirts of town, which means it's like an 8-minute walk from the center (medieval towns are awesome). Gent is cool, so beautiful at night, there's a cool castle, a few good beer places that are pretty standard. Antwerp is the fucking shit, such a cool town, the Ruebens and Printing museums are great, and Kulminator is also competing for \"favorite place in the world\". There's a couple other bars that are pretty good, but I spent like 5 hours a day at Kulminator because it's incomparable. They also have Westvleteren but it's hard to get, they save it for groups, I've never bothered ordering it there. There's a \"friends of kulminator\" facebook group you'll want to check, they randomly close sometimes because the proprietors are old, they have no help, and the guy isn't in great health.\n\nIn terms of Flanders that's basically it, except Grote Dorst, which is really its own thing.
