Still stupid that distributors have to sell everything over 5k in a calendar year. especially when to sell to a bar or a grocery store they need to sell to a distributor anyway. They just wanted to cash in on the growing number of people who are now drinking at the brewery instead of in their home or at the casinos.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "beer", "name": "t1_dg8u8bs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492178642.0, "created_utc": 1492149842.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8c0fp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "swimtherubicon", "parent_id": "t3_654kds", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/beer", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This article is a little vague; how do the distributors benefit from capping brewers' growth?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is a little vague; how do the distributors benefit from capping brewers&amp;#39; growth?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "beer", "name": "t1_dg8c0fp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492151184.0, "created_utc": 1492122384.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhg1", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654kds", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7jykg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lenwetelrunya", "parent_id": "t3_654kds", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/beer", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Hehe, a cap on the beer", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hehe, a cap on the beer&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "beer", "name": "t1_dg7jykg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492119728.0, "created_utc": 1492090928.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
