The tactile feel of glass and drinking from the bottle over a can. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not one to pour into a glass unless I have a draught setup (on of the local breweries had neat self-pressurized ~1/4 kegs I used to get). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I completely understand the advantages to a can (light tight, better seal, lighter, etc...). And, hard to beat a can when camping. I just prefer the feel of a bottle - even better when it&amp;#39;s a 500-600mL one). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If presented with two equal beers in brown bottles vs cans at similar price: I&amp;#39;ll pick bottles almost every time. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "beer", "name": "t1_dg9u0jk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492236479.0, "created_utc": 1492207679.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
