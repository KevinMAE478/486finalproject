The money was taken from the taxpayers and no one fucking gives a shit that a single cent that disappeared from State government does not share its budget with thousands of times more that disappeared to Comcast. The argument is about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SCALE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Meaning the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMOUNT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that disappeared. WTF does a dollar missing matter compared to ten thousand dollars if they&amp;#39;re both taken from the taxpayers?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, why the fuck do you, in fact, keep coming back to state vs federal? Really who gives a flying fuck if they aren&amp;#39;t part of the same budget, they&amp;#39;re still taken from taxpayers. I still have no idea why you keep coming back to this as it is entirely irrelevant to anything I&amp;#39;ve said. Is the State of Texas separate from the rest of the united states that the federal government does not get its money from the people of Texas? They&amp;#39;re still part of the same government right? Then they lost a lot more of their money to the federal government rather than the state government.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "beer", "name": "t1_dgba5sl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492324529.0, "created_utc": 1492295729.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb99aq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "8Bit_Architect", "parent_id": "t1_dgb8mm9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/beer", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Since you seem to be too dense to get this, I'm only going to say it once more.
