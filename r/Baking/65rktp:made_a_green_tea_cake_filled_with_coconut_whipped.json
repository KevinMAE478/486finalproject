Cream together butter, oil and sugar. Add in eggs and vanilla and mix until combined. In a small bowl sift together flour, matcha, baking powder, and salt. Add those dry ingredients into the wet ingredients make sure to alternate between adding dry ingredients and the buttermilk &amp; milk. I baked mine for around 40 mins but I also didn't split the batter up into two pans, I baked all in one pan.   \n      \nFor the Swiss meringue I used [this](http://thepioneerwoman.com/food-and-friends/swiss-meringue-buttercream/) recipe.   \n\nCoconut whipped cream:    \n1 cup heavy whipping cream   \nAround 4 tablespoons sugar(add more or less depending how sweet you like you're whipped cream)   \n1/4-1/2 of a cup of coconut cream    \n1 &amp; 1/2 teaspoon vanilla   \nAlthough you could definitely make this whipped cream dairy free solely using the coconut cream, I prefer adding the coconut whipped cream to regular whipped cream. With that said, to make this I'd recommend first placing your bowl and beaters in the freezer for about an hour and putting your heavy whipping cream in the fridge(DO NOT put the can of coconut cream in the fridge or the cream will freeze and it's a pain in the butt to thaw). Once everything is chilled put the whipping cream, vanilla and sugar in a bowl and beat for around a minute until it gets to a creamy consistency. In a separate bowl spoon out the coconut cream(make sure not get any of the coconut water at the bottom of the can under the cream) and beat until its fluffy. Fold the whipped coconut cream into the regular whipped cream until you reach your desired flavor. I let mine chill in the fridge for a bit before filling my cake with it.    \n\nFor the ganache:   \n1 cup white chocolate (I used about 165 g, a little over 5 oz. this means 1 full bar of 113g chocolate plus 3 extra squares of chocolate from another bar)   \n1/4 cup heavy whipping cream    \n3 tablespoons of matcha powder (approximately)   \nMelt chocolate and set aside. Put heavy whipping cream and matcha powder in a pot on the stove over low heat. Mix until matcha powder dissolves. Watch out so it doesn't burn out start to boil. When the matcha powder has dissolved, pour the cream into the melted chocolate through a strainer(to catch any clumps of matcha if you have any). Mix until combined then pour on your cake! Make sure the ganache has cooled down to room temp otherwise you'll melt off your frosting.
