Idk if you have experience with them, OP, but if not, fair warning: they wear very easily. \n\n\nThe foam gets dirty very easily (especially after cleaning it for the first time-I think they put on some treatment initially), the toe box scratches, and they crease like a  motherfucker. Treating them with whatever sprays you have might work well for the leather, but you can only save the foam for so long (it's cool though, magic eraser works wonders on it). \n\n\nThey're also made of really cheap materials (if you haven't noticed) and wear very fast. The padding in the ankles will get beaten down pretty quick, and my normal black athletics socks that normally don't pill on anything pilled the living shit out of the heels. \n\n\nThe good news is that they actually look pretty fantastic worn, and they're pretty cheap on Amazon. I was actually looking down at them earlier today thinking how dope they look beaten. They're like J1s. They look sick fresh, but when worn and kicked around they gain a certain amount of \"authenticity\" which looks dope in my opinion. \n\n\nEven with that said, I bought mine in early March (I think) and I'd say I'm about halfway through what's reasonable to expect for the shoe's life. I already feel the foam kinda starting to deteriorate in the sole, I think. I also don't treat them particularly well, though (why am I going to save the $50 shoes over another pair?).
