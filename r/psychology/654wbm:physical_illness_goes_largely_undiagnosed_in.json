When the tech asked if I had other imaging results to compare with my new ones, I said no, and I wondered how that was possible given how aware my doctor is of my symptoms. She never bothered to even *look* at the area that was causing me such pain. I googled my new diagnosis all the sites say things like \"pain is serious\" \"report this pain to your doctor\" \"treatments are available to help\". One medical assistant emailed me that my results were \"not anything bad\", as in, it's not cancer. I'm like, my crippling pain over the span of decades is \"not anything bad\"???\n\nMy father in law was a doctor, and when I told him how frustrated I was with my \"care\", he told me that doctors always see the same thing over and over. He compared it to horses and zebras; all day doctors see horses, they're all the same, and when a zebra comes in, it looks a hell of a lot like a horse to them. Zebras are pretty rare, so you aren't expecting to get one (he probably saw that explanation on an episode of House or something). Additionally, it's all a numbers game to them, 99.99% of the time it's X, why bother looking for Y? He also told me that doctors love to be \"right\", that they will diagnose you within moments and do whatever they have to do to stick to that first hunch.\n\nBeing a doctor these days also sucks. You often don't have the freedom to order whatever tests you want, and you don't have the time to spend with patients to really get to know their issues. He spent more time charting than seeing patients near the end, the tech that allows online records just makes more work for doctors somehow. Chronic pain is already stigmatized so badly, and drug seekers are a real thing, so it's easier/faster for them to just dismiss patients as crazy or drug seeking. I don't even ask for drugs!\n\nI have seen mental health professionals and the consensus is that I'm depressed because I'm in pain. Medical doctors refuse to test or treat me and say that I'm in pain because I'm depressed. I'm so exhausted from suffering all my life that I have a hard time continuing to fight. I haven't been to a doctor in over a year, I've just been quietly wasting away, and I'm actually scared to go today because I feel like the doctor will be worse than useless. I'm afraid she will make my life worse again. Sorry for the rant, I'm just so tired of this.\n\nTL;DR: trying to get treated for chronic pain and less visible symptoms is enough to make you go crazy if you weren't before. Even with imaging results that definitively prove that I'm suffering, they still don't believe me because I \"look fine\".

When I ask anyone on reddit, attempting to explain this whole unknown apathy in the medical field, I was downvoted and told that the doctor probably knows best or to find another doctor. Everyone on here couldn&amp;#39;t understand why I wanted to run my own tests and instead of pointing me in a direction I may be able to obtain them, I was ridiculed for my attempts. 10 years and with the help of my own acquired medical devices, I realize I have an autonomic nervous system disorder and finally get it diagnosed when I demand them to look at my numbers during certain events. But if I left it up to doctors entirely I&amp;#39;d be unemployed, homeless, and would definitely have a mental illness at that point coupled with my own physical issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "psychology", "name": "t1_dg8j0jv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492160629.0, "created_utc": 1492131829.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654wbm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654wbm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654wbm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654wbm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654wbm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654wbm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcz", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654wbm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8e5ll", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SunshineTeaCo", "parent_id": "t1_dg8dwow", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/psychology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "true that. thanks for being real. reddit is a place where we can express our opinions and at times, have intelligent debates.\n\ni'm just a neanderthal right now. :-)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;true that. thanks for being real. reddit is a place where we can express our opinions and at times, have intelligent debates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m just a neanderthal right now. :-)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "psychology", "name": "t1_dg8e5ll", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492154035.0, "created_utc": 1492125235.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8dwow", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mastelsa", "parent_id": "t1_dg8dfno", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/psychology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hey, no worries.
