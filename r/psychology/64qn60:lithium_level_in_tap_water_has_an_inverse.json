This is far from the first study finding inverse associations, but one of the reasons the correlation continues to generate so much skepticism/surprise is that the dose of lithium you get from tap water at normal concentrations is orders of magnitude below the therapeutic concentration: for example, in this study, they quote a mean concentration of 0.48 \u03bcg/liter (or 0.00048 mg/liter) - which is incredibly tiny compared to the 500mg+ doses used for bipolar. It gets worse when you consider how people don't drink that much tap water in the first place and how many imported foods and beverages they eat, because they're not even that exposed to local tap water. How many liters of tap water does a normal person drink in a day? Even 1 liter is actually quite a lot of water! (Try drinking a liter of water or milk sometime to see how easy it is.) Even if you say they drink a whole liter between tea and soup and other things, you're still comparing a dose of 0.00048 mg to 500.00000 mg a day; these are very different numbers, and it would be unusual to find a drug which is effective at the usual 1x dose and also at doses which are 1,041,666x times smaller. And of course, in studies like OP, you're not just comparing 0.00048 mg to 500.00000 mg, you're comparing 0.00048 mg to 0.00040 mg or 0.00056 mg etc.\n\nSo there's a problem of mechanism here: what mechanism causally links these tiny absolute differences in lifelong exposure to lithium in tap water to these surprisingly large population-level differences in suicide/violence/etc? Without a plausible biological mechanism, the effect size is so large it discredits itself and looks more consistent with residual confounding from urbanness or other things (which are always always always present in data like this and never controlled for completely). Based on the usual dose-response curves for almost anything, you would instead strongly confidently predict zero effect whatsoever.\n\nHence, as interesting as [I personally find it](https://www.gwern.net/Lithium), I have to admit that the probability this is a real causal relationship has to be quite low - it just doesn't make sense on a biological level. Still, it would be a tragedy if it turned out we really *could* cut suicide/violence rates by 20%+ just by adding a tiny bit of lithium to drinking water/food but the relationship was ignored by researchers. (It wouldn't be the first time biology has turned out to be surprising!) What I hope to see at some point is longitudinal samples of drinking water, which could link increases/decreases in lithium concentration due to weather within counties/towns to changes in suicide/violence; this would at least get around the primary concern that mineral levels in drinking water are just a proxy for urban/ruralness, mental hospital density, or altitude, to name some of the proposed confounds. (As far as I can tell, there is little or no longitudinal data because lithium is not routinely measured as part of tap water quality assurance, because it's never present in levels considered concerning or a health risk so it's either not tested for or numbers are not reported in publicly available datasets; which is a little ironic because it means that you can't show that *lack* of lithium may be a health risk.)", "edited": 1491945622.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fulltext: &lt;a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8oiecntpqgdwdpz/2017-ando.pdf\"&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/8oiecntpqgdwdpz/2017-ando.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This falls into the &amp;quot;I could have told you that&amp;quot; category.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, it doesn&amp;#39;t.

A large number of these degrees of freedoms ensures that you will find something \"significant\" at some point, but the probability of a false-positive finding approaches 100%. [See Simmons, Nelson, &amp; Simonsohn \\(2011\\)](http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/online_marketing/facultyCV/papers/nelson_false-positive.pdf) for a very instructive explanation of this.\n\nNext, p-values just below p = .05 are highly suspicious. The p-values indicate (roughly) the probability of finding such a large association between tap-water lithium and depressive symptoms *assuming there was in fact no association at all*. This is *not* to be confused with the probability that the null hypothesis (no association) is true given the data we observe. In fact, a p-value of p = .02 might be more likely to occur when there is no association; if there was a strong effect, we would rather expect something much smaller (e.g. p &lt; .001; especially so in large-ish samples). Matti Heino wrote a [great blog post](https://mattiheino.com/2016/12/02/p-walks-into-a-bar-chart/) about what p-values we can expect assuming various data situations.\n\nLast but not least, there is the obvious fact that at least the headline seems to follow common sense. Lithium in high doses can work against depression, so why shouldn't smaller doses have similar effects? Which leads to the problem of HARKing, a term coined by [Kerr \\(1998\\)](http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/528Readings/Kerr1998.pdf): Hypothesizing After the Results are Known. This (sadly) is common practice in certain parts of science: Find something potentially interesting, come up with a plausible story afterwards. There might have been hundreds of plausible stories hidden in the correlations between tap-water characteristics and a bunch of self-report questionnaires; just because they are telling one that seems to make sense doesn't mean that they couldn't have made sense of any other arbitrary false-positive finding. Even if they'd found the opposite, they would have been able to sell it as a paper and people would point out that it's obvious \u2013 how could we not expect that psychoactive drugs in tap water aren't damaging our health?!\n\nTL;DR: I wouldn't believe this study based on the number in the abstract.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here is what goes through my mind when I read the abstract as somebody who&amp;#39;s a bit more into statistics \u2013 not going to comment on the substantive part because I think &lt;a href=\"/u/gwern\"&gt;/u/gwern&lt;/a&gt; knows more about his:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;they could have analyzed all sorts of stuff in the tap water, i.e. there are potentially hundreds of interesting and potentially plausible dependent variables&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;they obviously had multiple outcome measures: abstract mentions depressive symptoms, interpersonal violence, suicidal behaviors (but there were probably more: if you assess such a large number of students with self-reports, you&amp;#39;ll probably ask for lots of different things)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the &amp;quot;significant&amp;quot; p-values (both p = .02) are suspiciously close to the significance-threshold of .05, which is (sadly) the magic number that helps you get shit published&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it looks like the had a large number of &amp;quot;researcher degrees of freedom&amp;quot; \u2013 lots of analyses they could have run (and probably did run). A large number of these degrees of freedoms ensures that you will find something &amp;quot;significant&amp;quot; at some point, but the probability of a false-positive finding approaches 100%. &lt;a href=\"http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/online_marketing/facultyCV/papers/nelson_false-positive.pdf\"&gt;See Simmons, Nelson, &amp;amp; Simonsohn (2011)&lt;/a&gt; for a very instructive explanation of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, p-values just below p = .05 are highly suspicious. The p-values indicate (roughly) the probability of finding such a large association between tap-water lithium and depressive symptoms &lt;em&gt;assuming there was in fact no association at all&lt;/em&gt;. This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be confused with the probability that the null hypothesis (no association) is true given the data we observe. In fact, a p-value of p = .02 might be more likely to occur when there is no association; if there was a strong effect, we would rather expect something much smaller (e.g. p &amp;lt; .001; especially so in large-ish samples). Matti Heino wrote a &lt;a href=\"https://mattiheino.com/2016/12/02/p-walks-into-a-bar-chart/\"&gt;great blog post&lt;/a&gt; about what p-values we can expect assuming various data situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, there is the obvious fact that at least the headline seems to follow common sense. Lithium in high doses can work against depression, so why shouldn&amp;#39;t smaller doses have similar effects? Which leads to the problem of HARKing, a term coined by &lt;a href=\"http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/%7Eschaller/528Readings/Kerr1998.pdf\"&gt;Kerr (1998)&lt;/a&gt;: Hypothesizing After the Results are Known.
