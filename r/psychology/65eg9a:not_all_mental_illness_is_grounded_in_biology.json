What are chemical or structural changes that occur? Can we target those areas and get desired behavioral results? That is tackled in the realm of biomedical and neurological communities. However, therapy can also cause biological changes to the brain. Neurological research investigates those biological changes. Mindfulness is such an approach where these fields have become interdisciplinary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arguing against reductionist approaches seems so outdated in the biological sciences. The biological sciences have rapidly adapted to interdisciplinary studies. In the case of psychology and psychiatry, anecdotally, I have already experienced the cooperation between these two disciplines. I am currently being treated simultaneously with therapy and psychiatric care, with the latter having recommended the former. Having moved states, my former psychiatrist had recommended me to read several books on the subject of my mental illness from the perspective of psychology. Given other comments in this thread, this does not seem to be atypical. So we seem to be confused with what you are arguing, because it seems like an outdated position that have started reconciling around two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "psychology", "name": "t1_dga9757", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492257700.0, "created_utc": 1492228900.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga7zcj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Snow_Mandalorian", "parent_id": "t1_dga6qid", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/psychology", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No, it's an argument against the biomedical reductive model that posits that all mental illness is at root a physiological impairment of the brain.
