Sorry for the long post\n\n\nSeveral studies have found a correlation between gender identity and brain structure.[6]\u00a0A first-of-its-kind study by Zhou\u00a0et al.\u00a0(1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the\u00a0stria terminalis\u00a0(BSTc), a region which is known for sex and\u00a0anxiety responses\u00a0(and which is affected by prenatal androgens),[7]\u00a0male-to-female trans women had a female-normal BSTc size (like\u00a0cisgender\u00a0women) and female-to-male trans men had a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still had sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.[8]\n\nIn a follow-up study, Kruijver\u00a0et al.\u00a0(2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou\u00a0et al.\u00a0(1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MtF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.[9]\n\nIn 2002, a follow-up study by Chung\u00a0et al.\u00a0found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung\u00a0et al.\u00a0theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the generation of a gender identity inconsistent with one's assigned sex.[10]\n\nIn a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirmed the earlier research as supporting the concept of transsexuality as a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain.[11]\u00a0Dick Swaab\u00a0(2004) concurs.[12]\n\nIn 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexuality was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou\u00a0et al.\u00a0(1995) and Kruijver\u00a0et al.\u00a0(2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MtF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FtM transsexual within the male range.[13]\n\nA 2009\u00a0MRI\u00a0study by Luders et al. of 24 MtF transsexuals not yet treated with cross-sex hormones found that regional\u00a0gray matter\u00a0concentrations were more similar to men than women, but there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right\u00a0putamen\u00a0compared to men.
