I don&amp;#39;t think they are going to have an answer for the $700 1080Ti &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, Nvidia just pulled a sucker-punch with the Ti and the 1080 price drop.  No one would&amp;#39;ve been shocked at a $800 1080Ti and a $600 1080.  For all we know, Vega has been targeting a &amp;quot;10% faster than 1080&amp;quot; @ ~$600...which looked good before the price drops we got/were going to get, but most were expecting everything slotted $100 higher.  I really beginning to think Nvidia just did more damage to the Vega launch than we&amp;#39;re all assuming.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They may not be able to sell the &amp;quot;vs 1080&amp;quot; GPU for under ~$550 without just giving them away.  If so, RIP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seems that was Nvidia&amp;#39;s plan, people were thinking Nvidia pulled a panic move and fire-selling Pascal a month ago - I think they know AMD is in too deep at this point with development and they just threw a HUGE wrench into Vega&amp;#39;s plans and targets.  Mind you, Nvidia probably knows &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; about Vega that we don&amp;#39;t...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll see soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A $475 &amp;quot;good AiB&amp;quot; 1080 doesn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; cheap, I guess.  But, it probably is what we&amp;#39;re gonna get.  A Strix 1080 on sale for under $500 plus a $25-30 rebate ain&amp;#39;t too shabby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the 1080Ti $50 more than the 980Ti, that puts the current 1080 price-point @ $450-475, in a sale, almost where my 980 was at $429 (plus $25 rebate) on Black Friday back then.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "buildapcsales", "name": "t1_dg635h0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492042334.0, "created_utc": 1492013534.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg611is", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IndigoMoss", "parent_id": "t1_dg60tg1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/buildapcsales", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well considering there's no relevant competition from the 1070 and up, if Vega releases a lower version that comes in around the $400 mark (which is likely given how they don't have anything above $200 right now), I don't see why Nvidia wouldn't go with further price drops.\n\nIn the case of the 980, it was positioned exactly where it should have been.
