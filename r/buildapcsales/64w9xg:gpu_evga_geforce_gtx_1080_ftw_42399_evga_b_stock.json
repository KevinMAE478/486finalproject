The modestly higher power delivery of the FTW cards (improved VRMs) doesn't really help here because it's mostly a matter of voltage limitations, not power limitations.  They may overclock better with some extra voltage, they may not.\n\nOut of all the Pascal cards - these are going to be the worst-performing.  They're essentially selected for that characteristic.
