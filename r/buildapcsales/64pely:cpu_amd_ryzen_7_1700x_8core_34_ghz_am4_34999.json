Ryzen is maybe 20% faster at the same clock, and you can expect to overclock 10-15% higher clock than the 3.5 ghz of the 2600.  So I make it about a 35% single-threaded improvement.  Of course the real reason to upgrade is if you need more cores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you can hold off upgrading, intel&amp;#39;s going to have to respond with a competitive 6/8 core of their own.
