There&amp;#39;s a few routes around, but they&amp;#39;ll all take you in a circle eventually, and can lead to an additional area. This area might be a little advanced for a newcomer at your level still I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A third option is the New Londo ruins. You can find Transient Curses relatively nearby, however this place is probably more advanced than the second option, so you might find ti even more struggling as it&amp;#39;s a mid-to-late game destination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind the other two of these locations are eventually mandatory, so don&amp;#39;t fear as you&amp;#39;ll end up exploring them in due time if you choose to focus on the Capra Demon route.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls", "name": "t1_dg9hbi6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492220980.0, "created_utc": 1492192180.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sazo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dwb6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9mw1z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "troop98", "parent_id": "t3_65dwb6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; foolishly\n\nOh, you wont be thinking that by the end\n\nFor capra, kill the dogs first, but be careful to not get cornered.
