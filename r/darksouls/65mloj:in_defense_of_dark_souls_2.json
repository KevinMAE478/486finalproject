The issue is that the developers of Dark Souls 2 clearly didn't have the interconnected world as a focus of theirs, and although it's paid some service in Dark Souls 3, Demon's Souls and Bloodborne didn't have much in the way of world design either. (Bloodborne had a bit, but so much of the game was spent warping to places that were wholly separate from the rest of the game that it's nowhere near the same level.)\n\nDark Souls 2's world design isn't amazing, but it's not particularly bad either. Sure, it's not as good as Dark Souls 1, but what game is? But it made up for lacking an interconnected world by *actually making its areas diverse*.

I think it&amp;#39;s clear that the developers wanted something different than Dark Souls 1, and while they could have done a better job, the fact that they did something different makes the game neither good nor worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls", "name": "t1_dgbq7tj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492348833.0, "created_utc": 1492320033.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sazo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mloj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbtr18", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "weclock", "parent_id": "t1_dgbpllo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I can tell from your post you didn't watch the video.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can tell from your post you didn&amp;#39;t watch the video.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls", "name": "t1_dgbtr18", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492357321.0, "created_utc": 1492328521.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbpllo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NinjaDinoCornShark", "parent_id": "t1_dgbp423", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're putting words in my mouth, do not do that.\n\nHere's how I see it: Dark Souls 1 had a *year* of development.

But here's the thing- here's the beauty part- the game that introduced Soul Memory is also the game that has a dedicated PvP arena (that actually works) that is based on SL instead of SM. Sure invasions aren't going to be as strong, but if you want PvP and don't like Soul Memory, they've given you an out.\n\n&gt; So many bosses in Dark Souls 2 relying on fighting against multiple opponents (doing this a few times isn't bad by any means, but it ends up feeling cheap and uninteresting when it's done every other boss fight, especially in NG+).\n\nDefinitely true, but is that enough to make the game as a whole bad? Dark Souls 1 had 26 bosses, 5 of which were based around fighting multiple enemies (in some way or another). Dark Souls 2 had 41, 15 of which were based around fighting multiple enemies (in some way or another). Yes there's more, but there's as many single-enemy bosses in Dark Souls 2 than there were bosses as a whole in Dark Souls 1. But again, does that make it better or worse or is it just different?\n\n&gt; So many bosses being slow, big dudes in armor with your standard 3-horizontal-hit combo, slow horizontal hit and overhead attack.\n\nAgain, yes that's true, but the number of non-Dude-in-Armor bosses is so high that I don't think it can be used as an example of why the game is inherently bad.\n\n&gt; Lifegems trivializing healing management (you can pop a Lifegem every time you go down to 80% HP, while that would had been a waste of an Estus charge in DaS1).\n\nThis is once again a difference of focus from the developers, and one that is different in every single game in the series. While Dark Souls 1 emphasized the risk vs. reward of limited healing, Demon's Souls gave no concern to the idea of limited healing, Bloodborne did something completely different with their system, and Dark Souls 3 was the closest to Dark Souls 1 but also provided so many ways to regenerate health that anyone who wanted more healing could get it. No game in the series does this *badly*- they just all do it differently. You may prefer one or another, but it's not like there's an accepted baseline.\n\nThe hitboxes are definitely a problem (they're definitely my biggest issue with the game) but Dark Souls 1 had plenty of hitbox issues too, but nobody ever talks about those. Dark Souls had plenty of texture issues too (not to mention frame rate issues that to this day have not been fixed), but clearly these issues didn't make or break Dark Souls 1; why do they make or break Dark Souls 2?\n\n&gt; There clearly wasn't as much effort put in the NPCs. For the most part you talk to them once in the world, then they move to Majula and never do anything again other than to stand around to sell you stuff.\n\nAgain, a different focus from the developers. If you hadn't played Dark Souls 1 you never would have had any issue with it because it's still better than most games.

Yes there&amp;#39;s more, but there&amp;#39;s as many single-enemy bosses in Dark Souls 2 than there were bosses as a whole in Dark Souls 1. But again, does that make it better or worse or is it just different?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So many bosses being slow, big dudes in armor with your standard 3-horizontal-hit combo, slow horizontal hit and overhead attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, yes that&amp;#39;s true, but the number of non-Dude-in-Armor bosses is so high that I don&amp;#39;t think it can be used as an example of why the game is inherently bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lifegems trivializing healing management (you can pop a Lifegem every time you go down to 80% HP, while that would had been a waste of an Estus charge in DaS1).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is once again a difference of focus from the developers, and one that is different in every single game in the series. While Dark Souls 1 emphasized the risk vs. reward of limited healing, Demon&amp;#39;s Souls gave no concern to the idea of limited healing, Bloodborne did something completely different with their system, and Dark Souls 3 was the closest to Dark Souls 1 but also provided so many ways to regenerate health that anyone who wanted more healing could get it. No game in the series does this &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt;- they just all do it differently. You may prefer one or another, but it&amp;#39;s not like there&amp;#39;s an accepted baseline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hitboxes are definitely a problem (they&amp;#39;re definitely my biggest issue with the game) but Dark Souls 1 had plenty of hitbox issues too, but nobody ever talks about those. Dark Souls had plenty of texture issues too (not to mention frame rate issues that to this day have not been fixed), but clearly these issues didn&amp;#39;t make or break Dark Souls 1; why do they make or break Dark Souls 2?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There clearly wasn&amp;#39;t as much effort put in the NPCs. For the most part you talk to them once in the world, then they move to Majula and never do anything again other than to stand around to sell you stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, a different focus from the developers. If you hadn&amp;#39;t played Dark Souls 1 you never would have had any issue with it because it&amp;#39;s still better than most games. Just because the game has less focus on NPC storylines than the first game doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean it&amp;#39;s bad, just different.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls", "name": "t1_dgcat93", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492392510.0, "created_utc": 1492363710.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc9bie", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pancak", "parent_id": "t1_dgc82kr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; but every person I've ever heard with a somewhat legitimate beef against Dark Souls 2 criticizes it for the same reasons they praise Dark Souls 1.\n\nThat's surprising.

For example, the corridor to the Velstadt fight, in which you are faced against multiple very tough enemies that can quickly group against you and kill you quickly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This types of encounters should have the player in control of the fight for him to do the croud-control that HBomber loves to talk about. But encounters as the one described before can&amp;#39;t be crowd-controlled consistently for it to be considered fair. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls", "name": "t1_dgcbfzu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492393347.0, "created_utc": 1492364547.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc7i00", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "defiantleek", "parent_id": "t1_dgc6leb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm specifically looking at the targeting and how he did it, to not really adapt your playstyle is playing wrong tbh.
