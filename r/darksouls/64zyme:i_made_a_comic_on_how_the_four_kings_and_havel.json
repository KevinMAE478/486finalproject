What help could you offer me?\n\n4K: Humbly, my lord, I must insist you underestimate the might of Man. Our strength comes not only from within our will, but from our faith. We offer as example, our fiercest warrior. His power exumes not even a stench of the Dark. Havel, come forth!\n\nHavel: My lord. I am Havel the Rock.

I will show you why it is my namesake.\n\n*rock meets a hard place*\n\nGwyn: Indeed, you have incredible strength!\n\n4K: Amongst our kind, his strength is unmatched, though he has accrued a following. They flock to this man, the Rock, who had the whole of his family and birthplace destroyed by an Ancient Dragon with skin of earthen rock. The man here wrenched a tooth from the beast and used it to smash its head into dust. A little after that, he carved himself this armor, entirely of stone and chain. His hate and strength together spell the end of the Ancient Dragons.\n\nGwyn: In the past, Mankind has been a threat to me and my people. You have proven to me that they can in fact be allied to us as well.

Another great triumph to bolster our defense against the Ancient Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwynevere: Congratulations, father.

I am still worried about the hideous beast we have imprisoned in the Depths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: Do you mean that demon? I&amp;#39;ll see to it that your brother and I take care of our prisoner. Though I imagined Duke Seath has taken interest in it by now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silver Knight: Lord Gwyn, I am sorry to interrupt. There are four humans here, calling themselves kings that wish for an audience with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: You mean those that abandoned the Ringed City? How could they have even arrived here? With Lloyd&amp;#39;s help no doubt. Tell them I refuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwynevere: Father... please. Lloyd is still kin, his wishes dear to us. At least give them audience, if nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: I shall, then. By your grace only, my daughter. Bring them in, then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4K: We are the Four Kings. We represent the humans who wish to live above. Your audience is a great honor, Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: You humans... who dare to abandon my Filianore and follow aimlessly the &amp;#39;Allfather,&amp;#39;and proclaim themselves monarchs, what could you possibly ask of me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4K: Sire, we wish to fight alongside our Lord and his mighty army. We do not befit ourselves slave knights, we wish to bolster your front with the power we have obtained on the Path of the Way of White.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: Fools! Without the strength offered to you by the Abyss, you are powerless to stand against the Dragons. What help could you offer me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4K: Humbly, my lord, I must insist you underestimate the might of Man. Our strength comes not only from within our will, but from our faith. We offer as example, our fiercest warrior. His power exumes not even a stench of the Dark. Havel, come forth!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Havel: My lord. I am Havel the Rock. If you are to test my might, seek any opponent for me, and I will smite them. Upon my word, I will not falter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: Ah, very well. Upon your word is it? I may have just the opponent for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Havel: My lord, I shall vanquish your foes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4K: What is that thing? That vile creature!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: It was once a dragon, but its proximity to the First Flame and the refuse surrounding it have turned it into an abomination. A toxic Demon, no less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Havel: You mean for me to defeat this unholy brute?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: Do you still mean to face it down? Its vile transformation has bolstered the defensive quality of its scales. It is nigh unkillable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Havel: My lord, no opponent can break the Rock. I will show you why it is my namesake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;rock meets a hard place&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: Indeed, you have incredible strength!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4K: Amongst our kind, his strength is unmatched, though he has accrued a following. They flock to this man, the Rock, who had the whole of his family and birthplace destroyed by an Ancient Dragon with skin of earthen rock. The man here wrenched a tooth from the beast and used it to smash its head into dust. A little after that, he carved himself this armor, entirely of stone and chain. His hate and strength together spell the end of the Ancient Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: In the past, Mankind has been a threat to me and my people. You have proven to me that they can in fact be allied to us as well.

It&amp;#39;s a great honour to meet you, Gwyn, my Lord of Sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: You humans; self proclaimed kings who dare to leave the Ringed city, leaving my Filianore and joining with Lloyd. What do you want?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four Kings: We wish to fight alongside my lord against the dragons - but not as slaves like the Ringed knights, rather as allies. We also wish my lord to acknowledge us as we do not use the power of the abyss that my lord doth(or &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;) despise. We&amp;#39;ll only follow the way of white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: What can you do? Without harnessing the abyssal strengths of the Dark Soul you&amp;#39;re just a tiny little dwarf. I doubt you can stand against a dragon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four Kings: My lord, you&amp;#39;re underestimating us humans. Our strength is not only within our soul but also our will and faith. To prove this we&amp;#39;ll show my lord our strongest warrior that does not have any stench of dark. Havel the Rock, come!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Havel: My lord I am Havel the Rock. If my lord have any doubt on my strength, please show me an opponent. On my honor I&amp;#39;ll put them down no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: Hmph, as a human you looked so highly of yourself. Alright, I have an opponent for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Havel: Thank you my lord, I promise you&amp;#39;ll not be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four Kings: What is that monster!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: It once a dragon but it get to close to the first flame. The dragon mutated and become a demon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Havel: &lt;del&gt;So I need to take it down right?&lt;/del&gt; Just say the word. (makes more sense for him to declare something rather than asking) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: Are you sure you want to face that monster? Because of the mutation, the dragon scales have been imbued &lt;del&gt;through it skin and bones&lt;/del&gt; with incredible toughness. It&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to kill it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Havel: My lord Gwyn, I&amp;#39;ll show you why they call me The Rock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: What incredible strength!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four Kings: Even amongst us humans his strength is abnormal but he has many followers who try to achieve it. Havel content  living peacefully at the Ringed city but suddenly a giant Archdragon, with skin made entirely out of stone, laid rampage to his town. Havels family including his wife and child have been devoured by the dragon. In his rage, Havel tore out the dragon&amp;#39;s tooth and use it to smash the dragons head into pieces. Later, Havel carved the dragon stone skin with his bare hands and made it his armor and shield. He swear to get his revenge on all the dragons as long as he lives. His hatred of the dragons is unmatched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: Because of your progenitor I had believed that humans are a threat, but you&amp;#39;ve proven me that they can be more. Havel, I acknowledge your strength; let&amp;#39;s fight the dragons together as comrades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Havel: My lord, your words are too great for one so insignificant as myself. I&amp;#39;ll follow you until the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Giant: My lord... the corpse....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwyn: Just throw that thing to the lake.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls", "name": "t1_dg6c3wl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492051496.0, "created_utc": 1492022696.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sazo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zyme", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6c7tt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "brokenfury8585", "parent_id": "t3_64zyme", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I like the art style a lot, almost made me think of dark souls from the 90s", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the art style a lot, almost made me think of dark souls from the 90s&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls", "name": "t1_dg6c7tt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492051608.0, "created_utc": 1492022808.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sazo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zyme", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6svd4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CynicBlaze", "parent_id": "t3_64zyme", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're drawings are very good!
