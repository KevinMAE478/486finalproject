That shows how much the weapon scales its own damage based off of your stats.  It doesn't show the exact numbers, but It scales poorly with DEX but averagely with STR.  \n\n\"What weapons/armor do I use\"\n\n- Your armor's protection doesn't matter too entirely much, what does matter is your equip load.  There's 3 levels of speed affected by the weight of all your gear together, Fastrolling, Midrolling and Fatrolling.  Fast is most of the time the sought-after, though I did my first playthrough p. much full midrolling and I was fine.  Fatrolling is the third, and most of the time never really desired except for one boss in the lategame which some people prefer to tank up with beefy high-poise armor and go to town on.  (Poise is a stat that armor has, the higher it is the less you stagger from getting attacked)\n\n- Dawg, it was a 20% drop over I think a few, so it's not crazy lucky, but basically all of the Black Knight weapons are great.  BKS is more than enough to carry you to the final boss, damage-wise.  But, if you wanna experiment, feel free.  The weapons aren't all about just what does more damage.  What attacks faster, what has a longer reach, try out a bunch n' see what catches your fancy!\n\n\"How do I upgrade my shit\"\n\n- 'm sure by now you've either stumbled across one in the open or you've found enemies that drop things called Titanite.  This is the stuff you use to upgrade your weapons/armor.  Bring the stuff to a blacksmith (like Andre down below the bonfire in the Undead Parish (the place just after the Taurus Demon)) and he can upgrade your weapons for you.  But, different weapons can require different kinds of titanite.  Your Black Knight Sword, for example, takes Twinkling Titanite to upgrade, though your Elite Knight Set takes regular Titanite Shards to upgrade.\n\n\n\nIf I neglected to touch on anything else, point it out, but this should be good for now.
