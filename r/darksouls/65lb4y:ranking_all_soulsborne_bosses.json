I want to share this work that I had with you and maybe hear some of your opinions to your favorite bosses and also what you would have done differently. I\u2019ll have two files below: every boss with its individual General Scale and the grade of each category and also the list of bosses from worse to best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note 1: I must say that some categories of my Grading System might have required some of my own opinions about certain aspects of the boss, so do not take my list as ABSOLUTE TRUTH. Each person has his/her own favorite bosses, even me. That is why I also decided to add a list of MY top 10 bosses and a subsequent explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-My Grading System kindly nicknamed \u2013 General Scaling: Gameplay, Soundtrack, Environment, Visual, Impact and Lore&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*First of all I separated the boss in certain categories to better analyze it. Each category can receive a grade from 0-10 and in the end you sum and divide by the number of categories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;There are two groups of categories: the GSEV and the IL&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;GSEV stands for Gameplay, Soundtrack, Environment and Visual. These are more physical and mechanical categories for the boss and analyze it as a boss in the game.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;IL stands for Impact and Lore. These are more personal categories and analyze it as an impact on the player and its importance on the lore of the game.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*After both GSEV and IL are finished, they are both summed and divided by 2 to arrive at the General Scaling. I used this method as I believe that a good boss is not only good because of its gameplay features, but also on the ability to leave a long lasting effect on the player and on the story. Below I\u2019ll explain what each of these categories mean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gameplay: analyzes a boss\u2019 mechanics, movements, features, attacks, methods of winning and difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*I must add that \u2018difficulty\u2019 in gameplay is not solely a measure of the boss\u2019 difficulty, but actually of the boss\u2019 complexity. A difficult boss is not necessarily a good or bad boss, but a complex one definitely makes it above many.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Soundtrack: analyzes the boss\u2019 theme and its effects (Does it make the fight better? Does it make the fight tenser? Does it immerse the player on the moment? How would the fight be without such theme?).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Environment: analyzes the boss arena, its impact on the player and on the fight itself as well as how well designed and beautiful it is. The area before the boss is also taken into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Visual: analyzes the boss\u2019 physical design (there is not much more to it)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Impact: analyzes what lasting effect it has on the players and the impression people have as they first encounter a certain boss (this could be beneficial or not, the point is to grade the boss on how good is his impact). If a boss is remembered, there is a reason to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lore: analyzes how the boss fares on the perspective of the lore&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*In a world like the one in Dark Souls, lore is a very important aspect that explains why a certain character is a boss and why you are fighting it. If a boss has insignificant lore, it is probably a bad boss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Now with each category explained, it will be easier to understand the list. However, first I want to show you how the grading system works with an example:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boss #1: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GSEV: to calculate this is simple: G+S+E+V= 5+4+6+2= 17 (now divide by 4) /4= 4.25&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IL: same thing for IL: I+L= 4+7= 11 (divide by 2) /2= 5.5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.G (5) \u2013 (0-10)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.S (4) \u2013 (0-10)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.E (6) \u2013 (0-10)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.V (2) \u2013 (0-10)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.I (4) \u2013 (0-10)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.L (7) \u2013 (0-10)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*With both the GSEV and IL calculated: 4.25+5.5= 9.7 (divide by 2) /2= 4.85 (General Scale)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note 2: Although a number like 4.85 may seem small, for my list it is actually good. I consider a boss bad if it is below 3.0 and average to good if below 4.5. A boss above 5.0 is very good or excellent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note 3: Before people start attacking me because certain bosses are much higher than others, I must say that I tried being as impartial as I could. I went through all the bosses and paid attention to every detail.
