Experiment, learn patterns, gitgud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried caster builds first in just about every soulsborne game. I get maybe halfway through and then get stuck. I like caster builds in other games, but it didn&amp;#39;t gel for me until DkS2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t beat Demon Souls until I rolled a STR build and got the DBS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t beat Dark Souls until I learned to love the bass cannon (and poise/great shields). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, in Bloodborne I ran straight for the heavy STR weapons, and finally beat the game recently. (I made a bloodtinge/skill build after, and it was much harder to start with - lots of trial and error).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t learn how to parry (greatshields ftw) until my fourth souls game (bloodborne), so getting gud doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily require actual mastery of game mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls", "name": "t1_dg98elq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492210710.0, "created_utc": 1492181910.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sazo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65c0sx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg99uv0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SaturnAscension", "parent_id": "t3_65c0sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Trial and error.
