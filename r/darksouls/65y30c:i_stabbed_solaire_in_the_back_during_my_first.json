This was my first time playing the game. I had just come off of bad experiences with the black knight and Havel, and I was flinching at shadows after the fight with the Taurus Demon. I managed to beat it on the first try with plunging attacks and luckily timed ladder climbing, but I was out of Estus and I didn&amp;#39;t want to have to wade back through the horde of undead between the boss area and the bonfire. It&amp;#39;s only four rooms, but that&amp;#39;s scary to a new player, and so when I saw the guy on the balcony, I froze. I&amp;#39;d played a shitload of video games. I knew an arena when I saw one, and I still hadn&amp;#39;t hit a freaking checkpoint. This guy was standing there, not doing anything, looking off into the distance with his back turned, and the last guy who did that was the giant scary fucker who followed me back through the whole level to the bonfire and then stabbed me. So I struck first. I crept up to him just like I did with the black knight, and I stabbed him, thinking I had succeeded here where I failed there. But he still had health left, and by some glitch or miracle he wasn&amp;#39;t killing me yet, so I stabbed him again, barely registering that he was complaining about it. Then he dropped a cool sword, so I assumed I&amp;#39;d done nothing wrong. This guy must just have a line when you kill him. That&amp;#39;s cool. I didn&amp;#39;t think anything else of it until school a couple days later. A friend and I were talking about my experience with the game. He was the one who told me to get it in the first place, and he asked what weapon I was using. I told him it was called the sunlight straight sword. He looked at me strangely and asked where I found it, so I told him the heroic tale of my encounter on the bridge. He didn&amp;#39;t think it was nearly as impressive as I did. To this day he gets a little bit salty when I bring it up. But that sword and the halberd took me all the way through my first playthrough, and honestly I can&amp;#39;t say I regret it. That character later became my first one with which I saved Solaire on his NG+ cycle, so honestly I consider the matter settled. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I still feel pretty bad about it.
