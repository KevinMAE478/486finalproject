To call DS3 DS1 rehashed isn't fair - they take place evidently in the same world, but DS3 gives an insight into how far this world has declined since the age of gods.

I was thrown off a little at first since you feel a little different, and there's definite inspiration from Bloodborne (some would argue it doesn't overlap into souls well), but I think it's welcome. Enemies in the previous games were all slow as hell. DS3's quicker and smarter enemies that incorporate shoves and roll-catches are an insight into how far From Soft's PvE philosophy advanced. They evidently wanted more pressuring enemies and a more tense first-time experience, and I think they accomplished it very well. The lack of DS1 poise is contentious, but DS1 poise was such a giant crutch for new players that when I played through it in full havel's in 2011 I barely tried to roll anything.

I speedrun the game at times when I'm feeling incredibly bored. I love it, but there are criticisms for it nonetheless. DS1 was intended to be the start of the series that DS3 would end and there's a definite and conscious effort between the two games to make the enemies less one-dimensional and more aggressive. I guess you're more into the atmosphere of the games than the quicker gameplay, and that's cool. DS1 also has the famously interconnected world that I can't get over even now that really gives it an atmosphere. Something else people throb over is the way mage builds and such are worse in this game. There's really no excuse for how little DPS magic offers in comparison to melee, but I think it's a consequence of the game being made too fast for spells to hit anyone not pre-occupied or bloodthirsty. A point people also overlook - poise not being in DS3 the way it was in DS1 means people are more eager to actually roll things instead of shielding or tanking it because you don't get to upgrade giants or have 99 humanity damage protections any more.

I'm sort of just trying to say that the games are intentionally very distinctly different from each other and calling DS3 DS1 but Bloodborne discredits the effort made entirely. In my opinion DS3 is proof From Soft never intended for you to 'git gud' or any of that shit. They refined everything and took away parts of what made the last two games special, but the focus on co-op improvements and a streamlining of the rougher parts of the previous games does show a genuine and unbiased effort to make it a great game, albeit in a way more devoted players don't like.

In my opinion DS3 is proof From Soft never intended for you to &amp;#39;git gud&amp;#39; or any of that shit. They refined everything and took away parts of what made the last two games special, but the focus on co-op improvements and a streamlining of the rougher parts of the previous games does show a genuine and unbiased effort to make it a great game, albeit in a way more devoted players don&amp;#39;t like. It&amp;#39;s also a clear effort to make the last game of the series a comfortable one that stands up on its own well. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls", "name": "t1_dgddgti", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492457309.0, "created_utc": 1492428509.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 45}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sazo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uc69", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sazo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uc69", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdbfnh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "n33k33", "parent_id": "t1_dgdavnb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; The fire fades, the world is going to the gutter.

All in all a good game better than DS2 but still way below Ds1, BB and DeSo to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls", "name": "t1_dgdfo96", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492462113.0, "created_utc": 1492433313.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sazo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uc69", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdebb2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "the-onepunchman", "parent_id": "t3_65uc69", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls", "controversiality": 0, "body": "haven't played 3 but every time I see it it is the first souls game other then bloodborne that exites me, when i saw one and two I didn't really like it, until I actually got into it, Sometimes I understand the critisiscm for the other games but sometimes its just nostalgia goggles, since I came from ds2 to ds1 I can see a lot of faults in 1 and a lot it does right, but I sinceraly think it might be the soul game I might most enjoy", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;haven&amp;#39;t played 3 but every time I see it it is the first souls game other then bloodborne that exites me, when i saw one and two I didn&amp;#39;t really like it, until I actually got into it, Sometimes I understand the critisiscm for the other games but sometimes its just nostalgia goggles, since I came from ds2 to ds1 I can see a lot of faults in 1 and a lot it does right, but I sinceraly think it might be the soul game I might most enjoy&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls", "name": "t1_dgdebb2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492459352.0, "created_utc": 1492430552.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sazo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uc69", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sazo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uc69", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdpvoz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gztichy", "parent_id": "t1_dgdln2m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls", "controversiality": 0, "body": "the shrine of amana, dragon aerie/dragon shrine, outside areas of shulva, and brume tower are pretty cool\n\nheide's tower is also nice, but it's so damn short and linear; iron keep has some neat parts to it (the entrance and area right before smelter demon is good), but holy fuck is it the most annoying place ever to deal with with all the alonne knights\n\nI think it would've helped if ds2 wasn't so damn boxy and clean for the most part; I mean come on, the primal bonfires are basically in giant plain rectangular prisms. that's just lazy.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;the shrine of amana, dragon aerie/dragon shrine, outside areas of shulva, and brume tower are pretty cool&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;heide&amp;#39;s tower is also nice, but it&amp;#39;s so damn short and linear; iron keep has some neat parts to it (the entrance and area right before smelter demon is good), but holy fuck is it the most annoying place ever to deal with with all the alonne knights&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it would&amp;#39;ve helped if ds2 wasn&amp;#39;t so damn boxy and clean for the most part; I mean come on, the primal bonfires are basically in giant plain rectangular prisms. that&amp;#39;s just lazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "darksouls", "name": "t1_dgdpvoz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475662.0, "created_utc": 1492446862.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sazo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uc69", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sazo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uc69", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdtb1f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HuffmanDickings", "parent_id": "t1_dgdqd1u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/darksouls", "controversiality": 0, "body": "some of them are neat... iconic might be stretch.
