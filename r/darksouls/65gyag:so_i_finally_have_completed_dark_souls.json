Immediately went out and bought it.  Went over to my buddies house and we both loved it.  It was the atmosphere that drew me in and I loved the faster gameplay.  No shields was what did it for me.  I&amp;#39;ve always been good at games like the Ninja Gaiden series and the PS2 Shinobi (underrated game), so BB just clicked for me.  Still my favorite PS4 exclusive and I don&amp;#39;t ever see than changing.  BB was my first souls game that I completed and holds a special place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So after BB and watching Vaati vids for the lore, I started watching his DS3 news videos and decided I would get DS3 and hopefully have a different experience.  After playing BB, I was more than ready for DS3.  I even found it easy at some points, definitely not as hard as BB.  Have about 200 hours sunk into it and the optional boss in Ringed City is the only one I haven&amp;#39;t solo&amp;#39;d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After DS3, I decided to go back and play the first.  Tonight, with my little brother (he&amp;#39;s 5, loves watching me play DS and even plays low level areas on my leveled characters!) I finally completed my first playthrough of DS1!  I feel like this has been such a long time coming and I&amp;#39;m so happy I was able to get into these games.  It literally took me years to finally click with them, but when it clicks (you know what that feels like) there is really no other feeling like it in gaming.  Beating certain bosses is like a drug, you get high when you finally win.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all this, I recorded my first ever fight with Gywn and this is how it went:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/iWlOnfCwnoo\"&gt;https://youtu.be/iWlOnfCwnoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just hope more people start to give these games a chance and stick with them.  I know FROM has said DS3 is the last souls game, but I hope they just mean the Souls franchise and the style of game doesn&amp;#39;t disappear.  I&amp;#39;m still hoping for BB2, but we&amp;#39;ll see.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, sorry for the history lesson, I just felt like sharing.
