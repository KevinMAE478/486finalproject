I think that Toxic Nest build might have a place here, but it&amp;#39;s not like Towers of Doom where Abathur can steal altars, and the scouting camps are going to be a &lt;em&gt;nightmare&lt;/em&gt; when the enemy team repeatedly uses them to find you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also a lot more open than ToD and even Braxis, both of which at least have predictable corridors you can mine up for safety. My first impression of Hanamura is that while there are plenty of walls and obstacles, they actual pathways themselves are pretty open, allowing enemies to evade your mines pretty easily. I&amp;#39;ll do a bunch of playtesting tonight though, maybe it&amp;#39;s not as bad as I&amp;#39;m afraid of.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "name": "t1_dgdqeso", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476250.0, "created_utc": 1492447450.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65w67n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgds0f0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kaarous", "parent_id": "t1_dgdpcxr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Except for how that dragon coin thing will reveal him.
