Grafted into a cyborg body by Overwatch, Genji walks his own path as one who fights for what&amp;#39;s right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://media.blizzard.com/heroes/genji/skins/videos/oni-genji.webm\"&gt;ONI GENJI&lt;/a&gt;: It is said that an oni with an iron club is invincible. But that&amp;#39;s nothing compared to an oni with a katana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://media.blizzard.com/heroes/genji/skins/videos/steel-dragon-genji.webm\"&gt;STEEL DRAGON GENJI&lt;/a&gt;: Though he used to struggle with being part man and part machine, Genji has since come to terms with his dual nature. Improving his body along with his spirit was the obvious next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage: 8/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utility: 4/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survivability: 4/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complexity: 6/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://media.blizzard.com/heroes/genji/abilities/thumbnails/shuriken.jpg\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shuriken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throw 3 Shuriken in a spread pattern, each dealing 65 damage to the first enemy hit. Stores up to 3 charges. Shuriken&amp;#39;s cooldown replenishes all charges at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://media.blizzard.com/heroes/genji/abilities/thumbnails/deflect.jpg\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deflect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Become Protected for 1.25 seconds.

While active, Dragonblade can be reactivated to lunge forward and slash in a huge arc, dealing 240 damage.
