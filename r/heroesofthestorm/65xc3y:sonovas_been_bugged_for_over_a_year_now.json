You&amp;#39;re also dead from that Muradin that jumped on you because you can&amp;#39;t block Stormbolt because your decoy is still on cooldown.  &amp;quot;Decoy uptime&amp;quot; is a meaningless stat. Let me ask you which is better: a Decoy with 10 min duration and 10 minute cooldown OR Decoy with 5 second duration and 5 second cooldown. The answer is obvious, the 5 second version. Both have the same uptime but it&amp;#39;s much better to get to reposition your decoy frequently and you get more opportunity to trick enemies because they are new decoys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;40% is not better than 25% when you consider percent OF WHAT. I thought you said you used your brain?  40% of 1 hero&amp;#39;s damage is less than half the damage of 25% of 5 heroes&amp;#39; damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get some of your points, and I&amp;#39;m gonna try the build again to see for myself, but you don&amp;#39;t seem to fully understand what Nova is capable of and your talent choices reflect that. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "name": "t1_dgea221", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492499028.0, "created_utc": 1492470228.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge9ats", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "XFactorNova", "parent_id": "t1_dge81b2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So what you are saying is you play meta?
