Knowing when to go in as a tank, knowing when to save someone vs let them die so you can save someone else as a support, knowing who to attack and what CDs to use when as DPS, knowing how to flank and how to defend against flanks as a bruiser, these are important and interesting skills. A Muradin should know if they&amp;#39;ll be able to survive diving into the enemy team, and similarly that player should know if ETC would survive sliding into the enemy team if they were on ETC. A Rehgar should be able to figure out &amp;quot;who is more useful to my team right now, Zeratul or Tyrael?&amp;quot; based on aspects such as who has been playing better, who has their heroic available, who is more useful in this situation right now, and be able to time Ancestral to get as much value as possible - so the enemy team uses cooldowns on your target but they still manage to stay alive, rather than using it in such a way that you&amp;#39;ll &amp;quot;waste&amp;quot; a significant portion of the heal on Ancestral, or doing it too late so they die and it goes on a 10s CD. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adding skill for the sake of adding skill is not good game design. It would similarly be &amp;quot;skill&amp;quot; if, whenever you cast your ult, you had to input Up-Down-Left-Right on your direction pads in order to &amp;quot;confirm&amp;quot; your ult within a certain amount of time, otherwise it fails to cast and gets put on a 10s CD. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s a good feature to add to the game. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "name": "t1_dgc3ysw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492383250.0, "created_utc": 1492354450.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc36rp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Arkislife1", "parent_id": "t1_dgbz6x3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's a skill you learn regardless.\n\nResource management is a skill.
