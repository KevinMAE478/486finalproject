On one BoE game as Li-Ming, he points out the way the enemy is moving during team fights and their positioning. The main thing that allows him to dominate is that people run away from him (or run at him) in a straight line rather than try and juke in parallel directions like a higher league player would.

The Samuro repeated this mistake throughout the match, not adjusting when they had died several times either. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "name": "t1_dgdkesu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469267.0, "created_utc": 1492440467.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd29dy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LadyParadox86", "parent_id": "t3_65o4vg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The disdain for people in lower ranks is weird to me.
