I didn&amp;#39;t mention it then, but with AA shells you retain some usability against PvE objectives that you lose completely with Snipe Master. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m terrible at math, but for the sake of science I went in try mode and did the calculations myself, mainly because your method assumed you had AA shells/Snipe Master at level 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using Snipe&amp;#39;s in-game tooltip with the very well hidden character sheet (C in game), &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; assuming you can somehow reach full stack of Snipe Master before hitting level 8, I noted these values :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snipe level 7 = 408 damage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;BA level 7 = 138&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untalented level 7 combo (Snipe + 1 BA) = 546 damage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untalented level 7 combo (Snipe + 3 BA) = 822&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AA Shell at level 7 = 346&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 AA Shells + Snipe combo = 754&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Master&amp;#39;d Snipe at level 7 (full stacks) = 714&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Master&amp;#39;d Snipe + 1 BA = 852&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Master&amp;#39;d Snipe + 3 BA = 1128&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So where your result is that AA shells is 5% higher damage, my 852/754 equals an about 12% damage difference in Snipe Master&amp;#39;s favor (under the condition that you maintain stacks and only attack heroes).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "name": "t1_dg4f1r0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491953584.0, "created_utc": 1491924784.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4daum", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kalulosu", "parent_id": "t1_dg4cle4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; You've lost me when you started describing a build that contained (to my understanding) both Gathering Power and Snipe Master, two talents that never existed at the same time on Nova, but I will say this : AA Shells does more than slightly increase her burst by 5% like you mentioned.\n\nNope I described what existed at the peak of Nova's \"100-0 in 1 second\" career.\n\nAs for the 5% figure, you can do the maths by yourself!

The main changes I bring to her are :\n\n- A mandatory aim time along with a visible red dot sight on her Snipe, so enemy players will know they're in danger while enhancing Nova's sniper fantasy.\n- A Tracer-like reload time after each Snipe and auto-attack, so she can't instantly chain both together. Also enhances her fantasy.\n- More talent changes to have a funner and more engaging Holo Decoy, plus revised Snipe talents to make them more interesting and/or viable.\n\n#Intro\nRegardless of Nova\u2019s power level, her rework has failed to not only deliver on her sniper/ghost fantasy, but also make her fun to play against (and, arguably, as) her. It caused her to lose the fun of landing high damage Snipes and Anti-Armor Bullets (as the talent is no longer viable due to the Snipe nerf), but she didn\u2019t get any reasonable compensation in exchange. Where before she was a fun burst assassin with a subpar sniper fantasy, she\u2019s now a mediocre sustain assassin that has to pick unviable talents to experience her fantasy.\n\nWith this document, I wish to suggest potential changes that could either be partly or completely implemented, in an attempt to make her more fun to play as and against her. I would of course be thrilled if this rework makes it entirely or partly into the game, but I will be happy if it at least manages to inspire her developers to find new ways to make her into a hero that is so hated that she can barely be mentioned without causing downvotes.\nBelow are my suggestions in \u201cpatch notes\u201d form, with comments in italic.\n\n\n\n#Nova\n##Abilities\n* Nova\u2019s sniper must now be reloaded (think Tracer\u2019s reload mechanic with maybe a 1-sec long reload time) after every basic attack and Snipe. This could be displayed as an empty/full bullet icon in the bottom-left corner HUD.\n\n * _One of the problems Nova always had in how little counterplay she has is how she could walk up to someone and, within a split second, fire a Snipe and auto attack. Especially if she has Anti-Tank armor shells, this made for a frustrating combination to be hit by. By adding this restriction, we strengthen the \u201csniper\u201d fantasy and prevent this from happening. Moreover, since her sniper rifle is single shot, there\u2019s no need to add a \u201cmanual reload\u201d button._\n\n####Calling the Shot (New Ability)\n\n* Mapped to \u201c1\u201d\n* No Mana cost\n* 30 seconds cooldown\n* When activated, this ability grants Nova the possibility of instantly refreshing her next Snipe\u2019s cooldown if it kills a Hero within 3 seconds of Calling the Shot\u2019s activation. \n* Targeted on an enemy Hero. Snipe must kill that Hero to refresh Snipe\u2019s cooldown.\n* Can be cast before or while Nova is aiming her Snipe (see below)\n\n####Snipe\n* Nova takes a knee and aims down her sight, stopping her movement. A red dot sight becomes visible, to all players, at her mouse position or the first valid target between her and the mouse. \n* Snipe now takes a whole second to cast, though Nova can adjust her aim while casting. \n* Moving cancels Snipe and removes the red dot sight. \n* Snipe base range increased by 10%\n* Snipe base damage increased by 30%\n* Snipe gains an additional 30% bonus damage if she manages to fire while unseen by the enemy team.\n* When Nova starts aiming Snipe, it gets a damage bonus proportional to the time she spends while aiming, to a maximum of an additional 20% if she spends another full second to aim.\n* Tactical Cloak\u2019s cooldown is suspended when taking aim.\n* Tactical Cloak is only removed upon firing.\n* Snipe\u2019s cooldown begins when canceled or fired (not when Nova starts taking aim)\n\n * _With these changes, enemy players have anywhere between one and two whole seconds of knowing approximately where Nova is. This means that players get at least one second to choose between playing it safe and retreating or hiding behind something, or attempt to juke the Snipe and punish Nova. The unseen damage bonus should be applied if Nova is stealthed and not revealed, in a bush and not revealed, or hiding behind a wall or otherwise in the fog of war. If the red dot sight is too easily missed by victims, add an audible \u201cgun reload/cock\u201d sound effect when Nova starts aiming._\n\n\n####Pinning Shot\n* Now a \u201cprep\u201d ability. Casting this ability no longer uncloaks Nova. Instead, her next basic attack gains the effect of the live version of Pinning Shot.\n\n * _This change should give Nova more freedom in using Pinning Shot. Whereas before she often only had one sensible option, being to cast Pinning shot immediately before casting Snipe, she may now decide between taking a risk and uncloak early to slow her target for an easier Snipe, or gamble the quality of her positioning and Snipe first, then slow to clean up her mark. It also reinforces the sniper fantasy in that she doesn't have a magic, pinning shot-exclusive bullet chamber in her gun._\n\n####Holo Decoy\n* Now deals 20% of Nova\u2019s damage, but can\u2019t use abilities.\n* Decoy Novas will target the closest valid (targetable, visible, non-invulnerable) enemy in their attack range, prioritizing heroes. \n* Targeting Holo Decoy now displays a range indicator around the decoy, and their target highlighted/outlined in red.\n\n * _These changes make it realistic for Nova players to be able to confuse enemies without having to pick Lethal Decoy at level 16, while keeping their untalented power level in check. The addition of a visible attack range while placing a Decoy puts more control in Nova\u2019s hands so she\u2019ll know exactly what her Holo Decoy will do once spawned, eliminating the risk of spending a cooldown to have it target something the player didn\u2019t intend._\n\n##Talents\n####Level 1\n* **New Talent : State-of-the-art Cloaking**\n* While cloaked, Nova\u2019s attack damage is doubled against enemy minions and mercenaries. \n* If these targets die from such a hit, Nova\u2019s Tactical Cloak cooldown is refreshed.\n* Doesn\u2019t affect Holo Decoys. \n\n * _This new talent makes Nova able to waveclear on her own a little, but also lets her participate in more PvE events like skull-hunting in the Haunted Mines or activating shrines in Infernal Shrines. Her Tactical Cloak cooldown being refreshed means she can consistently take advantage of this talent while remaining intermittently visible to the enemy team._ \n\n\n####Level 4\n\n* Remote Delivery : removed\n* **New Talent : Trump Card**\n* If Nova is revealed by an enemy while Holo Decoy is on cooldown, a Decoy is spawned within range of whoever revealed Nova and uses Pinning Shot on them. This effect has a 30 second cooldown.\n\n * _This talent can serve as an early safety measure for beginner Novas should they be revealed often, or for more experienced Novas who can tell they\u2019ll need some security when playing against skillshot-heavy heroes or heroes able to reveal her like Tassadar._\n\n####Level 7\n\n* Anti-Armor shells\n* Auto Attacks now also ignore 15 Physical armor, and Snipe gains 15 Spell Armor Penetration , on top of the current effect. \n* Basic attack speed unchanged but reload speed is 250% slower.\n\n * _The exact amount of armor penetration would probably need to be fine-tuned for this talent to be viable. The shield penetration could also be replaced with Spell armor penetration on Snipe. Either way, it\u2019s clear this talent needs more incentive to be picked more often._\n\n* **Reworked Talent : Snipe Master (Quest)**\n* Landing a Snipe on Heroes permanently grants Nova 7.5% additional Snipe damage, up to a total of 75%\n*  Failing to hit a hero, building or boss before the quest is complete resets the counter.\n\n * _This is but one way to rework the talent in a way that makes it both realistically achievable and that should give a valuable enough reward to take the risk in picking it. It would also make for an additional viable talent that also reinforces the Sniper fantasy._\n\n\n* **New Talent : Overdoing It**\n* Successfully refreshing Snipe\u2019s cooldown through Calling the Shot also refreshes Calling the Shot\u2019s cooldown.\n\n * _Picking Snipe Master is a gamble on how confident Nova is on her ability to consistently land Snipes but eventually lets her \u201cfire at will\u201d. Overdoing it, on the other hand, is a gamble on how well Nova picks the right targets, and when, but enables her to focus around finishing enemy heroes more easily. If upgrading Calling the Shot to this level while sacrificing other level 7 talents is not enough to make Nova viable, I recommend giving her this talent as baseline._\n\n####Level 13 (Current Talents : 3)\n* Psionic Efficiency : Removed\n* Double Tap : Moved to Level 16\n* **New Talent : Deafening Shot**\n* Pinning Shot now silences its target instead of slowing it.\n\n * _With Crippling shot exchanging places with Double Tap, Nova now has an important choice to make : Does she want to make her targets more vulnerable, or silence them at the cost of the slow? Will she want to pick Double Tap at the next tier, or is a single-use of whatever she picks be enough to free up her level 16 talent pick?_\n\n* Explosive Rounds : Removed\n* **New Talent : Panic Button**\n* If Nova is revealed by an enemy, she gets a free untalented Pinning Shot charge for 3 seconds, regardless of its cooldown status.\n\n * _This talent is for those Nova players that end up against players with reveal abilities or players able to spot and hit her while in cloak. It is situationally viable as a helping hand to stay alive, but would be the worse choice at this tier, in terms of damage output. It is also a bigger sacrifice to take if Nova was planning to further talent into her Holo Decoy at level 16._\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR : Nova is still hated post-rework due to the fact there is still no/little counter play to being sniped. The main changes I bring to her are :&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A mandatory aim time along with a visible red dot sight on her Snipe, so enemy players will know they&amp;#39;re in danger while enhancing Nova&amp;#39;s sniper fantasy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A Tracer-like reload time after each Snipe and auto-attack, so she can&amp;#39;t instantly chain both together. Also enhances her fantasy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More talent changes to have a funner and more engaging Holo Decoy, plus revised Snipe talents to make them more interesting and/or viable.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of Nova\u2019s power level, her rework has failed to not only deliver on her sniper/ghost fantasy, but also make her fun to play against (and, arguably, as) her. It caused her to lose the fun of landing high damage Snipes and Anti-Armor Bullets (as the talent is no longer viable due to the Snipe nerf), but she didn\u2019t get any reasonable compensation in exchange. Where before she was a fun burst assassin with a subpar sniper fantasy, she\u2019s now a mediocre sustain assassin that has to pick unviable talents to experience her fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this document, I wish to suggest potential changes that could either be partly or completely implemented, in an attempt to make her more fun to play as and against her. I would of course be thrilled if this rework makes it entirely or partly into the game, but I will be happy if it at least manages to inspire her developers to find new ways to make her into a hero that is so hated that she can barely be mentioned without causing downvotes.\nBelow are my suggestions in \u201cpatch notes\u201d form, with comments in italic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Nova&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Abilities&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nova\u2019s sniper must now be reloaded (think Tracer\u2019s reload mechanic with maybe a 1-sec long reload time) after every basic attack and Snipe. This could be displayed as an empty/full bullet icon in the bottom-left corner HUD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the problems Nova always had in how little counterplay she has is how she could walk up to someone and, within a split second, fire a Snipe and auto attack. Especially if she has Anti-Tank armor shells, this made for a frustrating combination to be hit by. By adding this restriction, we strengthen the \u201csniper\u201d fantasy and prevent this from happening. Moreover, since her sniper rifle is single shot, there\u2019s no need to add a \u201cmanual reload\u201d button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Calling the Shot (New Ability)&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mapped to \u201c1\u201d&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No Mana cost&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;30 seconds cooldown&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When activated, this ability grants Nova the possibility of instantly refreshing her next Snipe\u2019s cooldown if it kills a Hero within 3 seconds of Calling the Shot\u2019s activation. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Targeted on an enemy Hero. Snipe must kill that Hero to refresh Snipe\u2019s cooldown.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can be cast before or while Nova is aiming her Snipe (see below)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Snipe&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nova takes a knee and aims down her sight, stopping her movement. A red dot sight becomes visible, to all players, at her mouse position or the first valid target between her and the mouse. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Snipe now takes a whole second to cast, though Nova can adjust her aim while casting. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moving cancels Snipe and removes the red dot sight. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Snipe base range increased by 10%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Snipe base damage increased by 30%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Snipe gains an additional 30% bonus damage if she manages to fire while unseen by the enemy team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When Nova starts aiming Snipe, it gets a damage bonus proportional to the time she spends while aiming, to a maximum of an additional 20% if she spends another full second to aim.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tactical Cloak\u2019s cooldown is suspended when taking aim.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tactical Cloak is only removed upon firing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snipe\u2019s cooldown begins when canceled or fired (not when Nova starts taking aim)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;With these changes, enemy players have anywhere between one and two whole seconds of knowing approximately where Nova is. This means that players get at least one second to choose between playing it safe and retreating or hiding behind something, or attempt to juke the Snipe and punish Nova. The unseen damage bonus should be applied if Nova is stealthed and not revealed, in a bush and not revealed, or hiding behind a wall or otherwise in the fog of war. If the red dot sight is too easily missed by victims, add an audible \u201cgun reload/cock\u201d sound effect when Nova starts aiming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Pinning Shot&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a \u201cprep\u201d ability. Casting this ability no longer uncloaks Nova. Instead, her next basic attack gains the effect of the live version of Pinning Shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;This change should give Nova more freedom in using Pinning Shot. Whereas before she often only had one sensible option, being to cast Pinning shot immediately before casting Snipe, she may now decide between taking a risk and uncloak early to slow her target for an easier Snipe, or gamble the quality of her positioning and Snipe first, then slow to clean up her mark. It also reinforces the sniper fantasy in that she doesn&amp;#39;t have a magic, pinning shot-exclusive bullet chamber in her gun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Holo Decoy&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Now deals 20% of Nova\u2019s damage, but can\u2019t use abilities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Decoy Novas will target the closest valid (targetable, visible, non-invulnerable) enemy in their attack range, prioritizing heroes. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting Holo Decoy now displays a range indicator around the decoy, and their target highlighted/outlined in red.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;These changes make it realistic for Nova players to be able to confuse enemies without having to pick Lethal Decoy at level 16, while keeping their untalented power level in check. The addition of a visible attack range while placing a Decoy puts more control in Nova\u2019s hands so she\u2019ll know exactly what her Holo Decoy will do once spawned, eliminating the risk of spending a cooldown to have it target something the player didn\u2019t intend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Talents&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Level 1&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Talent : State-of-the-art Cloaking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;While cloaked, Nova\u2019s attack damage is doubled against enemy minions and mercenaries. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If these targets die from such a hit, Nova\u2019s Tactical Cloak cooldown is refreshed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn\u2019t affect Holo Decoys. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;This new talent makes Nova able to waveclear on her own a little, but also lets her participate in more PvE events like skull-hunting in the Haunted Mines or activating shrines in Infernal Shrines.

This would also bring anything hit out of stealth, and prevent them from stealthing for X amount of time (longer then the traditional recloak time). This would also 1 hit KO any clones/illusions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;R2: Tactical Nuke. Some what similar to her current AOE ult, but with functionality similar to braxis nukes/Starcraft nukes. However, this nuke would do equal damage to EVERYTHING in its radius. For balance purposes the amount of damage and/or the CD would take some tuning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trait: Similar to SC, Nova now deals bonus damage inversely proportional to the targets armor/physical armor. This trait means Nova will absolutely crush unarmored squishy targets, but will struggle to burst down tanks. Also this would allow for some neat counter play with Varian&amp;#39;s banner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I would have all of Nova&amp;#39;s basic abilities have short CDs, and instead make her Mana dependent. Really force her to choose between being able to spam snipes, or to stay cloaked.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "name": "t1_dg4llqn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491960764.0, "created_utc": 1491931964.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qdme", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4nysf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Schlessel", "parent_id": "t3_64qdme", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "2 word choice things, funner isn't a word, and you say red dot sight a lot but you just mean red dot, or laser dot, a red dot sight is a device you look through, but you're describing the little red laser dot from snipers in movies", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 word choice things, funner isn&amp;#39;t a word, and you say red dot sight a lot but you just mean red dot, or laser dot, a red dot sight is a device you look through, but you&amp;#39;re describing the little red laser dot from snipers in movies&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "name": "t1_dg4nysf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491963359.0, "created_utc": 1491934559.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qdme", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qdme", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qdme", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4wqjl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PatronOfTheStorm", "parent_id": "t1_dg4tf60", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Another interesting idea that could be done with a sniper, or in a nova reword, would be to make the snipe the targeted channeled ability(with little red dot) ability have a baseline giant killer effect and a \"true damage\" effect(which would basically mean that ignores physical/magical armor) if it hits that target.

I'm not saying it's not good but it changes some of Nova's mechanics in a very radical way. \n\nAlso I think you've tried to match more a generic Ghost unit and didn't try to incorporate her psionic lore side into it. Looking at the concept it still seems that your Nova would have kept a lot of current problems: massive lack of wave clear (somehow locked into her level 1 talent) which is further amplified by Explosion shot removal (best talent she has) and 2nd PS, and very weak early game. The latter I'm only guessing on the fact that you've probably kept her current talent tree with added new talents. I see that you've proposed damage buff for Snipe but since Sniping would be much more of a tactical nature I don't see it as a flat out damage increase.\n\nI know Nova isn't supposed to have State-of-the-Art-waveclear but this is one of her major drawbacks keeping her from serious matches. But I still believe if she was to ever become viable, she would either need a good balance in all departments or insane perfomance in a single one. To achieve that her skill floor would need to be greatly increased, which is what we both have in common.

I know that the way it was done it had no chance ever getting into a game, and yours might be more lucky in that sense, because it's not that far from what Nova currently is in regards of her spot in the game even thoguh you're radically changing some of her core mechanics.\n\nIf you'd like to check it out anyway: http://www.heroesfire.com/hots/concept/nova-4221", "edited": 1491951585.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see where you&amp;#39;re going with the design and that you&amp;#39;ve put a lot of thought into it, however, I don&amp;#39;t personally really like the direction. I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s not good but it changes some of Nova&amp;#39;s mechanics in a very radical way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I think you&amp;#39;ve tried to match more a generic Ghost unit and didn&amp;#39;t try to incorporate her psionic lore side into it. Looking at the concept it still seems that your Nova would have kept a lot of current problems: massive lack of wave clear (somehow locked into her level 1 talent) which is further amplified by Explosion shot removal (best talent she has) and 2nd PS, and very weak early game. The latter I&amp;#39;m only guessing on the fact that you&amp;#39;ve probably kept her current talent tree with added new talents. I see that you&amp;#39;ve proposed damage buff for Snipe but since Sniping would be much more of a tactical nature I don&amp;#39;t see it as a flat out damage increase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know Nova isn&amp;#39;t supposed to have State-of-the-Art-waveclear but this is one of her major drawbacks keeping her from serious matches. But I still believe if she was to ever become viable, she would either need a good balance in all departments or insane perfomance in a single one. To achieve that her skill floor would need to be greatly increased, which is what we both have in common.

Here is my rework I made for her:\n\n* **(Trait) Covert Ops:** Nova can only have 1 round in her gun at a time, rounds are reloaded once every .75 seconds. Basic attacks and some abilities must consume a round to fire. Nova also scans for heroes within 6 range, marking them with a warning symbol through fog of war or in bushes.\n\n* **(Q) Snipe:** Fire a rapid shot dealing damage to one enemy. Costs 1 round.\n\n* **(W) Target Locked:** Mark the target enemy for 4 seconds granting vision of them and causing your next round against them to slow by 40% for 2.25 seconds and deal bonus damage. Costs 1 round and does not break cloak.\n\n* **(E) Holo Decoy:** Create a decoy at the target location, while also entering stealth after 1 second. Passively, Nova will enter stealth if not in combat for 3 seconds.\n\n* **(R1) Precision Strike:** After a short delay deal damage in an AoE with global range.\n\n* **(R2) Lockdown:** After a short delay fire an ultrafast global bolt dealing damage and rooting the first enemy hit, damage increasing the further the bolt travels.\n\n[I made a talent tree and write-up right here if you wish to check it out.](http://www.heroesfire.com/hots/concept/nova-terra-6744)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like that you&amp;#39;re trying to change Nova, but I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re doing it in the right way.

Azmodan&amp;#39;s tell works because he&amp;#39;s supposed to aim somewhere the enemy team can see (duh) and his tell is an AoE at his targeted location. If team A looks at, say, the center temple in Sky Temple while it&amp;#39;s in fog of war and Team B dunks that temple, will team A see the tell (even if it&amp;#39;s in the fog of war)?

Azmo&amp;#39;s tell is not a raycast. So raycasts need to be able to generate that tell even when at least one end is in the fog, for this to work.
