And over a long battle, AA will always generates more dmg than from abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say Valla with standard W build has 493dps AA (full hatred stacks) in 5s deals 2466 physical dmg while her Q is 700 dmg (bounces twice to Joh) and W is 767 (full hatred + 1 grenade) and RoV deals 550 dmg - total 2017 ability dmg. And abilities have cd so over a longer battle (10s for example) physical dmg is gonna get higher - the majority of dmg tanks have to take. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are always exceptions ofc, let&amp;#39;s take full ability dmg Fals: with Q build, at lv20 his Q is about 1k dmg, his W about 900dmg (for full 4s duration) which totals 1900 ability dmg while his AA dps is 326 so for 5s he can deal 1630 physical dmg - they are quite close to each other even if your focus is on ability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about bruisers and tanks? Sonya standard build: at lv20 with Wrath on, her Q deals 532, W 539 - let&amp;#39;s say over 5s she can do 1 Q and 3 W, that&amp;#39;s 2149 ability dmg while 5 aa will deal 1687 physical dmg. Alarak standard build: 1272 ability dmg from 3 abilties and 1530 physical dmg from 5 AA. Valeera full combo rotation: 1576 ability dmg vs 1730 physical dmg over 5s. Muradin: Q 241dmg + W with thunderstrike 630 dmg = 871 ability dmg vs 1175 physical dmg in 5s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although everything is just theorycrafting, in practice you don&amp;#39;t wanna spend your cds on their tank unless Joh positions terribly and gets caught in a chain CC and burst. In normal situations you want to get dmg on tanks mostly from free AA and short cd abilities (chromie, Probe, Liming come to mind) to wear them down and save your spells for more vulnerable backline targets. People tend to underestimate Auto attack dmg but the majority of all dmg is physical while the majority of Burst is usually Ability dmg.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "name": "t1_dg5pvuu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492023273.0, "created_utc": 1491994473.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vi8t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5pzp1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dironiil", "parent_id": "t1_dg5o4oz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Butcher, artanis, cassia, Zul'jin, Varian (AA stance), Samuro, Tracer, (Xul), Greymane, (Kharazim), Zagara, Tychus, Illidan.\n\nAll of these are at least 50% AA, and a good part are really over that threshold.
