It's good to know what exactly you are objecting to.

I'm not saying that it does not exist, but I believe that for a lot of people it's a kind of confirmation bias when they hear it, where even if I only do it once in 50 broadcasts it stands out for the person listening to it as a confirmation of what they \"expect\" to happen. I for myself think that I started to only use it very rarely outside of a very clear NA vs. EU game where me and Dread are joking around. \n\nBut at the same time I think a lot of people share your opinion on that topic. That's why I would appreciate if you could maybe in a month or two let me know if you still hold that opinion. Mostly because I've been trying quite a bit to tone it down in official broadcasts of Blizzard Events for some time now. And I'd like to know if my personal view on this is wrong or not.\n\nTo give you one example: during the Western Clash I've been making an effort to let people know how especially the performance of Team8 was quite impressive to me and how much I liked to watch their aggressive and entertaining playstyle. Of course we had a lot of banter going into the event but I was under the impression that I was able to keep it to a minimum during the actual broadcasts. But again: that might be a wrong perception on my end.\n\nI do believe that especially during regional clashes it's ok to show a bit more bias towards your own region, since it makes banter more fun and adds to the cast. At the same time though I absolutely agree that it should happen in moderation. Coming back to the original point: if you could let me know in a few weeks if your opinion has changed on this I'd really appreciate it. Thanks again for the feedback!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the feedback! It&amp;#39;s good to know what exactly you are objecting to. Too often the only feedback one gets as a caster is &amp;quot;you suck&amp;quot; :P&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d appreciate though if you&amp;#39;d do a little experiment for me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you consciously listen to my commentary in the future and try to pay attention to the &amp;quot;making fun of NA&amp;quot; parts that you just mentioned? I&amp;#39;m not saying that it does not exist, but I believe that for a lot of people it&amp;#39;s a kind of confirmation bias when they hear it, where even if I only do it once in 50 broadcasts it stands out for the person listening to it as a confirmation of what they &amp;quot;expect&amp;quot; to happen. I for myself think that I started to only use it very rarely outside of a very clear NA vs. EU game where me and Dread are joking around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the same time I think a lot of people share your opinion on that topic. That&amp;#39;s why I would appreciate if you could maybe in a month or two let me know if you still hold that opinion. Mostly because I&amp;#39;ve been trying quite a bit to tone it down in official broadcasts of Blizzard Events for some time now. And I&amp;#39;d like to know if my personal view on this is wrong or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To give you one example: during the Western Clash I&amp;#39;ve been making an effort to let people know how especially the performance of Team8 was quite impressive to me and how much I liked to watch their aggressive and entertaining playstyle. Of course we had a lot of banter going into the event but I was under the impression that I was able to keep it to a minimum during the actual broadcasts. But again: that might be a wrong perception on my end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do believe that especially during regional clashes it&amp;#39;s ok to show a bit more bias towards your own region, since it makes banter more fun and adds to the cast. At the same time though I absolutely agree that it should happen in moderation. Coming back to the original point: if you could let me know in a few weeks if your opinion has changed on this I&amp;#39;d really appreciate it.

I think most people who are willing to improve their game knowledge are currently doing it by watching esport and high level streamers on twitch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I could link is the video &amp;quot;how to play every Heroes map&amp;quot; by Dreadnought: &lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdzdksu20XM\"&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdzdksu20XM&lt;/a&gt;. It is a bit oudated (we had some new maps since it was recorded and some maps were changed a bit), but can still be very usefull because it gives you an idea on how to think about the maps dynamic in general. Dreadnought is an ex pro player from NA who is currently casting HGC NA and he is also known for his analitycal casting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I just remembered that Grubby done a few viewer replay analysis lately on his stream, you can find vods of it on his youtube channel, here is the last one: &lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=runKUJCDAas\"&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=runKUJCDAas&lt;/a&gt;. Might be worth checking out: he knows game quite well and is very open to answering the questions of any sort from his viewers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "name": "t1_dgbxyql", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492371206.0, "created_utc": 1492342406.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbfkgi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MeatThatTalks", "parent_id": "t3_65lmr5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Besides watching some EU HGC games and listening to Khaldor's casting, where else can one learn about these more sophisticated tactics?
