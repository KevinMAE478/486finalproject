Rework heroes' designs to have more impact (too much work) 2. Add talents that will make it mechanically harder but more rewarding (a lot easier to do)\n\n- A \"good\" example would be Tracer's lvl 16 \"locked and loaded\" as what talents should be like, rewarding mechanical skill consistently, rather than risky all-in quest talents that are useless if you die or boring \"collection\" talents like picking up globes or killing minions or attacking buildings rather unskillfully. Alarak is another example of solid design for carrying.\n\nHis chat brainstormed and some similar talent ideas: \n\n- Rexxar Q hitting opponent will make misha's next attack do extra 5% hp dmg to that target.\n\n- Varian Q connecting on 2 opponents will let him stun with charge.\n\nI can't find the exact time stamp and it's sorta spread out throughout the stream, but if you can find any more examples (or just think of some on your own), feel free to post!\n\n[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/134413650](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/134413650)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "64ozii", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 694, "report_reasons": null, "author": "weekendwarrior11", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64ozii", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.heroesofthestorm", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/QCebKcyGNf1TD6J40npk3WDecdlFoaY0xgM0U7Z2tCs.jpg?s=47b5dff395b312f1785d926fee0e52f8", "width": 640, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/QCebKcyGNf1TD6J40npk3WDecdlFoaY0xgM0U7Z2tCs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=59511f9a7ad1deff2471fc8946ab5029", "width": 108, "height": 60}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/QCebKcyGNf1TD6J40npk3WDecdlFoaY0xgM0U7Z2tCs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=b2d3371734ae117e9da9cec108dffa43", "width": 216, "height": 121}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/QCebKcyGNf1TD6J40npk3WDecdlFoaY0xgM0U7Z2tCs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=2fd9ead6086ee7d1c2d5bbce5e995bc5", "width": 320, "height": 180}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/QCebKcyGNf1TD6J40npk3WDecdlFoaY0xgM0U7Z2tCs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=0625e5de7db1326d73ee4f0a486b870b", "width": 640, "height": 360}], "variants": {}, "id": "byIU1WQBlx5tIOpa0uobzxdIiq4OCqTWMGb8D3S5Wbo"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "edited": 1491897839.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/64ozii/rich_talent_system_needs_more_mechanically/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491917496.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/64ozii/rich_talent_system_needs_more_mechanically/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Rich: \"Talent system needs more mechanically rewarding talents to boost individual skill ceiling\" (especially for heroes who aren't as impactful)", "created_utc": 1491888696.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 359, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 694}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ozii", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ozii", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ozii", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ozii", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ozii", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ozii", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ozii", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ozii", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4jx7d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lord_Boo", "parent_id": "t1_dg4enke", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "5.5%, so yeah, it makes a good amount of sense to budget into Pulse Bomb rather than her AAs.

For example, Illidan's evasion timing is based on what your enemy is doing, difficult skillshots are based on where your enemies are and how they're moving, and even straightforward things like targeted heals are still sensitive to damage that originates from the enemy team. These are great because they involve dynamic decision-making and meaningful reactions.\n\nStuff like Locked and Loaded is different, because Locked and Loaded doesn't involve the same kind of meaningful response to external stimulus. It's much more like a single-player minigame, which sort of detracts from the overall spirit of the game. In that moment, you're playing against yourself more than you're playing against/with other people.\n\nHere's an example that takes it to a logical extreme; imagine a hypothetical hero who, as a part of one of their talents, can bring up a game of Simon Says in the UI that gives you a damage bonus based on how well you're doing. Other players cannot interact with your Simon Says game. Taking this talent *would* require more mechanical skill and it *would* reward it with extra damage, but the design is dampened by the fact that the mechanical skill/\"minigame\" in question doesn't actually have a meaningful interaction with what people are doing around you. The enemy team can't play \"against\" what you're doing, and it operates in a vacuum. Even if it did end in a situation where a more skilled player is proportionately more successful, it doesn't necessarily represent a healthy or fun design for the game.

As a general rule, I'm a much bigger fan of stuff like \"skillshot gets X% smaller but does Y% more damage\" because it's immediately far more sensitive to the context of what's going on around a hero.

You don&amp;#39;t have to last hit minions (similar to saying you don&amp;#39;t have to take that challenging mechanical talent), sure you will still win some games but the ones you don&amp;#39;t win because you&amp;#39;re behind in gold will leave you frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally I am all for more mechanically challenging games, but this WILL drive away some casual players that won&amp;#39;t be able to keep up. That being said, based on LoL&amp;#39;s success and much more challenging gameplay, I think the average player would welcome more challenging talents with open arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s almost like Blizzard is trying to make a casual game out of a non-casual genre with Hots.
