Grafted into a cyborg body by Overwatch, Genji walks his own path as one who fights for what\u2019s right. \n\n**Trait**  \n\n+   **Cyber Agility (D)**  \n\n    +  Activate to jump to the target area. \n\n**Basic Abilities**  \n\n+   **Shuriken (Q)**  \n\n    +  Throw 3 Shuriken in a spread pattern, each damaging the first enemy it hits. \n\n    +  Stores up to 3 charges. Shuriken\u2019s cooldown replenishes all charges at the same time. \n\n+   **Deflect (W)**  \n\n    +  Become Protected for 1.25 seconds. Any damage blocked during this period causes Genji to throw a Kunai toward the nearest enemy, prioritizing Heroes and dealing damage. \n\n+   **Swift Strike (E)**  \n\n    +  Dash forward, dealing damage to all enemies in a line. Enemy Heroes who die within 2 seconds after being hit by Swift Strike cause the cooldown and Mana cost to be refunded. \n\n**Heroic Abilities**  \n\n+   **Dragonblade (R)**  \n\n    +  Unleash the Dragonblade for 8 seconds. While active, Dragonblade can be reactivated to lunge forward and slash in a huge arc. If any enemy Heroes are killed within 2 seconds after being hit by Dragonblade, Swift Strike\u2019s cooldown is reset. \n\n+   **X-Strike (R)**  \n\n    +  Perform 2 perpendicular slashes that deal damage and ignite after 1.25 seconds, dealing additional damage to enemies in their area of effect. \n\nReturn to Top \n\n \n\n### New Battleground: Hanamura\n\n**Objectives**  \n\n+   **Protected Cores**  \n\n    +  Both Cores are protected by a barrier that cannot be attacked by Heroes. \n\n    +  Payloads must be escorted across the Battleground in order to deal damage to the enemy Core. \n\n+   **Escort Payloads**  \n\n    +  The first set of Payloads spawn for each team after 2:30 into the match, and additional waves will periodically spawn throughout the rest of the game. \n\n    +  Stand near an allied payload to escort it. The more allies who are present to escort a payload, the faster it will move. This effect caps at 3 nearby allies. \n\n    +  Payloads that haven\u2019t been escorted for a period of time will begin to slowly move backward. \n\n+   **Empowered Payloads**  \n\n    +  Destroying enemy Forts will cause the next allied Payload to deal additional damage when it arrives at its destination. \n\n    +  Destroying enemy Keeps will cause Sappers to spawn with allied Minion waves, which will fire on the Core upon reaching the end of their lanes. \n\n    +  Deal a total of 7 damage the opposing Core to claim victory! \n\n**Mercenary Camps**  \n\n+  Three types of Mercenary Camps exist on Hanamura, and captured Mercenaries will not travel down a lane to attack enemies. \n\n    +  Instead, captured Mercenary Camps will each award one of three consumable power-ups. \n\n    +  Right-click a power-up to collect it, and then use the \u201cMap Mechanic Ability\u201d hotkey (Default: F) to activate it. \n\n+   **Recon Camp**  \n\n    +  Reward: Dragon Spirits \n\n        +  Release 3 Dragon Spirits that seek out enemy Heroes, who are then revealed for 5 seconds. Dragon Spirits are destroyed after finding enemy Heroes or after 10 seconds. \n\n+   **Fortification Camp**  \n\n    +  Reward: Turret \n\n        +  Place a Turret on the ground or on your team\u2019s payload. \n\n+   **Support Camp**  \n\n    +  Reward: Healing Pulse \n\n        +  Restore 35% Health and 23% Mana to you and your allies over 15 seconds. \n\n+   \u200b\u200b\u200b**Mega Enforcer**  \n\n    +  Defeat the Mega Enforcer found at the center of Hanamura to fire 1 shot on the opposing Core. \n\nReturn to Top \n\n \n\n### Art\n\n**General**  \n\n+  Visual effects that indicate Movement Speed bonuses have received updates. \n\n+  Sprays have received additional polish that should help them feel more integrated with battleground environments. \n\n**Heroes, Abilities, and Talents**  \n\n+  **Tassadar:** Nullification (Talent) has received updated visual effects. \n\nReturn to Top \n\n \n\n### Collection\n\n**Open Beta Note**  \n\n+  *As a reminder, real-money purchases have been disabled in the Open Beta, and any items unlocked via Gold, Shards, Gems, or Loot Chests will **not** transfer to the live version of the game when Heroes of the Storm 2.0 is released.* \n\n**New Items**  \n\n+  The items listed below have been added to the Collection, and will be available for Gem purchase for a limited time. \n\n+   **New Skins**  \n\n    +  **Genji** \n\n        +  Oni Genji, Vengeful Oni Genji, Moss Oni Genji \n\n    +  **Auriel** \n\n        +  Sakura Auriel, Spring Sakura Auriel, Scarlet Sakura Auriel \n\n    +  **Zarya** \n\n        +  Cyberdemon Zarya, Indigo Cyberdemon Zarya, Cyborgdemon Zarya \n\n+   **New Bundles and Skin Packs**  \n\n    +  Genji Heroic Bundle \n\n    +  Sakura Auriel Skin Pack \n\n    +  Cyberdemon Zarya Skin Pack \n\n+  Much like new Heroes receive a Gold price reduction once they\u2019ve been in the Nexus for a few weeks, new skins and mounts that are unlockable using Gems start at a higher than normal Shard price. These items will receive a Shard price reduction a few weeks after they are added to the game. \n\n    +  New items that are only unlockable via Loot Chests and Forging (such as a new version of an existing Skin) will not start at a higher Shard price, or receive a Shard price reduction. \n\nReturn to Top \n\n \n\n### User Interface\n\n**General**  \n\n+   **Attack Move Target Point**  \n\n    +  Attack Move Target Point has been added to the Gameplay Options menu. \n\n        +  If enabled, attack move (default: A + Left-Click) concentrates on the closest enemy to the target point. \n\n        +  If disabled, attack move concentrates on the closest enemy to your Hero. \n\n**Collection**  \n\n+  Item borders have received updated art to make it easier to differentiate between owned and unowned items in your Collection. \n\n+   **Heroes**  \n\n    +  An \u201cAll Heroes\u201d tab has been added to the Heroes page in your Collection. \n\n+   **Portraits**  \n\n    +  Selecting the Basic Portrait Border in your Collection will now display your current Player Level on loading screens, in the party panel, and the player\u2019s profile. \n\n    +  All Player Level Progression Badge and Portrait Borders have received updated art. \n\n**Heroes Brawl**  \n\n+  Completing matches in Heroes Brawl will now award Hero XP. \n\n    +  In cases where multiple Heroes are used during the same Heroes Brawl, the total XP earned will be divided evenly among them. \n\n+  Completing the weekly Heroes Brawl quest will now award a Loot Chest, rather than a Portrait and Gold. \n\n**In-Game U.I.**  \n\n+  The in-game Chat box has been slightly lowered to provide more visibility in the center of the screen. \n\n**Mastery Taunts**  \n\n+  Issuing an in-game Taunt using a Hero who has reached level 15 or higher will now display unique \u201cmastery\u201d visual effects. \n\n    +  The Hero will also play its taunt animation and voiceover. \n\n    +  Issue an in-game Taunt using the radial emote menu (default: X), by pressing the Taunt hotkey (default: J), or by typing \u201c/Taunt\u201d into chat. \n\n+  Additional Hero Mastery Taunts will be added to the game in future patches, unlocking at levels 25, 50, 75, and 100. \n\n+  Read [our recent blog on Mastery Taunts](http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20638785) for more information. \n\n**Loot Chests**  \n\n+  Upon re-rolling a Loot Chest that contains a Rare, Epic, or Legendary item, a warning dialog will now appear that asks the player to confirm whether or not they\u2019d like to re-roll the chest. \n\n    +  Previously, this warning would only appear when re-rolling chests that contained Legendary Items. This will not occur for chests that only contain common items. \n\n**Score Screen**  \n\n+  Lightning bolt visual effects will now display when leveling-up on the post-game Summary screen. \n\nReturn to Top \n\n \n\n### Heroes\n\nAssassin\nSpecialist\nSupport\nWarrior", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a bot.
