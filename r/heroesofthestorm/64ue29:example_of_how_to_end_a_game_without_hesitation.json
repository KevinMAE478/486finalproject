If you just force down a lane with a boss, and get even 2 kills late game it can be an easy end.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "name": "t1_dg540m4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491982090.0, "created_utc": 1491953290.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ue29", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ue29", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ue29", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ue29", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ue29", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5q5fx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HunterDecious", "parent_id": "t1_dg5o3ig", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think he meant to say it wasn't their \"loss\" because they were actually trying to lose on purpose (so it's actually a win for them).
