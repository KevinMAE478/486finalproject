When you capture a camp, the mercenary doesn&amp;#39;t fight for you, but instead drops an item. As far as I remember,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One item summons two dragons that reveal (and maybe slows?) the two closest enemy heroes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One item is an AoE heal (over time?) effect&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One item is a turret that you can set on your own payload. You can&amp;#39;t set it on an enemy payload (I tried and died for it in one of the games I played)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the boss. When captured, the boss deals one core damage. I didn&amp;#39;t really understand its skills/mechanics since it dealt a lot of damage and I had trouble getting around it. I just know that he can eat one person, and it also makes some giant purple circle around him (no clue what the circle does).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "name": "t1_dgdn02r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492472401.0, "created_utc": 1492443601.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdmqah", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Funda_HS", "parent_id": "t1_dgdmnq3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for the reply!
