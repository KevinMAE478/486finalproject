I understand that it must do wonders for them to make boatloads of money, but I absolutely despise the business practice of putting the &amp;quot;unlocks&amp;quot; behind a slot machine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They say it&amp;#39;s not gambling because it doesn&amp;#39;t pay out money. Or they say &amp;quot;well then you can just use shards (or dust/gold in Hearthstone/Overwatch) to get the ones you really want!&amp;quot; But all the while they&amp;#39;re leveraging the addictiveness of the slot machine aspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally speaking, getting duplicates and being awarded a paltry amount of credit that amounts to the fraction of the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; of an otherwise unobtained item is one of the most frustrating things in games today. Perhaps I&amp;#39;m in the minority here but whether I spent real money or earned in-game currency to open my pack/box/crate/whatever and see all things I&amp;#39;ve already collected on the screen staring at me with the value of 8% of an uncollected counterpart, I feel absolutely terrible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real funny bit of it is, I probably fall into the &amp;#39;whale&amp;#39; category that the F2P market usually banks on. I&amp;#39;ve put &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of money in to HotS. Sure it&amp;#39;s all pixels, but I knew exactly what I was getting for my money. I&amp;#39;ve put a shit ton less into Overwatch (which I actually am currently playing more than HotS,) &lt;strong&gt;purely&lt;/strong&gt; because the &amp;#39;reward&amp;#39; structure is downright fucking frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "name": "t1_dg5u8oh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492031755.0, "created_utc": 1492002955.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 61}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xcgp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xcgp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xcgp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg675qi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DonPhelippe", "parent_id": "t1_dg62zyp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Did someone say my name?\n\nAnd all of that just because I want to have certain content that I will not want to miss.
