Played all the tutorials as i was a newcomer to the genre (I did play a bit of Infinite Crisis, Guardians of Middle Earth and LoL but didn't particularly enjoy any of 'em) as good ol' Jimmy and as soon as i had my first 2k gold i purchased him as my first character as i figured that i knew his kit already and so it would've been easy to use him. \n\nTruth be told i really wanted to get Sylvanas first since i really liked her character in Warcraft and her kit seemed really sweet but didn't have enough gold to get her. Sure enough though i played some matches, got some of the initial rewards and finally purchased her too. I think it was then and there i fell in love with the game.\n\nSylv's playstyle was is really akin to my tastes: being able to splitpush, teamfight and have great mobility was a blast. I started playing a lot (and i really mean it) to unlock more characters and then play some more.\n\nI was lucky enough to get some character i really liked basically going in blind (those Kharazim and Leoric) and that just fueled my passion for the game.\n\nAlso invited each and every one of my friends to play the game and many of 'em sticked to it (even though a few returned to LoL and didn't really give the game a chance playing just a couple of matches).

Having played mostly PvP during my MMO-time as well, SC2 instantly spoke to me and I got involved in e-sports and so on, loved it.\n\nWhen I visited GamesCom 2014 and Heroes was shown and playable at the booths i instantly fell in love with it. I managed to snatch up an Alpha Key so ever since September 2014 I have been playing Heroes as my first and only Moba. \n\nI did try LoL and Dota1+2 in the past but never for more than 5-10 games, never liked them. The new \"Blizzard formula\" of mobas however, truly intrigued me. So i got involved in a huge German community and helped build it (was part of a Multigaming clan but at one point our Heroes-section alone was the same size as all the other, much older, sections of the clan combined, at ~200 players). I loved theorycrafting and supporting the game and the community, I created written guides (in German) and on Youtube, I organized tournaments (internal to the clan) and an entire league (once more, internal to the clan, we had more than 10 teams just within the clan at one point) \n\nHowever, i spent time on the game so much to the point, that i did nothing but work, sleep and Heroes. And when it come down to it, i was more busy with organizing League/Tournament/Other Clan Stuff, than actually playing the game. Burnt me out alright. I took a hiatus and leave from the clan in April 2016 and have not played til December or so. Took that time to cut back generally on PC gaming but when i played, i went for Singleplayer games or online games that i could \"just enjoy\" without being the #1 person to talk to for hundreds of people. \n\nWhen I came back late December, i was so hot for the game again and so reinvigorated, it was, and still is, exciting. I rejoined my clan but only as a \"silent observer\" playing some games with them here and there. However one thing I did, which I had never done before, is I joined a proper 5 man team and we're doing everything together: Scrims, TL, Brawls, Tournaments, Replay Analysis. \n\nIt is so much fun, to not be the one having to organize it all but having 4 equally excited people around me who come to me, not with questions but with their own ideas for Comps, for Theorycrafting and so on. \n\nIt is a fun like no other and i can only encourage everyone to do the same, look for likeminded people, get to know them, and have fun ;) \n\nCompeting in Heroeslounge and every other tournament we get our hands on, it's just a blast. Climbed about 450 in mmr, just because i no longer \"just play\" with everyone that invites me, but just sticking with a good group of friends (by now).

Although I haven&amp;#39;t played Dota in years since I got into the HotS Alpha, I still praise it for teaching me a lot of mechanics that really translated over to HotS. \nI love Blizzard&amp;#39;s games and I play them religiously for periods of times switching between them, but HotS has been a constant. I finally got my friends into and they&amp;#39;re loving it. 2.0 is icing on the cake for this great game. \nMy reason for choosing HotS over the others?
