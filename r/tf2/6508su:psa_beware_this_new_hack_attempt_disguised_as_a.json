This recommendation falls apart as soon as you realize that web browsers can be configured to pass the handling of urls to external registered applications based on the protocol used in the link. That means that not only are there legitimate actions that can be performed (launching a steam game, for instance) but also malicious actions that can be performed if any of those external applications have unpatched vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the form of a handled url for their registered protocol. It also falls apart when you realize that the browser first has to render the response, which leaves the user open to more run of the mill browser exploits, malicious scripts, or even something simple things like social engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to safely click the link, chances are you are doing that for research purposes, in which case you don&amp;#39;t need to get instructions on doing that safely from reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tf2", "name": "t1_dg6h7kh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492056751.0, "created_utc": 1492027951.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 45}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6gu0x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -26, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nullifiedcat", "parent_id": "t1_dg6ezjp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tf2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You can click any links you want (in most cases, see flash vulns), you just have to NOT RUN THE EXECUTABLE YOU DOWNLOAD FROM RANDOM LINKS.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can click any links you want (in most cases, see flash vulns), you just have to NOT RUN THE EXECUTABLE YOU DOWNLOAD FROM RANDOM LINKS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tf2", "name": "t1_dg6gu0x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492056368.0, "created_utc": 1492027568.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -26}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ezjp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 44, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hi5TBone", "parent_id": "t3_6508su", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tf2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "you shouldn't click any links you get from someone who just added you anyway", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;you shouldn&amp;#39;t click any links you get from someone who just added you anyway&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tf2", "name": "t1_dg6ezjp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492054477.0, "created_utc": 1492025677.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6508su", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6508su", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6508su", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7gxtx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "npc_barney", "parent_id": "t1_dg6z9bg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tf2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Which is great.
