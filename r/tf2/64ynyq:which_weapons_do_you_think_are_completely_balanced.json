You can leech off the health packs and even Crusader Crossbow bolts to get back on your feet quickly but you lose the ability to heal from healing beams quickly. The only reason you barely see Pyros use it in comp is because Pyro&amp;#39;s mobility sucks and the Powerjack is nothing more than a band-aid for Pyro&amp;#39;s mobility. If Pyro had the ability to get to the fight and behind enemy lines quickly, we would see Pyros use this more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Direct hit, while seen as overpowered, is a balanced sidegrade. Aiming is a must because the splash damage is minimal. If it had Stock&amp;#39;s AoE, it would be practically a straight upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Iron Bomber is a beauty. You lose the roll of the Stock pills in exchange for quicker detonation which allows for airburst attacks and even fast grenade jumping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Gunboats minimize self-damage which is perfect for rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) All of the non-stock Mediguns are viable. From the knockback immunity and fast-paced healing of the Quick-fix to the Kritzkrieg&amp;#39;s crit uber which is perfect for defense and getting the enemy off your turf and even the Vaccinator&amp;#39;s ability to cancel out crits and reduce damage from specific types of attacks but with the downside of small ubers. Every one has a specific role depending on the battle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are plenty more but these are the ones off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tf2", "name": "t1_dg6acqw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492049708.0, "created_utc": 1492020908.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ynyq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6hybd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bloo_overbeck", "parent_id": "t3_64ynyq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tf2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Shotgun.
