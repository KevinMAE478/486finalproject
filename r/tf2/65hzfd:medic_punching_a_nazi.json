Glad people like my drawing! As far as people disagreeing about Medic being anti-Nazi, you can think what you want, but this is what I wanted for the character. (I BELIEVE that people from Valve have confirmed that he wasn&amp;#39;t a Nazi, but I can&amp;#39;t specifically cite anything.) I do know that plenty of doctors and scientists were driven from Nazi Germany due to not fitting the Aryan ideal, which seems plenty likely to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saying he&amp;#39;s a German scientist so he must&amp;#39;ve been a Nazi sympathizer is like saying I must be a Republican because I&amp;#39;m a white person from the South. It&amp;#39;s a lazy argument. I&amp;#39;m not going to fight with anyone about this. Like I said, believe whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone has questions or comments about my art, I&amp;#39;m happy to chat!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tf2", "name": "t1_dgb7pa2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492321061.0, "created_utc": 1492292261.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hzfd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hzfd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaqga7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 43, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Octagonalkahn", "parent_id": "t1_dgapmmb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tf2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Medic is a mercenary.

In my previous comment, I linked to a Huffington post article celebrating political violence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems like Leftist publications are supporting political violence. Here are some articles/videos coming from reputable left-wing publications like the Huffington Post, Vice, Salon and even The Guardian, all celebrating the thug who punched Richard Spencer a while back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJDIbkOrfw\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJDIbkOrfw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/is-it-ok-to-punch-nazis\"&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/is-it-ok-to-punch-nazis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/simon-shear/punching-nazis-is-good/\"&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/simon-shear/punching-nazis-is-good/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2017/01/23/the-new-national-debate-is-it-ever-ok-to-punch-a-nazi/\"&gt;http://www.salon.com/2017/01/23/the-new-national-debate-is-it-ever-ok-to-punch-a-nazi/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;furthermore your first four sources are from the most biased or shady media outlets there are. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from Breitbart, I used CNN, The Guardian and The Hill.
