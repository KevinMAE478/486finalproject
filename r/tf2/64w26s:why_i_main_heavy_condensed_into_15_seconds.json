In my opinion this is his real strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have ever played Heavy with a friend or a good random healing you (like in the video of this post), you will know that it is infinitely better than trying to fight alone. A heavy should play with his team, contesting the objective, which often enough can also get you resupplied well, either through the playload or through engineers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you can&amp;#39;t do this, it is most of the time better to switch to another class. The sad truth is that Heavy needs a medic/engi or atleast other combat classes that work with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer though: The flanking heavy, where you wrap around the enemy and spin up around corners, can work, but it heavily depends on the map and the composition of the enemy team. if there are only one or two good players in it, they can already shut down such a tactic very easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tf2", "name": "t1_dg5pf4a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492021968.0, "created_utc": 1491993168.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w26s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w26s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ti2w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Deathaster", "parent_id": "t1_dg5secl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tf2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'll try that, thanks :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try that, thanks :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tf2", "name": "t1_dg5ti2w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492030617.0, "created_utc": 1492001817.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5secl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Happysedits", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ngyd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tf2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "play on hightower as a heavy and suprise enemies from the back", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;play on hightower as a heavy and suprise enemies from the back&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tf2", "name": "t1_dg5secl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492028775.0, "created_utc": 1491999975.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w26s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w26s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w26s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w26s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w26s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qka0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w26s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6pz1c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SuperLuigi9624", "parent_id": "t1_dg6pvoe", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tf2", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;hitscan in this game is also just very fast projectiles so u still have to kind of predict.\n\nNo, they hit instantly.
