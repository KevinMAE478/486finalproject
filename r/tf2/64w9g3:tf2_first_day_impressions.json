Remember, your uber is quite important, and if your patient's going in really deep to the point where it's suicidal, don't follow, hang back with your teammates.\n\nSpy/Sniper: Both are two of the most skill-based classes in the game when it comes to playing them. Sniper's all about twitch reflexes, and Spy can act as both a way to scout out the enemy team and get in a good kill or two before dying.\n\n I'd hold off on playing them until you're more familiar with the game, because god knows casual has enough snipers and spies to go around.\n\nSoldier: I'd give him more of a chance, especially when you start playing around with unlockable weapons. He's a very powerful and versatile class who is good at offense, defense and picks of important targets once you get the hang of rocket jumping.\n\nPyro: I'm a Pyro main, so I have a few words to say about them. Remember to use the airblast on your flamethrower. It's an immensely powerful tool which can deflect projectiles and deny ubers by pushing the enemy back. Also, you can extinguish teammates and get health from it as well, so if you see a burning teammate, press that right mouse button.\n\nShotguns: Any class with access to the stock shotgun (Engineer, Soldier, Heavy, Pyro) all can benefit from this weapon immensely at times. Maybe not the Heavy so much, but they have the Sandvich. Remember, switching weapons is almost always faster than reloading.\n\nLastly, general tips:\n\n1: Do not buy weapons or hats from the Mann Co. Store. If you wish to buy things, get Mann Co. Keys can trade them to other players. One key can usually get you some pretty good cosmetic loadouts and weapons, if you want them.\n\n2: Check the advanced options menu. Some really useful options in there. Hitsounds and damage numbers, allowing your Medigun's healbeam to not be held down to heal all the time, etc, etc.\n\n3: Remember, if you get duplicate weapons you don't need, you can smelt them down into scrap metal. 3 scrap equals a reclaimed. 3 reclaimed makes a refined, and 3 refined can get you a random hat, but i'd just save it for trading material.\n\n4: Play the objective.

You need to flank your opponents in order to get the upper hand with scout. With your fast moving speed, you can sneak up on your enemies in order to do high damage. Since you have low health, you need to avoid them spotting you. Since you can die easily from any class.\n\nSoldier: Shoot the ground and do 90 damage. It's a good Beginner Class. Since you don't need to aim a lot with him. The Splash damage will do most of the work. But keep a good distance and don't spam out all of your rockets. Since Soldier reloads really slowly. And as time goes by, learn how to rocket jump. It'll help you to have a height advantage.\n\nPyro: Reflect and extinguish. He's nothing much. Low damage. So relay on reflecting or your secondary. Your secondary can do more damage.\n\nDemoman: Strongest Class in TF2. He can do 100 damage with his Grenade Launcher, if you can hit your Grenades directly. His Stickies can do a lot of damage if you spam it. You can use Stickies to spam a choke point or a point and wait for the enemies to come. Or you can just set some traps. But he's not really good at short range. He can damage himself if someone is to close to him. So he's good at mid to long range. And remember to charge your stickies so they can go farther.\n\nHeavy: Stick to med, watch your back, watch out for snipers. He can decimate most classes easily from Close to Mid range. But you can easily get tunnel visioned by him. So a Spy, Scout, or Sniper can end you in seconds. He is the most frustrating yet fun to play.\n\nEngi: Always build an entrance tele at spawn. The make a safe exit tele somewhere, and remember that you can spin the tele with your right click button. You can see the blueprint of the tele when you place it down that it shows an arrow. The Arrow shows what direction your teammate will face when coming out of the tele. This is important because a spy can camp it and get free kills. So always turn your tele that the backside is facing a wall. For dispensers, put it at a safe distance where your teammates can run back to it and the enemies can't destroy it. For sentries, put it at a safe distance where there are ammo packs and it actually protects the point. And remember to upgrade all of your stuff. The Tele is sometimes top priority. the dispenser and sentry are up to the current situation. Also, be careful of Demos and Spies. They are your hard counters. One can destroy your Buildings in an instant, while the other can insta kill you and sap allof your buildings.\n\nMedic- IMO, the most hardest Class in TF2 to Pick up, Learn, and Master. He keeps the team alive and helps on pushes with his uber. Hence why everyone wants to kill him. If you kill the med, you can win the game. Now Medic needs to overheal everyone to keep them buffed and ready. Use your Crossbow(which you will unlock or find) to do long ranged heals. And the Ubersaw(again with the Crossbow) can give you 1/4 of uber if you hit someone with it. But it's risky. Just remember to buff everyone, keep yourself alive, run away if your patient dies, and know how to defend yourself to the best as you can.\n\nSniper: Click heads. If you quickscope, meaning no charged shots, you can do 50 damage on the body, and 150 damage on the head. Which means you can kill 5 out of the 9 classes in game. The rest you need to charge your shot. A fully charged shot can do 150 damage on the body, and 450 on the head. When sniping, keep your crosshair on head level. Don't move your mouse too much. Use your strafe keys to keep steady at head level. You can move your mouse if you need to. Since other snipers can easily kill you if you do flick to their heads fast enough. And stay at a far and safe distance. You will die to any class. And Watch your Back.\n\nSpy: IMO, Second most hardest class to pick up. There is no one like him. He can cloak, fake his death, headshot, disguises, and sap buildings. You need to keep an eye on your cloak at all time if you are using the Invis Watch or Cloak and Dagger. The Dead Ringer fakes your death and makes you run faster for 3 seconds and have like 5 seconds( i think) of regular cloak. Beware that this takes up half of your cloak. So use it wisely. And all of the watches makes a sound. The regular invis makes the most quietest sound, followed by the Cloak and Dagger and then the Dead Ringer. Almost anyone can hear the Dead Ringer. Now for the knives. They call can insta kill anyone from the back. Each have their own unquie function. Remember to use your cloak to get behind people and stab them. Also be patient as well. And use your revolver. It's a strong tool against Pyros, your main enemy.

Leftover metal can get you a few cheap hats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play every class before you choose a favorite. Many new players instantly decide they only play sniper and spy for some reason, but most classes are much easier to play well as a new player. Find out what you like before you choose your main class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settings. Watch &lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WoY0fgMgLT4\"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;.
