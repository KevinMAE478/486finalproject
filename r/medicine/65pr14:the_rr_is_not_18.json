High flow creates a small amount of resistance when exhaling, increasing PEEP and acting similarly to CPAP. This splints the airways and stops them collapsing. BIPAP does this but also increases the pressure to assist in inspiration too. High flow/CPAP stays the same pressure continuously whereas BIPAP changes pressure dependant on the respiratory cycle. BIPAP is more invasive and less comfortable whereas High Flow is usually very well tolerated even by agitated patients, so it depends on the level of respiratory support the patient needs and how well they will tolerate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "medicine", "name": "t1_dgdidg6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492466500.0, "created_utc": 1492437700.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pr14", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdcgms", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lurkerRN", "parent_id": "t1_dgdc1yi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/medicine", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be extremely uncomfortable for the patient. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "medicine", "name": "t1_dgdcgms", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492454456.0, "created_utc": 1492425656.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdc1yi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RainbowBriteIsAwesom", "parent_id": "t1_dgchayj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/medicine", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Recently had a pateint with no definitive diagnosis other that ?sepsis.
