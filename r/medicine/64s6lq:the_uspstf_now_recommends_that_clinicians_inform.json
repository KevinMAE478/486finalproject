The updated follow up of the ERSPC study at 13 years (http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)60525-0/abstract) showed a relative reduction of 21% (HR 0.79) in prostate cancer deaths with screening overall, and 27% (HR 0.73) after adjusting for noncompliance.

Living with metastatic prostate cancer is miserable - the disease is painful and debilitating. The treatments (hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy) are toxic and costly. Even if it doesn't kill you in the end, and you die of an MI or pneumonia, avoiding metastatic disease is likely a significant gain in quality of life for most men. Further, diagnosing a larger proportion of GS 6-7 disease and less 8-10 disease means men are subjected to less intensive treatment.

What caused the USPSTF to shift their recommendation isn&amp;#39;t the ERSPC study, but rather politics.  A handful of lobbyists in the US are itching to get rid of the USPSTF altogether, arguing that the USPSTF are getting in-between patients and their doctors, and that the USPSTF are somehow responsible for care-rationing (ignoring that USPSTF explicitly does not consider cost-effectiveness in its recommendations).  So now, with the insanity of the new administration, the USPSTF are just trying to blunt the motivation to cut their funding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "medicine", "name": "t1_dg5e9m9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491995862.0, "created_utc": 1491967062.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s6lq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s6lq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg91bp3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bill_tampa", "parent_id": "t1_dg9083s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/medicine", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you, the supplement answered all my questions.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you, the supplement answered all my questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "medicine", "name": "t1_dg91bp3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492199236.0, "created_utc": 1492170436.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9083s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "candmo", "parent_id": "t1_dg5824e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/medicine", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; was the actual total death rate in the PSA screened vs non-screened arms significantly different?\n\nThere was a statistically significant reduction in prostate cancer mortality in Sweden and The Netherlands.
