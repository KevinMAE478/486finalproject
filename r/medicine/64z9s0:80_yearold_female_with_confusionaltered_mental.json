If you want to sound smart, you can say that tissues in an imaged volume are magnetically saturated by multiple repetitive RF-pulses which drive down their steady-state magnetization levels. Then, as blood flows through the vessels, we can image based on the phenomenon of flow-related enhancement of spins entering into an imaging slice. As a result of being unsaturated, these spins give more signal that surrounding stationary spins.\n\nIf you actually want to remember it, think of it like this: we beat down the normal signal with a bunch of RF pulses. Then, the blood coming into the picture has a bunch more signal, because it didn't get bitchslapped down by the initial RF pulses, so it's bright.\n\nAnyway, we can see blood actively flowing into the aneurysm sac. It's hard to tell how much of the dark stuff is clot versus slow moving blood. Because of the way the study was done (ToF), that could be clot or just slow moving blood. \n\nWhy get a non-con MRA when we already have a post-contrast MRI? The short answer is that there's really no need. Once you have a post-contrast MRI, aneurysms and arterial/venous  clots are going to be better evaluated with the C+ MRI because there's contrast in the vessels. Like, if you need to exclude a dural venous sinus thrombosis, just get a C+ MRI and skip the MRV.\n\n[Here's a quick refresher on cerebral arterial anatomy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Circle_of_Willis_en.svg/1200px-Circle_of_Willis_en.svg.png) in case you've forgotten some of the finer details.\n\n-\n\n[**Coronal ToF MRA:**](http://i.imgur.com/WpMJOOP.png) More of the same, big ole aneurysm.\n\n-\n\n[**Sagittal ToF MRA:**](http://i.imgur.com/9Qzprd3.png) More of the same, big ole aneurysm.\n\n----\n\nThere are a few types of aneurysms, but the \"big 3\" are fusiform, saccular, and pseudo. [This picture does a good job of showing the 3 types](https://images.radiopaedia.org/images/29606802/4e4a316fa4fe7774fa3b7d0acb1acc_big_gallery.jpeg). Yes, it's true that a pseudoaneurysm is just that: a false aneurysm. What makes something a true aneurysms, then? It has all 3 walls of the vessel involved. A pseudoaneurysm is basically a contained rupture, and it can be contained by the adventitia surrounding the vessel or adjacent soft tissues. Pseudoaneurysms are more unstable and prone to rupture, so in general they all need to be treated. Small true aneurysms can sometimes just be followed, and there are different size criteria to intervene based on the type and location.\n\nThis is a saccular aneurysm. In the brain, to make things more complicated than they need to be, we change the name from saccular aneurysms to berry aneurysms. [This is a photograph of a Norwegian blueberry](https://images.radiopaedia.org/images/26301/61aa8a14bd14442c48bdd4564864d5_big_gallery.jpg), which is apparently what saccular brain aneurysms look like to pathologists.\n\nAnyway, let's stop beating this dead horse and actually do something about this bad boy! This thing needs to be coiled off so it doesn't rupture. Let's do some angiography. \n\n----\n\n[**Lateral DSA run, right internal carotid:**](http://i.imgur.com/RmAjRUH.gifv) I thought this was a particularly cool DSA run because you can actually see the pulsation of the aneurysm sac. It's arising from the proximal branches of the right ICA, and we'll definitively localize it in a second here.\n\nWTF is a DSA run? DSA stands for \"[digital subtraction angiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subtraction_angiography),\" and if you think about it, it tells you exactly what it is. Basically, the computer takes a mask image and then a bunch of x-rays in quick succession as the contrast bolus hits the area of interest. Then, the data from the mask image is subtracted from every frame, so that (in theory) all you see is the vessel. It doesn't work as well when someone moves (which is what this patient did at the end of the run - and you can see the mask layer kinda fall apart). But when they hold still, you get excellent visualization of the vessel of interest.\n\n-\n\n[**Rotational DSA run, right internal carotid:**](http://i.imgur.com/JOcFYss.gifv) They definitely did more than just two runs on the initial angio, but I thought I'd just show you guys the coolest ones. This is a spinny DSA (technical term), but we can see the aneurysm arising from the anterior communicating artery. How can I be sure? Check out the flow away from the aneurysm sac towards the left side of the brain. You can start to make out the left ACA. So this thing is centered about the vessel that goes between the right and left ACAs, the anterior communicating artery, or \"AComm\" if you're both super cool and in the biz.\n\n-\n\n[**Intra-procedure fluoro:**](http://i.imgur.com/rXpzRaN.png) We can see the catheter tip in the right ICA just before it turns and enters its petrous course. Then it does the loop-the-loop in the cavernous portion, and comes out and bifurcates into the ACA (which is going up in this picture) and the MCA (which is headed to the left side of this image).\n\nWe can see the aneurysm sac just distal to the A1 segment of the right ACA.\n\n-\n\n[**Intra-procedure fluoro:**](http://i.imgur.com/Wd5DNtU.png) So we've got our microwire through the catheter, going up through the distal ICA \u2192 ACA \u2192 AComm \u2192 aneurysm sac. As you're driving, you have the prior picture held on the fluoro screen, so you have an idea of what the path of the catheter should look like. Once you think you're in the spot, a little squirt of contrast is all you need to confirm the position, which is why we barely see anything except the aneurysm here.\n\n-\n\n[**Intra-procedure fluoro:**](http://i.imgur.com/gLeuZT7.png) Status post placement of a few coils. Is this good enough? Probably not quite yet. We can still see contrast getting into the aneurysm sac and filling the caudal portion of it. Coils don't need to totally occlude flow to get an aneurysm to thrombose over, but you want to get it to the point where you don't really see contrast going into the sac to have adequately coiled the lesion.\n\n-\n\n[**Intra-procedure fluoro:**](http://i.imgur.com/UPPUPmy.png) This is more better. Notice how there's barely any flow into the aneurysm sac. It's looking pretty good, let's get a few orthogonal views and a DSA run to confirm, and then get out of dodge.\n\n-\n\n[**Intra-procedure fluoro:**](http://i.imgur.com/8hjlZqn.png) We've now turned more AP, and you can see the right MCA headed to the right (left of the image) and then turning up to head over the cerebral convexity in its M2 and more distal branches. You can also see the right ACA going up along the midline. The coils are a bit hard to make out, but they're just to the left of where the ACA starts heading north.\n\n-\n\n[**Here's our final DSA run.**](http://i.imgur.com/Smm0zEX.gifv) They did a couple more from different angles, but it all looks the same. The coils have largely stopped the aneurysm sac from filling. There might be a little tiny bit of contrast that gets in proximally, but it's not much. That twinking looking activity at the caudal margin of the sac is just DSA artifact, not contrast filling the entire sac.\n\n----\n\n**Take-home points:**\n\n* Brain lesions can be [intra-axial \\(in the brain parenchyma\\) or extra-axial \\(anything else\\)](http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/p47f86aa182b3a/brain-tumor-systematic-approach.html#i47f86b18db49d). This narrows the differential. For instance, you're not going to include astrocytomas on your list of possible diagnoses for extra-axial masses.\n* The most common brain mass is mets. The most common primary adult brain tumor is a [GBM](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glioblastoma). \"Frontal lobe tumors with calcification\" is a radiology buzz-word for [oligodendroglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oligodendroglioma), but this thing just doesn't *look* like a tumor. It's too discrete. Something about the look just isn't good for tumor. \n* That leads to this gem: Not every \"mass\" in the brain is actually a tumor. Think about hemorrhage, infection, vascular lesions, and demyelinating disease as well. Some of these can look strangely mass-like on MRI.\n* Look for dark vessels - \"flow voids\" is the $10 doctor phrase - on your T2 imaging. They should be dark, and if there's signal in them, there's something wrong: clot, dissection, etc\n* ~~After you have the MRI with contrast, do you really need an MRA? Probably not~~ \n* ***edit:*** /u/Musicman425 brings up an excellent point about MRAs: *When you do your MRI +C, contrast has already saturated all the arteries AND adjacent veins. This can be a problem. Which leads into the point where the biggest difference comes in - time. On an MRA, you know the bright stuff is purely arterial flow - that's why if you see bright stuff in the dural venous sinuses or cavernous sinus, you're pretty certain this is a fistula or AVM - some type of shunting lesion. On an MRI +C you wouldn't think anything was abnormal because contrast is everywhere.*\n* I've had two different attendings tell me that a C+ MRI of the brain is superior to an MRV, and I tend to agree. MRV depends on the absence or presence of flow. Gadolinium-containing blood on a C+ MRI is being directly signaled, so you'll directly \"see\" filling defects in the dural venous sinuses. If you feel like you have to pull the trigger on ruling that out, just order the definitive study. *(edit: I think this point still stands)*\n* Be sure to follow-up on your cool cases. You find some satisfying results from which you, too, can make cool animated gifs.\n\n-\n\n---GuerillaRads, radiology freedom fighter\n\n\"[I fight for the users](https://i2.wp.com/clothesonfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Tron_original-poster-image_crop.jpg).\"", "edited": 1492092503.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/IbUv0xR.png\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Axial ToF MRA:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;Time of flight&amp;quot; is a slight misnomer, in my opinion, because that&amp;#39;s not exactly how non-con MRAs work.

Head CT at St. Elsewhere showed a \"brain mass.\"\n\n**PMHx:** DM, HTN, etc. All the usual old patient crap. Nothing contributory per se.\n\n-\n\n[**Axial CT:**](http://i.imgur.com/ywjwfei.png) Ahh, the head CT. I can't really think of a time that I'd turn down a non-con head CT. It's fast, cheap, rules in or out certain diagnoses very quickly, AND the brain is one of the most radio-resistant organs in the body (all of the tissues are very well differentiated and not dividing). \n\nThat said, in my experience, it's rare to see an neurologic cause (by imaging anyway) in the absence of unilateral defects of some kind. Like, globally AMS without other deficits on the neuro exam is usually due to sepsis, or kidney failure, liver failure, etc. Anyway, this was one of those exceptions that proves the rule, though. Always get a head CT. It's only a bad idea with a young, low-risk patient with a totally normal neuro exam (imo). But that's just, like, my opinion, man... and I'll get off my soapbox now.\n\nAnyway, there's a round hyperdense mass centered about the left frontal lobe. It's hard to tell if it's [intra-axial](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/intra-axial-2) or [extra-axial](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/extra-axial-1), which is something over which radiologists obsess. For once, though, this is a good obsession to have because it can really help narrow your differential diagnosis. There's also some edema in the white matter of the left frontal lobe, which is why it looks darker than the rest of the white matter.\n\n-\n\n[**Coronal CT:**](http://i.imgur.com/cDJIIGa.png) This is to get a sense of the actual size of this thing. It wasn't small, something like 3 cm in craniocaudal extent. We can see some mass effect from the lesion which appears to be effacing the right lateral ventricle to some degree.\n\n-\n\n[**Sagittal CT:**](http://i.imgur.com/8U1I99r.png) The mass is again shown. It's clearly very close to midline since we can see the brainstem, pons, and corpus callosum. This thing displaces the anterior fibers/genu of the corpus callosum. *Testable trivia:* the corpus forms from front to back (with the rostrum formed last), so the earlier the insult in utero, the more anterior you're going to have problems in the corpus collosum. \n\nAnyway, our mass is hyperdense and heterogeneous, and along the superior and frontal aspects, it looks like there's some peripheral calcification. There's also some totally meaningless calcification in the pineal gland with some additional calcs on the falx cerebri.\n\n-\n\n[**Axial CT:**](http://i.imgur.com/dmHvYCh.png) If we're not sure if something is actually dense like calcifications, we can change the windows to bone windows. Things that are still hyperdense on bone windows are going to be pretty damn dense, like (duh) bone or calcium. The peripheral stuff in this lesion is definitely calcification.\n\n-\n\n[**Sagittal T1:**](http://i.imgur.com/7nrsXR3.png) Don't know what it is on CT? That's cool, just order a contrast \nenhanced MRI. Let's check out the pre-contrast sequences first. This image is just a bit off of midline, like the CT sagittal. We can \nsee the brainstem and pons more discreetly here, as well as the cerebellum and corpus callosum. You can definitely tell \nthe fibers of the corpus callosum are displaced superiorly here. The lesion itself is heterogeneous with some peripheral high T1 signal and then varying degrees of lower signal contained within. Only a few things are intrinsically bright on T1 (fat, blood, melanin, contrast, proteinaceous stuff, certain elements like manganese or copper), so it greatly narrows your differential.\n\n-\n\n[**Axial T1:**](http://i.imgur.com/Om1G0gH.png) A good exercise to always go through with MRI (for radiologists anyway) is the \"what sequence is this\" game. Fluid is your friend. Fluid is dark on T1 and bright on T2 (remember world war 2 \u2192 WW2 \u2192 water is white on T2). So on this picture, the CSF fluid is dark and the subcutaneous fat is bright, so this is a T1. It can be easy to get T1 and FLAIRs (see below) confused, so remember this, too: white matter is white on T1 (meaning, it's brighter than the cortical grey matter).\n\nAnyway, we have a heterogeneous mass in the left frontal region. On this slice, we're starting to think it might not actually be *in* the brain - it might be extra-axial. Why do I say that? Well, you can sort of make out a rim of grey matter between the lesion and the white matter. [This page](http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/p47f86aa182b3a/brain-tumor-systematic-approach.html#i47f86b18db49d) has a bit larger description of intra-axial vs extra-axial locations.\n\n-\n\n[**Axial T2:**](http://i.imgur.com/htvrdMO.png) Fluid is bright here, so this is a T2. There's a heterogeneous but overall T2 hypointense mass with surrounding edema in the white matter.\n\n-\n\n[**Axial T2:**](http://i.imgur.com/lY64IFl.png) Here are a couple of helpful arrow signs. One of the things you should always look at on a T2 MRI is the vessel flow voids. Basically, the stuff that's moving in a vessel is going to move out of the field of view during the time it takes to acquire your T2 weighted images. So, you won't get any signal from those areas. We call these \"flow voids,\" and when you can see something in the vessel that's not a black flow-void, that can indicate the presence of a clot. Anyway, in this case, we don't see a clot, but we do see two flow-voids (aka vessels) going into the big mass. Even without the previous imaging, we should be thinking about vascular lesions just from this image.\n\n-\n\n[**Axial FLAIR:**](http://i.imgur.com/39L9PMX.png) FLAIR stands for \"fluid attenuated inversion recovery.\" The tl;dr version \nof FLAIR is that it suppresses the CSF fluid signal, so anything that's bright is NOT just CSF, it's probably edema. The \nslightly longer version is this: T1 and T2 are intrinsic factors that tissues have. The speeds with which protons regain their logitudinal magnetization in different tissues is known, so when we're about to read out that signal, there's a counterpulse that nullifies the signal of whatever \"types\" of signal you want to ignore. In the case of FLAIR, we're trying to suppress the signal of water (technically CSF, but they're very similar of course). This is the same concept as when we do STIR imaging on MSK sequences - the only difference there is that we're suppressing the fat signal. We can also do this in the myocardium on cardiac MRI to null the myocardium, which makes it easier to identify areas of enhancement after contrast administration.\n\nI know I just told you that fluid is your friend a few images ago. But fluid is dark on both T1 and FlAIR. So, how can we tell T1 from FLAIR? White matter is \nwhite on T1 (meaning it's brighter than the grey matter). Here, the grey matter is brighter than the white matter, so even \nthough the fluid is dark, we know it's a FLAIR. You will also start to notice artifacts from the inversion recovery \nprocess and it will just look like a FLAIR to you after you've seen a bunch. The linear white signal coming off of the \noccipital horns of the lateral ventricles is such an artifact.\n\n-\n\n[**Axial post-contrast T1:**](http://i.imgur.com/NfAk2CC.png) Fluid is dark here, and the white matter is \"white\" (meaning, brighter than the grey matter), so this is a T1. It's post-contrast because we can see all of the vessels. Our mass lesion sure looks like it arises from a vessel, and is maybe even fed directly by that vessel we see just to the right of midline.\n\n-\n\n[**Coronal post-contrast T1:**](http://i.imgur.com/zVv2rRB.png) Another view of the lesion. Heterogenous appearance and enhancement, typical for mixed aged blood.\n\n-\n\n[**Coronal post-contrast T1:**](http://i.imgur.com/PLk6N8i.png) Slightly different cut. Handy arrow sign pointing out the vessel from which this lesion arises.\n\n-\n\n[**Sagittal post-contrast T1:**](http://i.imgur.com/o4SldK2.png) Same thing, we can see the normal vessel feeding the aneurysm sac.\n\n-\n\n[**3D MRA MIP:**](http://i.imgur.com/WApy2OO.png) Even though we already have post-contrast images, we got an MRA. The one thing that is nice about getting an MRA is that we can get a 3D MIP projection like the one shown here. MIP stands for maximum intensity projection. We take the data set and assign the highest signal value within a given voxel to *all* of that voxel (voxel = volumetric pixel = 3d pixels... and remember, pixel stands for picture element) . To make a long story short, this gives us excellent 3d visualization at the cost of \"depth perception.\" In this case, for example, it's hard to tell what's in front/behind of what. We have an idea of what the vessels are because we know what the ICAs and basilar and such all look like and where they're supposed to be. \n\nMIPs are great for increasing your sensitivity to small things. We use them in vessel imaging like this to help find small aneurysms. We use them on chest CTs to help find small lung nodules ~~so that you have to follow them for a couple of years, cause anxiety out of proportion to the severity of the finding for your patient, and generate income for both the radiologist and the clinician who sees them for generally useless follow-up visits...~~ err, to help screen for lung cancer.
