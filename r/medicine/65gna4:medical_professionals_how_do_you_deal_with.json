I think all of us have had patients who carve out a little place in your heart that will stay with you. If I can offer a few words, I would just like to let you know a few things that have helped me over time....\n\n1-The pain you feel is a testament to your humanity. That in an increasingly difficult workplace made harder by increasing bureaucracy, increasing tension, and a never ending supply of articles about burnout, your emotional response shows an empathy and a compassion that I think will hold you in good stead going forward \n\n2-it's ok to feel sad. One of the things I tell my patients is that they are entitled to their full range of emotion.  Sad situations abound in medicine, so allow yourself the mental space to say that it's ok for me to go through what I'm going through\n\n3-I echo the sentiment about professional help. Doesn't need to even be a mental health professional, although I personally feel they have a lot to offer. My hospital has a \"caring for the caregiver\" program which is staffed with psychologists, social workers, and a big bucket of candy. Pretty helpful to go just talk it out and eat chocolate. Maybe inquire if your place has something similar \n\n4-a personal note from me is I have found some poetry to be useful as a coping strategy. My favorite poet is named Khalil Gibran, and he has a poem called \"on death\" which for me has a nice sentiment about death being part of the same cycle of life, and that to know the secret of death you must find it in the heart of life. Two sides of the same coin, and an expansion, not an ending, of our being. He ends it by saying \"only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing, and when you reach the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb. And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance\" \n\nMy condolences again", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My condolences for your loss. I think all of us have had patients who carve out a little place in your heart that will stay with you. If I can offer a few words, I would just like to let you know a few things that have helped me over time....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1-The pain you feel is a testament to your humanity. That in an increasingly difficult workplace made harder by increasing bureaucracy, increasing tension, and a never ending supply of articles about burnout, your emotional response shows an empathy and a compassion that I think will hold you in good stead going forward &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2-it&amp;#39;s ok to feel sad. One of the things I tell my patients is that they are entitled to their full range of emotion.  Sad situations abound in medicine, so allow yourself the mental space to say that it&amp;#39;s ok for me to go through what I&amp;#39;m going through&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3-I echo the sentiment about professional help. Doesn&amp;#39;t need to even be a mental health professional, although I personally feel they have a lot to offer. My hospital has a &amp;quot;caring for the caregiver&amp;quot; program which is staffed with psychologists, social workers, and a big bucket of candy. Pretty helpful to go just talk it out and eat chocolate. Maybe inquire if your place has something similar &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4-a personal note from me is I have found some poetry to be useful as a coping strategy. My favorite poet is named Khalil Gibran, and he has a poem called &amp;quot;on death&amp;quot; which for me has a nice sentiment about death being part of the same cycle of life, and that to know the secret of death you must find it in the heart of life. Two sides of the same coin, and an expansion, not an ending, of our being. He ends it by saying &amp;quot;only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing, and when you reach the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb. And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My condolences again&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "medicine", "name": "t1_dgalcqn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492288152.0, "created_utc": 1492259352.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gna4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaz334", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TerrenceTas", "parent_id": "t3_65gna4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/medicine", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I had to do an emergency csection on  close friend of mine almost a year ago.
