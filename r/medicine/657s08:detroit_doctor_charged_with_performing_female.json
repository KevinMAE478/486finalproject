My point isn't to say men are suffering too. My point is to say our attacks on FGM, while valid, often occur from a stance of hypocrisy and xenophobia.

My point isn't that circumcision is bad, it is that it is hypocritical to condone one and attack the other in a form that roughly mirrors it. In that instance there seems to be no morally relevant difference between minor forms of FGM and circumcision, and instead the imaged difference seems to rapidly become a place to spew racism and cultural elitism. The fact that we circumcise males only serves as a means for me to demonstrate this. It knocks us off our high horse. I do not want to turn this away from a women's issue at all, but we do not serve the women of these cultures by attacking their culture wholesale in an unreflective way. In fact, this sort of unreflective attack allows us to overlook the issues women face in our own country, and in many ways is reminiscent of the white man's burden narrative. Until the late 1970s Blue Cross/Blue Shield covered a similar procedure to increase sexual behaviors in women who couldn't orgasm with their husbands, and until the 1950s it was used as a means to decrease behaviors like lesbianism and mastrubation. Both instances of the procedure are examples of it being done in the US on Americans for the means of increasing socially acceptable (and male approved) forms of behavior. In short, the women who are victims of FGM are often made pawns in xenophobic rants, and used functionally as a means to obscure forms of oppression closer to home. My point is to merely ask those who are critical to look first to the plank in their own eye, and to note use the victims as a tool to effectively promote racism against the victim's cultural group. In my opinion, many critics of FGM are not arguing in good faith, and that bothers me. There's few moral failings worse than hypocrisy.

Very sad. I had her deep under general anesthesia (1.3 MAC). It was just supposed to be a partial vulvectomy, so I didn&amp;#39;t know they were about to remove the clitoris and they didn&amp;#39;t tell me before they decided to take it. All of the sudden the patient jerks on the table! I rush up and give more drugs and was like &amp;quot;what was that?? I was not expecting her to move!&amp;quot;  She wasn&amp;#39;t even close to showing any signs of stimulation during any other part of the excision... And then they tell me what they just did. Yep, that explains it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The patient won&amp;#39;t remember any of that thankfully, but it definitely stuck with me how insanely stimulating that part of the procedure was. I immediately thought of all the poor girls who undergo that trauma with NO ANESTHESIA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: grammar stuff&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "medicine", "name": "t1_dg8ah6o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492149198.0, "created_utc": 1492120398.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 129}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657s08", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657s08", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg91p31", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jonathanlikes", "parent_id": "t1_dg8j7ib", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/medicine", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Probably YouTube.
