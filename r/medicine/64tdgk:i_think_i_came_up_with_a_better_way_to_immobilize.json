This may be worse than discouraging sight at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we suspect the eyes moving in tandem, who&amp;#39;s to say that that position (looking straight ahead, or whatever) isn&amp;#39;t the worst possible position for the injured eye?  What if that position maximizes the damage done by the impaled object?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Little Jimmy is rising from tying his shoes when Bobby throws a dart which enters just below Jimmy&amp;#39;s left brow ridge, pierces the orb, and lodges in the left cheek bone&amp;quot; - in this case, the pupil is best in the &amp;quot;looking up&amp;quot; angle, just as it was when the dart entered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SOP says inverted cup for the injury, cover the other eye to reduce injured eye movement (tandem movement), transport. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, in this example, we cut a hole in the uninjured eye cup. NOW, we&amp;#39;re basically &amp;quot;encouraging&amp;quot; little Jimmy to point his eyes &amp;quot;straight ahead&amp;quot; to see through the hole we made, and possibly thereby worsening the injury.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hole-in-the-cup has always been a neat idea, but we should think about it carefully before implementing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "medicine", "name": "t1_dg5ql8b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492025060.0, "created_utc": 1491996260.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tdgk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tdgk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tdgk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tdgk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5xzpz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GCSof2", "parent_id": "t1_dg5hju1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/medicine", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Obviously you'd throw whatever was left into your mouth before using the can.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously you&amp;#39;d throw whatever was left into your mouth before using the can.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "medicine", "name": "t1_dg5xzpz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492036616.0, "created_utc": 1492007816.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5hju1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WalleyD", "parent_id": "t1_dg5gkue", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/medicine", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The remaining tobacco may irritate the eye a little.
