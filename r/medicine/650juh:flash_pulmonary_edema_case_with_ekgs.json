To me, this is a wide complex tachycardia that is regular, with multiple atrial foci (note P wave morphologies differ before each complex, p waves especially evidence in V1 and II) in a RBBB pattern. T waves appear more peaked to me in EKG 1 vs 4 which is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From a cardiac stress test point of view, I&amp;#39;m not sure that an EST is the best test in this gentleman as he is 78, and in lieu of likely other risk factors he wouldn&amp;#39;t have a low pre-test probability of IHD, and has a bundle, which is another reason to not do an ECG EST. Nuclear imaging (MIBI) would be more appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can follow-up that&amp;#39;d be great, I imagine an ECHO will show RWMA with likely at least minimally depressed LV function. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good case where afterload reduction is the name of the game, LMNOP is a great acronym to start with to get your head around it (lasix, morphine, nitrates, oxygen, positive pressure ventilation).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;thanks for posting!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "medicine", "name": "t1_dg6jwkm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492059578.0, "created_utc": 1492030778.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650juh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650juh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhff", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650juh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7wvjp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anothercoffeefanatic", "parent_id": "t1_dg7v6av", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/medicine", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Unfortunately, there isn't any other recommendation, if they're demanding ETCO2 monitoring.
