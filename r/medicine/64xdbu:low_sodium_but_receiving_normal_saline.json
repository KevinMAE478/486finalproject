The appropriate treatment is to address the underlying pathology, e.g. Diuretics for heart failure or treating acute stressors. If this was your patient, the nephrologist may have been mad because the problem is fluid overload and giving fluids exacerbated this. \n\n3) euvolemia - in this situation, a body stressor causes excess ADH release without any derangement in intravascular volume.

If this was your patient and had been previously diagnosed, the nephrologist may have been upset that you didn't do more chart review. \n\nMoral of the story: very carefully evaluate a patient's volume status before giving fluids for hyponatremia. If they are dehydrated to euvolemic, give fluids cautiously and ensure you keep close tabs on how their sodium responds, and if they are edematous look instead to optimize their underlying condition.

Hell, consider what we recommend for ORS, Pedialyte, and the fact that it contains about 45 mEq of sodium and the recommended WHO-ORS has closer to 90 mEq.\n\nFor instance, it seems to me like LR would be a better fluid in the setting of diarrhea given the primary electrolytes lost are potassium and bicarb (neither of which are replaced by normal saline).

And, please, I am totally open with being wrong here. Hell, I'd love to upset everyone in grand rounds or something. Nothing is more satisfying than slaying sacred cows.\n\nBasic fluids: So you use your Holliday-Segar-we-figured-this-out-from-breastmilk? method to calculate your daily volume requirement. Next you need to address the electrolyte replacement (3 mEq/kg/day of chloride, 2 mEq/kg/day of sodium, and 1 mEq/kg/day of potassium). \n\nSo in a 10 kg kid, for example you get this:\n\n100 ml/kg/day*10kg = 1 L water\n\nplus\n\n1 mEq/kg/day K * 10 kg = 10 mEq K\n\nplus\n\n2 mEq/kg/day Na * 10 kg = 20 mEq Na\n\nplus\n\n3 mEq/kg/day Cl * 10 kg = 30 mEq Cl\n\nSo this approximates to 1L of 0.2% NaCl plus 10 mEq KCl given over a day. Wait, what? Yup. Turns out this would be perfectly acceptable and well tolerated by an otherwise healthy kid if the kidneys are working. The problem usually happens when practitioners approach maintenance fluids to serve as deficit replacement. \n\nAdditionally, sick kids secrete more ADH. This leads to more free water retention in addition to an electrolyte free fluid and, voila, your adequately fluid resuscitated septic kid now has cerebral edema. \n\nAnd really, in many of the cases of iatrogenic hyponatremia in the literature it's usually a combination of using comparatively electrolyte-free water to replace deficits (which is not how maint. fluid should be used) or inappropriate calculations on electrolytes utilizing a completely weight based calculation (as opposed to the concentration of the electrolytes in the given volume). \n\nThe real answer is as above that the choice of fluid depends on the patient and the pathology.

And, please, I am totally open with being wrong here. Hell, I&amp;#39;d love to upset everyone in grand rounds or something. Nothing is more satisfying than slaying sacred cows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basic fluids: So you use your Holliday-Segar-we-figured-this-out-from-breastmilk? method to calculate your daily volume requirement. Next you need to address the electrolyte replacement (3 mEq/kg/day of chloride, 2 mEq/kg/day of sodium, and 1 mEq/kg/day of potassium). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in a 10 kg kid, for example you get this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;100 ml/kg/day*10kg = 1 L water&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;plus&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 mEq/kg/day K * 10 kg = 10 mEq K&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;plus&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 mEq/kg/day Na * 10 kg = 20 mEq Na&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;plus&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 mEq/kg/day Cl * 10 kg = 30 mEq Cl&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this approximates to 1L of 0.2% NaCl plus 10 mEq KCl given over a day. Wait, what? Yup. Turns out this would be perfectly acceptable and well tolerated by an otherwise healthy kid if the kidneys are working. The problem usually happens when practitioners approach maintenance fluids to serve as deficit replacement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, sick kids secrete more ADH. This leads to more free water retention in addition to an electrolyte free fluid and, voila, your adequately fluid resuscitated septic kid now has cerebral edema. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And really, in many of the cases of iatrogenic hyponatremia in the literature it&amp;#39;s usually a combination of using comparatively electrolyte-free water to replace deficits (which is not how maint. fluid should be used) or inappropriate calculations on electrolytes utilizing a completely weight based calculation (as opposed to the concentration of the electrolytes in the given volume). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real answer is as above that the choice of fluid depends on the patient and the pathology. For kids that are particularly sick (those in the ICU, meningitis, severe pneumonia, etc.) an isotonic solution is usually more appropriate and in smaller volumes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "medicine", "name": "t1_dg71o59", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492081409.0, "created_utc": 1492052609.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6xo1h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "90DaysNCounting", "parent_id": "t1_dg6xkr8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/medicine", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Maintenance.

If they are stable or the hyponatremia is chronic you have got all the time you need. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next is to determine the type of hyponatremia based on volume status. Typically classified into hypovolemic, hypervolemic, and euvolemic. Examination of patient combined with urine and serum studies mentioned elsewhere can help you classify it further. Then treatment can be tailored based on additional information. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often if someone has new hyponatremia and they are stable in the ER, I get all the things that the nephrologist and hospitalist need to help determine the cause and don&amp;#39;t initiate treatment until everything has resulted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that it would be reasonable for a midlevel to gather all the information, come up with the likely cause and diagnosis, develop a treatment plan and then run that by the physician or nephrologist before initiating therapy. As mentioned else where there is significant morbidity if it is treated wrong or corrected too quickly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If all else fails, kidneys are magic and nephrologist are wizards, consult the nephrologist early it is what they are trained to deal with.
