Some patients (spine) I think annoy the living shit out of me, and some I feel nothing for. But there are of course patients I empathise a lot with. Are there no patients you empathise with? Then I&amp;#39;d be worried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But being professional includes being able to give a reasonable and ample emotional response. Can you do that?
