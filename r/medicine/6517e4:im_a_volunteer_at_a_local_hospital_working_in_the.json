Organizing their items in the patient belongings bag, etc.\n-If it's lunch time, I often ask the nurses first which patients I can help get food to and then, if possible, I announce the menu to the patients with some humor ... \"and red wine!\" and deliver it with a smile. It breaks the ice and sometimes gets a laugh, and later on, they want to chat. Planting a seed for connecting later.\n- Make eye contact, connect with the family or home aides. Introduce yourself to all warmly.\n-Other small conversation starters: are you from around here? I'm located in a large city on the West Coast and most people I meet are not originally from here. Noticing an article of clothing or accessory, or interesting possession, and asking about it. Some people love to talk about travel and their families... or just to unload about how terrible their nursing home is, etc. \"How are you doing today?
