In this case, Occam&amp;#39;s razor failed, and we actually have TWO separate diagnoses (although they are related). I suspect this is where some of you got confused, and that is why I wanted to share this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It looks like hydranencephaly? But there is more cerebral rim than I&amp;#39;d expect on the followup images, so I&amp;#39;m not sure.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach to this Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/L5WwnaF\"&gt;2 Annotated&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; Note the presence of the flow void of a single anterior cerebral artery (aka &amp;quot;azygos ACA&amp;quot;) where there should two ACAs. This can be seen in isolation as a variant anatomy, but it is highly associated with fusion abnormalities of the brain (holoprosencephaly). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Note the presence of a midline falx both anteriorly and posteriorly. This effectively rules out the severe forms of holoprosencephaly (aprosencephaly, atelencephaly) that have absent falx as well as the moderate-severe form of semilobar holoproscenphaly that has absence of the anterior falx. We&amp;#39;re left with the lobar type, the middle interhemispheric variant / syntelencephaly, minimal holoprosencephaly, and microform holoprosencephaly. We will narrow it down even further later on. I noticed that &lt;a href=\"/u/Porencephaly\"&gt;u/Porencephaly&lt;/a&gt; called this case semilobar - that&amp;#39;s okay. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter too much between &amp;quot;severe&amp;quot; lobar or &amp;quot;mild&amp;quot; semilobar as far as I understand it. In real life, holoprosencephaly is a smooth spectrum of varying severity, and the individual &amp;quot;types&amp;quot; should be thought of as sign posts or distance markers rather than absolutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; The ventricles are not well defined. There should be a lateral ventricle in either hemisphere separated from each other superiorly by intervening brain material. Instead, there is this midline enlarged CSF space. Additionally, this CSF space is very large and is pushing out and squeezing the cerebral cortex out. The cortex looks plastered against the skull. This is consistent with hydrocephalus. Those of you who suggested lissencephaly - good thought! as that never even crossed my mind. On the other hand, going down the path of lissencephaly means that you missed the hydrocephalus that requires an urgent surgical procedure. Just search &amp;quot;lissencephaly&amp;quot; on google and compare the ventricle size on the examples to this case&amp;#39;s BULGING CSF space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4)&lt;/strong&gt; Now let&amp;#39;s look at the cortex. The presence of both cerebral hemispheres already rules out hydranencephaly - a condition of in utero bilateral ICA occlusion -&amp;gt; destruction/near absence of both cerebral hemispheres, leaving only the posterior circulation brain (broadly, parts of the occipital lobe + cerebellum + brainstem, etc) in place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/rkfqqVt\"&gt;3 Annotated&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The peanut-shaped highlight shows partial fusion of bilateral thalami, a finding seen in either lobar or semilobar holoprosencephaly. In order to not write an even larger wall of text, we can, with some other findings, discard the milder forms of holoprosencephaly to arrive at our final diagnosis of lobar holoprosencephaly + hydrocephalus.

Does your diagnosis change compared to Part 1?\n\n-----\n\n**Thanks for your patience. I was pretty busy today. Here are my thoughts on this case.**\n\n**SPOILERS AHEAD**\n\n**Diagnosis and Teaching Point**\n\n- Diagnosis: Newborn: Lobar holoprosencephaly + hydrocephalus (probably from congenital aqueductal stenosis). 11 y/o: same as above; hydrocephalus status post ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS).\n\n- Teaching Point: The classic differential for enlarged CSF space + abnormal brain hemispheres is HHH: hydrocephalus, hydranencephaly, and holoprosencephaly; and you're supposed to narrow it down to 1 of those 3.
