No RCT was powered to evaluate the effect of oseltamivir treatment of outpatients to reduce influenza-associated complications such as hospitalization or lower respiratory tract infections; both outcomes are rare in otherwise healthy individuals but more common in persons at higher risk for complications.  Pooled data from RCTs have been used to try to assess the effect of outpatient treatment on subsequent complications.  While too few hospitalizations were recorded from available RCTs to assess this outcome, published studies have demonstrated a reduction in clinician diagnosed lower respiratory tract infections requiring antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "medicine", "name": "t1_dg9a8rk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492212934.0, "created_utc": 1492184134.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8nit8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Movinmeat", "parent_id": "t1_dg85omg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/medicine", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ugh.
