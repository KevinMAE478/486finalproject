I&amp;#39;ll start with the one displayed in the title.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a Ultrawide monitor for about a month now. It&amp;#39;s a LG 29UB67, which I have hooked up to a UHD (4K) Dell XPS 15 9560. The monitor sports a 99% sRGB coverage, the XPS 15 sports around 97% AdobeRGB coverage. So needless to say, they are capable of displaying very vibrant colors. The configuration I use is as following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Laptop closed (and Windows put on &amp;quot;Second Screen&amp;quot; only, and hooked up to monitor via HDMI&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keyboard and mouse connected to monitor, which are connected via a USB-A to USB-B cable to the laptop&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The laptop came with this software called &amp;quot;Dell PremierColor&amp;quot; which is used to put the laptop in different colormodes (e.g sRGB, Vibrant, AdobeRGB). I assumed this was the culprit so I uninstalled it. After a reboot, the same behaviour continued. The colors on the monitor became washed out after a few seconds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also gave it a shot to disable f.lux for a hour, but no improvements have been made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monitor settings are on default, no custom profile whatsoever. I really suspect this is a Windows thing, as it happens shortly after I login. On the login screen the colors are still vibrant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the Ultrawide comes with a custom colorprofile in Windows, I tried loading some different ones in that were also on my system and made those default. That didn&amp;#39;t make any difference either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is problem 1. Problem 2 is a bit more difficult to describe. I have a suspicion to what it may be related, but I have no idea how to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My laptop has a UHD (4K) screen. It is a pleasure to work on. When I&amp;#39;m at home, I often close it, however sometimes during conference calls I turn the screen on and open the laptop for having my skype open and being able to use the webcam. This gives me 2 monitors in essence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that however, the fun starts. On my ultrawide which I use to look at articles, (in Chrome btw.) I get black bars on both sides. They are about 15 pixels wide on each side. This only affects the web part of the page, not the Chrome UI. If I have a website with scrollbars on the side, the scrollbar becomes gigantic and atleast a finger in width. Both of these issues are annoying, and I&amp;#39;d love to be able to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I assume it is related to is the different resolutions and thus the different scaling precentages. My Ultrawide uses the default 100%, my laptop 225%. Without that precentage my laptop is nearly unusable. Setting my ultrawide to match that scaling is not a option either, as I will lose nearly all real estate given to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the two things I&amp;#39;m most bothered by right now, and I&amp;#39;d love to get some help regarding these issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure if it is related, but here are the software and hardware specs of my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hardware Dell XPS 15 9560:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Processor: i7-7700HQ @3.6 GHZ turbo&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RAM: 16GB 2400Mhz&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SSD: Liteon CX 512GB NVMe&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Internal GPU: Intel HD 630 (Driver is the .4590 version)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;dGPU: GTX 1050 4GB Mobile&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HDMI version: 1.4&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Windows: Windows 10 Home 64-bit, Anniversary Update (no Creators Update just yet)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any given help, I really appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Okay, two issues.
