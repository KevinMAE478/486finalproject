I work in higher-ed where BYOD is becoming more and more common. I think the biggest drivers of technology like this (using an app, etc) would be software licensing and data protection. \n\nSoftware licensing is usually an issue because when a company licenses a software, 8/10 times that software contract spells out that you can only install it on your device. If it's registered to a company, that meas only company-owned devices. There are ways around this, such as SaaS and virtualizing software, but it would require an application to run. So to use enterprise software that may be required for you to complete your job responsibilities, you need to install the app to run it.\n\nData security is a huge deal in today's world. Hearing about millions of accounts and PI being compromised and sold on the web, the vast majority of these attacks are  not \"hacking\", they're unprotected endpoints (people's computers). You click on a phishing email and get a keylogger or something, and you work with your company's data on your device? Yeah, they now have that data. Without some kind of protection, you're the threat. Many companies have software that allows you to access company data virtually and not install it on your computer. Another option is having a software that scans your computer for known infections (think antivirus, but not your run of the mill Norton) or would scan your data for certain references, like company name or PII (personally identifiable information) and flag them and lock it down. \n\nThere are reasons to use an app for work, and a lot of people here are keyboard warriors who've never worked an enterprise job in their life that are talking about your rights. Your company probably has a really good reason for wanting you to use it, however, they're being sketchy not telling you what its purpose is.

I work in higher-ed where BYOD is becoming more and more common. I think the biggest drivers of technology like this (using an app, etc) would be software licensing and data protection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Software licensing is usually an issue because when a company licenses a software, 8/10 times that software contract spells out that you can only install it on your device. If it&amp;#39;s registered to a company, that meas only company-owned devices. There are ways around this, such as SaaS and virtualizing software, but it would require an application to run. So to use enterprise software that may be required for you to complete your job responsibilities, you need to install the app to run it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Data security is a huge deal in today&amp;#39;s world. Hearing about millions of accounts and PI being compromised and sold on the web, the vast majority of these attacks are  not &amp;quot;hacking&amp;quot;, they&amp;#39;re unprotected endpoints (people&amp;#39;s computers). You click on a phishing email and get a keylogger or something, and you work with your company&amp;#39;s data on your device? Yeah, they now have that data. Without some kind of protection, you&amp;#39;re the threat. Many companies have software that allows you to access company data virtually and not install it on your computer. Another option is having a software that scans your computer for known infections (think antivirus, but not your run of the mill Norton) or would scan your data for certain references, like company name or PII (personally identifiable information) and flag them and lock it down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are reasons to use an app for work, and a lot of people here are keyboard warriors who&amp;#39;ve never worked an enterprise job in their life that are talking about your rights. Your company probably has a really good reason for wanting you to use it, however, they&amp;#39;re being sketchy not telling you what its purpose is. I&amp;#39;d verify what that purpose is before doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "techsupport", "name": "t1_dgcgyld", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492400676.0, "created_utc": 1492371876.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o830", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o830", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbzynr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bnndforfatantagonism", "parent_id": "t1_dgbw5um", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/techsupport", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks, I might try this.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, I might try this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "techsupport", "name": "t1_dgbzynr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492376275.0, "created_utc": 1492347475.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o830", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o830", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o830", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o830", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o830", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o830", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcl03x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ajdrausal", "parent_id": "t1_dgckoox", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/techsupport", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you have aws server running 24/7 (lowest one) it can be 30-60$/month. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have aws server running 24/7 (lowest one) it can be 30-60$/month. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "techsupport", "name": "t1_dgcl03x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492405924.0, "created_utc": 1492377124.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgckoox", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ruinah", "parent_id": "t1_dgck5ys", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/techsupport", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How much is something like that to run a month?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much is something like that to run a month?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "techsupport", "name": "t1_dgckoox", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492405509.0, "created_utc": 1492376709.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgck5ys", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ajdrausal", "parent_id": "t1_dgcjqg4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/techsupport", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Think of Docker like an image of an operating system with everything installed", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of Docker like an image of an operating system with everything installed&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "techsupport", "name": "t1_dgck5ys", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492404803.0, "created_utc": 1492376003.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o830", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgck7du", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Andrewfx", "parent_id": "t1_dgcjqg4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/techsupport", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Essentially the same as running it in a virtual machine, but just running an instance of it inside a container and hosting it online.
