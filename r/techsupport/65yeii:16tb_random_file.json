Do not do any methods that involve opening the file or any programs that may be associated with the file, because it will mess up the properties of the file and potentially make this more difficult.\n\n_____\n**1. Viewing the file in a Text Editor**\n\nYou may try opening the file into a text editor that only loads chunks of the file at a time, considering you would not be able to open a 1.6TB file at one time unless you had over 1.6TB of memory.\n\nA program that may do this is UltraEdit.\n\nIf you open the file as text in UltraEdit and it's in plaintext, or even if some sections are in plaintext, you could get some clues as to what the file was for.\n\nAs for preventing it from happening again, you will need to know what caused it to be created. \n\n_____\n**2. Monitoring the file with Process Monitor**\n\nThere is a tool by Microsoft Sysinternals called Procmon. It's great for monitoring processes, files, threads and registry edits. It will not tell you what created the file unless you are monitoring while it gets created, but it will monitor anything created or changed while you have it open.\n\nYou can monitor what program changes this file by doing this:\n\nOpen Procmon, then press CTRL+L to open Filters.\n\nYou should already see some Red X filters and those are fine (Exclude filters).\n\nAdd this filter by changing the dropdown bars and text field to this, then click Add.\n\n    Detail  \n    Contains\n    3590F75ABA9E485486C100C1A9D4FF06SMPFZLNVMOBPXLUM  \n    then\n    Include\n\nHere, I have already provided the specific filename into the text field. You just want:\n\n    Detail Contains [filename] then Include.\n\nThis will add the filter to your Procmon to monitor anything that happens to that file, at all. Be sure that if you renamed it, name it back to the above.\n\nIf Procmon picks anything up, it will show you what program is doing the changes.\n\n_____\n**3. Probing for an error or find out if a program needs that file**\n\nYou can try at least renaming the file to something like:\n 3590F75ABA9E485486C100C1A9D4FF06SMPFZLNVMOBPXLUMbackup.bak\n\nIf there is a program that would create another one of these files, then you may be able to catch it.

Just be careful not to open any of the programs or you will change the Last Accessed information which may or may not change the file's Last Accessed information.\n\nYou can also search your drives for those properties to find other files that were created, modified or Accessed on those dates.

It may still be worth it.\n\nIf the file was created on 12/3/2016, then you can go to **This PC** and type in the Search bar \"created:12/3/2016\" and hit enter.
