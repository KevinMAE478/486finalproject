You'll be putting your computer on the hook for providing services to the entire office. What if you need to update your OS? What if the hard drive goes? Bad idea. I would recommend two options:\n\n* Small Windows server - A small entry-level microserver. HP or Dell are both good. You don't need anything crazy. Single CPU, 16-32GB RAM (thinking ahead to other uses). If you don't need a lot of disk space then go with a simple two-drive mirror (any size) or RAID5 (small disks only, not preferred but an option). If you want performance and redundancy, go with four drive RAID10 (any size). You'll want something with a Windows Server license - 2016 Essentials will do. Advantages: Windows-based for easy, familiar management. Can add additional services, including cloud-based backup (Carbonite, CrashPlan, etc) if you desire. It's not best practices or recommended at all, but you could even add AD services and bring the Windows machines into a domain for easy management. Enterprise-class support available at reasonable costs. If you don't have dedicated IT, or even if you do, quick phone support and hardware replacement can be worth it. Disadvantages: Can get unruly to manage as new services are added or requested. It's Windows, so you have to practice good hygiene and update habits.\n\n* Dedicated NAS - Synology, QNAP, something like that. Throw in some NAS disks and go. Advantages: Even simpler to manage than Windows. Closer to turnkey/set it and forget it type functionality. Disadvantages: Versatile, but not as versatile as Windows. Frequently much shorter warranties than what is available with a standard server.\n\nSome tips that apply to either option:\n\n* Backups. RAID is not a backup solution. Make sure you have backups. Have backups.\n\n* Sane permissions save time and aggravation. The more complex your permission structure, the more time you spend figuring out why person X can't get to some file. Set permissions at the highest level in the folder structure as possible, and use group permissions vs individual permissions. Simple is better than complex.\n\n* Backups. Assuming the business cares about staying *in* business.\n\n* Configure email alerts for disk failures and/or health checks. Don't get bitten by the nobody-noticed-disks-were-dead bug. After configuring email alerts, assume they'll never work and make sure someone is checking the status of the machine at least twice per week. Nothing crazy, but you want to know if your disks are about to fail.\n\n* Once again: backups. Preferably at least one copy offline and inaccessible to the network. I still have customers getting their file storage encrypted by ransomware because people can't resist clicking on \"why did you send us this invoice?\" emails.
