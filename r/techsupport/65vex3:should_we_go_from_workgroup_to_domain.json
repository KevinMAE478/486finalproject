You want to ensure each machine is using the same workgroup name, like OFFICE or BLAHBLAHBLAH. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter what it is as long as each machine is using the same exact one. On top of that, any machine that being accessed MUST be powered on and connected to the network in order to be accessed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, if two machines are on the same network, have file and printer sharing enabled, and are on the same subnet, there really isn&amp;#39;t a reason you shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to make them communicate. Try using both the hostname of the machines as well as the IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "techsupport", "name": "t1_dgdkypo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469962.0, "created_utc": 1492441162.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vex3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vex3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vex3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qioo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vex3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgef8iq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "salamander_gus", "parent_id": "t1_dgecrq0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/techsupport", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sorry.
