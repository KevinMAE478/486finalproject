The reported findings are below.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Update 1:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So.. here&amp;#39;s some more info for you guys. Some of it is possibly relevant background info, but I found out some things today:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The issue is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; caused by any USB devices (except, possibly, my mouse because I can&amp;#39;t figure out how to test without it).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Running FurMark with &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; the GPU took about ten minutes before it crashed. Temp was 73-74C, fan was at around 58% speed, power was around 88-89% (it never seemed to hit 90% or higher).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Running FurMark with the GPU &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; CPU stressed caused a crash in.. maybe 5-6 minutes? Again, the GPU&amp;#39;s stats were about the same as above. Unsure of the CPU&amp;#39;s as I wasn&amp;#39;t monitoring them, but I&amp;#39;ll do another test to at least find its running temp at the time of a crash.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Previously, if I were to stream Overwatch, I would crash within 20 minutes. Once I moved my OW install to my internal HDD and unplugged my external, I was able to stream for around 3 hours without crashing. Whether this is related or coincidental is something I haven&amp;#39;t been able to figure out yet; however, if the external were drawing enough power, it seems reasonable that the issue might indeed be a lemon of a PSU I was sent. The way things seem now, the more components/peripherals I have powered up, the faster I crash.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next, I&amp;#39;ll be testing things more specifically related to the PSU. I&amp;#39;ll try switching outlets, as well as removing the power strip entirely and using an outlet directly. Expect results soon.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Update 2:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After a handful more GPU/CPU stress tests of varying configurations, I think I can rule out the CPU as the issue. I ran it at 100% for half an hour with no ill effects whatsoever. Tested the GPU alone several times and crashed within 10 minutes every time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Taking past tests and results into consideration, I&amp;#39;m leaning much more towards the PSU now, as the crashing seems to take longer the less power my system is using (when there are minimal USB devices plugged in, for example).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I also tested another outlet with no success. I&amp;#39;m inclined to believe it isn&amp;#39;t the house&amp;#39;s wiring, but I still haven&amp;#39;t completely ruled it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve ordered a new PSU and I&amp;#39;ll be returning this one. The new unit is a Corsair CX750M and is due to arrive on Saturday. Until then, I&amp;#39;m either going to put a hold on further testing or test some simple things. That said, I&amp;#39;ll be checking the thread every few hours to answer any questions or suggestions, but for the time being, there won&amp;#39;t be any updates until Saturday. If the issue persists with the new PSU, I&amp;#39;ll be looking at the CPU and GPU next, as I&amp;#39;ll be comfortable convinced that it isn&amp;#39;t a power draw issue, which will allow me to downgrade to older components for the purpose of testing stability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once again, thank you all for your help and patience. Bringing my issue here lifted such an immense amount of stress off my shoulders. I&amp;#39;m certain I&amp;#39;ll get this figured out with your help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;New PSU just came in today and I&amp;#39;ve got it all installed. I double-checked all my cables to make sure everything is securely plugged in. Just to clarify, I&amp;#39;ve gone from the original 630W Raidmax PSU (which burned out), to a 600W EVGA (which, presumably, wasn&amp;#39;t powerful enough) to a 750W Corsair (which is the one in my system now). At some point tonight, I&amp;#39;ll be stressing the components the same way I did in my last tests, so I&amp;#39;ll update afterwards and let you all know how it goes. Here&amp;#39;s hoping!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Update 3:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Preliminary tests are looking good. FurMark stress tests (which previously resulted in a crash within 10 minutes) ran for about 15 minutes without issue. For the sake of my system&amp;#39;s health, I&amp;#39;m not running the system at 100% like this for longer than that, especially considering that this new PSU seems to make my system hotter overall. I won&amp;#39;t hit concerning temps doing anything except running at 100% for extended periods, though, so my cooling situation isn&amp;#39;t a major concern.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From here on out, I&amp;#39;m going to go forward with the perhaps naive faith that my problem has been fixed. I&amp;#39;ll know for sure after I spend an entire day streaming MEA or something, as that&amp;#39;s the most accurate &amp;#39;real world&amp;#39; test I can run to determine my system&amp;#39;s stability. I&amp;#39;ll be doing that probably later tonight. If all goes well, I&amp;#39;ll be summarizing the problem, its solution, and marking this thread as solved. As usual, thank you all for your help.
