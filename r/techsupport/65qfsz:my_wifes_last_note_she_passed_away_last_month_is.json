I am hugely sympathetic here.\n\nI am gonna use 2 different scenerios.  The first scenerio I am not gonna spell out.  You will need a bit of help.  It is incredibly doable.  If Harrisburg PA is anywhere near you then PM me, I would be happy to do the work for you.  (I wouldn't charge you, I lost my Father a few years ago, you hit a soft spot).\n\nAnyways, get a buddy that is comfortable doing tech support of any kind.  If you have a friend that has a kid that is into 'PC GAMING' - this might be within the kids skillset.\n\nYou want to do this:\n\nFree version:  You can do ALL OF THIS YOURSELF.  None of it is very hard.\n\nYou will need to:\n\nA) extract the hard drive and place into an external enclosure.\n\nB) plug it into a USB drive into an external computer (laptop or such) \n\nC) utilize backup software (linux has a lot of free tools for this, I am partial to Acronis) create the image.\n\nD) Browse the image for the note.\n\nE)  Save the note externally.  Email is kind of nice for this.  If you have a GMAIL account it will sit on Googles server by default - you actually have to delete to make it go away.\n\nF) Bribe individual appropriately.  Us adults are suckers for Pizza and beer.  A teenager will appreciate you putting money into his STEAM account so he can buy a video game.\n\n--------------\n\nOther solution, gonna cost you a bit of money\n\nI got two solutions, the first one is assuming you are willing to drop some money to fix the problem, the second is assuming you are a bit cash poor at the moment.\n\nFirst solution, gonna cost a bit:\n\nFind a local ma and pa computer repair shop.  Do NOT go to Best Buy, Do NOT go to Office Depot or Staples.  You want a place where they are gonna do everything on site, you want a place where the employees have common sense, training and some lee way on how they do things.\n\nAlso, do NOT ship to Dell.\n\nWalk in, put the laptop on the counter and tell them you want the following:  You need the hard drive removed, you want an image taken of the hard drive and you need two physical copies of that image on two different pieces of media.  (Media in this case being a USB drive or a DVD or CD set.  YOU PREFER THE USB DRIVE.  In any case, 2 separate copies.  2 separate USB drives.  This is critical).  Instruct the person that you know there are boot problems.  You are aware.  At the moment, you are instructing them to not do anything that could be 'destructive' to the data on the drive, they are to make no attempt to fix the boot issue.  Extract the drive, create the media.\n\nI personaly would not (yet) tell the person why.  What I am trying to accomplish is a slow and steady route where they are relegated into simple steps they are unlikely to fuck up.  Getting in a talk of the end game introduces the possibility of shit getting all fucked up.  Slow and steady.\n\nI advise you ask to see the ticket with your own eyes so you can confirm it says 'nondestructive', '2 sets of the disk image on 2 different pieces of media' and 'extract hard drive' on it.\n\nCome back and pick up.  Ensure you are happy, you should have a laptop, a hard drive and 2 USB keys.  Give the guy back the laptop and one of the images.  You keep the hard drive and the other image.\n\nNow you tell them what you have told us.  Ask for a new hard drive, ask them to do a restore from the image and fix the boot.  Ask them if they could locate the note and save it for you - maybe in an email.\n\nWhat you have done (by following my advice) is ensured yourself that in a worst case scenerio (sorry, everything is lost) you still have the original drive and a copy of the image.  \n\n--------------\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay.  I am hugely sympathetic here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am gonna use 2 different scenerios.  The first scenerio I am not gonna spell out.  You will need a bit of help.  It is incredibly doable.  If Harrisburg PA is anywhere near you then PM me, I would be happy to do the work for you.  (I wouldn&amp;#39;t charge you, I lost my Father a few years ago, you hit a soft spot).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, get a buddy that is comfortable doing tech support of any kind.  If you have a friend that has a kid that is into &amp;#39;PC GAMING&amp;#39; - this might be within the kids skillset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want to do this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Free version:  You can do ALL OF THIS YOURSELF.  None of it is very hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will need to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A) extract the hard drive and place into an external enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B) plug it into a USB drive into an external computer (laptop or such) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C) utilize backup software (linux has a lot of free tools for this, I am partial to Acronis) create the image.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;D) Browse the image for the note.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E)  Save the note externally.  Email is kind of nice for this.  If you have a GMAIL account it will sit on Googles server by default - you actually have to delete to make it go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;F) Bribe individual appropriately.  Us adults are suckers for Pizza and beer.  A teenager will appreciate you putting money into his STEAM account so he can buy a video game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other solution, gonna cost you a bit of money&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got two solutions, the first one is assuming you are willing to drop some money to fix the problem, the second is assuming you are a bit cash poor at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First solution, gonna cost a bit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find a local ma and pa computer repair shop.  Do NOT go to Best Buy, Do NOT go to Office Depot or Staples.  You want a place where they are gonna do everything on site, you want a place where the employees have common sense, training and some lee way on how they do things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, do NOT ship to Dell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walk in, put the laptop on the counter and tell them you want the following:  You need the hard drive removed, you want an image taken of the hard drive and you need two physical copies of that image on two different pieces of media.  (Media in this case being a USB drive or a DVD or CD set.  YOU PREFER THE USB DRIVE.  In any case, 2 separate copies.  2 separate USB drives.  This is critical).  Instruct the person that you know there are boot problems.  You are aware.

Slow and steady.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I advise you ask to see the ticket with your own eyes so you can confirm it says &amp;#39;nondestructive&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;2 sets of the disk image on 2 different pieces of media&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;extract hard drive&amp;#39; on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Come back and pick up.
