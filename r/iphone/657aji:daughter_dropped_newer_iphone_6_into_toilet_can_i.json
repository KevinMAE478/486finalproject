It's a well-known fact in the repair industry that the chances of \"putting it in rice\" successfully \"fixing\" a waterlogged phone are slim to none, and that it's nothing more than an [ethnic joke of a meme](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=putting+it+in+rice+meme). Tell any reputable smartphone repairer that offers liquid damage repair services that you attempted a DIY rice repair, and they will either laugh at you or tell you that was useless. Even if it was just to \"minimize the damage\" on the way to the repair shop it wouldn't have done much.\n\nRice *may* be able to pull **moisture** (i.e. water suspended in air, which water resistant devices aren't designed to resist) out of the phone, but that's the least of your concerns with a waterlogged phone. Rice cannot draw **water** out of a phone, especially a water/dust resistant one. Think about it - the water needed external pressure to get into the phone. You'll at least need the same amount of pressure to get it out, which is something rice can't do.\n\nWhat \"putting it in rice\" **does** do is make you *think* it works, postpones proper treatment (e.g. disconnecting the battery, using an ultrasonic cleaner, removing EMI shields and scrubbing the board with isopropanol, reflowing chips etc.) AND encourages corrosion by trapping the water/moisture inside an airtight container with the phone.\n\nThe rice myth arose from photographers wanting to keep their camera gear from getting moisture/condensation/mold damaged when travelling to humid tropical locations. They'd keep their gear inside airtight containers/bags accompanied by a desiccant (e.g. uncooked rice or silica gel), preventing moisture damage *before* it happens, not *after*. How that became an old wives' tale of a homeopathic smartphone water damage remedy is beyond me.\n\nIt goes without saying that the rice trick doesn't work most of the time. But in any cases that \"putting it in rice\" did work, what's not to say that it could have worked even without putting it in rice and just letting it dry out on its own?\n\nEdit: the underlying reason why water damage kills a phone (and ultimately why the rice trick doesn't work) is because of the resulting corrosion or presence of impurities in the water that shorts out/fries parts of the logic board. So if you were to flush the board with distilled water (as it has no impurities and doesn't conduct electricity) before any corrosion or shorts occur, it would actually be more effective than the rice trick. But isopropanol is commonly used because it evaporates quickly.", "edited": 1492176316.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s even funnier is that you&amp;#39;re wrong to think that &lt;a href=\"/u/danielzuyevbmwzs\"&gt;/u/danielzuyevbmwzs&lt;/a&gt; is wrong (although I agree that they do need to chill a bit). It&amp;#39;s a well-known fact in the repair industry that the chances of &amp;quot;putting it in rice&amp;quot; successfully &amp;quot;fixing&amp;quot; a waterlogged phone are slim to none, and that it&amp;#39;s nothing more than an &lt;a href=\"http://lmgtfy.com/?q=putting+it+in+rice+meme\"&gt;ethnic joke of a meme&lt;/a&gt;. Tell any reputable smartphone repairer that offers liquid damage repair services that you attempted a DIY rice repair, and they will either laugh at you or tell you that was useless. Even if it was just to &amp;quot;minimize the damage&amp;quot; on the way to the repair shop it wouldn&amp;#39;t have done much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rice &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be able to pull &lt;strong&gt;moisture&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. water suspended in air, which water resistant devices aren&amp;#39;t designed to resist) out of the phone, but that&amp;#39;s the least of your concerns with a waterlogged phone. Rice cannot draw &lt;strong&gt;water&lt;/strong&gt; out of a phone, especially a water/dust resistant one. Think about it - the water needed external pressure to get into the phone. You&amp;#39;ll at least need the same amount of pressure to get it out, which is something rice can&amp;#39;t do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What &amp;quot;putting it in rice&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; do is make you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; it works, postpones proper treatment (e.g. disconnecting the battery, using an ultrasonic cleaner, removing EMI shields and scrubbing the board with isopropanol, reflowing chips etc.) AND encourages corrosion by trapping the water/moisture inside an airtight container with the phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rice myth arose from photographers wanting to keep their camera gear from getting moisture/condensation/mold damaged when travelling to humid tropical locations. They&amp;#39;d keep their gear inside airtight containers/bags accompanied by a desiccant (e.g. uncooked rice or silica gel), preventing moisture damage &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; it happens, not &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt;. How that became an old wives&amp;#39; tale of a homeopathic smartphone water damage remedy is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that the rice trick doesn&amp;#39;t work most of the time. But in any cases that &amp;quot;putting it in rice&amp;quot; did work, what&amp;#39;s not to say that it could have worked even without putting it in rice and just letting it dry out on its own?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: the underlying reason why water damage kills a phone (and ultimately why the rice trick doesn&amp;#39;t work) is because of the resulting corrosion or presence of impurities in the water that shorts out/fries parts of the logic board.
