I immediately took the phone out of the water, shook it vigorously to get some the water out of the ports and stop it from settling on internal components. the phone had started to develop stripes down the middle of the screen and began turning red and flickering. I quickly turned it off wrapped it in a few layers of paper towel and let it sit for a 3mins or so to dry off the exterior. I then took it out of its paper towel tomb and filled a Mcdonalds cup to to top with rice and left the phone inside for around 13hours. When i took the phone out after 13hrs and attempted to turn it on, a red screen came up...it flickered...and died :&amp;#39;) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then decided to open up the phone as all seemed lost. So i used a scalpel blade which i had in the basement to unscrew the two little screws at the bottom of the phone (on either side of the charging ports) and used a small suction cup (from my shower sponge) and a knife to carefully remove the screen and the middle layer, i&amp;#39;m no expert with iphones so i don&amp;#39;t know what that middle layer between where the screen is and the battery housing is but yeah, that bit came off aswell (be very careful not to cut or damage the wires connected to the screen and home button if you do this, as you will 1000% break your phone). Then i used a q-tip to wipe away some of the excess water droplets inside the phone and on the main components till it was visibly dry. A hairdryer was the next weapon of choice as the phone would still not turn on. I used a hairdryer on its lowest setting for around 10mins just fanning it side to side so i didn&amp;#39;t heat up any components directly. After about 10mins i left the phone in its disassembled state for about 5mins before attempting to turn it on. And lo and behold, it turned on! no red screen, a few tiny tiny water droplets behind the screen (nothing major) and no flickering. I plugged it into my macbook and made sure to backup all my important info onto my macbook just in case this was only temporary, but the phone has been on and fine for around 3 days now. Battery life has been somewhat affected but other than that it is fine :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Note: This worked for me in MY situation and i am just sharing my experience with you guys so you have a few more things to try after the rice trick and any other home remedies we have heard to fix your wet iphone :)\n\nOk so i dropped my iphone 5s in a sink full of water while listening to music, it was submerged for a second or so.
