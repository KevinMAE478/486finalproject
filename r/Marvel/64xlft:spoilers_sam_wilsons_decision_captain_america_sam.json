It's really stupid, but we \"accept\" it for two reasons: (1) it's an artifact of a simpler time. Superman has been flying with no logical explanation of his propulsion since the 1940s. I'm 39 years old and Supes has been flying like this for almost twice as long as I've been alive. What am I gonna do? But (2) we also accept Superman's flight because it looks cool and it fits in with the rest of his power set. If Superman was just super-strong and super-fast with X-ray vision, then he wouldn't be the OP Superman we all know and love. He needs heat vision, cold breath and flight.\n\nI didn't like Sam Wilson as Cap because it's was 2015 and I expected better of Marvel. When Steve Rodgers died in 2006 after the first Civil War event, they explained that they tried giving Cap's shield to 10 different highly trained SHIELD agents but none of them could handle it. First they gave the shield to Hawkeye. He could handle it because he's the world's greatest marksman, a circus trained acrobat and a master swordsman. Then they gave it to Bucky, a KGB-trained assassin, master marksman, trained in acrobatics with a super strong cybernetic arm. OK, that's the minimum standard for handling the shield: peak physical conditioning, acrobatics and high level marksmanship. \n\nSam is a great superhero as Falcon, but given this background on Cap's shield in 2006, there's no explanation for why Sam can handle the shield in 2017. Sam is not superhuman. He's not an acrobat on the level of Hawkeye or Bucky. He's never shown to be a marksman on the level of Bucky, let alone Hawkeye. He's a former soldier in a combat wing suit who can talk to birds. But not only does Sam handle Cap's shield, he does it while flying ... which makes very little sense and would be 1000x more difficult than anything Steve Rodgers or Bucky ever did. On top of all that, I just don't think it looks good to be holding a round shield on top a winged arm. It looks very busy, like Rob Liefeld drawing a pouch on top of another pouch on Cable's costume busy. And it doesn't really add much to his existing power set. Why throw a shield when you can already shoot energy bolts from your wing suit?That's what annoys me.\n\nWhat makes it more annoying for me is that Eli Bradley would have been a much better choice for a younger, black Captain America. He's got the same Super-Soldier formula in his blood as Steve Rodgers. He already fought using a triangular shield in Young Avengers. He doesn't fly, making the physics more palatable. Cap's shield would actually add to his arsenal. Plus, Eli has been on the sidelines since The Children's crusade in 2012. If you pull Eli off the bench, you've got a \"new\" black superhero in the same age bracket as Kate Bishop (Hawkeye), Laura Kinney (Wolverine), Ms Marvel (Kamala Khan), Hulk (Amadeus Cho), Spider-Man (Miles Morales), Iron Heart (Riri Williams), Nova (Sam Alexander) and the rest of the young Marvel heroes. Plus you get to keep Sam in the Falcon suit to build on his popularity from the movies. There's no reason Falcon couldn't have a solo series. It's a no brainer to me.\n\nAnd like I said, there are other black heroes that would be better than Sam too. I think you could do a cool story with Isaiah Bradley (Eli's grandfather) too. Maybe a young Isaiah time travels to the present era. Maybe the elderly version of Isaiah gets rejuvenated to his younger self because ... comics. They've now got a time traveling young adult version of baby Danielle Cage on the US Avengers. She could have taken over as Captain America.
