Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sanji has unfortunately fallen victim of becoming a plot device. Sanji is still strong, we&amp;#39;ve seen this (both Zoro and Sanji one shot a Pacifista). But yet Zoro has received all the attention since the timeskip. And Sanji has been forced to sit on the sideline for why? To push the plot forward. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you think Oda just unwillingly threw an already injured Sanji right into fighting Vergo in Punk Hazard? No! He knew what he was doing and what he was trying to accomplish. He wanted to showcase Vergo&amp;#39;s strength and stall him. He wanted to show that Vergo probably is the strongest out of Doffy&amp;#39;s crew. Plus Sanji was even putting more hits on Vergo than vice versa. Where people see he takes an L in that fight I don&amp;#39;t understand. It was clearly stated by Sanji himself that he was injured because of Nami in his body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Doffy situation, news flash; SANJI KNEW HE COULDNT BEAT DOFLAMINGO. Sanji wasn&amp;#39;t going to fight him to beat him, Sanji reacted because he knew it was his responsibility as one of the Monster Trio to protect his weaker crewmates (remember his speech to Usopp in Ennies Lobby? &amp;quot;The things you can&amp;#39;t do, I&amp;#39;ll do them for you&amp;quot;). So the Doflamingo situation really doesn&amp;#39;t even stand out in my mind as he was just trying to stall him which he did successfully even receiving compliments from the Heavenly Demon himself. Zoro and Luffy BOTH would not be able to beat Doflamingo 1v1 at that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now of course we hit chapter 862 and the Katakuri and Sanji situation. People are undermining Sanji once again. I&amp;#39;ve seen it from &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s just a bullet wow&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Zoro would do the same&amp;quot; NO. Sanji is a specialist of Observation, Zoro: Armament. What Sanji did was impressive, what Sanji did should not be undermined at all.

No. I&amp;#39;m just stating that Sanji had an amazing feat and we should respect the character. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sanji is making his comeback (although he never really fell from grace) and we will see him in a new light after this arc. Remember the head of all the news organizations in the world is at the tea party, he will most likely inform either the Marines or the world about the events at the Tea Party and all of the Straw Hats (Luffy and Sanji, hopefully Brook too) bounties who participated will rise (to catch up with the Dressrosa crew). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for hearing me ramble on about a fictitious character we all love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Sanji is still strong, respect the goddamn character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: don&amp;#39;t understand how I am being downvoted for analyzing a piece of fiction and giving my opinion. \nEdit #2: correction of using the word everyone &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE SPOILERS TAGS I AM ON MOBILE SO SOMEONE PLEASE HELP. \n\nWith that out of the way, it's seriously time to stop the Sanji hate.
