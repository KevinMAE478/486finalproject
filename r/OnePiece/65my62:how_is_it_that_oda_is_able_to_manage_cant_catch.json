It's essentially impossible to predict because as soon as it becomes predictable, some kind of new plot element is introduced that would have made it impossible to predict its outcome either way. (like in this chapter its Big Moms plan to murder the Vinsmokes, Puddings third eye and being evil, Bege wanting to assassinate Big Mom on the day of the wedding, and so forth). We just don't see where he's coming from, and one can assume he knows exactly how things will go and plans ahead before the arc even begins in order to make things structured despite the huge amount of plot threads.
