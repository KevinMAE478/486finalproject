This guy is strong af, his fight with Zoro was in my opinion one of the best and closest fights in the series, and I honestly believe him to be around the same level as Zoro post-timeskip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were around the same strength level at Alabasta, and he just seems like the kind of the guy to have the same kind of determination and work-ethic as Zoro, I mean, he was taking Impel Down like a champ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the shit that he does with his devil fruit is cool af, like the techniques where he slashes with enough force to cut stuff behind his target, which I feel is like his unique style as a swordsman, the thing that differentiates him from all the other swordsman. His ice-skate technique is also really cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, his attack names are great, i.e. Spider, Sparkling Daisy, Spiral Hollow and Atomic Spurt, as when they are read in Japanese they all include the word &amp;#39;Supa&amp;#39; as in &amp;#39;Supa Supa no mi&amp;#39;.
