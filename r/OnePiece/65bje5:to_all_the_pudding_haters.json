I had a thought about the \"sudden reversal\" you mentioned and how people are talking \"bullshit\" when they mention it. I think we can all agree on what \"sudden\" means but \"reversal\" in this case is more tricky. Reversal is defined by Merriam-Webster as an \"act of reversing\" which can be explained as something that is \"opposite or contrary to a previous or normal condition\".\n\nSo, in order for there to be a reversal of something there needs to be something to reverse, whether that is a personality trait or something else. Pudding's character development in the story did in fact experience a reversal: From a rather innocent and helpful person to someone who is willing to lie and hurt others.

Learning about her past really isn't a reversal of character since it is not reversing anything. We, according to my memory, don't really know a lot of Pudding's past. Showing her past is more about a character **reveal** rather than a character **reversal**. However, her breaking down into tears in front of the accepting eyes of Sanji is another matter.\n\nSince the first character reversal Pudding went through revealed her previous actions as a conscious deception, the best guess we have of her true character is the meaner more malicious version of her, which, you could argue, is opposite to someone who is sensitive and possibly heart-broken, as she appeared to be like after Sanji complimented her looks. I don't think the two are mutually exclusive but it is certainly a new and sudden aspect to her character, provided her reaction was true and not another deception. So in this sense I can agree with someone saying the latest episode was a character reversal for Pudding. I certainly don't think someone saying it is talking \"bullshit\".

We can guess how the ride's gonna go, but we aren't the designers, just the riders.\n\nI'd rather trust Oda's design of the ride than get upset over it, especially when it comes to things that aren't fully clear to us yet. He's shown many times over the past couple decades that he knows how to develop character motivations and personalities and is especially fond of what English and Writing majors would call the \"iceberg technique\" where a character or even a more basic element of a story starts out fairly simple, and as you go along as the reader you find that there's much more depth behind those characters and elements than you were first shown as things get revealed that can in some cases completely change the way the reader sees said characters or other story elements.\n\nAnother thing Oda seems to have a fondness for is character growth, a very important thing for a writer to consider as they're building characters and worlds. When characters are flat and things are black and white with no grey area in between a story can get monotonous and boring. Oda loves to take his characters and have their personalities, motivations and ways of thinking grow and change as their parts in the story unfold.\n\nWith things like this in mind, I think his decision to give Pudding that grey area and more depth makes sense.

All we've seen is a glimpse into her past after Sanji did something she didn't expect that shocked her enough that she hesitated and was brought to her knees.\n\nI think there's still some unpredictability to Pudding as a character after the last chapter, personally. This whole time she's been a wild card, and I'll be interested to see what she does when she gets her composure back amidst the chaos that's about to unfold. She still could point the gun at Sanji again for a number of reasons, whether it's fear of what Big Mom will do if she doesn't or even anger driven by suspicion of Sanji's motives and disbelief in his compliment that shocked her into that hesitation. Either way, she's very interesting as a character, especially after the last chapter, and that's something I really appreciate as someone who loves to write and is fascinated by the different techniques and styles writers use. Oda's had a very unique voice as a writer in OP, and he always seems to have some kind of big surprise up his sleeve that nobody sees coming, and that's a lot of what keeps me invested in this story he's so painstakingly built over the years.\n\nWell, I just felt like speaking my bit.

All we&amp;#39;ve seen is a glimpse into her past after Sanji did something she didn&amp;#39;t expect that shocked her enough that she hesitated and was brought to her knees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#39;s still some unpredictability to Pudding as a character after the last chapter, personally. This whole time she&amp;#39;s been a wild card, and I&amp;#39;ll be interested to see what she does when she gets her composure back amidst the chaos that&amp;#39;s about to unfold. She still could point the gun at Sanji again for a number of reasons, whether it&amp;#39;s fear of what Big Mom will do if she doesn&amp;#39;t or even anger driven by suspicion of Sanji&amp;#39;s motives and disbelief in his compliment that shocked her into that hesitation. Either way, she&amp;#39;s very interesting as a character, especially after the last chapter, and that&amp;#39;s something I really appreciate as someone who loves to write and is fascinated by the different techniques and styles writers use. Oda&amp;#39;s had a very unique voice as a writer in OP, and he always seems to have some kind of big surprise up his sleeve that nobody sees coming, and that&amp;#39;s a lot of what keeps me invested in this story he&amp;#39;s so painstakingly built over the years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I just felt like speaking my bit.
