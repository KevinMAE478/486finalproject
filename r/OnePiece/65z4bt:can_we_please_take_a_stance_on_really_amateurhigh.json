Even just banning &amp;quot;sequel&amp;quot; posts would be fine, but I have a couple further suggestions that might improve things for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, we see a lot of traced art and a lot of stuff that... well, middle school notebook doodles sometimes have higher standards of quality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be impossible to police the quality of this art via removal, so instead I have a couple simple solutions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a stickied post active every week or month.
