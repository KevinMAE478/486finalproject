Netflix got the streaming deal long after the series was available on Crunchyroll, they could have easily said, &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; if they really cared. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Netflix just has greater marketshare overall than either Crunchyroll or Funimation have so I don&amp;#39;t think they care if Funimation has a service. They have popular live action and western cartoons, while CR and Funi have a more limited market.
