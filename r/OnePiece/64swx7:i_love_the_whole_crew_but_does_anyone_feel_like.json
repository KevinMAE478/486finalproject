Destined to be a pirate, he made his &amp;quot;Dream Ship&amp;#39;&amp;#39; for the Straw Hats. Knowingly, Iceburg told Franky it wouldn&amp;#39;t be his dream ship until he brought it to the end of the world. Tied to W7 to what he thought was a debt to Tom, Franky had to be forced to join the crew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brook: An ancient pirate In the deep dark depths of despair trapped in the Florian Triangle. His previous crew knew Laboon and left him with Crocus when they couldn&amp;#39;t risk endangering him in the Grand Line. Having died along his crewmates years ago, he&amp;#39;s left as nothing but a walking skeleton revived by his DF. After an encounter with a Warlord he lost his shadow, keeping him permanently trapped in the triangle until he could retrieve it. Here comes Luffy, giving Brook a way to get back to Moria and his soul. He hits it off with Luffy at least, they get along really well from the start. The crew saves Brook, who happens to be the musician Luffy has always been looking for. After almost dying together in order to escape the clutches of Moria and get their own souls back, this group has bonded with Brook. Leading him out of the Florian Triangle, he has been given a knew life and he&amp;#39;s able to live it in the sun, with a crew as fun as his old one. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OnePiece", "name": "t1_dg4z2z1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491975722.0, "created_utc": 1491946922.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfz5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64swx7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfz5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64swx7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg587d2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "i_am_average_AMA", "parent_id": "t1_dg4t5wg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OnePiece", "controversiality": 0, "body": "To be fair, Jinbei already has a few arcs' worth of history, with Luffy if not the entire SH crew.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Jinbei already has a few arcs&amp;#39; worth of history, with Luffy if not the entire SH crew.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OnePiece", "name": "t1_dg587d2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491987679.0, "created_utc": 1491958879.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4t5wg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Blaricus", "parent_id": "t3_64swx7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OnePiece", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think so tbh, how are you going to feel when Jinbei joins then since they're so far in their journey?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think so tbh, how are you going to feel when Jinbei joins then since they&amp;#39;re so far in their journey?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OnePiece", "name": "t1_dg4t5wg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491968936.0, "created_utc": 1491940136.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfz5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64swx7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfz5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64swx7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfz5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64swx7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4qweh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 24, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JakalDX", "parent_id": "t1_dg4qjkp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OnePiece", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dunno what to tell you then.
