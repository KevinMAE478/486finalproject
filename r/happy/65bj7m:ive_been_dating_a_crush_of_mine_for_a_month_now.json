But that&amp;#39;s foolish, if it works out that stage of acceptance is 30 years long, but you may only get months of the stage of gorgeous exciting mystery, of getting to know eachother and making yourself vulnerable and feeling existentially relieved with each passing day the relationship&amp;#39;s still working. You&amp;#39;ll look back on those months as one of your great life experiences period if this is the girl you&amp;#39;re meant to be with, so treat them as such, try and remember every detail, don&amp;#39;t be in your head fantasizing about the future and trying to figure out how to get through them and tear off the vulnerability bandaid. Accept the uncertainty and try and really stop and taste the feelings you&amp;#39;re feeling right now, really stop and pay attention to what it feels like to be falling in love with her, take your time with it, your future selves will thank you for the memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does that make sense? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "happy", "name": "t1_dga3q7e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492249507.0, "created_utc": 1492220707.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bj7m", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9x53q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kianpr180", "parent_id": "t1_dg9cdpo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/happy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think what he means is that given the difference, you being a geek and her being a model, y'all might need some time getting used to each other so don't get ahead of yourself and start saying crazy stuff\n\nIm speaking from experience, I'm also a geek, but your case could be different so idk anyways good luck!!!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think what he means is that given the difference, you being a geek and her being a model, y&amp;#39;all might need some time getting used to each other so don&amp;#39;t get ahead of yourself and start saying crazy stuff&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im speaking from experience, I&amp;#39;m also a geek, but your case could be different so idk anyways good luck!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "happy", "name": "t1_dg9x53q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492240666.0, "created_utc": 1492211866.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9cdpo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mugen_is_here", "parent_id": "t1_dg94ruy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/happy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What do you mean by don't fall too fast?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you mean by don&amp;#39;t fall too fast?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "happy", "name": "t1_dg9cdpo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492215359.0, "created_utc": 1492186559.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg94ruy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KH10304", "parent_id": "t3_65bj7m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/happy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nice!
