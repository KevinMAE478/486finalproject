Here is what you need to know to win CBs when you get them.\n\n1) Talk to your processor/sales person/account manager for them, make sure you have a decent plan with minimum fees for Chargebacks (because a lot of times, even if you win a CB, there will be a 5-25$ fee for each one that is non-refundable, and it costs more if you want to take it to arbitration, etc.)\n\n2) Make sure you have your refund policy CLEARLY STATED in plain English on the receipt. You can lose a Chargeback just for not having it be more than 1/4th of an inch underneath the signature line on a printed copy of it. A link to a Terms and Conditions is not actually legally binding.\n\n3) Every time you charge a customer you need an authorization from a CC processor. Even if you adjust a charge for 1$ because it was entered wrong, you can technically lose a CB for this.\n\n4) ALWAYS require an AVS/CVV code if doing business online, and get verification for it on the receipt with the authorization code. (Not doing this can make you automatically lose a CB too).\n\n5) Get fraud insurance. Some people will start a CB just to cost you money, some people do counterfeit cc's. This can help cover that. Some people will counterfeit cards or hack paypal accounts and there is literally no way to win those if the cardholder/account holder signs an affidavit to the effect that they did not authorize that charge. You can go back and forth with this process for over two years and statistically less than .03% of businesses win the CB if goes into arbitration.\n\n6) Most CC processors hate Stripe because they seldom play well with even a digital POS, and it has kind of a history of double charging customers if there is packet loss during a transaction and the customer refreshes the site and causes chargebacks.\n\n7) Having a NO REFUNDS policy is actually against the rules for Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and Amex and does not save you from a chargeback. I talk to about half a dozen people a week in any scale  from mom and pop stores to fortune 500 companies and this doesn't ever work in their favor as far as CB's go.\n\n8) Document EVERYTHING. Send documentation to the customer outlying your terms and conditions with their purchase. Respond on time. Respond FAST.

Even if you refund the customer, make sure you respond with the paperwork showing the refund. Even if the customer tells you they will ask to have the CB halted or stop it, the bank can go on with it without the customer's knowledge and still win and take the money themselves. Always respond. If you don't respond, you will lose.\n\n10) If someone is scamming you or uses a counterfeit card, etc... inform the police and your legal representation. The fraud insurance you need will require that, and sometimes you will only win a CB for having a police report, and if it is a regular customer or non-scammer just trying to get their money back, this can force them to drop the CB since their affidavit becomes perjury and fraud if they lose the case in court.\n\nEDITED for grammar and added #10", "edited": 1492055902.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work for a credit card processor.

And it's a good idea. It's probably the number one thing you can do to prevent charge backs... just give them their money back through a refund. Although you'll still have some folks doing a charge back just cause.\n\nMore info on refunds: https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/refunds-100-money-back-guarantee/\n\nTL;DR: (1) Do it. (2) Really ask no questions and just reply with \"Your refund has been processed.\" and move on to helping real customers. (3) If your refund rate is &lt; 10%, you can probably increase prices. i.e. your prices are so low people don't care enough to get a refund.\n\nAnother thing you can do are offer one time payments as an option if you only offer recurring payments. So offer $x/year and $x, expiring in one year. Many people will cancel/refund/chargeback just to get out of the recurring part of things if it's not optional on your site.\n\nIn general, try to organize your business so you can absorb the scammers vs avoid them. It's going to happen. Just be glad your product is digital with little incremental cost to you. Make paying you the easiest way for non-scammers to get your stuff.\n\nEdit: Another tip, make sure you keep enough balance in your PayPal account to cover refunds and disputes.

And it&amp;#39;s a good idea. It&amp;#39;s probably the number one thing you can do to prevent charge backs... just give them their money back through a refund. Although you&amp;#39;ll still have some folks doing a charge back just cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More info on refunds: &lt;a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/refunds-100-money-back-guarantee/\"&gt;https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/refunds-100-money-back-guarantee/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: (1) Do it. (2) Really ask no questions and just reply with &amp;quot;Your refund has been processed.&amp;quot; and move on to helping real customers. (3) If your refund rate is &amp;lt; 10%, you can probably increase prices. i.e. your prices are so low people don&amp;#39;t care enough to get a refund.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing you can do are offer one time payments as an option if you only offer recurring payments. So offer $x/year and $x, expiring in one year. Many people will cancel/refund/chargeback just to get out of the recurring part of things if it&amp;#39;s not optional on your site.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, try to organize your business so you can absorb the scammers vs avoid them. It&amp;#39;s going to happen. Just be glad your product is digital with little incremental cost to you. Make paying you the easiest way for non-scammers to get your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Another tip, make sure you keep enough balance in your PayPal account to cover refunds and disputes. If your PayPal balance goes negative, I believe you&amp;#39;re more likely for them to pause your account or add withdrawal limits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "name": "t1_dg6wno0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492075088.0, "created_utc": 1492046288.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65274v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65274v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65274v", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6wnpy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pokersolo", "parent_id": "t1_dg6wevs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No, if the customer wants their money back cause they aren't happy just give it to them, otherwise they go on forums and talk trash about your website.
