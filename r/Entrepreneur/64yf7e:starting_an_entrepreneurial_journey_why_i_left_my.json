Leaving the security of a monthly paycheck is a daunting thought, so I want to clear my head a bit and explain why I believe this is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are on the fence about starting something new, I hope this post will serve you well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Finding joy&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m never more happy than when I\u2019m writing code. It\u2019s my creative outlet. I may not be able to draw a picture or write a song but I can use my creative skills to solve difficult problems with elegant code. Programming is my form of art, my way of creating things that didn\u2019t exist before. Coding is my job and my hobby; there\u2019s no greater gift in life than to wake up in the morning and being truly happy to go to work, doing what you love. I felt that joy for over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately \u2013\u00a0or perhaps quite fortunately \u2013\u00a0my current job stopped providing that wonderful feeling. Without it, work became a dreadful experience. Without that joy, I no longer felt able to express my creativity like I did before. I wanted that feeling back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had two choices: either find another job or try starting my own project. I had to ask myself which one would bring the most joy back into my daily professional life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Deciding to go my own\u00a0route&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent a few weeks reflecting on my career as a software developer. I wanted to explore the moments that brought me not only the most joy but also a sense of accomplishment, a feeling of doing the right thing. Almost all of those moments had the same thing in common: they were times where I taught other people the beauty of programming, many of whom work a developers today. I\u2019ve also coached junior developers in several of my previous jobs, which I always enjoyed doing. Recently I even wrote a book about the basics of programming titled &lt;a href=\"https://leanpub.com/foundationalprog\"&gt;Foundational Programming&lt;/a&gt;, which has been selling well and getting positive reviews.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, my passion is not only in building software but also in teaching others how to do it. This is something I was able to do in previous jobs, but to a limited extent. If I want to get the most joy out of my work, it needs to combine those two passions into a single project. That\u2019s not something I can expect if I were to look for another day job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to choose between a steady paycheck and an uncertain yet personally fulfilling goal. Despite my fears and reservations \u2013\u00a0or perhaps &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; thwart them \u2013 I decided to try building my own thing, something that would make me happy, help others, and hopefully pay well enough to keep the lights on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My plan is to build a video-based learning course teaching full-stack web development, from the bare basics of HTML and CSS to advanced Python, Django, JavaScript and even skills for finding a job and being successful in a new career as a junior developer. My goal is to help people become employable web developers, even if they have absolutely no programming knowledge or experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See &lt;a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*GwSQRFQeHkDgCw8iyXrbKQ.png\"&gt;a picture of the learning path&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;m proposing to follow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The challenges ahead&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know there are a lot of challenges that I need to consider and overcome to make this work. Aside from leaving my job, I also just had my third baby. I\u2019ve got enough savings to pay the bills while I build and launch the initial lessons for the course. Still, I\u2019ll need the course to be profitable early to ensure that I can continue developing both the platform and the lessons themselves. I\u2019ll write a follow-up post to go over some ideas for my business model. For now, I\u2019ll say that I absolutely hate ads \u2013 a rant, perhaps, for another day! \u2013\u00a0so I\u2019m leaning toward a subscription model.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another hurdle I\u2019ll have to jump is the marketing; how do I let people know the course exists? This is something I have less experience with, so I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research and careful studying. I already have a few neat ideas for promoting the course without breaking the bank, so I\u2019ll make sure to write a follow-up on this topic too, once I\u2019m in the position to report on what worked and what didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quality is, of course, a major consideration for any project, and this is where I feel most confident. I\u2019ve got plenty of professional experience in web development as a self-taught developer, so I know which skills are important to learn and how to teach them to a large audience. I\u2019ve also got experience in hiring developers, so I know what job skills employers and recruiters look for when scheduling and conducting interviews, which I plan to teach as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Documenting the\u00a0journey&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m filled with an exciting mixture of anticipation and apprehension. I have a lot of cool ideas on how to build something that combines my two biggest passions into one (hopefully profitable) endeavor. Being my own boss is both an empowering and frightening concept.\u00a0I\u2019ve placed a lot of responsibility on myself to succeed or fail, with no one to blame but myself for either one. Yet the fear of failure doesn\u2019t outweigh the thrill of starting my own project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll be using this blog to document each stage of building my course, which I\u2019ve named Snakecasts (because Python, you see). Not only will this keep me accountable by sharing my progress, I also hope that it will serve as either an educational or inspirational tool for other budding entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d love to write more but I\u2019ve got work to do; it\u2019s time to turn on the mic and record a few lessons!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you are interested in learning full-stack web development, from beginner to employable, take a look at &lt;a href=\"http://snakecasts.com\"&gt;snakecasts.com&lt;/a&gt; to be notified when the course is released.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m happy to answer any question you may have and look forward to reading your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "# About leaving the corporate life to do my own\u00a0thing\n\n*This post was initially published on Medium.
