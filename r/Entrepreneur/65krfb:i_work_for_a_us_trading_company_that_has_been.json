A lot of the smaller companies I&amp;#39;ve worked with rush to get their items made in China before they really even have anything else in their business put in place. Unless you are sure there is demand for your project then hold off worrying about China.

A lot of people think their idea is the next million dollar thing.  Most factories don't have the time or resources to copy most things. For most new ideas, the marketing and sales of the product are more important, and nobody can take that part away from you. \n\nI don't know exactly what type of product you are talking about, and there will always be exceptions to any rule. But just because a product looks the same does not mean it is the same quality. I buy fake Adidas here in China that look great but fall apart within a couple of months. It can be difficult sometimes to reverse engineer products 100%, and if they are in the business of ripping off ideas, it is quite likely that they will cut some corners when it comes to quality and craftsmanship.\n\nYou also have to figure out who is stealing the idea. If the factory is just ripping you off directly then you did a poor job at sourcing your supplier. There are some trustworthy factories here that help people develop new products, but if the idea is really that great, there is nothing stopping someone from seeing the product on the Internet or actually buying one and then trying to copy or modify it slightly it to try and make a buck. If you did your job correctly, people will be able to tell a real product from a fake copy. You can't copy goodwill. \n\nYou can add something of a layer of protection by not sourcing everything all from one factory. Some people source all the components separately and then do the final assembly in the USA so they can at least advertise that they are \"Assembled in the USA.\" It really just depends on how complicated your product is. \n\nYour idea gives you a head start and jump on things. Hopefully you will have already shipped your products by the time someone gets their hand on a final version. It will take a counterfeiter a while to get their act together and come to market, but by that time you are way ahead. If you run your business correctly, you will be able to eek out your share in the market even if someone does rip you off. \n\nYou can get an NNN and China patent to try and protect yourself if you have the resources. But if something does get copied here then you have to spend the resources to fight. We did have a friend that had an electronics accessory that was doing pretty well. He had a patent in China, and when he was shopping in a mall  he saw copies of his goods available for sale. He was able to get the shop owner to take down the displays after having to go back a few times, but all the counterfeiters are going to do is set up shop at a new location. Who has the resources to check every single mall? In the end he just gave up because it wasn't really worth his time. He made what he needed to off the idea and ended up selling the company after a couple years. Think about all the junk out there. Most things come and go. Shit. Most ideas never even come to fruition. \n\nYou have to think about the market too. If you have a patent in your home country then at least you have protection against someone trying to sell the product there, but there is at least demand for the product there. A lot of the shit that people give me have almost no chance of being copied here in China because the copycats can't sell them in the USA and nobody in China wants to buy them.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does happen, but not at the rate people think.
