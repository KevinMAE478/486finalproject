I had graduated and found a pretty decent job in my field, done all the things you were supposed to do. But the working environment was horrible and I found myself miserable and doing exactly what I didn&amp;#39;t want to be doing with my life. So I moved in with my mom and started saving and planning for a trip overseas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a blast traveling and exploring life for 3 months, but savings were coming to a close and I would have to go home and figure out a source of income. Until, an acquaintance approached me about starting an import/export business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The deal was that he would fund things while I did most of the work. I couldn&amp;#39;t pass up the opportunity, especially since I&amp;#39;d been wanting to start something for a quite some time. So we committed to each other and founded our company. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #1&lt;/strong&gt;\nI went to work right away, drawing up a business plan, creating a budget, and so forth. I shared these with my partner who sort of just brushed them off. That sort of stuff is just way over his head, but I just sort of ignored it and thought I could figure it out. It&amp;#39;s turned out that at the time, he actually had a MUCH longer timeline for making this thing happen than I thought. I was ready to go, had a plan to launch in 3 months and everything. But he wasn&amp;#39;t, and we didn&amp;#39;t communicate this to each other. Therein lies mistake #1: not being communicative about how we saw this business unfolding. Unfortunately, it&amp;#39;s hard to communicate these things when you&amp;#39;re halfway across the world from each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It became more and more apparent that things were moving far too slowly. It wasn&amp;#39;t until 2 months later that we actually got our LLC established (the bank acct didn&amp;#39;t come until like 4 months after this). But I wasn&amp;#39;t giving up, I had faith in the idea and he had the funding (or so I thought).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After months of dicking around and way too much stress, we finally made it to the same place at the same time. He showed me his bank account, and it was like 10 times less than what I believed it to be. The budget I&amp;#39;d created was equal to the entire cash savings he had. I should have realized at this point that there was no way this was going to work, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to give up. Therein lies mistake #2: not being clear about what this business would cost, and depending on a financially irresponsible person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By this point, (5 months after we committed to starting this business) it should have been so apparent that this was not going to work. But I was afraid of failure and believed I could make this thing work even on a limited budget. My partner was there and we were finally working together, making progress. We sourced a bunch of awesome products and had a good team. But, he had to leave after only a month (2-3 month timeline for sourcing, building website, shipping etc.) leaving me on my own. I couldn&amp;#39;t get it all done on my own in time and had to return home, leaving the products behind because they were not yet import compliant. 9 months after we had started the business, we had no products on the way, an unfinished website, and no revenue. We&amp;#39;d sunk a good 20k between the two of us and had nothing really to show for it. Therein lies mistake #3: not accepting reality, and stupidly believing I could make a failing business work on my own. Also, sinking my own money into a business that was supposed to be fully funded by my partner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistake #4&lt;/strong&gt;\nAfter returning home and taking care of business (renewing my green card), I made it back to our products and started getting them ready and finishing all of the stuff we needed to do to sell them. The stress of not having money started eating away at me, and I fell into bad habits and was not as productive as I should have been. I set a deadline for myself, and in the stress of figuring it all out myself, took the easy route of shipping everything courier, because I just could not sort out air freight. I thought I did all the calculations, but in the stress and tension of the moment, I forgot an essential detail: dimensional weight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the products arrived, I was stoked. Even though we were way in the hole, we had solid products on a solid website with solid content: if we could even sell half we were on our way to at least breaking even and having a functioning business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then the bill came. The dimensional weight was 3x the actual weight, and the bill 3x what I calculated. That was it, nail in the coffin. Both me and my partner were broke and there was no digging out of the hole. Even if we sold everything and paid the bill, we&amp;#39;d be left with essentially nothing to reinvest, and as we were both broke, no way to put more money in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;\nIt became clear to me last night that the business was over. The stress of trying to figure out how to pay that damn bill while keeping everything running drove me to consider suicide, and that was a very clear signal to stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I regret it? No, I don&amp;#39;t regret taking an opportunity and trying to make it work. It&amp;#39;s not everyday that someone comes knocking on your door and says they&amp;#39;ll fund a business if you run it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I regret not listening to advice and being a lazy bum half the time when I couldn&amp;#39;t get in touch with my business partner because he was off having fun or doing something else. I regret not sticking to my guns when I KNEW what it would take to start this business, and acquiescing when my partner wouldn&amp;#39;t listen or didn&amp;#39;t hold up his end of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have I learned a ton? Oh, yes. I feel infinitely more prepared to start another business. What was the cost of that? $15k extra in CC debt that I now have, arguably worth it considering the cost of school nowadays. But I&amp;#39;m still back to square one. I&amp;#39;ve got $1000 left that will cover minimum payments for 2 months. My mom said I can stay with her and eat. I&amp;#39;m there now, and going to look for a job tomorrow so I can start making an income again before I default on all my credit. I&amp;#39;ve hit rock bottom. Time to pull myself up, get a job and an income, and start another business. This time, I&amp;#39;ll do it the proper way: starting small on the side and building it up. It was a fun time, but the free ride eventually ends and that&amp;#39;s that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this sloppy mess.
