You have to think, there&amp;#39;s no factory pumping out original iphone parts other than Foxconn or official Apple factories. Anything you see will be pulled from old phones and refurbished or resold. So obviously the supply is limited from one supplier.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps. Let me know if there&amp;#39;s anything else you want to know. Like I said, I import cell phone parts so let me know what you&amp;#39;re looking for I can try to help&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "name": "t1_dga1vb6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492246940.0, "created_utc": 1492218140.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d5l2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga22dr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ahhwth", "parent_id": "t3_65d5l2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I will take a look.
