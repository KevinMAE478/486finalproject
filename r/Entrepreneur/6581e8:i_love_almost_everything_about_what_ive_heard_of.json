I just want you to help you be clear-eyed about what it is, what it takes, and what works.\n\nSo, a few things...\n\n1) Quick repeat: *If your goal is to be \"successful\" and \"financially independent\" in X years, then entrepreneurship is most definitely NOT the easiest path to achieve that.* \n\nThere are a number of other things you can do that are far less \"sexy\" than entrepreneurship - and also far more likely to be effective.\n\n**I will talk about entrepreneurship in a bit**, but I want to just briefly mention the following non-entrepreneur things you can do:\n\n* Think really hard about your career path, and what skills you can add to your repertoire that will differentiate you from the crowd. I'm a content manager at a media company (by day, as I launch my startup, which I'll talk about in a bit). If I learned html and css, that\u2019d probably increase my value by 25-30%.\n\n* Financial independence is about savings far more than it is about income. If you want this, you have to prioritize is. Spend less, save more. The sub /r/financialindependence is really, really fantastic and helpful. One thing I do: send $xx from every paycheck straight to savings. I don\u2019t even see it, I just have to adjust my budget accordingly. It works.\n\n* If your job isn\u2019t giving you room to grow \u2013 both in terms of salary and skill set \u2013 then don\u2019t waste any time. Look for a better job now. If you don\u2019t have the skills or experience to get one, figure out what you need to do to get those skills, and **act.**If you don\u2019t have the drive to do something like acquire a new skill, then trust me, you don\u2019t have the drive to be an entrepreneur, period, end of story.\n\n* Find a job/career where your compensation is as merit-based as possible. This can be either a place where there\u2019s clear opportunity for advancement, a job with a significant portion of income that is performance-based, or like a job at a startup that comes with equity benefits (though this is risky, but so is entrepreneurship).\n\n**Okay. Let me give you a clear-eyed view of what entrepreneurship looks like.** It\u2019s different for everyone depending on what you\u2019re doing, but here\u2019s me and my take.\n\nI\u2019m the type of person that is wildly passionate about EVERYTHING. I think I don\u2019t get invited back to parties because I end up finding someone that wants to talk about Tesla stock for 45 minutes, or problems with the media, and there goes the evening. Whoops \u2013 sorry, not sorry.\n\n**I have the same end goals as you.** I want more freedom \u2013 to work for myself, to be financially free, and so on. This is really, really fucking important to me, as I\u2019m sure it is to you.\n\nIn college, I made close to $8,000 playing a video game. I bought and sold virtual items in a virtual auction house (Diablo 3). That was my first taste of entrepreneurship. At the time it seemed incredibly lucrative, and to a degree it was, but the reality \u2013 in retrospect \u2013 is that I spent all day every day following market trends in the game and refreshing the auction house to look for new undervalued items. My point: it was hard work. Also, I got really, really, REALLY fucking lucky for a number of reasons.\n\nRight after college, I was bored to tears working as a government consultant. So I launched a blog with a few friends that took me back to what I studied in school and what I thought I really cared about: international affairs, foreign policy, and that type of stuff. We took in outside submissions, edited the shit out of them, and published. Nothing crazy. It didn\u2019t really go that far, but I learned a lot about building something from scratch, how to develop processes to get things done consistently, etc etc.\n\nLast fall, I began in earnest pursuing ideas that could free me from the traditional career path. My driving motivation: I don\u2019t want to go to grad school, and the vast majority of people in my field have graduate degrees or higher. Fuck that.\n\nSo, I was invited in the fall to speak at my alma mater about the election, the media, and millennials. Thinking hard about what I would say, I realized this is something I deeply care about: there\u2019s too much information, too much bias, too much bullshit, and everyone is really disillusioned with it all.\n\nOK: **I\u2019ve identified a problem, and it\u2019s something that I really fucking care about. That\u2019s a good start.**\n\nAt my day job, I do a lot of stuff, but one of the things I do is manage a newsletter. In this role, I\u2019ve learned a lot about the newsletter business \u2013 both technically how to create and run one, and just how much money a successful one can make through advertising.\n\nNow I\u2019ve got a format I can use for my startup.\n\nNext, it\u2019s research time. I scour the web for data on advertising revenue, growth rates of newsletters, best practices by people who have constructed incredibly successful ones\u2026all of that stuff. I talk with friends, co-workers and family (incessantly, I\u2019m sure) about my ideas and try to get as much feedback as I can. I create a test newsletter and send it off to friends for feedback. I talk with redditors online about issues in the media to see if they agree this problem exists.\n\nDecember and January come around. I start working with someone to put up a basic signup page website. I fiddle around with my newsletter template some more. I start to think through finances and logistics: I\u2019ve got a full-time job, how the hell am I going to write this every night? Financially, part of the reason the newsletter idea appealed to me is the incredibly low overhead, so that\u2019s not much of an issue \u2013 but I engineered it that way on purpose.\n\nSunday, February 5. I decide to write another test newsletter to send out the following morning. I send it out, and it gets great feedback from my friends. So I post on Facebook asking if anyone would like to sign up for the list.\n\nHoly shit. Didn\u2019t realize my network viewed me as a good source of information on the news. Over 75 of my friends send me their email addresses, asking to be added to the list.\n\n**So I make the leap.** I decide Monday wasn\u2019t a test \u2013 it was the beginning of the daily newsletter. I have now committed to sending this thing out every morning, Monday through Friday. Keep in mind here: I have a full-time job (actually slightly more than full-time, I have some night work after I get home too). So, I\u2019m staying up until 2, 3, 4 AM to write this, and then waking up at 8:30 or whatever for work.\n\nAt this point, my mood and confidence begin to fluctuate all over the place. One moment I wake up and I feel on top of the world. Holy shit, I\u2019m building something from nothing, and people seem to like it! I get a few email replies from people saying they love it, it\u2019s so much easier to follow than cable news or whatever else, etc etc.\n\nThen two hours later: *What the fuck am I doing? I\u2019m 23. Who the hell am I to think I can write this type of thing? This is insane. Oh god, I\u2019m such an idiot. It\u2019s growing so slowly, this can\u2019t possibly go anywhere. My parents are right, this is a waste of time\u2026*\n\nMy mental state has been up and down like that ever since launching the newsletter. Objectively, I\u2019m on the right track: the metrics look great, growth is slow but I know what to do to solve it, and even if I fail, I stand to lose very little. But I can\u2019t shake those thoughts. Not even for a full 24 hours. And not to mention \u2013 I\u2019ve been getting 4-5 hours of sleep a night for the entire week, catching up on sleep over the weekend, and turning down almost every social invitation for two months. And it\u2019s clearly going to take a number of months more to reach a point where I can either secure funding or begin to sell advertising; email lists just take time to grow, no matter how amazing the product is.\n\n**Quick aside, at the risk of coming across as egotistical:** I have every single card in the deck stacked in my favor, personally speaking. I\u2019m a relatively attractive white male, and my parents have loads of connections that have already come in handy. Everything I\u2019ve done academically and professionally has involved things like writing, following the news, analysis, editing \u2013 so all of my experience has prepared me to launch a great product. I have been offered every single job or internship I\u2019ve ever interviewed for.\n\n*And yet \u2013 this is really, really fucking hard. Mentally and physically exhausting, and I spend almost every waking hour working.*\n\nHere\u2019s the point. **If you aren\u2019t passionate about the thing you\u2019re trying to build \u2013 if you aren\u2019t driven enough to make these types of sacrifices without any up-front return \u2013 if you aren\u2019t willing to turn down invitations from your friends to work on your project \u2013 then pick a different path to financial independence.**\n\nThat\u2019s why I ask you to figure out what you give a shit about.\n\nYou mention that you\u2019re prone to flitting about from one interest to another. I am too. That\u2019s why I spent months not just working on the idea and the product before launching my newsletter, but also making sure that my interest in it wouldn\u2019t die off.\n\nThere are a huge number of steps in between where you sit now and launching an entrepreneurial project. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t start taking those steps; by all means, hopefully I\u2019ve given you an idea of how to go about finding an interest, a problem, and finally a service or product you can pursue. But I want you to be clear-eyed about what this path to financial success looks like.\n\n*And by the way, I didn\u2019t even mention failure.*\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look, I&amp;#39;m not trying to discourage you from getting into entrepreneurship - I&amp;#39;m really not. I just want you to help you be clear-eyed about what it is, what it takes, and what works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, a few things...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Quick repeat: &lt;em&gt;If your goal is to be &amp;quot;successful&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;financially independent&amp;quot; in X years, then entrepreneurship is most definitely NOT the easiest path to achieve that.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a number of other things you can do that are far less &amp;quot;sexy&amp;quot; than entrepreneurship - and also far more likely to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will talk about entrepreneurship in a bit&lt;/strong&gt;, but I want to just briefly mention the following non-entrepreneur things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think really hard about your career path, and what skills you can add to your repertoire that will differentiate you from the crowd. I&amp;#39;m a content manager at a media company (by day, as I launch my startup, which I&amp;#39;ll talk about in a bit). If I learned html and css, that\u2019d probably increase my value by 25-30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial independence is about savings far more than it is about income. If you want this, you have to prioritize is. Spend less, save more. The sub &lt;a href=\"/r/financialindependence\"&gt;/r/financialindependence&lt;/a&gt; is really, really fantastic and helpful. One thing I do: send $xx from every paycheck straight to savings. I don\u2019t even see it, I just have to adjust my budget accordingly. It works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your job isn\u2019t giving you room to grow \u2013 both in terms of salary and skill set \u2013 then don\u2019t waste any time. Look for a better job now. If you don\u2019t have the skills or experience to get one, figure out what you need to do to get those skills, and &lt;strong&gt;act.&lt;/strong&gt;If you don\u2019t have the drive to do something like acquire a new skill, then trust me, you don\u2019t have the drive to be an entrepreneur, period, end of story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a job/career where your compensation is as merit-based as possible. This can be either a place where there\u2019s clear opportunity for advancement, a job with a significant portion of income that is performance-based, or like a job at a startup that comes with equity benefits (though this is risky, but so is entrepreneurship).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. Let me give you a clear-eyed view of what entrepreneurship looks like.&lt;/strong&gt; It\u2019s different for everyone depending on what you\u2019re doing, but here\u2019s me and my take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m the type of person that is wildly passionate about EVERYTHING. I think I don\u2019t get invited back to parties because I end up finding someone that wants to talk about Tesla stock for 45 minutes, or problems with the media, and there goes the evening. Whoops \u2013 sorry, not sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have the same end goals as you.&lt;/strong&gt; I want more freedom \u2013 to work for myself, to be financially free, and so on. This is really, really fucking important to me, as I\u2019m sure it is to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In college, I made close to $8,000 playing a video game. I bought and sold virtual items in a virtual auction house (Diablo 3). That was my first taste of entrepreneurship. At the time it seemed incredibly lucrative, and to a degree it was, but the reality \u2013 in retrospect \u2013 is that I spent all day every day following market trends in the game and refreshing the auction house to look for new undervalued items. My point: it was hard work. Also, I got really, really, REALLY fucking lucky for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right after college, I was bored to tears working as a government consultant. So I launched a blog with a few friends that took me back to what I studied in school and what I thought I really cared about: international affairs, foreign policy, and that type of stuff. We took in outside submissions, edited the shit out of them, and published. Nothing crazy. It didn\u2019t really go that far, but I learned a lot about building something from scratch, how to develop processes to get things done consistently, etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last fall, I began in earnest pursuing ideas that could free me from the traditional career path. My driving motivation: I don\u2019t want to go to grad school, and the vast majority of people in my field have graduate degrees or higher. Fuck that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I was invited in the fall to speak at my alma mater about the election, the media, and millennials. Thinking hard about what I would say, I realized this is something I deeply care about: there\u2019s too much information, too much bias, too much bullshit, and everyone is really disillusioned with it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK: &lt;strong&gt;I\u2019ve identified a problem, and it\u2019s something that I really fucking care about. That\u2019s a good start.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At my day job, I do a lot of stuff, but one of the things I do is manage a newsletter.
