Suck it up and deal with it.  This will not be the last hard decision you make in business. This is a cost of education. Your mistake cost you money.

Send emails to your customers notifying them of the brand change (make something up and call it an evolution in your branding)  Right now you are in a good position if the other company does not know you exist yet.  You can potentially change before any major damage happens and lawyers get involved.  That would be a very expensive problem to have.\n\nDont go wasting money on the TM as others have said.
