[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey fellow &lt;a href=\"/r/entrepreneurs\"&gt;/r/entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt;! I\u2019ve written up a small case study of my product and it\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d (Yay! You can learn what mistakes not to do). Hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flashback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in January 2016, whilst playing a game of poker, an epiphany occurred. Seeing all the designs on a deck of cards, I thought they\u2019d be cool to color and from that moment on, &lt;a href=\"https://www.playingcolor.com/\"&gt;PlayingColor&lt;/a&gt; was born. Furthermore, as this was my first project and I was on college holidays, time and curiosity was aplenty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, to start the deck, I needed a designer. I was willing to do it myself but I felt someone else would be better. So instead of searching for an established and professional designer, I went over to a friend and asked her to do the deck. She said sure\u2026. Sweet! What could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON 1. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND DON\u2019T MIX IN YOUR FRIENDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What my naivety failed to realize was that she\u2019s also in college and working and partying\u2026 and my project was going to take fourth place. Oh boy was her designs delayed. A request of 52 beautifully unique and intricate Mandalas ended up taking nearly 4 months to draw\u2026 (I should\u2019ve really saved that time and hired a faster professional designer). Furthermore, since we were friends, I couldn\u2019t really fathom of being harsh. My mistake. Also I forgot to implement a stringent deadline. Another mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON 2. CHINA ISN&amp;#39;T ALWAYS CHEAPER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the cards were sloooooooowly being designed, I was busy searching for suppliers. I always thought that China = Cheap and as a result, I began searching for Chinese manufacturers (I\u2019m located in Australia). The issue was that the card stock I needed had to have 1-side coated and the other to be uncoated. This was surprisingly a tall order for most Chinese and even US card manufacturers. Other issue was that US and China were giving me Minimum Order Quantities of 2,000 for $10k to print. I just didn\u2019t have that amount of money to spend. Luckily, I found one manufacturer in China and ordered a deck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON 3. MAKE SURE YOU CLARIFY AND TRIPLE CHECK EVERYTHING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the deck came from China. They promised and assured me that I could draw on the colored side. Nope. As well, the long shipping made me lose another 3 weeks. Fuck. I should\u2019ve requested a paper sample. My mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSON 4. CHINA ISN\u201dT ALWAYS CHEAPER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then went looking for any local suppliers in Australia and BEHOLD, it was actually cheaper to find a local supplier. Albeit, the first deck arrived and it was perfect. Finally! A fantastic box supplier in US and an Australian card manufacturer. I now have a product\u2026 but how do I sell it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marketing Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 5. DON\u201dT BE AFRAID TO SHOW YOUR PRODUCT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty self-explanatory but you see, when I created the deck, I realized no one had such an idea before. GOLD MINE! WHY SHOULD I TELL ANYONE? THEY MIGHT STEAL IT! I kept quiet about it (seriously, it wasn\u2019t a goldmine and I should\u2019ve been testing the concept earlier). I felt the idea was definitely going to be stolen. Unfortunately, only thing stolen was my logic and common sense. As a result, my initial marketing and customer research suffered.\nI actively started using Instagram and posting content about coloring and similar styles/designs to my cards but never actually revealed the product till the last moment. Big mistake. Sure the content I was posting made my account look pretty but for the actual purpose of my business, quite useless. Also, without showing and dabbling with my audience, I never really found out what consumers wanted or cared about coloring and specifically, my coloring playing cards. BIG MISTAKE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 6. DO MARKET RESEARCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did none. I suffered. I assumed they\u2019d love it. Assumed. To make an &amp;#39;ass&amp;#39; out of &amp;#39;u&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;me&amp;#39;. And as a result of failing to discover the exact needs and the specific people that\u2019d be interested, I lost out a whole new understanding for my product and obviously made my marketing attempt suffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 7. DON\u201dT WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT YOUR LOGO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/vqqIU\"&gt;Logo Styles I experimented&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasted a long time doing this. Trust me. It\u2019s not worth it at the start. Unless you\u2019re relaunching a new P&amp;amp;G product, your 600 followers won\u2019t care that much. Use your time for something else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 8. PEOPLE ARE STUPID. SPEAK STUPID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when I finally revealed the product leading up to my Kickstarter, I was met with a warm response and I decided to ump the marketing. I made a simple giveaway on my site where people had to submit their email and in return, they\u2019d get 5 free coloring card PDF\u2019s. Simple right? Nope. Under the \u201cPlease Put Your Email Here\u201d, I had more than 35 submissions of people putting the word \u201cEmail\u201d in there\u2026. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had people message my FB Page stating they got a virus called BMP. I had to explain to them it was a file format. I even had a lovely lady ask me if I could help her find the PDF files she downloaded on her computer. Albeit, I made mistakes by creating lead generation pages and giveaways that required more than 3 steps\u2026. Something that many couldn\u2019t do. Oh well. When I dumbed it down, results started happening and my mailing list started to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 9. BE REAL. SORTA\u2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To connect with many other colorists on FB and get a feel of the market, I made a fake FB account of our brand personality and interacted with them through all the tight-knit FB coloring groups. This is something I highly recommend for you to try. The connection and support I made was valuable for the Kickstarter that was coming up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kickstarter Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 10. MAKE SOME NOISE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was quiet for &lt;a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/410596108/playingcolor-the-worlds-first-coloring-playing-car\"&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. I figured that I\u2019d just rely on my FB personality sharing the announcement and my posts on Instagram alerting about it. I believed I had a fellowship already strong enough for Kickstarter which was sort of true, but having more fans, more money and more interest is always better. I could\u2019ve done so much more by seeking PR, Journalists or even paid recommendations from influencers. But no I didn\u2019t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, raised my $3k for PlayingColor and had enough to purchase a decent order to minimize my costs. Everything after went well though I planned to send these cards early November, the manufacturer screwed up the order and backlogged it till early December\u2026. Meaning I missed out on Christmas. Not fun. But with all the delays throughout the year, I was just desperate for something to come soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 11. TEST PRICING.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One startling issue with PlayingColor was its location in Australia. Our main market was the US. To send a deck over there costs $7USD. Starting to see the problem? Because of shipping, selling a deck + shipping appeared extortionate to my customers and my demand flailed heavily. I ran numerous campaigns on FB and Instagram but sales were slow. People weren\u2019t happy paying $14 for a deck of cards. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 12. ONCE YOU COMMIT. COMMIT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another issue arose in the start of this year. See, I got an internship/college opportunity to go to US for 6 months which I accepted. However, my spare time for PlayingColor quickly eroded. When I left to US, I took all the decks I had with me and tried selling it (albeit lazily) in US. I tried to run numerous FB advertising with no luck. Only one advert converted to sales but it just wasn\u2019t financially working out for me. As well, with Kickstarter, I bought an order that supplied me with enough cards to last a short time (I was hoping sales would skyrocket and I\u2019d buy a bigger order) but I was wrong. Here\u2019s the example of our profits (not including Kickstarter). Just sales directly from Shopify and not from market stalls or other avenues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;November    $120.90\nDecember    $154.40\nJanuary $175.87\nFebruary    $281.48&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue was that in February, my stock was down to 16 decks. I had to reorder but I wasn\u2019t willing to. I managed to find a few quality suppliers in US for both the boxes and the cards but I knew deep down I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to balance all my commitments. Furthermore, I\u2019ll be going back home to Australia and I\u2019d have to find a fulfillment company to ship and make the product competitive.\nI failed the product. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, with my soon-graduation, changing employment and a health issue, this all has culminated in putting me out of action and destroying all my interest in PlayingColor.  So that\u2019s the story of my PlayingColor experience....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though, as I sit now thinking whether to sell or just end the company, I can\u2019t help but be proud of the experience I\u2019ve had. It\u2019s been totally worth it with all the new knowledge and skills I\u2019ve developed. As well, looks fantastic on the resume ;) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, feel free to ask! \nI leave you with this quote \u201cBuild your own dreams, or someone else will hire you to build theirs.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey fellow /r/entrepreneurs!
