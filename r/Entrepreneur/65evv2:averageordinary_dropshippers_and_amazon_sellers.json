I dropship musical instruments from China to the US, Singapore and U.K. Sometimes I make \u00a33,600 a week sometimes I make \u00a31,100 a week and one time I only made \u00a3620 because my supplier fucked up an order or two and I was on the receiving end paying shipping fees etc. \n\nDon't listen to people that claim to be making \u00a350K a week dropshipping majority of them are lying and just want you to buy their ebooks this typically works if you are one of those lazy individuals who are gullible enough to be convinced by figures that have been adjusted by inspect element on Chrome or ones that just want to \"Get rich quick\".  The people that aren't lying aren't sharing information because they don't want competition.\n\n I'd like to disagree with the dude that said \"Dropshipping isn't profitable anymore\" It is profitable if you find the right market with low competition  and if you know what you are doing. Admittedly I've failed at least 6 times before I found a viable market. With dropshipping it tends to be the startup that's the hardest, surviving is far more easier if you use your head and if you are consistent. \n\nThe only people that think dropshipping is not viable are the ones who do poor product research list overpriced items and don't make any sales. Or they list items without enticing the buyer enough and make no sales. The common misconception of dropshipping is that it is \"easy\" no it is not. It requires extensive research and sometimes strategy - if you have a website etc. Don't find items list them and expect to make crazy sales. Do your research. In your first couple of months you are not drop shipping for massive amounts of money, you are dropshipping for reputation with both eBay and your target consumers. (If you have a shopify store you'd be building reputation for your store). Don't dropship products that the Asians can outclass you in I'm speaking of phone cases etc. \n\nTips: \n\n1. Find a product that is always needed by consumers. - This is the first step to ensuring that your \"dropshipping\" business or hobby lasts longer than it should. By selling products that are always in need it is less likely for the consumer interest in it to \"die out\". \n\n2.  Do your research - If you aren't willing to do market research forget it, the most you can make is a couple of extra pounds if you are lucky.\n\n3.  PayPal - Nobody ever mentions this. If you are going to use PayPal especially for dropshipping before you even start selling verify everything send them your information and lift your limits to ensure that you don't really have any problems with them I'd advise waiting a couple of months for your PayPal account to mature ensure that you use it frequently but not too frequently during its maturing period to ensure that you have a lot of transactions under your belt. This is good because you will be able to avoid 21 day holds on every single goods and service transaction you make thus, making it less stressful to drop ship and making dropshipping without a capital doable.  \n\n4. Dropshipping is a short term business model for generating money. The length of your business depends on the exposure your products get and their demand. People that dropship trendy products always need to devise new ways to attract buyer attention and actively need to keep up with consumer demands to drive sales as their products tend to die out after some time hence why Tip #1 is important.\n\n5. Don't overestimate stock always underestimate stock and \"restock\" when you reach the quantity you underestimated. \n\n6. Save up some excess cash. This is my preferred way of dropshipping as it is a lot easier and you will be far more flexible.\n\n7. Don't ever think for a second that you are going to be extremely successful. Always be realistic as much as all of us want to get rich quick also consider that you might fail. \n\n8. Introspect and improve. Unbiased revaluation will help you a lot. Retrace what you think you got wrong and work around ways to improve it. I'll use the example of a shopify store I used to run. I'd find products and think \"Wow everyone is going to love this\" I made the mistake of centring advertising campaigns around that product making minimal low profits on it simply because I allowed a cognitive bias to take over and that I thought people where going to love when it was a trash product. Facts over Fantasy all the time! \n\n9. Dropshipping is not for everyone. I'm not trying to discourage anyone however, if you are the type of person that hates spending hours doing research or can't find products or gaps in markets don't dropship. If you are convinced that you can make profit from dropshipping from Amazon don't dropship. I mean you can if you want to but you won't make sustainable income over a long period of time. \n\n10. Use your head - You aren't going to get rich or attain sustainable income just by sitting and stealing listings from different sites. Spice it up and research.  \n\nI'll give this example, I know how to get software keys at reasonable cheap prices. When I checked the market for those same keys on Ebay UK it was oversaturated and highly competitive and I would make virtually no money if even tried to compete. However, when I checked on eBay Usa it was a completely different story there was low competition and I could easily beat their prices. The only reason why I didn't take that market was that I could only attain 10 keys per week and make \u00a311 from each sale (after PayPal tax and eBay tax) wasn't attractive to me. Especially with only 10 items. \n\nSorry if I am coming off as obnoxious re-Reading this I really feel like I do but, ultimately I hope someone has gained a few ideas from whatever I just said. I hope I was helpful to at least one person. \n\nThanks.\n\n\n", "edited": 1492274445.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It honestly varies, there is no set amount that you get monthly, it tends to fluctuate depending on the number of sales that you make.
