I&amp;#39;ve tried my alumni network and tried to see if I can get a list of customers at some workspaces here in the city, bur so far no dice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "name": "t1_dg72o88", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492082789.0, "created_utc": 1492053989.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650f7q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg77q4l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rustedhorses4", "parent_id": "t3_650f7q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Being a marketing nub!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a marketing nub!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "name": "t1_dg77q4l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492091215.0, "created_utc": 1492062415.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650f7q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg78h7s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mreinecker", "parent_id": "t3_650f7q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "body": "SALES!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALES!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "name": "t1_dg78h7s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492092917.0, "created_utc": 1492064117.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650f7q", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650f7q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7acxa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Usedmyrealname", "parent_id": "t1_dg7a5ac", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oooh, thats an interesting and unusual situation. \n\nIs the business partner a family member? \n\nI do agree with you on the places to advertise.
