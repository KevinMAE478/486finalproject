Please keep your day job until you get $$ in the door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how to get cash in the door?- b2b is my preferred business model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to 100 people that could use your service. Email, call, linkedin request. Just talk to people. Learn how to do this early because if you don&amp;#39;t you will die. (And no you can not delegate this to your employees...as the founder you have to talk to your customers and know what they need). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After talking to 100 people map out what makes them unique. Are they all small business owners that sell real estate? Ok great. Whatever the funnel looks like, figure it out NOW. Go back to those 100 people and get 10 of them to pay up front for the service. If you want to build an app that does something SO beneficial to them they will pay upfront (or at the very least sign letters of intent to pay).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5.Use a landing page builder (instapage.co is great) and create an interest form. Now, with the info you have from above about who seems to like your idea drop 100 bucks into facebook and TARGET the hell out of people like that.

The really great businesses are going to have easy customer acquisition and easy to reach customers. I am 22 years old and have no corporate america network...this makes it way harder for me to sell enterprise software (think meetings upon meetings, etc). I say this to educate those thinking about jumping into starting a company....think long and hard about how you are going to sell. I would suggest building for the SMB first. Find local real estate agents who could use your software. And then a year from launch get into the true enterprise. I am happy to explain more about why this makes sense if anyone wants more info. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok so what do your customer acquisition funnels look like? Are early adopters begging for your software? BE HONEST. Does it sell like crack on a corner? If it does, great. Quit your day job and go all in. If it doesn&amp;#39;t, I would strongly suggest not pursuing the idea. Its so easy to get really attached to the idea. Its hard &amp;amp; takes a LOT of capital to educate customers about why your idea is great. Just go back to the drawing board and redo this exercise. The business that is going to change your life will grow SO fast you won&amp;#39;t know what to do. If its hard to get people interested, you probably have not found that one business yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok so now you have something people are really interested in, the funnel seems to work to bring more potential customers in, and you have some revenue. Good freaking job. Seriously, the first sale is the hardest. You got there. Now, double down and find 10 more people just like your early customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build your product with these initial 20 on board. I promise you this thinking will drastically improve your ability to win starting your company.
