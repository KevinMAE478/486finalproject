But I do see where you are coming from with the Paypal consumer protection guarantee, I guess if you can prove to your customers that you are legit and upfront then they shouldn&amp;#39;t particularly have a problem with processing a payment through your system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But unless you find a promotional offering for a limited transaction, that 3% isn&amp;#39;t getting any lower than maybe 2.5%. It&amp;#39;s just the credit card interchange fee. Not even huge retailers like Walmart find a way around that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Incorrect my friend, Referring to the Paypal business monthly sales info I post just below in this comment you can see that the more money you bring in each month the lower the total transaction % fee is going to be. its the standard .30c which can&amp;#39;t be lowered. Having your own transaction API system would still incur the .30c transaction fee but im sure you will be able to get a less total transaction % fee without having to bring in such monthly sale totals like paypal requires but that&amp;#39;s up to your bank to decide.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monthly sales: Up to $2,500 Australian customers: 2.6% + $0.30&lt;br/&gt;\nMonthly sales: $2,500.01 - $5,000 Australian customers: 2.2% + $0.30&lt;br/&gt;\nMonthly sales: $5,000.01 - $15,000 Australian customers: 2.0% + $0.30&lt;br/&gt;\nMonthly sales: $15,000.01 - $150,000 Australian customers: 1.5% + $0.30&lt;br/&gt;\nMonthly sales: Over $150,000 Australian customers: 1.1% + $0.30  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "name": "t1_dg74nyy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492085744.0, "created_utc": 1492056944.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5w3n3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ExternalUserError", "parent_id": "t1_dg5k260", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well sure if you're going to do ACH or something similar.
