I\u2019m &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; selling dirt and making a solid chunk of change. My name is Nick and I founded &lt;a href=\"http://www.DirtByMail.com\"&gt;www.DirtByMail.com&lt;/a&gt; March 1st with my best friend Ryan. We anonymously send a bag of dirt to the dirtbag of your choice. The recipient receives the bag of dirt accompanied by a \u201cYou\u2019re a dirtbag\u201d card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ryan pitched the idea to me in the middle of February and I loved the idea. Ryan and I each agreed to put in a few hundred bucks to get us started. I created our website, ordered the \u201cYou\u2019re a dirtbag\u201d cards, set up a manufacturer in China for our bags, and talked with Ryan about how we would get the dirt, boxes, and other miscellaneous stuff. We figured out a plan, ordered the first couple hundred units, and decided to do a soft launch through my University. I sent some out to random people and watched as they opened up the packages, put it on social media, and laughed at the hilarious experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that small success, we agreed the best way to officially launch the website would be through an Instagram Influencer, or someone who has a few hundred thousand/million followers. For a few hundred dollars, we got our ad in front of hundreds of thousands of people. We made sure to work with an Instagram account that posts funny memes since our audience is people who have a sense of humor. The ad was a success and we got a great return on that investment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We continued to put up other ads with other accounts and have some great successes and great failures. The problems occur when you work with Instagram accounts that have bought millions of followers. You quickly learn that if an account with 10 million followers is offering you an ad for $40, it\u2019s too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 45 days, we have taken in just over $7,500. After covering our costs for shipping and cogs, a good amount was profit but we&amp;#39;re reinvesting everything right back into Instagram ads. An example of an Instagram post: An account with 2 million followers cost about $400 which caused about 4,000 unique visits to the site which turned into about $800 worth of sales. We usually get a 2x return on our investment with these ads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ryan and I are continuing to advertise with legit Instagram accounts and are having continued success. We are growing at a steady pace and have had over 1,000 happy customers in just under 45 days. We are really enjoying the whole process of working with our customers, fulfilling all the orders, and running a dirt company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would love to hear what you think of DirtByMail! We especially would love any fun/different ideas how we can market it. Thanks :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Some people find it hard to believe this is real (and I totally get it).
