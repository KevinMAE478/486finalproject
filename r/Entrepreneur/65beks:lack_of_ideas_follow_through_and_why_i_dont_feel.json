I got in some trouble a few years back so nothing too good is going to come out of 9-5&amp;#39;s for me right now. I have a very diverse set of skills. I repair computers from time to time. I do wood working, blacksmithing, I sew. I crochet. I can fix just about anything. I like building, breaking, and fixing things. There isn&amp;#39;t a lot I cannot do usually. However, for the past couple years I cannot for the life of me find something I want to do and stick to it. I&amp;#39;ve tried learning code but I&amp;#39;m not passionate about it.
