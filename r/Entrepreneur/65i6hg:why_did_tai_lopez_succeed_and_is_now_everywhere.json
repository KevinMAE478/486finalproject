Tai came from nothing, defrauded some folks with fake dating sites, and moved on to better scams by joining a syndicate and hitting it big on social media. If he had any other non scam success, he would call it out by name, as other successful people do, and enjoy the free publicity for his other business. And he&amp;#39;d have other domains in his name with age. And he&amp;#39;d have other corporate filings in his name with age. And he&amp;#39;d have testimonials from the past and photos from the past, and promotions from the past. Sadly, because he is a scam artist, what he has is a very well invented present, and ads out for 9 new employees to help him take people&amp;#39;s money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "name": "t1_dgarooo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492299119.0, "created_utc": 1492270319.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i6hg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaopep", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "vee_lan_cleef", "parent_id": "t3_65i6hg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just to sort of go against the grain here... who the *hell* is Tai Lopez?
