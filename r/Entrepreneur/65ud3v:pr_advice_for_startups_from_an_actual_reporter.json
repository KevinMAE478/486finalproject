This probably (possibly) isn't you since we're talking PR and interviews though.  To piggy back one last time on the content criticism, I should offer something constructive.  Change the content strat.  Do a complete 180.  Start a Lessons Learned interview series on people that didn't make it and are down and out or close to it.  It will require you to seek out the interview instead of the other way around.

There's a reason for that.  It's because mommy blogger's and drop shippers and niche adsense sites that sell ebooks that offer nothing of value that's not already been said and then claim in their \"monthly income report post\" they are making outrageous numbers.  I think most of the big players and vets are probably truthful because they rank for pretty much everything in the MMOL area.  But when you question someone who is a wanna be pat flynn for some proof of the numbers, you typically get an insult.  I guess I'll end this by asking your opinion even though you don't sound like a reg on the sub.  What's your opinion on this?  Is it unethical?  Should the mods treat anyone claiming sales from a blog (not a product/software) like AMA and require proof?  To bring this question full circle...that's pretty much why I rarely browse this sub anymore.  Hearing your opinion on my questions/comments might bring me back though.  \n\nI'll end this by saying thanks again, and I hope you don't take og my any criticism too personally.

It will never be more than an idea without the back of your audience and support though.  I think it would be a homerun and have the formula and connections to do it.
