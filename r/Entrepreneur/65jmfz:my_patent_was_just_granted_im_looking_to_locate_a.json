Call them and ask if they would quote a job.  You will need an engineering drawing and Estimated Annual Volume.  They may be too \"big\" to deal with small runs, but I'm sure there are job shops that would quote you.\n\nThis is how it goes generally (injection molder, etc.):\n\nWith a solid model or drawing (needs detailed dimensions AND tolerances) they quote your part.  Most times, you own the injection mold and the supplier uses it to supply you parts.  Meaning you pay to manufacture the tooling which is likely quoted through tool/mold building shops and designed based on the molder and tool shop's expertise.  Depending on complexity, a tool can take some time, weeks to months, and be a significant expense.  A resin will need to be decided (colors, additives, quality, etc.  Once tooling is built, a trial run is ran and you would approve the silicone parts and likely pay and place an order at that point.  Source: interned for medical injection molder as project engineer.\n\nThis may sound bad, but Chinese tool shops generally make poor molds/tools.  Also you risk having your product knocked off if you are manufacturing in China and it becomes a hit.\n\nI'm sure I'm missing stuff, but let me know what questions you have.\nEDIT: I'm also assuming your silicone product will be injection molded.

Call them and ask if they would quote a job.  You will need an engineering drawing and Estimated Annual Volume.  They may be too &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; to deal with small runs, but I&amp;#39;m sure there are job shops that would quote you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is how it goes generally (injection molder, etc.):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a solid model or drawing (needs detailed dimensions AND tolerances) they quote your part.  Most times, you own the injection mold and the supplier uses it to supply you parts.  Meaning you pay to manufacture the tooling which is likely quoted through tool/mold building shops and designed based on the molder and tool shop&amp;#39;s expertise.  Depending on complexity, a tool can take some time, weeks to months, and be a significant expense.  A resin will need to be decided (colors, additives, quality, etc.  Once tooling is built, a trial run is ran and you would approve the silicone parts and likely pay and place an order at that point.
