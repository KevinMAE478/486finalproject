We're shooting some of the new content their fans unlocked earlier this year, so that will rise pretty quickly.\n\nAnd in response to this question:\n\n&gt; I know it's only been two episodes for the First! window, but because of the interest and discussion it's gained, will you be discussing the results of the experimentation at a point during the season of Red vs Blue or at the end? \n\n&gt; Are there shows you can say will be getting experimental windows in the future?  If First! members have suggestions on what shows get longer or shorter windows, would that be something you consider?\n\n&gt; Thank you for coming forward to address more transparently the situation and as it develops.\n\n&gt; EDIT: Oh yes, I remembered another point I had.  I use a Windows Phone and a PS4 as other internet media devices.  It has been a while since I looked, but when the Xbox and Android/IOS apps launched I could not find the First! app for either.  Are they in development?  Are they out already?\n\nHe replied:\n\n&gt; We'll definitely keep you updated when there's new info to share.
