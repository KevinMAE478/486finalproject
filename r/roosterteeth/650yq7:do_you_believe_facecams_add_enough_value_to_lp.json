For instance the Bigfoot LP. I don&amp;#39;t really want to see Jack on camera doing his bits or funny moments. I would much rather think of Jack actually being in the forest calling Ryan and Lil&amp;#39; J on a walkie talkie saying &amp;quot;I see the squatch&amp;quot; or freaking out in a camper when the squatch busts in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any game where they&amp;#39;re playing against actual other people in a versus type game has no need for a facecam in my opinion, unless they do something in the cams like Funhaus. From AH facecam videos I&amp;#39;d say that a lot of the time they look at their screens where as Funhaus moves around, make gestures, and overall has something going on in the facecam.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "roosterteeth", "name": "t1_dg79nem", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492095891.0, "created_utc": 1492067091.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7g9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650yq7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg75zzk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rice39567", "parent_id": "t3_650yq7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/roosterteeth", "controversiality": 1, "body": "I personally enjoy the more edited videos that are put out.
