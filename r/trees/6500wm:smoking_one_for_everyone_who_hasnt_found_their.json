She was dating one of my best friends, I'll call him G but when she met me, we hit it off and developed a crush, so G set us up and started dating a girl I'll call Z.  We dated for a little while, but I broke up with her after 2 months because apparently she was already in a long distance relationship with another guy, and I liked a girl I'll call A1. A1 wasn't into me at first, so I set her up with my other best friend I'll call C. She and C weren't even together for a month. That was my plan. C is super awkward with girls. I mean REALLY awkward. Like barely talks awkward. I knew this. And i knew they wouldn't workout. In the mean time I got back with M. It turns out, I was her first for a lot of things. Everything but penetration basically. So I feel shitty about using her the way i did, but i used to be like that. Anyway A1 started getting jealous and i dumped M over a MySpace message. Well, i dated A1 for about 6 months. At this time my friend K was dating A2. At bout 3 months in i found out A2 and A1 were together at one point, they met because A2 was in the foster care system and A1's mother was a foster parent. They were also really good friends but lost touch when a bunch of drama happened, I got the bright idea to reconnect them, i figured hey worst case scenario they become friends again, best case i get a 3some. K and A2 had broken up at this point. So i called him up, got A2's number and gave her a call. I fell in love as soon as I heard her voice. I tried to ignore it but holy hell, it was crazy. We alked very day fter that. I was gonna set her up with G to try and move past it, but when we met, I fell even harder. She was everything I want. I'm still convinced she is my soul mate. Anyway nothing happens then, a week later A2, K K's cousin and I go hang out at the bowling alley. We have our first kiss, it was. Amazing. We were all over each other. I got to 2nd base that day lol. Anyway I ended up breaking things off with A1 a month later. I waited so long because at this point, M was pissed so she and her best friend told her school i was going to blow up my school and G his. I was an emo kid, my school did not like me at all, so they used this to get me kicked out my junior year. G got a 10 day suspension from his lol. Well after all this, in the summer, A2 and I got together and became human rabbits. We were crazy. In September I started alternative school to finish my junior and senior year, she transferred to a new school but she was an outcast like me, constantly being bullied, one dude sexually assaulted her so i found him. I never got caught for that. She ended up dropping out that year she was bullied so much. She ended up moving in with me because her parents were abusive and we were together for 3 years. I fell into a rut after i graduated I couldn't find a job, things were bad for a while with me and she was dealing with her own stuff so she left me. This destroyed me. I tried killing myself when i found out she was dating R, i thought we would get back together one day. We didn't stop sleeping together until she married R. I was a shitty person back then. Anyway after all this i stopped dating. I started counseling got help and got a little better. Last year i met A3. I found out she went out with K a couple times, but nothing ever came of it.
