I think we've very much\n&gt; like to see where we stand right\n&gt; now as far as accomplishment versus\n&gt; what's planned. \n&gt; \n&gt; We'd all kind of\n&gt; hoped before the mission, and every-\n&gt; body had the message, that we did\n&gt; not plan to operate at the SL-3\n&gt; pace.

And I\n&gt; imagine you guys are probably caught\n&gt; right smack in the middle of it\n&gt; and the questions that arise to\n&gt; mind when I hear these - when these\n&gt; people start asking me these questions\n&gt; from one place or another and that is -\n&gt; Are we behind, and if so how far? Or\n&gt; is all this hastle over our time\n&gt; a result of people coming out of the\n&gt; woodwork with new things to be done.\n&gt; I'd like to understand that and\n&gt; possibly then I'd be in a position\n&gt; to maybe respond and do something about\n&gt; it.
