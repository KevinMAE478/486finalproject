Because the last time I checked close to about 50% of the mass of crop yields was due to artificial fertilizer. Then again, if you count the total yield from a field that uses artificial fert as 100% artificial nitrogen then this figure would make more sense. However, there is a good bit of nitrogen present in the soil from bacteria and nitrogen fixating crops that are rotated out, its not 100%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, I think we rely far too much on artificial fertilizer, I think we should stop reducing farmland and instead deal with lower crop yields. Its better for the soil in the long term and we are less reliant on a resource that primarily comes from natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wikipedia", "name": "t1_dgaewnb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492269326.0, "created_utc": 1492240526.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hkfo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgax1zb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "irsmert", "parent_id": "t3_65hkfo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wikipedia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Highly recommend reading The Alchemy of Air by Thomas Haber for anyone wanting to know more about the fascinating story behind the creation of the process.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly recommend reading The Alchemy of Air by Thomas Haber for anyone wanting to know more about the fascinating story behind the creation of the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wikipedia", "name": "t1_dgax1zb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492306573.0, "created_utc": 1492277773.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hkfo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbly8c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chiminage", "parent_id": "t3_65hkfo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wikipedia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We get it Joe", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get it Joe&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wikipedia", "name": "t1_dgbly8c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492341602.0, "created_utc": 1492312802.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hkfo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hkfo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb7rv2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hail_Britannia", "parent_id": "t1_dgankt6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wikipedia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; In time, Malthus may end up being right.\n\nIn fiction maybe.
