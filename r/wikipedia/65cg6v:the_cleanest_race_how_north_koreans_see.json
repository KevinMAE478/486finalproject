This passage from a review article in the Journal of Asian Studies published by Cambridge University Press particularly stood out to me:\n\n&gt; \"what Myers points to as the most significant feature of North Korea\u2019s ideology, the centrality of *maternal imagery* in the cults of the Great Leaders (father and son), *has no equivalent in any fascist dictatorship of which I am aware*. These regimes glorified manly virtues in both their leaders and their followers (at least their male followers), while North Korea, Myers argues, emphasizes the motherly qualities of its leaders and the childish attributes of its people. In a way, it does a disservice to the originality of North Koreans to attribute all the peculiarities of their ideological system to its right-wing Japanese antecedents, rather than accept that Koreans could come up with a bizarre and frightening political system all by themselves.\" (Armstrong 2011, Emphasis added)\n\nWhile my specialisation is not in North Korea, International Relations is my field and it does not seem as though this book is the best example of academic efforts to distill a clear picture to a North Korean ideology. As peer review is the closest thing to external validity in certain political science studies (this is debatable according to which epistemological assumptions one subscribes to and the ability to maximise validity in gathering data, I know), I'd say its best not to put to much weight on the argument of this book given the academic consensus. That being said, this is Reddit, so who cares I guess. Any how, best get back to my own research...
