What is the value to the client? That will change with each client but it's not based on what you can do for one hour of work. That turns you into a commodity, like a sack of potatoes. It discounts speed and efficiency, which come with time and experience. \n\nThe lawn care business above has been around for 18 years. They are successful. If they are well known in their market, their website is of greater value. If you can optimize their site so that it saves them time and money while getting more leads and bringing in more revenue, then there is a great value to what you do. \n\nI'm sure we all can bring more to the table for this client in terms of design, but can we bring more to the table in terms of return on investment or value to the client? What do you do to sell them that your services will be better than this agency's work? \n\nThe value to the business is leads that turn into clients. Maybe this site looks different than the agency's other clients because the client base for the lawn care business is different. We don't know anything about this agency and their process. I want to be slow to judge their work. \n\nBut if this \"crappy\" looking website is the best thing because it is also backed by a marketing campaign and SEO campaign and email campaign, maybe it is better than just having a prettier site. This is business and leads mean business. We have to help businesses get those leads. \n\nI hope that we can all move from a commodity pricing structure (per hour) to a value based structure (what is the value to the client?). It will actually make it so that you can turn web design into a career and not just a hobby. Commodity based pricing turns us into slaves while value based pricing turns us into partners with the client. It might mean less work, but you will have better clients and weed out some of the disaster ones while still making a good return on the jobs you complete. \n\nThink about it this way. If the company above has revenues of $300,000 per year then a site that can raise revenues just 1% (a good, but conservative increase) is worth $3,000 to them. That is the value of that site. Now, if their revenues are greater than that the site becomes more valuable to the client. If the client pays to raise the revenues by 1% and they get a 3% increase they have made a good investment in their business. They put down one dollar and got three back. \n\nThis is value based pricing. It respects what you can do to help the business and not how fast you can do it. In the end clients might come back to you for commodity based business, but if you give them a 3% increase in revenue I guarantee they will come back to you. You have proven the website's worth to their business. That's all they care about. \n\nBe careful to knock this company if they are giving their clients a good return on investment. The client wants to generate leads that turn into clients, not win web design awards.\n\nThat's my 2 cents. I hope it can help someone.

If the typical customer stays with the company for 3 full seasons, you&amp;#39;re looking at a lifetime value of $1,800.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, calculate how many new customers your website generates (or will generate). If the company&amp;#39;s other marketing efforts generate 500 new users a month in-season and your efforts in design convert at a 1% rate, that means the company gains 30 new customers over the course of the season. (I get much better conversion rates for my clients&amp;#39; websites, but 1% is about what I&amp;#39;d expect from this particular website.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$1,800 CLV per customer times 30 new customers is $54,000 in lifetime revenue from those customers. That&amp;#39;s $54,000 the company would not have made without your work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you go to your client with this kind of information, they won&amp;#39;t bat an eye at dropping $10k on that ugly, reprehensible website. If you&amp;#39;re asking $200, you&amp;#39;re doing yourself a disservice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "web_design", "name": "t1_dg9wkll", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492239902.0, "created_utc": 1492211102.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8r6er", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kgflash1", "parent_id": "t1_dg8e5y1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/web_design", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm going to be redoing it, my sites range anywhere from $900-$4000, for the result they got I would have charged $200.
