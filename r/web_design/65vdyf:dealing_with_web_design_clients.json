I just want to give my advice from working with clients for almost 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of the problems that I&amp;#39;m seeing (but not all) stem from the initial meeting with the client. (Hopefully, every project starts with an initial meeting.) Before you ever give a quote or sign a contract, meet with the client for an hour or two and talk with them about their business, current website, and what they want to see. Here are some good starter questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What do you like about your website?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tell me two or three things you want users to do on your site before they leave.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What are some adjectives to describe the design style you&amp;#39;re looking for?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can you tell me some sites that you like? Why do you like them?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should also be asking questions that will help you figure out the technical specs for the site. Do they need a CMS? What sorts of payment gateways or carts are needed? What forms do they need? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is vital as a designer that you learn to interpret what the client wants. You have to learn how to speak to them using language he/she can understand and then interpret that into technical knowledge of how to get the site to that place. Does the client need to know the technical term? No. It&amp;#39;s your job to hear &amp;quot;big photo on the front page&amp;quot; and interpret that as a hero image. Then instruct them on the proper terms. &amp;quot;Oh, yes, like this? [show them a hero image]. That&amp;#39;s called a hero section or hero image. Do you want to be able to change that easily?&amp;quot; If they describe something and you don&amp;#39;t understand, then have them show you an example. Clarity is the key. Clearly talk about yourself and about the client&amp;#39;s vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the first meeting, you should be able to come up with a proposal outlining the scope, look, and feel of the website before you even sign the contract. The proposal gives the client the design direction, technical specs, cost, and time. That is the working document with the client until you get to a contract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This proposal/discovery document should be ok&amp;#39;d by the client and that can be the basis for the contract. The contract should cover what happens during the agreed upon timeframe for the work, what happens with the work once it&amp;#39;s finished, your responsibility as the designer, the client&amp;#39;s responsibilities (and those should be clearly outlined), and how to handle contingencies (over time, over budget, sickness, vacation, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lay out the expectations to the client. You are partners. You are not just the client&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;hands.&amp;quot; You are a professional. You are paid to do something specific. Do that thing. Find out if the client wants you to do your thing or is looking for something you can&amp;#39;t or aren&amp;#39;t willing to do. If they don&amp;#39;t feel like they respect you in that way, politely let them know that you are not the designer they are looking for. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of every project, evaluate the project from the beginning. If it was the kind of client you don&amp;#39;t want to work with, think through any warning signs you saw in the beginning, before you even started the work. Either come up with ways to direct those kinds of clients or learn how to let them go before entering into a contractual relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, you are a builder--a contractor. You are setting out to remodel or rebuild. The person hiring you doesn&amp;#39;t know how to do that. You have to teach, guide, instruct, and move the client to a better solution, not your own personal style or preferences. It&amp;#39;s not good enough to say I don&amp;#39;t like this. Show yourself to be an expert. Use testing, use articles from trusted sources. Work around a glaring problem like, &amp;quot;Can we make the logo bigger?&amp;quot; Provide some mockups. If you find that these sorts of revisions are taking up too much time and you&amp;#39;re not getting paid enough, make provision for that in the contract. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t like &amp;quot;nickel and dime&amp;quot; clients? Raise your rates. It will get rid of them. It&amp;#39;s almost always the cheap clients who do that. Learn how to spot a cheap client. Learn how to let them know courteously that your services just aren&amp;#39;t right and let them go. There are plenty of people who respect what you do and will let you free to design as long as you work with them on the direction you&amp;#39;re going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is especially important for young designers/developers and those just starting to interact with clients. Be courteously bold. Be confident in your skills and thoughts. Have a process in place &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you meet clients. Guide the clients through an area they know nothing about.

I've not had to really go through that with my clients. You could add that anything outside the expressed, written scope of the contract will be worked up and billed separately or that any changes must be agreed upon by both parties and written up for billing. \n\nIf you're working with a client where there are a lot of decision-makers, then build in an extra 25% (or another number) on the cost for changes and revisions. Then, you won't have to worry about undercharging or nickel and diming for revisions. \n\nIn the end, you have to be firm. Make sure you read through the contract again to ensure that you're right :-) Then let the client know that what they are asking for is a separate feature and is out of the scope of the contract. If they want to have it then give them an estimate for the extra costs and have them sign off on it. Don't just say \"yes.\" Go through the process. If it's a bad idea then give some push back on it. See how they respond to your logic. If they still want to do it and they're willing to pay, then the ball is in your court. Do it or don't. You might even consider finding someone else to contract that work out to.\n\nJust make sure the contract specifically says what you will be putting into the project, especially if you have had previous conversations that weren't written down. \n\nGive clients a little bit of grace. They don't always know when they're moving into a new feature. Coach them, teach them.

This is all of the protection I have in my current contract:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We don\u2019t want to limit your ability to change your mind. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won\u2019t be a problem as we\u2019ll provide a separate estimate for those additional changes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s under a section called &amp;quot;changes and revisions.&amp;quot; You could be a lot more hardcore than that. I&amp;#39;ve not had to really go through that with my clients. You could add that anything outside the expressed, written scope of the contract will be worked up and billed separately or that any changes must be agreed upon by both parties and written up for billing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re working with a client where there are a lot of decision-makers, then build in an extra 25% (or another number) on the cost for changes and revisions. Then, you won&amp;#39;t have to worry about undercharging or nickel and diming for revisions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, you have to be firm. Make sure you read through the contract again to ensure that you&amp;#39;re right :-) Then let the client know that what they are asking for is a separate feature and is out of the scope of the contract. If they want to have it then give them an estimate for the extra costs and have them sign off on it. Don&amp;#39;t just say &amp;quot;yes.&amp;quot; Go through the process. If it&amp;#39;s a bad idea then give some push back on it. See how they respond to your logic. If they still want to do it and they&amp;#39;re willing to pay, then the ball is in your court. Do it or don&amp;#39;t.
