You have 1. Business/Personal/Shared Hosting. You're given a single cPanel account, and share resources with other customers with these same plans. They place as many customers as they can on a single server (~100s-1,000s etc). Then you have 2. Reseller Hosting. It's like getting sudo-root to a cPanel account. They give you WHM access that can make many other cPanel accounts, and you also share resources with other reseller hosting customers. IE. Tons of Resellers on the same server - Hundreds of more customers/web sites on the same server considering you have 20 - 100+ customer websites per reseller. Resources can always be finicky considering hosting companies are trying to make a profit. (This applies to all of them, I don't care how great their marketing looks). Regardless, you're looking at decent uptime and service however that 99.9% up time guarantee just means that if the servers go down for a little or a lot during the month, they're paying out very small amounts of credits to each customer on the server, and you still deal with downtime and angry customers of your own. Then you have 3. VPS Hosting. Best mainly as testing environments, and alright for small amounts of clients if you're trying to do reseller hosting on them. A VPS is a virtualized computer environment that mimics your own personal server. You get free range real root access, and WHM/cPanel etc. 4. And the best is a Dedicated Server (hosting). You pay the most but you provide a self contained environment for your clients, considering only your clients/your hosting is on this server. The real metal hardware version of a VPS type system.\n\nI worked in the industry while in college and I gotta say, it's shady as hell. You're dealing with brilliant people running a full fledged data center and support/sales center, but when something happens to Level3 (data center internet provider across the country) and customers want answers, the lying is far too ridiculous. And when servers have issues or are slightly at capacity and causing problems for all customers involved, it becomes a grey area for everyone as to how to treat the situation and up selling etc.\n\nI also gotta say that I despise resellers that don't know what they're doing. Of course, any issues are handled by the hosting company you're dealing with (if you're getting fully managed hosting, which is usually the case) but ultimately, your clients are relying on you as the actual host (because they signed up with you) and you should at least know what the in's and out's are and try to figure out what you're really getting into. Anyway, It's not that hard to believe that there are companies that invest in infrastructure and servers, and then allow the ants of the industry like resellers to take up space on their servers and try to make a small profit. The amount of shared/reseller/vps/ and server clients they have pales in comparison to your 15 clients websites sharing resources with thousands of others on a single server. I don't mean to come off as rude, but the way you worded your post seemed a little off to me so understand that you should be there for your clients 100% when giving them the option to sign up everything they would need with you.\n\nSome tools to make your reseller hosting more professional is WHMS (which I think most hosts provide for free), and it allows you to setup a client portal to take customer package orders, domain registration etc. And then you add in your own ticketing system which you can have automatically forward support tickets to your web host, and keep things efficient like that.\n\nAnd cPanel shouldn't go over your head unless you're dealing with windows hosting, and I don't know who would put themselves through that. In any case, a single cPanel account allows you to add domains/sub-domains/addon/parked domains (etc) and email accounts for a single entity. If I remember correctly, you could technically put all your clients websites on a single cPanel accounts but then they wouldn't have access to their own accounts as the cPanel user/login would need to be given out to each of them and that's probably not a good idea. With a reseller, you're creating multiple cpanel accounts, each for their own client/website and they would then have access to their own cPanels and be able to use web email applications and add things on their own if they wanted to you. That should help with understanding the dynamic of these type of hosting accounts. It's been a while since i've been in the thick of it all so I apologize if anything is outdated. I know when I quit, hosts were starting to move away from the shared/reseller game and delving into cloud virtualization like Amazon AWS and cloud computing. (Ie. https://www.vultr.com/). But I think most of big hosts still offer shared and reseller packages simply because it's a tried and true service in the industry.\n\nI would stay away from GoDaddy (though they're not bad, they just seem incompetent), and maybe go with Namecheap. Honestly, I'm not a fan of any of these hosts since in reality, they all offer the same basic thing but it's hard to know how it's really being run.

I remember talking to people who were do disillusioned with the hosting industry as a whole, but they also weren't willing to put up the money for a private hosting environment.", "edited": 1492220584.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how hosting works. You have 1. Business/Personal/Shared Hosting. You&amp;#39;re given a single cPanel account, and share resources with other customers with these same plans. They place as many customers as they can on a single server (~100s-1,000s etc). Then you have 2. Reseller Hosting. It&amp;#39;s like getting sudo-root to a cPanel account. They give you WHM access that can make many other cPanel accounts, and you also share resources with other reseller hosting customers. IE. Tons of Resellers on the same server - Hundreds of more customers/web sites on the same server considering you have 20 - 100+ customer websites per reseller. Resources can always be finicky considering hosting companies are trying to make a profit. (This applies to all of them, I don&amp;#39;t care how great their marketing looks). Regardless, you&amp;#39;re looking at decent uptime and service however that 99.9% up time guarantee just means that if the servers go down for a little or a lot during the month, they&amp;#39;re paying out very small amounts of credits to each customer on the server, and you still deal with downtime and angry customers of your own. Then you have 3. VPS Hosting. Best mainly as testing environments, and alright for small amounts of clients if you&amp;#39;re trying to do reseller hosting on them. A VPS is a virtualized computer environment that mimics your own personal server. You get free range real root access, and WHM/cPanel etc. 4. And the best is a Dedicated Server (hosting). You pay the most but you provide a self contained environment for your clients, considering only your clients/your hosting is on this server. The real metal hardware version of a VPS type system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worked in the industry while in college and I gotta say, it&amp;#39;s shady as hell. You&amp;#39;re dealing with brilliant people running a full fledged data center and support/sales center, but when something happens to Level3 (data center internet provider across the country) and customers want answers, the lying is far too ridiculous. And when servers have issues or are slightly at capacity and causing problems for all customers involved, it becomes a grey area for everyone as to how to treat the situation and up selling etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also gotta say that I despise resellers that don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing. Of course, any issues are handled by the hosting company you&amp;#39;re dealing with (if you&amp;#39;re getting fully managed hosting, which is usually the case) but ultimately, your clients are relying on you as the actual host (because they signed up with you) and you should at least know what the in&amp;#39;s and out&amp;#39;s are and try to figure out what you&amp;#39;re really getting into. Anyway, It&amp;#39;s not that hard to believe that there are companies that invest in infrastructure and servers, and then allow the ants of the industry like resellers to take up space on their servers and try to make a small profit. The amount of shared/reseller/vps/ and server clients they have pales in comparison to your 15 clients websites sharing resources with thousands of others on a single server. I don&amp;#39;t mean to come off as rude, but the way you worded your post seemed a little off to me so understand that you should be there for your clients 100% when giving them the option to sign up everything they would need with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some tools to make your reseller hosting more professional is WHMS (which I think most hosts provide for free), and it allows you to setup a client portal to take customer package orders, domain registration etc. And then you add in your own ticketing system which you can have automatically forward support tickets to your web host, and keep things efficient like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And cPanel shouldn&amp;#39;t go over your head unless you&amp;#39;re dealing with windows hosting, and I don&amp;#39;t know who would put themselves through that. In any case, a single cPanel account allows you to add domains/sub-domains/addon/parked domains (etc) and email accounts for a single entity. If I remember correctly, you could technically put all your clients websites on a single cPanel accounts but then they wouldn&amp;#39;t have access to their own accounts as the cPanel user/login would need to be given out to each of them and that&amp;#39;s probably not a good idea. With a reseller, you&amp;#39;re creating multiple cpanel accounts, each for their own client/website and they would then have access to their own cPanels and be able to use web email applications and add things on their own if they wanted to you. That should help with understanding the dynamic of these type of hosting accounts. It&amp;#39;s been a while since i&amp;#39;ve been in the thick of it all so I apologize if anything is outdated. I know when I quit, hosts were starting to move away from the shared/reseller game and delving into cloud virtualization like Amazon AWS and cloud computing. (Ie. &lt;a href=\"https://www.vultr.com/\"&gt;https://www.vultr.com/&lt;/a&gt;). But I think most of big hosts still offer shared and reseller packages simply because it&amp;#39;s a tried and true service in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would stay away from GoDaddy (though they&amp;#39;re not bad, they just seem incompetent), and maybe go with Namecheap. Honestly, I&amp;#39;m not a fan of any of these hosts since in reality, they all offer the same basic thing but it&amp;#39;s hard to know how it&amp;#39;s really being run. Just make sure it&amp;#39;s a fully managed service, call their support line to see how long it takes for them to pick up, and try to research the space as much as possible. Their are a lot of bad ones, and having to move from one to the other can get really trying.

You have a \"main\" account and any accounts you \"resell\" are full accounts with their own storage, bandwidth, so on but are just placed under your \"main\" account.  You generally share the server with anywhere from 50-100 other resellers who have god knows how many accounts.\n\n2. You have a \"main\" account with a set amount of storage/bandwidth that you then \"slice\" into subaccounts. For example if you get 100GB storage, want to host 10 sites, then you have 9 subaccounts at 10GB each (10th is your main account). You generally share the server with anywhere from 50-100 other resellers who have god knows how many accounts. (I seen one guy, had about 75 accounts on his reseller plan with something like 2gb storage/bandwidth each)  \n\n3. You get a VPS or dedicated hosting plan, not an \"official\" reseller plan but a server that you can do however you want and build your own reseller setup out of that. This has its benefits and drawbacks.  The main benefit is that you are the only one who is on the server and you decide how things get allocated. \n\nBased on the information at the link it looks like what Dreamhost is offering #2. \n\nNow you think that you may be able to throw 100 websites on there and make money, but all to often people who try to resell run into other issues and I have seen so many fail usually because: \n\n1. In cases where #2 is done, you are going to hit other limits then storage/bandwidth eventually such as CPU/Memory usage.  How would you like having all your resold clients disabled because your account as a whole has exceeded CPU/Memory resources because one of your clients had a script go \"wild\"? Not good. In cases where a host does #1 properly (I've only seen two companies do this properly), only the account causing the issue will be disabled. \n\n2. You may think that you are giving up a lot of money by not hosting your clients, however you also are not dealing with the headaches of managing the nitty gritty.  Joe blow cant connect to email?  He has to contact you, if its something that you can't fix then YOU have to contact the host. The host will not deal directly with your clients. \n\n3. Clients website goes down, your unavailable for some reason, they contact the host. The host tells them they have to contact you.  This causes nothing but frustration for the host if the client keeps coming back, but also frustration for the client.  Often even if the tech support is able to do something to fix the clients issue they can not do it because they are permitted to only make changes you request since they have no idea what you may have told the client. \n\n4. Like 4am wake up calls because someone forgot their email password and has to access their email \"NOW\"? \n\nIf you really want to do reseller hosting, then I recommend: \n\nA. Don't do it until you can START on a VPS or Dedicated server. Most host reseller plans suck long term. \n\nB. Don't do it unless you can provide 24/7/365 support for your clients. \n\nIf you can't yet meet both of the above, you are better off with designing sites and letting the clients host where they want although I really do NOT recommend Godaddy , [EIG, or any EIG subsidiary company](http://researchasahobby.com/full-list-eig-hosting-companies-brands/) (which is a lot of companies and they try hard as hell to hide that they are owned by EIG) . \n\nSRC: I work tech support for a fairly large hosting company, I deal with direct clients and resellers (but never their clients) all the time.
