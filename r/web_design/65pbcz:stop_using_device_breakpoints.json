This means that you have decreasing amounts of css as the breakpoints increase. \n* Your breakpoints should be based on the screen dimensions of your users. Go into google analytics and take notes on what kinds of device widths your visitors are accessing your site with. After you do this, you will almost always find that the widths correspond to the ones used in Bootstrap. Those numbers aren't arbitrary. They were the result of a lot of research done for millions of users. That being said, for a minority of use cases your numbers may be different.

Design is measured in them. Device widths and heights are measured in them. Many, many more users simply use the zoom features in browsers rather than changing their default font sizes. If your site is more text heavy and you want to use em's to support different browser font sizes, you need to test this when laying out your columns, sections, etc. Your columns should not be based on rem's and dynamically change size.
