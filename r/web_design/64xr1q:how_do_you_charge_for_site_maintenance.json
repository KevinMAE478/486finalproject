Find better ways to solve maintenance issues that provide more value to the customer and less tedium to you, and make your money in more useful and exciting ways.\n\nThis is tricky, and it's why I don't offer \"site maintenance\" to my customers. Here's why, and how I handle the problem.\n\nThe reason that I don't charge customers for site maintenance (updating themes, plugins, WP core) is that, depending on your plugin/theme stack, you stand a fair chance of breaking something by updating. What then?  You're stuck explaining to the customer why they need to pay you to fix their site which, from their perspective, you broke in the first place.\n\n(I've seen this happen to a lot of customers that utilize WooCommerce.  They see an update, think it's always good to install updates, and essentially \"brick\" their store. Another pain point is updating sites that I didn't design that don't utilize a child theme: updating the base theme may lose all their customizations.)\n\nYes, not updating components leads to insecurity, and I'm getting to that.\n\nHere's how I solve the problem:\n\n* I don't use plugins I don't trust, and that don't provide a high level of reliability and support. Are we developers or \"plugin installers?\" Offering a feature I need is not a good enough reason to install if it's going to cause problems later.\n* I let the nature of the update dictate the update schedule.  I subscribe to feeds that tell me when someone discovers a bug or security exploit. I use this to explain the need to the client. I proceed and bill them at my hourly rate.  I give an estimate but spell out worst-case scenarios. Letting the update's necessity dictate the schedule takes the heat off of me if something breaks.\n* I don't screw around with hosting.  I host on a platform that performs daily backups and has a tweaked WP environment that protects my sites in other ways including locked-down login, blacklisting, etc. so constant updating is slightly less of a factor.  I pay a premium for these services, and in exchange, I charge my clients a premium too. I've never had a complaint because my customers understand they're getting value for their money.\n\nIn conclusion: I am making recurring income through quality hosting and staying current on plugin issues and providing updates as needed, rather than by providing tedious monthly maintenance.  I'm making money, my customers are getting a value, and it keeps me focused on work I find interesting.  It works for me.
