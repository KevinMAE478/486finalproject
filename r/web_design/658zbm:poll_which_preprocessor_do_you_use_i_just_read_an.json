No, not really. There are some differences in thinking but you can easily overcome that. With grunt everything is abstracted, you have to rely on extensions that you install. With gulp is a little bit better cause there is that monadic aspect to it, but it's still very abstracted and you have to rely on that extensions are updated. \nNode scripts are little bit annoying to maintain. Cause every single change will execute everyting. Or you have to make manual checks if the file should be changed.\nMake file is by default parallel and it will check if the file is updated or not. It works great with tools like svg-store, svgo, less, browserify, uglify, mocha and dozen others. You just have to make intermediate files that make can read upon.
