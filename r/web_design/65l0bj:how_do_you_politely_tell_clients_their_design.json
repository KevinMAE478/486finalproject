If you don&amp;#39;t strongly suggest, point out to client you were hired for your design expertise not for them to design and for you be a photoshop monkey. I personally am strict with my idea of professional quality leaving the office so I make it clear to clients at the start as the agency owner I can veto a project for quality, ethical reasons. The issue arises from poor brief, defined deliverables, conditions in the contract at the start. Yes, some clients are total nut bags, but well defined briefs keep those fuckers in check and can save your ass if it all goes wrong. If your contract says do what they want at their whim your setting yourself up for issues. If your contract says you can create xyz based on this research and brief and you get paid your good.
