Trillions of dollars of the US economy are devoted to executing the wishes of people who died long ago, rather than satisfying the needs, preferences, and values of those living now. Philosopher Barry Lam follows the story of the Hershey fortune to show how a 19th century industrialist constructed the oddest business structure to ensure that his idiosyncratic wishes would be fulfilled hundreds of years after his death. The story raises questions about why we give the dead so much power over our lives, and what this says about how we find meaning in our own lives given foreknowledge of our mortality.\n\n**Hi-Phi Nation**:\n\n[Hi-Phi Nation](https://hiphination.org/) is the first narrative, sound-and-story-driven podcast about philosophy, where each episode brings you a story and then draws the philosophical conflicts out of the story. The show connects philosophy with investigative reporting, the arts, science, religion, policy, and law. We just completed the inaugural season and are gearing up for season two.\n\n**Donate**:\n\nHi-Phi Nation is a high-production seasonal show, and is completely independently produced.
