We first encountered this theme, albeit briefly, in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5wllsk/kierkegaards_the_lilies_and_the_birds_discourse/\"&gt;second discourse&lt;/a&gt; of Part Two, and it will arise again in subsequent discourses of Part Three. Christ is addressed as the believer\u2019s existential prototype \u201cwho left footprints that we should follow,\u201d as well as his or her comforter, strengthener, future judge, and the one with whom she or he may experience \u201ceternal happiness\u201d in \u201cthe life to come\u201d (p. 217).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Gospel text of this discourse is Luke 14:27: \u201cWhoever does not carry his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.\u201d Eschewing universalism and embracing Christianity\u2019s scandal of particularity, Kierkegaard asserts that \u201cthough errors are numerous, truth is still only one, and there is only one who is \u2018the Way and the Life,\u2019 only one guidance that in truth leads a person through life to life. Thousands upon thousands carry a name by which it is indicated that they have chosen this guidance, that they belong to the Lord Jesus Christ, after whom they call themselves Christians, that they are his bond-servants, whether they be masters or servants, slaves or freeborn, men or women\u201d (p. 217). Kierkegaard observes that they call themselves by many names\u2014Christians, believers, the communion of saints, cross-bearers, and followers of Christ\u2014and remarks that \u201call of them designate the relation to this one guidance\u201d (pp. 217-18). The present discourse, he says, will focus on the last of these names: \u201cfollowers of Christ.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Analyzing what it means \u201cto follow,\u201d Kierkegaard maintains that it is only when the warrior steps aside, when the teacher hides himself, that the squire, the student, etc. can truly have the opportunity to become a \u201cfollower\u201d (pp. 218-219). \u201cTo follow, then, means to walk along the same road walked by the one whom one is following; it means, therefore, that he is no longer visibly walking ahead [of one]\u201d (p. 219). When a child is learning to walk, the mother \u201cmust make herself invisible\u201d so that it is \u201cno longer permitted to hold onto its mother\u2019s dress\u201d (pp. 219-20). \u201cBut what it means for the child to have to learn to walk by itself and to walk alone is, spiritually speaking, the task assigned to the person who is to be someone\u2019s follower\u2014he must learn to walk by himself and to walk alone.\u201d The terror of walking this path is that it means \u201cto have to choose by oneself, to scream in vain as the child screams in vain since the mother does not dare to be of visible help, to despair in vain since no one can help and heaven does not dare to be of visible help.\u201d Granted, \u201cyou will surely find fellow pilgrims, but in the decisive moment and every time there is mortal danger you will be by yourself\u201d (p. 220).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does he mean \u201cby yourself\u201d &lt;em&gt;in relation to other followers&lt;/em&gt;, and not in relation to the aforementioned divine guidance? Assuredly, but even &lt;em&gt;heaven\u2019s&lt;/em&gt; help does not come to our aid in the conventional manner. Heaven\u2019s help, for Kierkegaard, \u201cdoes not come from outside and grasp your hand,\u201d but is the inward training whereby one learns to walk alone through self-denial and total devotion. So \u201cto &lt;em&gt;follow Christ&lt;/em&gt; means \u2026 to carry one\u2019s cross,\u201d which means, in turn, \u201cto deny oneself\u201d\u2014a \u201c&lt;em&gt;slow and difficult task&lt;/em&gt; \u2026, a heavy cross to take up, a heavy cross to bear, and one that, according to the prototype\u2019s instructions, is to be carried in obedience unto death, so that the imitator, even if he does not die on the cross, nevertheless resembles the prototype in dying \u2018with the cross on\u2019,\u201d so to speak (p. 221).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As those know who have read Kierkegaard\u2019s &lt;em&gt;Fear and Trembling&lt;/em&gt;, faith for Kierkegaard is a lifelong task. So too here, taking up one\u2019s cross and &lt;em&gt;carrying&lt;/em&gt; that cross \u201cmust take place daily, not once and for all\u201d and\u2014in line with another dominant theme in Kierkegaard\u2014\u201cthere must not be anything, anything at all, that the follower would not be willing to give up in self-denial\u201d (p. 222). As the pseudonym Johannes Climacus puts it elsewhere, the task is to relate oneself \u201cabsolutely\u201d to the absolute and \u201crelatively\u201d to the relative (see &lt;em&gt;Concluding Unscientific Postscript&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 393ff., esp. p. 407).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is not all. Not only is following Christ said to be a &lt;em&gt;lifelong task&lt;/em&gt;, and one whose requirement is &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt;, it also means \u201cto deny oneself and means to &lt;em&gt;walk the same road&lt;/em&gt; Christ walked in the lowly form of a servant, indigent, forsaken, mocked, not loving the world and not loved by it. Therefore it means &lt;em&gt;to walk by oneself&lt;/em&gt;, since the person who in self-denial renounces the world and all that is of the world renounces every connection that ordinarily tempts and captures\u201d (p. 223).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kierkegaard also observes that self-denial is not performed for the sake of self-denial. Kierkegaard does not champion a self-validating asceticism. For \u201ceternity will not ask about what &lt;em&gt;worldly things&lt;/em&gt; remain &lt;em&gt;behind you&lt;/em&gt; in the world\u201d\u2014i.e., what you have given up in self-denial\u2014but \u201cwill ask about what riches you have gathered in heaven, about how often you have conquered your own mind, about what control you have exercised over yourself or whether you have been a slave [to your worldly loves], about how often you have mastered yourself in self-denial\u2026, about how often you in self-denial have been willing to make a sacrifice for a good cause\u2026, about how often you in self-denial have forgiven your enemy, whether seven times or seventy times seven times, about how often you in self-denial endured insults patiently, about what you have suffered, not for your own sake, for your own selfish interests\u2019 sake, but what you in self-denial have suffered for God\u2019s sake\u201d (pp. 223-4).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before turning to the concluding section of this discourse, Kierkegaard returns our attention to Christ, considering his status as judge and prototype. Indeed, Kierkegaard links these two roles inseparably: the eternal one who will interrogate us about the above \u201cwas not a military commander who conquered kingdoms and countries, one with whom you could talk about your worldly exploits; his kingdom was specifically not of this world.\u201d So Christ as judge \u201cdoes not merely know what self-denial is,\u201d but \u201chis presence [itself] is the judging that makes everything that looked so good, which was heard and seen with admiration in the world, become silent and turn pale; his presence is the judging, because he was [as prototype, the very essence of] self-denial\u201d (p. 224). Christ is the paradox: both eternal judge on high, and servant in lowliness. Anticipating this theme of Christ\u2019s lowliness as indivisible from his loftiness, which he will treat at length in &lt;em&gt;Practice in Christianity&lt;/em&gt;, Kierkegaard elaborates further:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe who was equal with God took the form of a lowly servant, he who could command legions of angels, indeed, could command the world\u2019s creation and its destruction, he walked about defenseless; he who had everything in his power surrendered all power and could not even do anything for his beloved disciples but could only offer them the very same conditions of lowliness and contempt; he who was the lord of creation constrained nature itself to keep quiet, for it was not until he had given up his spirit that the curtain tore and the graves opened and the powers of nature betrayed who he was: if this is not self-denial, what then is self-denial!\u201d (pp.  224-5).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the final section of this discourse, we turn from the meaning of following Christ to \u201cconsider the &lt;em&gt;joy in this thought&lt;/em&gt;.\u201d Here we are to \u201cimagine a young man standing on the threshold of his life, where many roads lie open before him,\u201d the man \u201casking himself which career he would like to follow,\u201d etc. He makes \u201ccareful inquiries\u201d as to \u201cwhere each particular road leads or, what amounts to the same thing, [tries] to find out who has walked this road previously.\u201d We may mention to him an abundance of names in accord with the man\u2019s potential, but \u201che himself, driven by an inner need, narrows the choice, and finally there remains only one, a single one, who in his eyes and according to his heart is the most excellent of all.\u201d Indeed, \u201cthe young man\u2019s heart beats violently when he enthusiastically mentions this name, to him the one and only name, and says: Along this road I will walk, because he walked along this road!\u201d (p. 225).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now there \u201cmust be several roads, since a person is to choose, but there also must be just one to choose if the earnestness of eternity is to rest upon the choice,\u201d i.e., if the choice is not to be a matter of arbitrariness or indifference. \u201cThere must unconditionally be everything to gain and everything to lose in the choice,\u201d lest it be without any existential significance (ibid.). Kierkegaard\u2019s own choice\u2014unsurprisingly from the standpoint of his authorial project, and the primary audience of the present work\u2014is Christ. Thus: \u201cThere is only one name in heaven and on earth, only one road, only one prototype. The person who chooses to follow Christ chooses the name that is above every name, the prototype that is supremely lifted up above all heavens, but yet at the same time is human in such a way that it can be the prototype for a human being, that it is named and shall be named in heaven &lt;em&gt;and on earth&lt;/em&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; places, as the highest name\u201d (pp. 225-6, my emphasis).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By means of this paradox, the paradoxical judge-prototype\u2014&lt;em&gt;lowly&lt;/em&gt; Lord, &lt;em&gt;modest&lt;/em&gt; King, &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; God, the Name in both heaven &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; earth\u2014Kierkegaard flips our concepts, our expectations, of mortal superiority and inferiority: \u201cIs it really so glorious to become &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; superior person no one else can become; is it not disconsolate instead! Is it so glorious to dine on silver when others starve, to live in palaces when so many are homeless, to be the scholar no ordinary person can become, to have a name in the sense that excludes thousands and thousands\u2014is that so glorious! If this, the &lt;em&gt;envious&lt;/em&gt; diversity of &lt;em&gt;mortal life&lt;/em&gt; were supreme, would it not be inhuman, and would not life be unbearable for the fortunate!\u201d How inhuman, how alienating! (You might as well be from Krypton.) \u201cHow different, on the other hand, if the only joy is to follow Christ,\u201d something that \u201cevery human being can do\u201d (p. 226).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only is Christ himself the paradox, however, so too is the road he travels\u2014along which his followers must sojourn\u2014hemmed in by the paradoxical. \u201cAlong this road \u2026 the greatest suffering is the closest to perfection.\u201d The \u201ceternal road safety\u201d the very \u201c \u2018road signs\u2019 of suffering\u201d provide \u201cthe joyous signs that one is going ahead on the right road\u201d (p. 227). What strange security! And one should not think Christ has, by going ahead, simply cleared away the obstacles for those who follow him: \u201cA human predecessor can sometimes justifiably say: Now it is quite easy to go afterward, since the road has been cleared and prepared and the gate is wide. Christ, on the other hand, must say: Behold, everything is prepared in heaven\u2014if you are prepared to walk through the narrow gate of self-denial and along its hard road\u201d (p. 228). (Cf. &lt;em&gt;Christian Discourses&lt;/em&gt;, Part Two, Discourse VII: \u201cThe Joy of It: That Adversity Is Prosperity.\u201d)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But only if this heaven is truly a reality for such a person can she or he follow that road. For \u201che cannot have his place in the world he has given up\u2014therefore there must be another place\u2014indeed, there must be in order for him to be able to give up the world.\u201d Accordingly, Kierkegaard gives us what almost amounts to an ontological argument for the existence of heaven: \u201cIf there were no eternal happiness in the life to come, it seems to me that just out of compassion for a person [who renounces all the world\u2019s goods and bears all its evils] that it must come into existence\u201d (p. 228). And so he goes on to say, \u201cThat there is this eternal happiness is most gloriously demonstrated by Paul, for there can be no doubt whatever that without it he would have been of all men the most miserable\u201d (p. 229). Yet this is not to provide an apologetic for the Christian eschaton (which would make no sense given Kierkegaard\u2019s audience). Further, he is quick to remark, concerning judging the status of another\u2019s faith, \u201clet no one judge, or each person only himself, since wanting to judge someone else in this regard is only another attempt to secure oneself in this world\u2026\u201d (ibid.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kierkegaard concludes the discourse with his own choice, which he asserts with the enthusiasm of the young man he had mentioned above, yet without authority\u2014without arrogating to himself the authority to make that choice for another. For his readers, it remains an either/or, a matter of decision, not a bit of information that can be learned. But for Kierkegaard\u2026 \u201cBetween heaven and earth there is only one road: to follow Christ. In time and eternity there is only one choice, one single choice: to choose this road. There is only one eternal hope on this earth: to follow Christ into heaven. There is one blessed joy in this life: to follow Christ; and in death there is one final blessed joy\u2014to follow Christ to life!\u201d (ibid.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next&lt;/em&gt;: \u201cThe Gospel of Sufferings,\u201d Discourse II: \u201cBut How Can the Burden Be Light if the Suffering Is Heavy?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(For previous posts, see &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ExistentialChristian/comments/3pblkf/posts_on_kierkegaard/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; under \u2018Reading Kierkegaard\u2019s &lt;em&gt;Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits&lt;/em&gt;\u2019.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "The first discourse of \u201cThe Gospel of Sufferings\u201d\u2014[Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5yrr9v/kierkegaards_upbuilding_discourses_in_various/) of Kierkegaard\u2019s *Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits*\u2014is on the theme \u201cWhat Meaning and What Joy There Are in the Thought of Following Christ.\u201d It opens with [a prayer](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExistentialChristian/comments/5yupkf/a_prayer_of_kierkegaard/) addressed to Christ which reintroduces the theme of \u2018prototype\u2019. We first encountered this theme, albeit briefly, in the [second discourse](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5wllsk/kierkegaards_the_lilies_and_the_birds_discourse/) of Part Two, and it will arise again in subsequent discourses of Part Three. Christ is addressed as the believer\u2019s existential prototype \u201cwho left footprints that we should follow,\u201d as well as his or her comforter, strengthener, future judge, and the one with whom she or he may experience \u201ceternal happiness\u201d in \u201cthe life to come\u201d (p. 217).\n\nThe Gospel text of this discourse is Luke 14:27: \u201cWhoever does not carry his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.\u201d Eschewing universalism and embracing Christianity\u2019s scandal of particularity, Kierkegaard asserts that \u201cthough errors are numerous, truth is still only one, and there is only one who is \u2018the Way and the Life,\u2019 only one guidance that in truth leads a person through life to life. Thousands upon thousands carry a name by which it is indicated that they have chosen this guidance, that they belong to the Lord Jesus Christ, after whom they call themselves Christians, that they are his bond-servants, whether they be masters or servants, slaves or freeborn, men or women\u201d (p. 217). Kierkegaard observes that they call themselves by many names\u2014Christians, believers, the communion of saints, cross-bearers, and followers of Christ\u2014and remarks that \u201call of them designate the relation to this one guidance\u201d (pp. 217-18). The present discourse, he says, will focus on the last of these names: \u201cfollowers of Christ.\u201d\n\nAnalyzing what it means \u201cto follow,\u201d Kierkegaard maintains that it is only when the warrior steps aside, when the teacher hides himself, that the squire, the student, etc. can truly have the opportunity to become a \u201cfollower\u201d (pp. 218-219). \u201cTo follow, then, means to walk along the same road walked by the one whom one is following; it means, therefore, that he is no longer visibly walking ahead [of one]\u201d (p. 219). When a child is learning to walk, the mother \u201cmust make herself invisible\u201d so that it is \u201cno longer permitted to hold onto its mother\u2019s dress\u201d (pp. 219-20). \u201cBut what it means for the child to have to learn to walk by itself and to walk alone is, spiritually speaking, the task assigned to the person who is to be someone\u2019s follower\u2014he must learn to walk by himself and to walk alone.\u201d The terror of walking this path is that it means \u201cto have to choose by oneself, to scream in vain as the child screams in vain since the mother does not dare to be of visible help, to despair in vain since no one can help and heaven does not dare to be of visible help.\u201d Granted, \u201cyou will surely find fellow pilgrims, but in the decisive moment and every time there is mortal danger you will be by yourself\u201d (p. 220).\n\nDoes he mean \u201cby yourself\u201d *in relation to other followers*, and not in relation to the aforementioned divine guidance? Assuredly, but even *heaven\u2019s* help does not come to our aid in the conventional manner. Heaven\u2019s help, for Kierkegaard, \u201cdoes not come from outside and grasp your hand,\u201d but is the inward training whereby one learns to walk alone through self-denial and total devotion. So \u201cto *follow Christ* means \u2026 to carry one\u2019s cross,\u201d which means, in turn, \u201cto deny oneself\u201d\u2014a \u201c*slow and difficult task* \u2026, a heavy cross to take up, a heavy cross to bear, and one that, according to the prototype\u2019s instructions, is to be carried in obedience unto death, so that the imitator, even if he does not die on the cross, nevertheless resembles the prototype in dying \u2018with the cross on\u2019,\u201d so to speak (p. 221).\n\nAs those know who have read Kierkegaard\u2019s *Fear and Trembling*, faith for Kierkegaard is a lifelong task. So too here, taking up one\u2019s cross and *carrying* that cross \u201cmust take place daily, not once and for all\u201d and\u2014in line with another dominant theme in Kierkegaard\u2014\u201cthere must not be anything, anything at all, that the follower would not be willing to give up in self-denial\u201d (p. 222). As the pseudonym Johannes Climacus puts it elsewhere, the task is to relate oneself \u201cabsolutely\u201d to the absolute and \u201crelatively\u201d to the relative (see *Concluding Unscientific Postscript*, pp. 393ff., esp. p. 407).\n\nThat is not all. Not only is following Christ said to be a *lifelong task*, and one whose requirement is *absolute*, it also means \u201cto deny oneself and means to *walk the same road* Christ walked in the lowly form of a servant, indigent, forsaken, mocked, not loving the world and not loved by it. Therefore it means *to walk by oneself*, since the person who in self-denial renounces the world and all that is of the world renounces every connection that ordinarily tempts and captures\u201d (p. 223).\n\nKierkegaard also observes that self-denial is not performed for the sake of self-denial. Kierkegaard does not champion a self-validating asceticism. For \u201ceternity will not ask about what *worldly things* remain *behind you* in the world\u201d\u2014i.e., what you have given up in self-denial\u2014but \u201cwill ask about what riches you have gathered in heaven, about how often you have conquered your own mind, about what control you have exercised over yourself or whether you have been a slave [to your worldly loves], about how often you have mastered yourself in self-denial\u2026, about how often you in self-denial have been willing to make a sacrifice for a good cause\u2026, about how often you in self-denial have forgiven your enemy, whether seven times or seventy times seven times, about how often you in self-denial endured insults patiently, about what you have suffered, not for your own sake, for your own selfish interests\u2019 sake, but what you in self-denial have suffered for God\u2019s sake\u201d (pp. 223-4).\n\nBefore turning to the concluding section of this discourse, Kierkegaard returns our attention to Christ, considering his status as judge and prototype. Indeed, Kierkegaard links these two roles inseparably: the eternal one who will interrogate us about the above \u201cwas not a military commander who conquered kingdoms and countries, one with whom you could talk about your worldly exploits; his kingdom was specifically not of this world.\u201d So Christ as judge \u201cdoes not merely know what self-denial is,\u201d but \u201chis presence [itself] is the judging that makes everything that looked so good, which was heard and seen with admiration in the world, become silent and turn pale; his presence is the judging, because he was [as prototype, the very essence of] self-denial\u201d (p. 224). Christ is the paradox: both eternal judge on high, and servant in lowliness. Anticipating this theme of Christ\u2019s lowliness as indivisible from his loftiness, which he will treat at length in *Practice in Christianity*, Kierkegaard elaborates further:\n\n\u201cHe who was equal with God took the form of a lowly servant, he who could command legions of angels, indeed, could command the world\u2019s creation and its destruction, he walked about defenseless; he who had everything in his power surrendered all power and could not even do anything for his beloved disciples but could only offer them the very same conditions of lowliness and contempt; he who was the lord of creation constrained nature itself to keep quiet, for it was not until he had given up his spirit that the curtain tore and the graves opened and the powers of nature betrayed who he was: if this is not self-denial, what then is self-denial!\u201d (pp.  224-5).\n\nIn the final section of this discourse, we turn from the meaning of following Christ to \u201cconsider the *joy in this thought*.\u201d Here we are to \u201cimagine a young man standing on the threshold of his life, where many roads lie open before him,\u201d the man \u201casking himself which career he would like to follow,\u201d etc. He makes \u201ccareful inquiries\u201d as to \u201cwhere each particular road leads or, what amounts to the same thing, [tries] to find out who has walked this road previously.\u201d We may mention to him an abundance of names in accord with the man\u2019s potential, but \u201che himself, driven by an inner need, narrows the choice, and finally there remains only one, a single one, who in his eyes and according to his heart is the most excellent of all.\u201d Indeed, \u201cthe young man\u2019s heart beats violently when he enthusiastically mentions this name, to him the one and only name, and says: Along this road I will walk, because he walked along this road!\u201d (p. 225).\n\nNow there \u201cmust be several roads, since a person is to choose, but there also must be just one to choose if the earnestness of eternity is to rest upon the choice,\u201d i.e., if the choice is not to be a matter of arbitrariness or indifference. \u201cThere must unconditionally be everything to gain and everything to lose in the choice,\u201d lest it be without any existential significance (ibid.). Kierkegaard\u2019s own choice\u2014unsurprisingly from the standpoint of his authorial project, and the primary audience of the present work\u2014is Christ. Thus: \u201cThere is only one name in heaven and on earth, only one road, only one prototype. The person who chooses to follow Christ chooses the name that is above every name, the prototype that is supremely lifted up above all heavens, but yet at the same time is human in such a way that it can be the prototype for a human being, that it is named and shall be named in heaven *and on earth*, in *both* places, as the highest name\u201d (pp. 225-6, my emphasis).\n\nBy means of this paradox, the paradoxical judge-prototype\u2014*lowly* Lord, *modest* King, *human* God, the Name in both heaven *and* earth\u2014Kierkegaard flips our concepts, our expectations, of mortal superiority and inferiority: \u201cIs it really so glorious to become *the* superior person no one else can become; is it not disconsolate instead! Is it so glorious to dine on silver when others starve, to live in palaces when so many are homeless, to be the scholar no ordinary person can become, to have a name in the sense that excludes thousands and thousands\u2014is that so glorious! If this, the *envious* diversity of *mortal life* were supreme, would it not be inhuman, and would not life be unbearable for the fortunate!\u201d How inhuman, how alienating! (You might as well be from Krypton.) \u201cHow different, on the other hand, if the only joy is to follow Christ,\u201d something that \u201cevery human being can do\u201d (p. 226).\n\nNot only is Christ himself the paradox, however, so too is the road he travels\u2014along which his followers must sojourn\u2014hemmed in by the paradoxical. \u201cAlong this road \u2026 the greatest suffering is the closest to perfection.\u201d The \u201ceternal road safety\u201d the very \u201c \u2018road signs\u2019 of suffering\u201d provide \u201cthe joyous signs that one is going ahead on the right road\u201d (p. 227). What strange security! And one should not think Christ has, by going ahead, simply cleared away the obstacles for those who follow him: \u201cA human predecessor can sometimes justifiably say: Now it is quite easy to go afterward, since the road has been cleared and prepared and the gate is wide. Christ, on the other hand, must say: Behold, everything is prepared in heaven\u2014if you are prepared to walk through the narrow gate of self-denial and along its hard road\u201d (p. 228). (Cf. *Christian Discourses*, Part Two, Discourse VII: \u201cThe Joy of It: That Adversity Is Prosperity.\u201d)\n\nBut only if this heaven is truly a reality for such a person can she or he follow that road. For \u201che cannot have his place in the world he has given up\u2014therefore there must be another place\u2014indeed, there must be in order for him to be able to give up the world.\u201d Accordingly, Kierkegaard gives us what almost amounts to an ontological argument for the existence of heaven: \u201cIf there were no eternal happiness in the life to come, it seems to me that just out of compassion for a person [who renounces all the world\u2019s goods and bears all its evils] that it must come into existence\u201d (p. 228). And so he goes on to say, \u201cThat there is this eternal happiness is most gloriously demonstrated by Paul, for there can be no doubt whatever that without it he would have been of all men the most miserable\u201d (p. 229). Yet this is not to provide an apologetic for the Christian eschaton (which would make no sense given Kierkegaard\u2019s audience). Further, he is quick to remark, concerning judging the status of another\u2019s faith, \u201clet no one judge, or each person only himself, since wanting to judge someone else in this regard is only another attempt to secure oneself in this world\u2026\u201d (ibid.).\n\nKierkegaard concludes the discourse with his own choice, which he asserts with the enthusiasm of the young man he had mentioned above, yet without authority\u2014without arrogating to himself the authority to make that choice for another. For his readers, it remains an either/or, a matter of decision, not a bit of information that can be learned. But for Kierkegaard\u2026 \u201cBetween heaven and earth there is only one road: to follow Christ. In time and eternity there is only one choice, one single choice: to choose this road. There is only one eternal hope on this earth: to follow Christ into heaven. There is one blessed joy in this life: to follow Christ; and in death there is one final blessed joy\u2014to follow Christ to life!\u201d (ibid.).\n\n*Next*: \u201cThe Gospel of Sufferings,\u201d
