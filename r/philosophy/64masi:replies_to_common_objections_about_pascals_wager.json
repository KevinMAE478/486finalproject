Anyway, I'm going to attempt something of a summary of the conversation on which feedback would be welcome, but I'm not sure how much more I'll be able to engage. (There\u2019s a Tl;dr at the end because it turned into a book.)\n\nI need to first clarify what exactly the wager is good for as I think this is a source of confusion.  It is *not* good for proving god(s) existence \u2013that is, its not a metaphysical proof.  It *is* good for deciding what you should do given how you think about the existence of god(s) \u2013 that is, it is an exploration of *rational* decision making based on the probabilistic status of god(s) existence. Importantly, this is *your* probabilistic evaluation, it does not matter for PW to proceed what the actual probability is or how close you are to it.  You should of course try to be correct, but PW is about rational action based on probabilistic evaluation, not about the evaluation itself.  So PW has a narrow scope but, if it is valid, it has profound implications for acceptance/belief in god given how you affirm the premises.  \n\n**First \u2013 is it valid?** \n\nAfter the pushback in this thread, **I'm still comfortable asserting the expected utility version of PW as presented in the linked article is valid and coherent**.  There was no knockdown argument presented against the logic of PW.  When I read the article, I thought if the argument were to be undermined from a logical standpoint, it would be in the math of the infinite expected utility calculations.  As it stands now, I think the math checks out, but I'll grant infinity is weird and there may yet be unexplored difficulties.  \n\n*Pushback 1.a - You could add different outcome categories beyond the four presented in the article, which undermines the deduction.*\n\nEven if you granted that there is a god who punished you for believing in other gods or if a god punished you for insincere belief, that changes the likelihood calculation for which god exists (eg if god that hates insincere belief is most likely, go with that god), but which option you should bet on can still be deduced by the logic of maximizing your chance of achieve the desired outcome.  So PW remains valid.\n\n*Pushback 1.b \u2013 It is possible there infinitely many gods to be believed in, this would include gods that punish for wrong/insincere belief, making the probability of one god relative to other gods impossible to calculate.  So even if I assessed pr(existence of god1)=0.01%, given infinitely many choices and given that some of these choices include gods that punish for wrong/insincere belief, I can\u2019t possibly make a probabilistic decision about god1, thus the conclusion does not follow from the premises.*\n\nThis is actually a fancy restatement of pushback 1.a, and it does not trivialize the probability calculus, ie. there is at least one valid method to assess the probability of which god exists.  All I have to do is mentally bracket the infinitely many permutations of gods that punish for wrong/insincere belief into a set of say, belief-inverse gods (BIGs), {BIG1, BIG2\u2026BIGInfinite}. I can still mentally assign a probability of the existence of this set as a limit: limn-&gt; infinity pr[set{BIG1\u2026n}] =0.001%.  This implies there is a point where additional gods in the set of BIGs add diminishing amounts of probability to it.  Is this step justified? I think so given the nature of the God that I find plausible and given that it seems more plausible to me a God would honor my sincere attempt to find my way to him vs. my spurious belief in a counterfactual.  This is just my cursory assessment, and I\u2019m sure most of you had immediate problems with that assessment, but that is irrelevant for this point.  The point here is: there exists a logical operation that does not render the probability assessment impossible, despite the possible existence of BIGs. \n\n*Pushback 2 - the utility calculation will result in infinite expected utility no matter which god you go with, so the probability of a gods existence is trivial.*\n\nI believe this to be a procedural confusion in the math.  **The decision is not**: based on the expected payout of each option (probability(godC) x utility of belief(godC)), what is the best decision to make. This is the operation I use to decide that it is rational to pursue one of these gods based on the infinite utility I expect to receive. **The decision is**: of the gods that provide infinite utility, which one is most likely to exist.  In other words, I want this infinite payout, I\u2019m going to go with whichever god I think is most likely to get me there. Even though infinity is a weirdo, in this argument it is functioning as a categorical variable of which gods qualify for consideration and is not factoring into the calculation itself. I see no logical reason that would prohibit the latter procedure after I\u2019ve affirmed the value of the former. The former is answering the question, \u201cis it worth it?\u201d the latter is answering the question \u201chow do I get it?\u201d\n\n**Therefore**, given that the logic of the argument is valid at this point, I see that it has **implications for 3 groups of people**.  The difference in each group is how they affirm or deny the premises. \n\n**Group 1 - Agnostics who think it a god could possibly exist, no matter how miniscule the possibility**\n\nI think the argument is most important for this camp.  If you fall into the category, it implies **you**, yes you, should rationally accept the specific God (that will give you infinite utility) that you think has the highest probability of existence.\n\n*Pushback 3 - you're crazy if you think I'll believe in something that I think has a .00001% chance of existence. No one does that. That\u2019s not belief.*\n\nYou may bring an umbrella to work if you're in your best suit and there\u2019s a 10% chance of rain.  You may take out life insurance to protect your family even if you think you'll live to 90. **reply: Yeah, but insurance is not belief** Who's to say what is the character of belief that the god will accept? I certainly couldn't tell you that the Christian God wouldn't accept that. For all I know, he appreciates the thoughtfulness that you put toward the question and your effortful mental assent given what you know is the rational course of action. Many of the great saints throughout history wrestled with doubt and unbelief.  Given the payout, the effort is worth it, as long as there is a non-zero probability that your belief/acceptance/acting \"as if it's true\u201d will be accepted.  \n\n*Pushback 4 \u2013 I\u2019ll roll the dice and chance it rather than act \u201cas if it\u2019s true.\u201d*\n\nThat\u2019s fine, you can do that, but at this point you\u2019re not acting rationally, (eg. to obtain infinite utility, because it seems very irrational to not try to obtain infinite utility), you\u2019re acting according to some other value system.  This is fine, we humans do it all the time, but you lot extoll the virtues of rationality as supreme, and you certainly can\u2019t let the theists be the rational ones.  That would ruin a good number of memes.   You\u2019ll have to either let the rationality thing go or let this type of pushback go.  \n\n*Pushback 5 \u2013 But god is a jerk! Look at all the evil in the world!*\n\nSame reply as in pushback 4.  I thought this was worth including because it comes up so much.  \n\n*Pushback 6- I\u2019ll take disutility from belief such that it will outweigh the utility of belief, thus preserving my rational decision to not accept the god.*\n\nThis confusion is why my answer to pushback 2 is important.  This is asking the question, \u201cis it worth it given the potential disutility of belief?\u201d and any finite disutility will disappear next to the possibility of infinite utility.  Therefore, the disutility of belief if god doesn\u2019t exist cannot outweigh the expected infinite utility of belief if god does exist.\n\n**Group 2 \u2013 Atheists with who think there\u2019s zero probability of God\u2019s existence**\n\nMost of the replies here fall in this group, which is no surprise.  It\u2019s important to point out that you\u2019re concluding, \u201cthere is no god that could possibly give infinite utility\u201d, but the argument itself remains valid and intact. **That PW is valid means that if ever in your life a faint spark of cognition assents to the miniscule possibility of a gods existence (who would grant infinite utility based on belief status), then you are still rationally bound to bet on this god**.  So no, PW doesn\u2019t prove god\u2019s existence, but it does profoundly lower the threshold of rational acceptance for the atheist (that is, you shouldn\u2019t accept God only when you conclude it is more probable than not that he exists, but rather you should accept him when you grant it is *merely possible* that he exists).   \n\n*Pushback 7 \u2013 Flying spaghetti monster, video game god, Puff the magic dragon, my third toe are just as likely to be gods as any of the gods you actually have in mind.*\n\nIn essence, this is pejoratively saying, \u201cthere are infinitely many possible gods, and they are all equally likely to exist\u201d.  I think you\u2019re still safe here, but you\u2019re one step closer to accepting a god than the \u201cprobability zero\u201d crowd above.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019re rationally committed to accept at this point because of the possibility of malevolent gods or gods that reward a certain type of belief, as outlined in pushback 1.b, but you\u2019re still on the hook to rationally accept a god when, to whatever infinitesimal degree, he rises above the pack.  \n\n**Group 3 \u2013 Believers** - This is further support that we are rational in our belief/action/acceptance of a god that we have good reason to think exists. No pushback here.  \n", "edited": 1492318033.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=\"/u/bob_1024\"&gt;/u/bob_1024&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/JacksonHarrisson\"&gt;/u/JacksonHarrisson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/osteomata\"&gt;/u/osteomata&lt;/a&gt; and the rest, I appreciate the conversation here.  I&amp;#39;ve found myself with something like 12 interlocutors, and I&amp;#39;m unable to sustain productive conversations on so many fronts (plus I have looming work commitments and a new baby at home, so there\u2019s that).  Anyway, I&amp;#39;m going to attempt something of a summary of the conversation on which feedback would be welcome, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how much more I&amp;#39;ll be able to engage. (There\u2019s a Tl;dr at the end because it turned into a book.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need to first clarify what exactly the wager is good for as I think this is a source of confusion.  It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; good for proving god(s) existence \u2013that is, its not a metaphysical proof.  It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; good for deciding what you should do given how you think about the existence of god(s) \u2013 that is, it is an exploration of &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; decision making based on the probabilistic status of god(s) existence. Importantly, this is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; probabilistic evaluation, it does not matter for PW to proceed what the actual probability is or how close you are to it.  You should of course try to be correct, but PW is about rational action based on probabilistic evaluation, not about the evaluation itself.  So PW has a narrow scope but, if it is valid, it has profound implications for acceptance/belief in god given how you affirm the premises.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First \u2013 is it valid?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the pushback in this thread, &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m still comfortable asserting the expected utility version of PW as presented in the linked article is valid and coherent&lt;/strong&gt;.
