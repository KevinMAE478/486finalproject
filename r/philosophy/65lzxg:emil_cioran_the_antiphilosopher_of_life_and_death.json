Second, certain types of functional impairment of the brain can produce all sorts of odd phenomena such as confabulation, alien hand syndrome, etc., which indicate we can be aware of and respond to our environment even as we firmly deny such awareness. This hardly constitutes proof that awareness, thought, etc. and the brain are separate, but it does show that humans can verbally deny awareness and thought while nonetheless exhibiting clear signs of both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially, we&amp;#39;ve found ways to ensure someone does not recall having thought or been aware, and ways to ensure someone cannot take the action of verbally reporting having thought or been aware, but we have no solid evidence that failure to recall or report thought and awareness equates to an actual lack of thought or awareness. To the contrary, we&amp;#39;ve actually found some (weak) evidence that we can have thoughts and awareness and nonetheless go on to forget and/or fail to report them, and that interference with nervous function can reliably produce such phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "philosophy", "name": "t1_dgbdjih", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492329393.0, "created_utc": 1492300593.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lzxg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lzxg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lzxg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lzxg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc38kh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rattatally", "parent_id": "t1_dgbyio1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/philosophy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No, I can't prove unicorns.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I can&amp;#39;t prove unicorns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "philosophy", "name": "t1_dgc38kh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492382134.0, "created_utc": 1492353334.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbyio1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SuperAlexIY", "parent_id": "t1_dgbws24", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/philosophy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So you can't prove anything then, no evidence, no argument.
