The author of this article doesn&amp;#39;t realize that &lt;a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolling_(fishing\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;trolling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) actually comes from the fishing term, not a reference to &amp;quot;trolls&amp;quot;, the mythological creature. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you &lt;em&gt;troll&lt;/em&gt; the waters you&amp;#39;re casting out tackle behind the boat and running the engines slowly, hoping for a bite. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In internet culture this is seen as a posting a racy comment to elicit reaction. You see this as people responding with paragraphs of arguments and fighting amongst each other while the OP never responds, or leaves small posts to stoke the flames.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also disappointed no mention of the official anus of the internet, 4chan.org, which practically invented trolling in much higher forms. &lt;em&gt;Sigh&lt;/em&gt; I do miss those days when the internet wasn&amp;#39;t self-righteous, and composed of all forms of mockery and things offensive.
