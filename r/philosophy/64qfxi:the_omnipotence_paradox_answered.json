[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "philosophy", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very classical argument from the ancient time of the greeks and has been discussed so many times before, but I want to take it up again in this sub. Firstly let us see the paradox.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If god is omnipotent, can He create a stone that He cannot move?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am sure you all know this paradox so I will just begin now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly we must know the concept of god. It is important to know what god is and what god is not. So you may ask &amp;quot;What is the definition of God?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the definition from surah Al-iklas&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say, &amp;quot;He is Allah, [who is] One,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allah, the Eternal Refuge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He neither begets nor is born,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nor is there to Him any equivalent.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now let us see the question again. Let us examine the word omnipotence. Omnipotence means There is no power and might except the power of Allah.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To understand absolute see this example. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let us say you have three glasses of water. You fill the first one 1/3, you fill the next one to 1/2 and the last one you fill 1/1. Now if someone says &amp;quot;Can the glasses have water, while the glasses being empty?&amp;quot; Then for the two first glasses that would make sense since there is water in them, but there is also an emptiness in them. But for the last cup that is filled 1/1 that questioned does not make any sense. Because when the glass is absolutely full then there is no place for emptiness, so in that case, that question does not make sense. This can be applied to the God omnipotence paradox. When god is absolute in power there is no weakness for him.  In this case, then the paradox makes no sense. It&amp;#39;s like saying &amp;quot;I am absolutely a liar.&amp;quot; If he lying he telling the truth, but if he telling the truth then he is lying. So this the statement paradox contradict itself and plays with us.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you might say &amp;quot;but can god do anything&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, we Muslims say &amp;quot;\u0644\u0627 \u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647&amp;quot;  this means There is no power and might except the power of Allah.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also say: &amp;quot;\u0648\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u0621\u064d \u0642\u064e\u062f\u064a\u0631&amp;quot; this means  Allah can do whatever he wills to do&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there is a catch. God would never will something that would make him cease to make him God. God would never will something that would contradict the concept of godhood. So he would not will to die. Why? He is eternal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can God create another God? Let us look at the definition of god that we gave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He neither begets nor is born,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see a god cannot be created as god is a uncreated being. So this question is like asking can God create an uncreated being?  This question is again flawed since it contradicts itself meaning it can&amp;#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let us see this question literally for once. In this case, let us see a man instead for a god. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To lift something there has to be a  ground since this rock has to be lifted in a relation to something. There needs to be gravity that affects both them man and the stone so that the man can apply an opposite force to the gravity. Without the gravity, the stone can be lifted very easily and. Now you might be thinking this right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, let me explain. This scenario is a human scenario and does not apply to God since everything bound by space, time or any forces is not God since those are his creations. Also, this question sets the scenario that god has to lift an object like us humans. Allah (SWT) uses commands. Allah says \u0643\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646, means be and it is. and now the rock is created and Allah commands it move and it moves. So do not see god as a human and these problems won&amp;#39;t rise, as it is logically wrong for the human to be the god. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This can also be seen from this perspective. Some might say that if god is capable of doing anything is he should be able to fail. That is logically wrong since failure is not a feature of His omnipotence. This question describes an event that can&amp;#39;t happen since it is impossible. The question raised is like asking an artist to draw a &amp;quot;white black crow&amp;quot; to prove he can draw, or a mathematician to draw a &amp;quot;circle triangle&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to conclude: God can create a stone that is heavier than anything we can imagine, but he will always be able to move the stone since he uses commands and failure is not feature of omnipotence&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR ARGUMENTS:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand what godhood is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question implies that God is like us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failure is not a feature of His omnipotence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;God can never will something that contradicts the Godhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question explains an impossible event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL: DR: God cannot will something that ceases to make him a God. That&amp;#39;s why that question is flawed. The question also assumes God is a human. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sorry for my Englis it&amp;#39;s my second level. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Minor mistake &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This is a very classical argument from the ancient time of the greeks and has been discussed so many times before, but I want to take it up again in this sub.
