Rather, as my previous comment indicated, I think we merely misunderstand objective reality.  It is not necessary to posit a non-physical existence (although I am not offended by such suggestions), merely that there are physics we don't yet understand (objectively provable) which may not be as deterministic as the standard model (which has plenty of space left for such discoveries).\n\nIf you accept hard determinism, you must necessarily do away with personal responsibility in the sense normally meant, and so goes any semblance of ethics or morality as we generally discuss them.  And I think any honest hard determinist is required to admit as much, exactly as Richard Dawkins does.  Concepts like \"good\" and \"bad\" disappear when you boil them down to particle states.

But I don't have to know how to make a car, in order to judge if something looks like a car, if it acts like a car, and if it makes a good car. And likewise I can tell what's a good debate or not a good debate, based on some external appearance factors, like participants talking past each other, being wildly inconsistent with their own statements, relying heavily on unfounded speculation and conjecture, ignoring existing scientific evidence that renders their point incorrect, and so on.\n\nThe arguments about free will are largely floating in the air with nothing to hang onto, and my impressions from witnessing and participating in many such arguments is that they are little more than people arguing about the dictionary definition of words, and somehow trying to use that as a proof of their PoV.\n\n&gt; The ancients postulated an atom, before knowledge of the cell.\n\nJust to get that straight, we haven't found the atom yet, as per the original definition that was postulated.\n\nWe just postulated \"well there must be some smallest unit that's indivisible\" and once we found a small unit, we called it \"the atom\". Then we divided it into particles. Then we divided those particles into quarks. Then we divided the quarks... And the most recent theory of this is there are no particles. Just discrete interactions within continuous fields of energy, that falsely look like particles in *some* (but not all) data points.\n\nSo that's a case in point that postulating things without facts doesn't mean much.\n\n&gt; They calculated the size of the earth before its circumnavigation.\n\nThey didn't do this by having discussions about it, but by transforming observable facts and data through math. The problem is that we have no facts about free will to transform through math, logic, or whatever, because as I said, to talk about agents with free will, we need to know what an agent with experience of self is.\n\nSay, when you call yourself \"you\", what are you? The matter making up your cells? Your cells making up your organs? Your organs making up your entire body? Well none of this is constant. Or is it not about the matter, but the interaction between the elements of the system that this matter creates? But that's not constant either. So we can't even define, strictly what \"you\" are. If we can't even define what \"you\" are, how on Earth can we even start having a debate about whether \"you\" have a free will?\n\nOur only definition is contextual, subjective and useful only in specific limited contexts. Say, imagine that if we were more like worms, you can cut yourself in two halves, and both halves kind of heal and grow to be full people. Well that's all government systems going into the trash bin. They can't describe something like this. To them you're an \"atom\" and you're an indivisible entity, with a single social security number, and a singular credit history, and so on and so on, like that fake atom that ancient Greeks were thinking about. \n\nIt's an example of how a conceptual model of something is not like the physical reality it's describing. They're two distinct things, and the connection between them hinges on context, and pragmatic assumptions. The concept of \"you\" is molded entirely by pragmatism. It has no truth into it.

Can you?\n\n&gt; The entire history of natural philosophy (the conversations of facts) has shown that it IS possible to have fruitful conclusions based on the analysis of incomplete facts.\n\nIt is possible, but let's say that in the case of free will, I've zero evidence it has happened.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just saying that just about any argument about free will that I&amp;#39;ve seen, reads like a transcription of a group of friends getting high and thinking they are philosophical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t assume anything exists or will be discovered to make the question of free will make sense, ever. But I don&amp;#39;t have to know how to make a car, in order to judge if something looks like a car, if it acts like a car, and if it makes a good car. And likewise I can tell what&amp;#39;s a good debate or not a good debate, based on some external appearance factors, like participants talking past each other, being wildly inconsistent with their own statements, relying heavily on unfounded speculation and conjecture, ignoring existing scientific evidence that renders their point incorrect, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The arguments about free will are largely floating in the air with nothing to hang onto, and my impressions from witnessing and participating in many such arguments is that they are little more than people arguing about the dictionary definition of words, and somehow trying to use that as a proof of their PoV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ancients postulated an atom, before knowledge of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just to get that straight, we haven&amp;#39;t found the atom yet, as per the original definition that was postulated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just postulated &amp;quot;well there must be some smallest unit that&amp;#39;s indivisible&amp;quot; and once we found a small unit, we called it &amp;quot;the atom&amp;quot;. Then we divided it into particles. Then we divided those particles into quarks. Then we divided the quarks... And the most recent theory of this is there are no particles. Just discrete interactions within continuous fields of energy, that falsely look like particles in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; (but not all) data points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s a case in point that postulating things without facts doesn&amp;#39;t mean much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They calculated the size of the earth before its circumnavigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t do this by having discussions about it, but by transforming observable facts and data through math. The problem is that we have no facts about free will to transform through math, logic, or whatever, because as I said, to talk about agents with free will, we need to know what an agent with experience of self is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say, when you call yourself &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;, what are you? The matter making up your cells? Your cells making up your organs? Your organs making up your entire body? Well none of this is constant. Or is it not about the matter, but the interaction between the elements of the system that this matter creates? But that&amp;#39;s not constant either. So we can&amp;#39;t even define, strictly what &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; are. If we can&amp;#39;t even define what &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; are, how on Earth can we even start having a debate about whether &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; have a free will?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our only definition is contextual, subjective and useful only in specific limited contexts. Say, imagine that if we were more like worms, you can cut yourself in two halves, and both halves kind of heal and grow to be full people. Well that&amp;#39;s all government systems going into the trash bin. They can&amp;#39;t describe something like this. To them you&amp;#39;re an &amp;quot;atom&amp;quot; and you&amp;#39;re an indivisible entity, with a single social security number, and a singular credit history, and so on and so on, like that fake atom that ancient Greeks were thinking about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an example of how a conceptual model of something is not like the physical reality it&amp;#39;s describing. They&amp;#39;re two distinct things, and the connection between them hinges on context, and pragmatic assumptions. The concept of &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; is molded entirely by pragmatism.

To me, instincts are the primal drives that we consciously wrestle with. So we have the instinct to eat large quantities of high calorie food and will do so unless we make the conscious decision to go against that instinct. Animals lack that ability and will eat themselves sick. At the extreme end we have the ability to consciously end our lives despite our very powerful and primal instincts to stay alive.

If I dig a ditch so I can afford lunch, is it instinctual or not? Are we saying that all behavior that closes a loop to achieve a goal is free will? Why are we just redefining phrases like \"free will\" in this way?\n\nI suppose it depends on how self-aware you are about it.

To me, instincts are the primal drives that we consciously wrestle with. So we have the instinct to eat large quantities of high calorie food and will do so unless we make the conscious decision to go against that instinct. Animals lack that ability and will eat themselves sick. At the extreme end we have the ability to consciously end our lives despite our very powerful and primal instincts to stay alive.
