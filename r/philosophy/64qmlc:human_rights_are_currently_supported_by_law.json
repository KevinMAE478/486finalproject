Each day she placed on the white board a venn diagram with the circles &amp;quot;Justice&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Law&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Morality&amp;quot; . . . Nearly every individual in the room defined their own venn diagram in their own way.  In a scary way, I always think of that as sort of a microcosm of just what our political/social/economic system is, here in the USA.  Everyone has preconceived notions that change on experience, and those preconceptions and experiences lead someone to prioritize justice, law, or morality perhaps at a loss of one or the other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not know what system you live in (I&amp;#39;m USA). . . But, in my experience what is most scary is how at a local level (such as county or township) how giant an individuals impact can be on a local community and how they can abuse their office/position so easily.  In other words, on local scale there is a lot of power and a lot less law/checking against the power and as you said &amp;quot;justice exists outside of law&amp;quot; . . . I tend to agree with that statement because more law doesn&amp;#39;t mean &amp;quot;just law&amp;quot;, just as much as less law doesn&amp;#39;t mean &amp;quot;just law&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is just is just, and that is relative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "philosophy", "name": "t1_dg4sijg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491968244.0, "created_utc": 1491939444.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4nsz2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 44, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Anathos117", "parent_id": "t1_dg4ky7n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/philosophy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What do you mean \"why\"?

This concept goes by many names, but is generally called the theory of Natural Law.  It's been around for a long time, but it was very visibly codified with the creation of the United States of America.  \n\nHowever, Natural law has not always been part of the culture.  Natural Law, and the Culture in support of it tended to advance together, jointly, through the British Common Law system, starting as far back as with the Magna Carte.  Or you can go back even further to something like The Ten Commandments.\n\nIt culminated in the United States, which was the first country to actually be *founded* on the concept of Natural Law, and which had Natural Law embedded in its beginnings (Declaration of Independence) and in its highest authority (The Constitution).  From there, it became part of the culture, and as United States (And British) Culture spread around the world, it became parts of other cultures as well.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence was an appeal to a higher authority.  It said quite openly: *\"We're going to break the law, in service of a higher one.\"*  They were going to break King George's Law (Political Law) in service to the fundamental rights of humans (Natural Law).\n\nThe very first sentence sums this up very well: \n\n&gt;\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\n\nWhat a sentence.

But even for those who don't, they need to recognize the importance of this sentence.  Humans by virtue of their existence and humanity have unalienable rights, granted to them by *some sort of power* greater than that of other humans.  Call it History or Natural Rights or God or whatever, but it is an authority beyond the reach or contravention of mortal men.

Nobody wants to be stripped of their freedom.  And while not everybody will be happy, and it's no one else's job to give you happiness, everyone should be free to pursue their own happiness - whatever that means for them.  These things get restricted only in service to maintaining them for others.\n\n\nThe Constitution then further emphasizes and elaborates on all this with the Day 1 DLC *\"Bill of Rights\"*, which is filled with negative rights. Rights people had inherently - not ones *granted* by the government.  All they said was these are natural, inalienable rights, and the government is not allowed to touch them. Congress shall not infringe, Congress shall not prohibit, etc etc.\n\nAnd the culture at the time wasn't 100% there in support of it.  Slavery was still a thing.  A lot of people believed in the supremacy of the crown over individual human rights.

I agree with the author that we need more than resorting to an appeal to legal or cultural authority.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have digested from many scholars that human rights are the &lt;em&gt;sui generis&lt;/em&gt; positive rights to life, liberty, and property &lt;strong&gt;and there is no 4th&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there exists no 4th positive right absent a voluntary agreement that does not attempt to alienate an inalienable human right.  (Contract rights are positive rights, but those must be explicit and defined).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There can be no other positive human right for a very important reason:  No other putative human right can exist and be co-equal with the rights to life, liberty, and property; that is, you and I each have co-equal rights to life, liberty, and property (that is, mine cannot infringe upon yours and yours cannot infringe upon mine).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Human rights are not, by the way, currently supported by law.  Law regularly infringes upon human rights, significantly.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "philosophy", "name": "t1_dg4qq2p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491966327.0, "created_utc": 1491937527.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qmlc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4w9rq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ibreathefreedom", "parent_id": "t3_64qmlc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/philosophy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think they are enough, I'm just saying that they are the main engine for people not doing bad shit to other people.
