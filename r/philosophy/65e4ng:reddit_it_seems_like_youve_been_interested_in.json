Though this would vary by one&amp;#39;s view of ethics, it is easy to see how an argument could be made that any animal which is capable of harming or helping another animal must therefore be judged according to their actions--that, because they are capable of wronging another, we are morally obligated to intervene to ensure they do not, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, especially under the idea that animal cruelty is bad because animals can suffer, it could then easily follow that we must take all steps available to reduce cruelty to animals, &lt;em&gt;including that cruelty enacted by others animals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I&amp;#39;m aware, none have suggested this, though I&amp;#39;m going to assume that at least a few have at some point or other and it&amp;#39;s simply not a popular enough viewpoint that I&amp;#39;ve ever encountered it before. And, I must say, it is fairly compelling. Even if said animals are not capable of understanding moral reasoning, it does not follow that we should not judge them according to it. It&amp;#39;s the same idea often expressed as &amp;quot;ignorance of the law is no excuse&amp;quot;, I think, at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s a question for you: If I were to say that the above is true of my beliefs about ethics, and that we absolutely should judge other species by their moral behaviour, how would you respond?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "philosophy", "name": "t1_dg9zafd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492243504.0, "created_utc": 1492214704.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e4ng", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgao0h1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sad_handjob", "parent_id": "t1_dg9osfh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/philosophy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why is murdering infants wrong?

No matter how you look at it, it seems that we very much discriminate on the sole basis of species, with no good reasoning behind our discrimination -- which is textbook prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Goodpaster&amp;#39;s point, though, is taking it too far, IMO. There&amp;#39;s a rational case to be made for the respect of &lt;em&gt;sentient&lt;/em&gt; life, but there&amp;#39;s no reason to grant moral status on the sole basis of &amp;#39;life&amp;#39;.

The standard space per cow on pack is 110 sq foot, which no regular farmer can afford to build for, much less pay bedding for. So the requirements for better housing for a cow are the very reason why no farmer will go there cause milk prices are most likely to go down in the near future. Even I have to build in free stall dimensions in case I don't make it financially. \n\nIf I had kids I would mot risk that either. \nLike I said my cows are not pets, they are my living.\n\nBefore the 1950s everybody farmed and nobody blamed 2% of the population for breeding animals and slaughtering for food. \n\nJust because mechanization and technology made it possible for you to not have to farm all your food yourself, doesn't mean you are less responsible for how your food is created. \n\nIf you will not pay extra or do the required research to source the food you are comfortable consuming and thereby supporting the right way of animal husbandry, you are still part of the problem. \n\nCreating these animals and deciding to send them for meat is part of my job. But it is a very tiny part of my job. \n\nMy goal is to stretch their lives to 10 years instead of 4 and go from there. \n\nMy system is a back to back 10% sloped floor (like a berm) chopped, dust free straw falls from a system (called Schauer Strohmatic) above the pack on an interval. The cows traffic over the pack will slowly work the bedding down and off the slope where scrapers take it to the back of the barn and a barn cleaner conveyors it out of the barn. So no clean out day in the barn. \n\nCows are milked voluntary by lely milk robot. My cows love their lely. They think they own it. Its their grain vending machine. They wait in line for their turn without any gates. They know their time slots and stick with them at 5 minute accuracy. My barn is built so that no event messes with their routines. \n\nRobots can sort cows into a different area if I tell em to ( like if I think she is limping) or by automatic criteria ( like 2 months before calving to dry her off) That separation room works like a doctors waiting room. With food and drink and comfortable place to sleep. And milking robot access if they want. \n\nRobot sorting is stress free and at their own pace and that way I don't stress the herd for a treatment only one cow has to have done. The fact that she can eat drink rest and milk while in the selection pen, takes away deadlines for me and her. So we can do everything at her pace. Her coming into my special area instead of me invading her area is another thing that is very important and promotes calm handling.  \n\nCows like to have only one clear option and they will cooperate. If you give them two options they get confused.

", "edited": 1492314815.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is even more irresponsible to ignore the farmers that do farm in ways that you approve of because they pay out of their own pockets to try and change whole a sector that changes in the wrong direction producing cheaper and cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inly reason why I can afford to build my ideology is because my brother declined to farm and I will shrink my parents farm from 250 cows to a 60 cow barn. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Free stalls would house twice the amount of cows in my size barn. The standard space per cow on pack is 110 sq foot, which no regular farmer can afford to build for, much less pay bedding for. So the requirements for better housing for a cow are the very reason why no farmer will go there cause milk prices are most likely to go down in the near future. Even I have to build in free stall dimensions in case I don&amp;#39;t make it financially. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I had kids I would mot risk that either. \nLike I said my cows are not pets, they are my living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before the 1950s everybody farmed and nobody blamed 2% of the population for breeding animals and slaughtering for food. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just because mechanization and technology made it possible for you to not have to farm all your food yourself, doesn&amp;#39;t mean you are less responsible for how your food is created. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you will not pay extra or do the required research to source the food you are comfortable consuming and thereby supporting the right way of animal husbandry, you are still part of the problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Creating these animals and deciding to send them for meat is part of my job. But it is a very tiny part of my job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My goal is to stretch their lives to 10 years instead of 4 and go from there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My system is a back to back 10% sloped floor (like a berm) chopped, dust free straw falls from a system (called Schauer Strohmatic) above the pack on an interval. The cows traffic over the pack will slowly work the bedding down and off the slope where scrapers take it to the back of the barn and a barn cleaner conveyors it out of the barn. So no clean out day in the barn. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cows are milked voluntary by lely milk robot. My cows love their lely. They think they own it. Its their grain vending machine. They wait in line for their turn without any gates. They know their time slots and stick with them at 5 minute accuracy. My barn is built so that no event messes with their routines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robots can sort cows into a different area if I tell em to ( like if I think she is limping) or by automatic criteria ( like 2 months before calving to dry her off) That separation room works like a doctors waiting room. With food and drink and comfortable place to sleep. And milking robot access if they want. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robot sorting is stress free and at their own pace and that way I don&amp;#39;t stress the herd for a treatment only one cow has to have done. The fact that she can eat drink rest and milk while in the selection pen, takes away deadlines for me and her. So we can do everything at her pace. Her coming into my special area instead of me invading her area is another thing that is very important and promotes calm handling.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cows like to have only one clear option and they will cooperate. If you give them two options they get confused. So I have one very obvious, wide, light but not too bright area for breeding, trimming , vaccinating pregnancy check and periodically shaving the hair of the udder and tail. Even a surgery if needed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have the calving pens not on a slope but right next to the separation pen.
