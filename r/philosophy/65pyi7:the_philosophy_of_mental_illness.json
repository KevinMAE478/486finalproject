For pharma companies and insurers, there is a strongly vested interest in convincing primary care physicians that most mental illness can be treated with medication by a non-specialist.\n\nBiologicalism for patients is a way of saying \"it isn't me\". Patients are worried about their jobs and their reputation. A bottle of pills is a lot easier to conceal than leaving work every week to see a therapist. Treating mental illness as biological-only gets rid of the temptation to think hard about negative family dynamics that might have created the condition. It allows you to compartmentalize your illness- which of course is part of what probably created the illness in the first place.\n\nThe non-genetic causes of mental illness are taboo, particular in America. Abuse, neglect, trauma and fucked up family dynamics are much more common than anyone wants to admit, but these patterns are often strongly tied to conventional views of the \"right\" way to raise children, religion, or socio-economic realities, and are hard to correct. I know hitting kids as a form of discipline is rampant in my community, and that it's marketed not only through churches but also through a broader culture of 'toughness' and 'respect' that treats anyone who dares to say a word against it as soft and unrealistic. Two working parents can't provide the same level of care as full-time parents, resulting in self-raising kids and emotional neglect, but few families can afford to do it any other way. Work-life balance and expectations of workers are insane in a lot of places, particularly where jobs are few and employment is precarious.\n\nTherapy still has a strong stigma to many people as 'complaining' or 'brainwashing' because of distrust of the psychiatric field- a field that often has the unpleasant job of pointing out the shortcomings of families and other respected institutions. There is such a huge stigma in the US about saying a negative thing about the conventional 'way things are done'. If you complain, it means you are too weak to work to the required level. The biological paradigm allows mental illness to be discussed in isolation, without implicating its social roots.\n\nIf it's just a \"chemical imbalance\", then society doesn't need to change- just the patients brain chemistry. We can continue to allow people to abuse and neglect children as long as it stays subtle and safely out of sight, or as long as the abuse is just emotional.\n\n ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of the &amp;#39;biologicalism&amp;#39; is about economics on the provider side, and a response to the stigma of mental illness on the patient side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No insurer is going to rush to sign off on six months of $100/week therapy when a script for Prozac is $5 for a 60 day supply. For pharma companies and insurers, there is a strongly vested interest in convincing primary care physicians that most mental illness can be treated with medication by a non-specialist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Biologicalism for patients is a way of saying &amp;quot;it isn&amp;#39;t me&amp;quot;. Patients are worried about their jobs and their reputation. A bottle of pills is a lot easier to conceal than leaving work every week to see a therapist. Treating mental illness as biological-only gets rid of the temptation to think hard about negative family dynamics that might have created the condition. It allows you to compartmentalize your illness- which of course is part of what probably created the illness in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The non-genetic causes of mental illness are taboo, particular in America. Abuse, neglect, trauma and fucked up family dynamics are much more common than anyone wants to admit, but these patterns are often strongly tied to conventional views of the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; way to raise children, religion, or socio-economic realities, and are hard to correct. I know hitting kids as a form of discipline is rampant in my community, and that it&amp;#39;s marketed not only through churches but also through a broader culture of &amp;#39;toughness&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;respect&amp;#39; that treats anyone who dares to say a word against it as soft and unrealistic. Two working parents can&amp;#39;t provide the same level of care as full-time parents, resulting in self-raising kids and emotional neglect, but few families can afford to do it any other way. Work-life balance and expectations of workers are insane in a lot of places, particularly where jobs are few and employment is precarious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therapy still has a strong stigma to many people as &amp;#39;complaining&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;brainwashing&amp;#39; because of distrust of the psychiatric field- a field that often has the unpleasant job of pointing out the shortcomings of families and other respected institutions. There is such a huge stigma in the US about saying a negative thing about the conventional &amp;#39;way things are done&amp;#39;. If you complain, it means you are too weak to work to the required level. The biological paradigm allows mental illness to be discussed in isolation, without implicating its social roots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;chemical imbalance&amp;quot;, then society doesn&amp;#39;t need to change- just the patients brain chemistry. We can continue to allow people to abuse and neglect children as long as it stays subtle and safely out of sight, or as long as the abuse is just emotional.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "philosophy", "name": "t1_dgcwyox", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492421925.0, "created_utc": 1492393125.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pyi7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pyi7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pyi7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd21bq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shitasspetfuckers", "parent_id": "t1_dgcljwa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/philosophy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; More than that, there is hope for far more than just mental illness.\n\nCare to elaborate?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More than that, there is hope for far more than just mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Care to elaborate?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "philosophy", "name": "t1_dgd21bq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492429089.0, "created_utc": 1492400289.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pyi7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd9m80", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "georglukacs", "parent_id": "t1_dgcljwa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/philosophy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is microdosing an option for mild to severe depression?
