They are tactile and analogue in a world of electronic modernity.\n\nAlfas: between their styling, which has a presence in person that commands your attention, their quirkiness (be it unreliability or questionable design choices) coupled with stellar driving expereinces make them a car enthusiast's love-hate relationship they look fondly back upon 10 years past even if they curse the damn thing during ownership.\n\nBritish Stuff: A reminder of the nicer things in life, these luxurious sedans, coupes, grand tourers, and even roadsters, these cars are quintessentially british and represent what the brits wish the world thought of them - contained, chivalrous old-world men that are willing to have a roaring good time if you are.\n\nOld Ferraris: Definitive of what an italian car should be, gated shifter ferraris are an experience in and of themselves. It is special just to sit in one of these, let alone drive one, if only for their legend... but it's not only for that.\n\nThe Focus RS is a boy racer special with all the tricks. Going far too fast in what is ultimately an uppity econobox and coming out of a corner safely (or sideways) is an exhilarating thing.\n\nThe S2000 (and I suppose I should include the RX7 and RX8 to a lesser extent) is the high-revving NA motor that every roadster should have, and similar to manual porsches is simply a driving experience\n\nThe Miata is the definition of a roadster. Small, light, arguably underpowered with bodyroll that scares you sometimes, this car is perfect for clear-day six tenths backroad cruising and while an S2000 will egg you on to go faster and beg you to rev it out, the miata is perfectly content just cruising along and enjoying the outdoors with you.\n\nPagani and Bugatti make the list for being ridiculously over-the-top in every way, from interior design, exterior design, speed, noise, to pricetag. They, similar to old ferraris, are an experience to be near simply for the testament to craftsmanship they represent\n\nKoenigsegg is special to me because it represents that which sweden can achieve on a world stage... and for the engineering excellence they represent. This is different from an Audi because an Audi is engineered just enough to do the job perfectly, a Koenigsegg is so over engineered it redefines the job (if that makes sense).\n\nV8 Cameros are the embodiment of old school muscle. I don't like the looks of the new ones, but they represent the american automotive dream: torque, and maybe AC.\n\nThe Dodge viper is just brutal, in every way. It's special in a masochistic way.\n\nAMG is special for their ability to make any engine sound like god's gift to man.

They are tactile and analogue in a world of electronic modernity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfas: between their styling, which has a presence in person that commands your attention, their quirkiness (be it unreliability or questionable design choices) coupled with stellar driving expereinces make them a car enthusiast&amp;#39;s love-hate relationship they look fondly back upon 10 years past even if they curse the damn thing during ownership.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;British Stuff: A reminder of the nicer things in life, these luxurious sedans, coupes, grand tourers, and even roadsters, these cars are quintessentially british and represent what the brits wish the world thought of them - contained, chivalrous old-world men that are willing to have a roaring good time if you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Old Ferraris: Definitive of what an italian car should be, gated shifter ferraris are an experience in and of themselves. It is special just to sit in one of these, let alone drive one, if only for their legend... but it&amp;#39;s not only for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Focus RS is a boy racer special with all the tricks. Going far too fast in what is ultimately an uppity econobox and coming out of a corner safely (or sideways) is an exhilarating thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The S2000 (and I suppose I should include the RX7 and RX8 to a lesser extent) is the high-revving NA motor that every roadster should have, and similar to manual porsches is simply a driving experience&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Miata is the definition of a roadster. Small, light, arguably underpowered with bodyroll that scares you sometimes, this car is perfect for clear-day six tenths backroad cruising and while an S2000 will egg you on to go faster and beg you to rev it out, the miata is perfectly content just cruising along and enjoying the outdoors with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pagani and Bugatti make the list for being ridiculously over-the-top in every way, from interior design, exterior design, speed, noise, to pricetag. They, similar to old ferraris, are an experience to be near simply for the testament to craftsmanship they represent&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Koenigsegg is special to me because it represents that which sweden can achieve on a world stage... and for the engineering excellence they represent. This is different from an Audi because an Audi is engineered just enough to do the job perfectly, a Koenigsegg is so over engineered it redefines the job (if that makes sense).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;V8 Cameros are the embodiment of old school muscle. I don&amp;#39;t like the looks of the new ones, but they represent the american automotive dream: torque, and maybe AC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Dodge viper is just brutal, in every way. It&amp;#39;s special in a masochistic way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AMG is special for their ability to make any engine sound like god&amp;#39;s gift to man.
