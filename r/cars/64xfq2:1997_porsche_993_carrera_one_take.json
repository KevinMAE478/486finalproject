The current generation is 991, technically 991.2 since it&amp;#39;s the post-facelift version now. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cars", "name": "t1_dg6gfy9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492055961.0, "created_utc": 1492027161.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6fuya", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sleepingsysadmin", "parent_id": "t3_64xfq2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cars", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How do people manage to remember what the difference is between 992 vs 993?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do people manage to remember what the difference is between 992 vs 993?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cars", "name": "t1_dg6fuya", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492055373.0, "created_utc": 1492026573.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xfq2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xfq2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xfq2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5vrr8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nipcarlover", "parent_id": "t1_dg5v4k3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cars", "controversiality": 0, "body": "LPT: Get AlienTube to replace YouTube cancer with reddit comments, which may or may not be a less painful disease, depending on the video", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LPT: Get AlienTube to replace YouTube cancer with reddit comments, which may or may not be a less painful disease, depending on the video&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cars", "name": "t1_dg5vrr8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492033884.0, "created_utc": 1492005084.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5v4k3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 28, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nariek", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ttsb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cars", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you ask Youtube it practically makes him Hitler.
