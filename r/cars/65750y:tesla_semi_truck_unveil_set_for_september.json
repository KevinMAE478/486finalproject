Bear with me because I'm on mobile.\n\n\nSo according to [this table](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density) on Wikipedia, diesel has a specific energy content of 12.667 kWh/kg. According to a quick Google search, diesel weighs 7.25 to 7.5 pounds per gallon, which converts to 3.41 kg. Even though I'm American and love my freedom, when it comes to calculations, SI units are so much better (and as an aside, in the afterlife if I ever meet the bastard who came up with English units, I will rip them limb from limb and then shove a pound-mass of dynamite up their fucking ass).\n\n\nAnyhoo, if you have 300 gallons of diesel fuel, you've got 1023 kilos of fuel, which translates to 12,955 kWh of energy. Diesel engines are inherently more thermodynamically efficient than gasoline engines, and some engines like the Mercedes F1 engines are not far from 50% thermal efficiency last I heard. But let's say you've got a hella efficient diesel engine, say 60% thermal efficiency. So of that 13,000 kWh, really only 7,773 of it gets used in propelling the truck. So now I'll brb while I look up how much battery we need for that.\n\n\nOk Tesla has announced a new \"2170\" battery, which they claim has the highest energy density of any lithium-ion battery in the world. Unfortunately they're not willing to share that info with the public yet, so I had to look up specs for the current battery offered in the Model S. The 85 kWh pack weighs 1200 pounds, or 544 kg. The closest thing I could find to its size was a Reddit comment estimating it at 112\u00d770 inches, and 4 inches thick. Now with the new battery Tesla has come up with, let's just be optimists and say it has a 50% increase in energy density (a pretty massive leap in technology!), so that same size battery pack now stores 127.5 kWh. So how many battery packs like this would we need? Considering the Model S already has assloads of torque and the new battery is supposed to be able to supply twice the current, let's just assume that the batteries are able to provide enough power to move the load.\n\n\nWell since it seems lithium-ion batteries can have efficiencies of up to 90%, and we need 7,773 kWh of output, we need batteries that'll store 8,637 kWh in order to have the same capacity. That means we'd need about 68 of those battery packs I just mentioned, which would weigh 36,850 kg, or 81,000 pounds.\n\n\nThis is also a total battery pack volume of 31,360 cubic inches (I know, I hate mixing units and I'm really sorry!). It seems 53 feet is a common length of trailer for 18 wheelers, which is 636 inches. So what if you made a special trailer with the battery pack making up the bottom of the trailer? Well if you did that, your 53' long battery could be only 1 inch deep and 49 inches wide. So size-wise, it's totally doable!\n\n\nTL;DR: 18-wheelers *could* use batteries big enough to power the truck, but in order to keep the same capacity as current semis, the battery would probably be absurdly heavy. However, maybe without an engine it could be lower profile and more aerodynamic, reducing the amount of energy needed by the battery.
