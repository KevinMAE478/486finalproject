Incredible. As mentioned, I wanted something that was more of an occasion to drive than the C63 and also something that I could exploit the power with more easily. The Merc was incredibly quick but you couldn&amp;#39;t really enjoy using the power on the road as you&amp;#39;d end up straying into ridiculous speeds - and the car would light the rear tyres up whenever it had the chance to.

I think because you sit lower down and the torque is way more prevalent through the rev range, it makes it feel faster than it is. Driving hilariously fast in a straight line is fun, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, but the Aston is far better suited to twisty roads than its predecessor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the noise - well, it&amp;#39;s lovely. The V8 makes a much more refined, but still pleasantly loud racket when you plant the throttle. It also rumbles nicely at low revs, and the transition up to the racket above 4500rpm is a great mix of the two. It&amp;#39;s unoffensively loud at low revs (i.e. around town), and makes itself very well heard when you open it up.
