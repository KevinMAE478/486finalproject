which means something like meeting in a pub where you and other regulars discuss car matters, and if someone has bought a new car he will try to show off and brag about 0-100 km/h times or top speeds.\nThat happens a lot so that\u00b4s one point of not real car guyanism but general car culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the most part you can witness the importance of the car here when you actually drive around Germany/Austria.\nOur highway code for example demands that you always drive on the far right lane of the Autobahn/Interstate in any case, regardless of speed.\nIf you see a slower car you may use other lanes to overtake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a thing called &amp;quot;\u00dcberholprestige&amp;quot; has evolved, which means that some performance cars demand so much respect when they appear behind you that nearly everyone using the Autobahn will get out of the left lane and let the obviously faster car pass.\nPeople over here tend to really drive their cars to the limit, on open street sounds crazy for people from other countries but in Austria it is pretty common if you do 100km/h in an 80km/h restriction someone will overtake you doing 120 or tailgate you for driving to slow and blocking the left lane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u00b4s also common to drive around in a 130km/h zone, which is the general speed limit here in Austria and some guy blows past you doing over 200km/h.\nEven the police doesn\u00b4t really care as long as you don\u00b4t tailgate anyone and don\u00b4t drive like a madman they will let speeding up to 30 km/h slide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this should mean that the electric car simply is no option for most Germans/Austrians, it doesn\u00b4t have the drama of a big rumbling US-V8, or the deep growl of an AMG mercedes it\u00b4s just silent...and quite boring in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as the article says, we use our cars for vacations, work, supply runs, visiting friends or simply joyriding.\nIt\u00b4s not like it\u00b4s something different company to another other country, whith the exception that over here even non car guys go for a leisurely drive somewhere.\nTo drink a coffe or for a snack, we Austrians even have a expression for that &amp;quot;Wir fahren ins Blaue&amp;quot; which means you just take your car and family and drive into the blue, somewhere you don\u00b4t know where to yet but you\u00b4ll decide along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another point is that we take pride in our car industry!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean come on, look at the Americans they love German luxury cars, theeir quality and suffistication.\nIn Japan ownership of a German car will generally be understood as a sign of wealth and power.\nFor us the German automobile is nothing special, but something we enjoy and we are proud that we are known for building good cars so we buy them to represent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A big chunk of Austrias and Germanys industry is related to car manufacturers, with most parts produced locally in Germany for Germany it makes sense to build a German car with German or Austrian steel and aluminium!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a lot of jobs are related to the industry, which explains why it is implented into our culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all the electric car will not only have a hard time beeing accepted around here, but also to be sold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;German brands know that, that\u00b4s where their hesitation comes from to develop electric cars there will be no real market for them in the next 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But hey we invented the motor vehicle, so we could make e-cars for the world market but I guess we don\u00b4t want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for spelling mistakes or wrong grammar I\u00b4m obviously not a native speaker :-P&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cars", "name": "t1_dgasmtl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492300455.0, "created_utc": 1492271655.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 56}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ixzb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ixzb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ixzb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgasf0h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mancaveaccount", "parent_id": "t1_dgarj9w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cars", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I only seem to find myself driving through Michael Bay films with Decepticons &amp;
