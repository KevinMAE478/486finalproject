There are cameras nowadays that have incredible lowlight performance.

There are too many traps to be constantly slowing down for every single one, so your primary defense against this must be your spotter plane. CB frequencies for monitoring local LE radio traffic through all the jurisdictions you'll be moving through. You will also need local radio communication to the plane, can't rely on cellphone or other other forms especially in the empty deserted areas.\n\nStimulants to keep you at the top of your game.

The previous runs were getting worse MPG than this, so you may need tanks as big as 26 or 28 gallons to achieve the required range. 10 hours non-stop driving is doable but extremely difficult at the level of concentration necessary, but if necessary a pit stop to swap drivers mid-stint during construction zones or traffic is feasible. It only would cost about 60 seconds at most, and that tradeoff to gain a fresh driver is worth it IMO.\n\nNo spare tire, the weight\\MPG and space penalty is not worth it because if you have to stop to change to the spare you're DOA anyway.\n\nThat leaves on-the-fly refueling which... well yeah. Feasible? Potentially. Death wish? Totally. I think a better option is having your refueling truck waiting at the offramp on the highway armed having high-speed pumps.

This tactic would potentially eliminate the necessity to stop mid-stint for a driver switch, if you only have to do 9 hours of driving I can see it possible that the driver could do it. \n\nAnyway, this all is probably over-budget but I think that encompasses everything that's possible. \n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492077588.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the SS popularity, I&amp;#39;d go with a Taurus SHO in police trim - steelies , spotlight and maybe a front ram.

Driver swaps at each of the refueling stops. And no, not driver\\passenger. I mean 2 completely new and refreshed people. Not sure if that breaks the &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; of this though, but that does provide an edge as fatigue during the New Mexico --&amp;gt; California stint during a traditional 2-person full trip is problematic. This tactic would potentially eliminate the necessity to stop mid-stint for a driver switch, if you only have to do 9 hours of driving I can see it possible that the driver could do it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this all is probably over-budget but I think that encompasses everything that&amp;#39;s possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cars", "name": "t1_dg7cx7s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492105537.0, "created_utc": 1492076737.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6533gf", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6533gf", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg77dl6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "justanotheraddiction", "parent_id": "t1_dg76wx1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cars", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I just bought a 2001 and can't get it over 90, but I like where you're going.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just bought a 2001 and can&amp;#39;t get it over 90, but I like where you&amp;#39;re going.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cars", "name": "t1_dg77dl6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492090466.0, "created_utc": 1492061666.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg76wx1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zenith21", "parent_id": "t3_6533gf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cars", "controversiality": 0, "body": "First gen Honda Insight, with big brakes, super faded, crap paint, extra batteries, extra fuel tanks, gps, night vision, CB radios, scanners, active suspension, carbon fiber panels, Modafinil, and really good cold brew coffee.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First gen Honda Insight, with big brakes, super faded, crap paint, extra batteries, extra fuel tanks, gps, night vision, CB radios, scanners, active suspension, carbon fiber panels, Modafinil, and really good cold brew coffee.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cars", "name": "t1_dg76wx1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492089534.0, "created_utc": 1492060734.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6533gf", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6533gf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7gbat", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mopar39426ml", "parent_id": "t1_dg76pns", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cars", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would do the same thing, but swap on a base model front bumper and put on a push bar...\n\nMight as well make it look like a cop just in case you get spotted.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would do the same thing, but swap on a base model front bumper and put on a push bar...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might as well make it look like a cop just in case you get spotted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cars", "name": "t1_dg7gbat", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492114123.0, "created_utc": 1492085323.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg76pns", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FrenchFriedMushroom", "parent_id": "t3_6533gf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cars", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Black Charger SRT8 ($35k).\n\nExtra fuel tank, radar, laser, CB, GPS, cameras, computer for video storage, co-driver, tune, upgraded tires, low profile antennas on roof, air freshener.\n\nSee if I can talk a pilot friend into spotting like Roy did when he did it. \n\nPlus lots, and lots of planning.
