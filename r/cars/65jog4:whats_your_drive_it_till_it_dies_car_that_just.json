It had been sitting for a couple years. I got a bicycle pump and pumped up the tires and amazingly they held air. I installed a new battery and sprayed a little starting fluid in   the carb and it fired right up. My friend then decided he wanted $100 for it. hehe what an ass. \n\nIn any event it had a few other issues but I wound up driving that car for 8 years.  The speedometer was broke so I have no idea how many miles were on it, but it still ran great the day I gave it to a kid down the street.
