When I bought my 2002 Cabriolet it came down between a Tiptronic and a manual one In my price range. The manual had a blue roof (which I hated on a silver car), way more miles and 3 more owners than the Tip that had a black top. The Tip also had the IMS go on it and take the engine with it. Porsche had replaced the entire engine and upgraded the IMSB. I ended up getting the auto. I loved that car to death until one day the transmission went. I went through a month hassle of getting it fixed and ended up putting a used transmission in it. After months of enjoying my car again the goddamn trans went again. It&amp;#39;s now sitting in my garage waiting for me to be willing to spend the dough to fix it and get rid of it. What&amp;#39;s extra shitty is that the Merc transmission the autos have are normally bulletproof. If I could go back and do things over, I probably would have just waited till I could afford one with a warranty still attached to it. I would say also a manual but that PDK with Sport chronos is just too tempting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cars", "name": "t1_dgbrjqg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492351647.0, "created_utc": 1492322847.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lz7i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lz7i", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcbs4d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wootfatigue", "parent_id": "t1_dgc1wjk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cars", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I still want a silver 1999 Carrera in silver, boxster red interior, amber turn signals, and aero package.
