That&amp;#39;s like calling the Neon a &amp;quot;tuner car&amp;quot; because of the 1st-gen ACR and the 2nd-gen SRT4.  Sure, the enthusiast community remembers the SRT4 that made gobs of power and annihilated every single one of it&amp;#39;s competitors when it first came out.  But most people remember &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/LDU5pMw.jpg\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same story with the Dart.  To enthusiasts, the name evokes images of the &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/mkiChbW.jpg\"&gt;GTS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/wlgIQKS.jpg\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;. To most of the general public, the &amp;quot;Dodge Dart&amp;quot; is that beige sedan with a slant 6 and a 3-speed Torqueflite that their mom used to own- in other words, the &amp;#39;60s/&amp;#39;70s equivalent of the modern Dart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cars", "name": "t1_dg9s2m3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492233965.0, "created_utc": 1492205165.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhl2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65em2a", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9o0ek", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rotorain", "parent_id": "t1_dg9n4ob", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cars", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was really hoping that the new dart was going to be the new neon with a base model that's a cheap econobox and an srt version that could hang with the MazdaSpeed3, turbo civics, GTI, and the rest of the performance FWD crowd.
