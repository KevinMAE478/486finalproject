If you&amp;#39;re doing 120mph on a straightaway, and the cars 20-30ft in front of you start braking really hard into a corner, we just don&amp;#39;t know what the car will do in that situation.  Will it slam on the brakes for you, way before the normal braking zone?  Because if so, you are likely to get rear-ended by a Viper closing in on you at 150mph, who is not expecting you to slam on the brakes so far outside the braking zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if you are attempting to overtake a car on a straightaway, and you have to put a wheel on the white line on the outside edge of the track to do so, will the car think you are drifting out of your lane and push you back toward the center of the track?  Because that could cause a wreck, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Track safety at HPDE is all about being predictable.  You can tell new drivers apart because they are taking weird lines, braking at weird places, and generally doing unexpected things.  Predictable is both fast and safe.  These systems may cause the car to be unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think these guys basically said, look, we don&amp;#39;t have any idea how these systems will react yet, so we will treat them as guilty until proven innocent.
