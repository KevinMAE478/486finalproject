For the most part vehicles are in good condition, but I've seen some bombed out pieces of shit. One of my local favorite is the guy who drives a Corolla that has its roof caved in. \n\nThat being said there is little data pointing to states that have no safety inspections having significantly more road fatalities/injuries due to failed vehicle components. \n\nThey do get extremely ridiculous in states that do implement inspections. Obviously log suspension should fail. But in MA I was failed an inspection on my truck for a tiny crack in a tail light and because the bumper mounted hitch ball was \"obstructing\" my license plate. They'll check the front end suspension of your vehicle too, but not the rear end, which on my truck the rear shackles were broken, but that's good by MA standards. Oh and the truck was missing third gear. Meanwhile one of my motorcycles passed inspection even though the tires on it were 30 years old (I'm not exaggerating, they really were that old), but I passed because the tread depth was okay. Then my next one (which had brand new tires) I brought in for inspection failed because my fender delete made the turn signals be 1/2\" too close to each other so I had to ride home, make a spacer and ride back. I even exaggerated the spacer on one side (I used a Sharpie marker as the spacer so one turn signal stuck way out to create the required distance between turn signals) only to show how fucking dumb it was that I could pass like that. Then I went back home and removed the spacer after receiving my valid inspection sticker. \n\nIf safety inspections had standards that weren't written and enforced to the T by clueless bureaucrats I would support them. If they were entirely enforced by private repair businesses there's a good possibility many garages would start deeming vehicles unsafe and gouging for repairs. Until the inspection stations are run entirely by the government and the standards are written by a team of automotive engineers and enforced by qualified government employed technicians I don't ever see safety inspections being valid. The way inspections (at least in the states that have them) are carried out in the USA are a joke and do jack and shit to prevent unsafe vehicles on the roads. Meanwhile they fuck over people who have non-issues but just because they can fuck you on a technicality they will. \n\nThis is also ignoring the shops that will give you a sticker because they just don't care, which is a whole separate issue. They're not hard to find. You just gotta go to the sketchiest looking shop you can find. Probably don't even have to bribe them either. I never did. I would pay the standard government fee and they would just slap the sticker on and send me out the door in 5 minutes. \n\nDue to current standards and inspection processes I've come to conclude that it's all a money grab for the state govt. The state does not care as long as they're getting your money. They'll bust one or two garages a year and write a news story to keep the other garages on their toes and make the public feel good. But other than that business continues as normal and unsafe vehicles fill the roads. \n\nI mean you can't tell me this shit is enforced in any meaningful way when a MA state trooper pulled up to me being broken down on the side of the road and my bike had no inspection sticker and was clearly missing its turn signals and my friend who was there in his car had a big red R for safety rejection sticker on the windshield and we received no fine. The trooper checked our licenses and registrations and the inspection info definitely would have been radio'd to him, never minding it was clearly and obviously right in front of him. Especially considering in MA anyone can find out instantly and for free if a vehicle has passed/failed its inspection by going to the DMV website and punching in the license plate.

Then my next one (which had brand new tires) I brought in for inspection failed because my fender delete made the turn signals be 1/2&amp;quot; too close to each other so I had to ride home, make a spacer and ride back. I even exaggerated the spacer on one side (I used a Sharpie marker as the spacer so one turn signal stuck way out to create the required distance between turn signals) only to show how fucking dumb it was that I could pass like that. Then I went back home and removed the spacer after receiving my valid inspection sticker. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If safety inspections had standards that weren&amp;#39;t written and enforced to the T by clueless bureaucrats I would support them. If they were entirely enforced by private repair businesses there&amp;#39;s a good possibility many garages would start deeming vehicles unsafe and gouging for repairs. Until the inspection stations are run entirely by the government and the standards are written by a team of automotive engineers and enforced by qualified government employed technicians I don&amp;#39;t ever see safety inspections being valid. The way inspections (at least in the states that have them) are carried out in the USA are a joke and do jack and shit to prevent unsafe vehicles on the roads. Meanwhile they fuck over people who have non-issues but just because they can fuck you on a technicality they will. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is also ignoring the shops that will give you a sticker because they just don&amp;#39;t care, which is a whole separate issue. They&amp;#39;re not hard to find. You just gotta go to the sketchiest looking shop you can find. Probably don&amp;#39;t even have to bribe them either. I never did. I would pay the standard government fee and they would just slap the sticker on and send me out the door in 5 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to current standards and inspection processes I&amp;#39;ve come to conclude that it&amp;#39;s all a money grab for the state govt. The state does not care as long as they&amp;#39;re getting your money. They&amp;#39;ll bust one or two garages a year and write a news story to keep the other garages on their toes and make the public feel good. But other than that business continues as normal and unsafe vehicles fill the roads. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean you can&amp;#39;t tell me this shit is enforced in any meaningful way when a MA state trooper pulled up to me being broken down on the side of the road and my bike had no inspection sticker and was clearly missing its turn signals and my friend who was there in his car had a big red R for safety rejection sticker on the windshield and we received no fine. The trooper checked our licenses and registrations and the inspection info definitely would have been radio&amp;#39;d to him, never minding it was clearly and obviously right in front of him. Especially considering in MA anyone can find out instantly and for free if a vehicle has passed/failed its inspection by going to the DMV website and punching in the license plate. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cars", "name": "t1_dg6bpqq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492051096.0, "created_utc": 1492022296.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg61jeh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ak235", "parent_id": "t1_dg5yiem", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cars", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In more than one state it's an OBD II check, honk the horn, drive a few feet maybe, and not much more...oh, tint checks.
