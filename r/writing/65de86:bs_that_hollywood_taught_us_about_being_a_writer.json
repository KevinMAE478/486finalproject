Everything he thinks about what it would it be like gets destroyed when he actually gets to Hollywood. The movie even pokes fun at the writer himself, about how he has all these literary ambitions, to write about the people, but can't even listen to the ordinary person sitting next to him wanting to tell him a story.\n\nMaybe because I was a film major and worked a little in the film industry, I don't have those kinds of illusions. I used to have them when I was fresh out of school, until I got hit in the face with reality. All of us wanted to accumulate the necessary hours to get accepted into the various film-related guilds. I just toiled as a low-level grunt for various indie films and I had enough of the long grueling hours and quit. A buddy of mine, however, kept at it and sold a script and got into the screenwriting guild and has an agent.

I like the movies were it upends them, like the Coen brothers &amp;quot;Barton Fink,&amp;quot; where you see a young up-and-coming writer come to Hollywood to work on a screenplay for a studio. Everything he thinks about what it would it be like gets destroyed when he actually gets to Hollywood. The movie even pokes fun at the writer himself, about how he has all these literary ambitions, to write about the people, but can&amp;#39;t even listen to the ordinary person sitting next to him wanting to tell him a story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe because I was a film major and worked a little in the film industry, I don&amp;#39;t have those kinds of illusions.
