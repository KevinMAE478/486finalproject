So as much as you love what you created you need to think of what is necessary to the plot, what makes sense in terms of the context and the characters. You might end up using only 10%, but it will be a better book for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a you thing, it&amp;#39;s just a casualty of world building. I have several pages of history on my world and maybe will only cover 10% of it in the actual book if I&amp;#39;m capable of some good shoehorning. At least your guy likes to read, gives you an excuse. My guy wouldn&amp;#39;t be caught dead in a library so shoving some history into this thing is gonna be fun. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg8u9sq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492178737.0, "created_utc": 1492149937.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659wq7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8skkv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Seb_Romu", "parent_id": "t3_659wq7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If it is feeling forced it is probably because you are forcing it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is feeling forced it is probably because you are forcing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg8skkv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492175238.0, "created_utc": 1492146438.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659wq7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8yx0s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "crowqueen", "parent_id": "t3_659wq7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've used Polish and Russian in this way in my magical-Earth stories, but I've stopped actually writing phrases in the language, and only really refer to it when the character has a meaningful or ironic name (usually the latter: a woman who looks like she has Turkish ancestry is named 'Morozova', Miss Frost; the Cardinal in the story is named Sikorska, and people notice she puffs herself up like a *sikora*, a tit...).
