(For instance, naming a child after a living relative.)  What were their passions, hobbies, and interests?  (My mother named me after her favorite fictional character, because the character is strong, and she wanted me to be strong.)  Did they have other children besides the character?  Names of siblings should share a single aesthetic, unless the parents had an agreement where the mother got to name the girls and the father got to name the boys or something.  \n\nEveryone has an origin, and each character\u2019s name should reflect theirs.  \n\nImpact of the name:\n\nNames are chosen in the character\u2019s past, but they continue to have an impact in the present.  If there is symbolism, it should be symbolism the namers would have chosen, and that the character then must choose to accept or rebel against.  If the symbolism is bad, it may impact the character\u2019s relationship with the namer, or be representative of a relationship that was unhealthy from the start.  (I would suspect something seriously wrong with a parent who named their daughter Jezebel, for instance.)  Names also impact how a person is treated as they grow up.  \n\nFor example, an American boy named Valerie, Francis, or Shannon is going to have a lot of feelings about that, and it will shape who he becomes.  If Valerie is a well-adjusted boy, it will be because he has brought himself to an emotional place where he genuinely does not give a shit what other people think, and so he will not be so easily swayed by peer pressure as others might be.  He may even refuse to answer to Val.  If Valerie is poorly adjusted, he might insist on being called Val, and beat up anyone who calls him Valerie, and he will be otherwise insecure also, displaying many symptoms of fragile masculinity.\n\nBut even with less exotic examples, there is still an impact.  People named Denise and Dennis are much more likely to become dentists than are people named Mike or Michelle.  People also make unconscious assumptions based on names, which then shape how others respond to the person.  A girl named Flora might be treated as more fragile than a girl named Samantha going by Sam, and each might grow up to believe they are how others treated them.  \n\nWho is the character:\n\nAs a writer, I tend to start with a character.  What kinds of decisions they make in my plot, what their dialogue sounds like, etc.  Then I figure out what kind of origin and name would produce a person like that.  But it is never me as the writer directly naming the character.

Parents, grandparents, priest?  What culture are they from?  (If it is an imaginary culture, I will make a list of names with a communal aesthetic, which I will draw from for all of the characters.)  Do they live in the city or the country?  What was their socioeconomic status at the time, and what were each of their socioeconomic statuses of origin?  What did they want for this child?  If the namers were the parents, which of them had more power in the naming process?  Are there family names they wanted to pass down, and if so, is this the child who would have been saddled with them?  (More likely with firstborn children.)  Are there any naming taboos?
