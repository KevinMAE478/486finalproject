It sounds like you're already being very supportive of him, which is really wonderful, and I think it's fantastic that you've even gone to such lengths as posting on here for advice! Now here's what I would add to what's already been said:\n\nI could be wrong, but I think that the main reason why so many of us seem to have so many ideas and yet cannot put pen to page is basically two things: 1. A general fear of failure. Failure to publish, to finish, or to simply be inspired/good enough to keep an idea going that long; and 2. Too much self-inflicted criticalness. \n\nIf I could hazard a guess, I would say that he is always too tired to write, or always making excuses, because the prospect of actually writing is exhausting to him for the reasons I mentioned above. It may also be a result of him sort of mentally biting off more than he can chew, or in other words, he places the full weight of the entire novel on himself instead of just determining to write a single line, and so the task seems unmanageable. \n\nIt's also really comfortable to enjoy the feeling of unborn ideas and kind of sit in that dim, warm uncertainty and not take the courage to confirm whether they are actually good or not, so I wouldn't be surprised if he isn't feeling super excited about leaving that place for the cold light of day, either. It takes a lot of courage to actually write something down, because before it is written down it cannot be subject to scrutiny, not even his own, because it is not fully formed and is more subject to his feelings about it than actual critical assessment, but once it's down on the page, he will be forced to look at it with a reader's eye, and not all of us like what we see once our writing's in plain view. \n\nSo I guess here's what you should do: don't push him too hard, but I think reminders in the form of books and writing materials are really good ideas, even just to show him that you are so supportive of him, and to keep him thinking about it. I would suggest the book If You Want to Write, by Brenda Ueland. Seriously, buy that for him and ask him to read it...I really think it will help. Stay away from books on writing by Hemingway and Stephen King, they are only helpful for writers who need hard love to get going, or people who are already novelists and want some inspiration. For just getting going, finally, for once--go with Ueland. \n\nI would also give him the suggestion to write three pages (by hand, not typed) of stream-of-consciousness every day, preferably in the morning. This means literally writing down every word or sound that pops into his brain, without stopping, and without leaving anything out. For three pages. It takes about 30-45 minutes. The point of the exercise is to get rid of his mental \"critic\", the part of him that arrests his ability to write because he decides that it won't be good before he even writes it. Writing these pages every day will start to break down that mental habit of dismissing writing before it's even been done, and should ultimately make him feel more free to put down his prose in the same free, unrestrained way. \n\nSee, the great challenge facing beginning writers is the hurdle of accepting that writing a novel/story/poem/whatever is all about chiseling out of a big block as opposed to like, 3D printing or something. What I'm saying is, it's usually a lost cause to try and pull everything out of yourself already fully-formed. You have to just pour everything, every idea and thought indiscriminately, and then afterward you go back and you narrow things down to the best parts. You pretty much have to do it this way, assuming you're not a genius (and some people are--good for them!), because this is the only way to find your good ideas, when you're feel free and not being too critical. If you examine every idea that pops into your head for whether it's suitable for your story, you will become quickly discouraged. It's hard to explain why this is, but it just has to do with the way inspiration works. Inspiration is wild and unhinged and very much not analytical and nit-picking. Inspiration also has no idea what the hell is going on, that's the true nature of it, so when you try to bend inspired ideas to your will, they die instantly. \n\nProbably none of this is making any sense and I'm rambling, but suggest the exercise. It will feel good for him if he is not doing any writing otherwise, because even though it's not writing a novel, it is still writing, and any writing at all when you're not writing feels really good, and I really do think that the exercise will help him. And also get him that book. Just buy it and leave it laying around somewhere, or hand it to him in person if he's seemed receptive to that sort of thing in the past.
