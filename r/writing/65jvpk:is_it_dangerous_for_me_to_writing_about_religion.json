Obviously external sources will also be necessary, and the perspective of ex(whatever faith) might help too, but if you&amp;#39;re going to write about it you shouldn&amp;#39;t just write about it from the outside looking in -- you should have the knowledge and the empathy required to put yourself in their shoes. Then, if you wish to criticize, and it happens to offend, you will at least have done the leg work necessary to avoid a clumsy criticism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big question: have you ever met someone who belongs to the religion you wish to write about? Can you find beta readers who have a lot of experience with that faith?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people in here patting themselves on the back for their free speech forget that some of your readers might belong to or know a lot about that faith, and might roll their eyes and put the book down when they encounter something shallow, inaccurate, or patronizing. It&amp;#39;s not about restricting free speech, it&amp;#39;s about respecting the intelligence of your audience, which you should do whether your novel is about trapeze artists or Coptic Christians. It&amp;#39;s like when doctors watch medical shows and groan at the misinformation. Respect the reader enough to tell them something true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you approach it with the right kind of awareness and thoughtfulness, I don&amp;#39;t see why it should be an issue. I think you should try asking in various religious subreddits however, since in here you&amp;#39;ll be encouraged to lazily offend people in order to magically become as talented as Salmon Rushdie, as if that&amp;#39;s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dgb781i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492320418.0, "created_utc": 1492291618.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jvpk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jvpk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jvpk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcg657", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheBrendanReturns", "parent_id": "t1_dgbez4l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fuck that.
