As is often said on this sub: \"Nobody wants to read your version of ASOIAF or Harry Potter - get original.\"\n\nOriginality isn't born from abandoning all other known ideas; it comes from *stealing* other ideas.  When you steal something, you make it your own.  It no longer belongs to the previous owner.  This can be done two ways:\n\n1. Redoing what they did so well that your version is so much better that it puts the original to shame.\n\n2. Taking their concepts and doing something with them that is uniquely personal to you.\n\nMost writers default to #2.  They're inspired by something, but instead of just redoing it with their own twist, they develop an entire infrastructure that's inspired by all of the things they've learned from other authors.  It's like building a castle with legos, but you've stolen each block from other already built castles (sometimes multiple blocks from one castle).  You're creating something new and unique out of old materials in a way that is no longer recognizable to the outside eye, even though the author himself knows where each lego piece came from.\n\nAs for #1, Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane wrote a song called *Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas*, which was first performed by Judy Garland in 1944's *Meet Me in St. Louis*.  It's beautiful.  But 99% of the people reading this, as soon as they saw the title started singing it in Frank Sinatra's voice.  Why?  Because as good as the original was, he did it better - so much better that nobody even remembers that Judy Garland first sang it.  He stole the song from her.  So, if you're going to base your lego castle by taking pieces almost exclusively from one other castle, your new castle had better be so much better than the original version that people don't care it's a rip-off of someone else's fame.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an old adage about this: &lt;em&gt;Good artists copy; great artists steal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To copy is essentially a cut and paste of someone else&amp;#39;s work, re-done with enough changes that it&amp;#39;s not noticeable.  As is often said on this sub: &amp;quot;Nobody wants to read your version of ASOIAF or Harry Potter - get original.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Originality isn&amp;#39;t born from abandoning all other known ideas; it comes from &lt;em&gt;stealing&lt;/em&gt; other ideas.  When you steal something, you make it your own.  It no longer belongs to the previous owner.  This can be done two ways:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redoing what they did so well that your version is so much better that it puts the original to shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking their concepts and doing something with them that is uniquely personal to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most writers default to #2.  They&amp;#39;re inspired by something, but instead of just redoing it with their own twist, they develop an entire infrastructure that&amp;#39;s inspired by all of the things they&amp;#39;ve learned from other authors.  It&amp;#39;s like building a castle with legos, but you&amp;#39;ve stolen each block from other already built castles (sometimes multiple blocks from one castle).  You&amp;#39;re creating something new and unique out of old materials in a way that is no longer recognizable to the outside eye, even though the author himself knows where each lego piece came from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for #1, Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane wrote a song called &lt;em&gt;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&lt;/em&gt;, which was first performed by Judy Garland in 1944&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Meet Me in St. Louis&lt;/em&gt;.  It&amp;#39;s beautiful.  But 99% of the people reading this, as soon as they saw the title started singing it in Frank Sinatra&amp;#39;s voice.  Why?  Because as good as the original was, he did it better - so much better that nobody even remembers that Judy Garland first sang it.  He stole the song from her.  So, if you&amp;#39;re going to base your lego castle by taking pieces almost exclusively from one other castle, your new castle had better be so much better than the original version that people don&amp;#39;t care it&amp;#39;s a rip-off of someone else&amp;#39;s fame.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg4tl7l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491969398.0, "created_utc": 1491940598.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rccm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4wm3v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Agent_Alpha", "parent_id": "t3_64rccm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This definitely worked for me.
