When you first meet them, they don't spill their life story. More angles become clear the more time you spend with them.  Even for me right now, my own character development has become slightly frustrating, because I fail to remind myself that it's indeed a process.\n\nAnother piece of advice that has been helpful for me is the importance of observing your character in daily activities. This has helped me to look at characters as beings that should be breathing. Even when I leave the keyboard, they're still out there, breathing, sleeping, talking with friends, etc (depending on who they are of course). Writing a scene involving your character and imagining how they would behave in that context might be helpful in further fleshing them out. The scene doesn't even have to have anything to do with your main plot - I remember seeing in a video somewhere that they advised writing a scene between two characters talking about Pumpkin Spice Lattes in a Starbucks or something.

When you first meet them, they don&amp;#39;t spill their life story. More angles become clear the more time you spend with them.  Even for me right now, my own character development has become slightly frustrating, because I fail to remind myself that it&amp;#39;s indeed a process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another piece of advice that has been helpful for me is the importance of observing your character in daily activities. This has helped me to look at characters as beings that should be breathing. Even when I leave the keyboard, they&amp;#39;re still out there, breathing, sleeping, talking with friends, etc (depending on who they are of course). Writing a scene involving your character and imagining how they would behave in that context might be helpful in further fleshing them out. The scene doesn&amp;#39;t even have to have anything to do with your main plot - I remember seeing in a video somewhere that they advised writing a scene between two characters talking about Pumpkin Spice Lattes in a Starbucks or something. Every character will respond differently. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dgdtgl7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492479631.0, "created_utc": 1492450831.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sq0f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdw0n4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pmjohnson9062", "parent_id": "t3_65sq0f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree with the \"keep them relatable\" comment.
