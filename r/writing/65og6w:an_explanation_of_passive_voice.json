In case we\u2019re not sure what an object is, here are a few (active voice) examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She bought a &lt;strong&gt;car&lt;/strong&gt;.   (The car is the thing being acted on by the verb \u2013 when we ask \u201cWhat was bought ?\u201d the answer is, of course, \u201ca car.\u201d)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ate &lt;strong&gt;pizza&lt;/strong&gt;.  (Again, what was eaten?  Pizza.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Susan drew a &lt;strong&gt;picture&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tom designs &lt;strong&gt;buildings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These sentences are all in active voice \u2013 meaning that the person or thing doing the acting (performing the verb) is the subject of the sentence, while the thing being acted upon (the object of the action / verb) is the object.  Passive voice is when this structure is flipped around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A car was bought by her.  (See how the object of the action \u2013 the car \u2013 is now the subject of the sentence, while the person doing the action (\u201cher\u201d) is the object.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pizza was eaten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A picture was drawn by Susan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buildings are designed by Tom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Many Tenses of Passive Voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To help in identifying passive voice, here\u2019s a quick rundown of what passive voice looks like in most tenses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Present: The cake is eaten.&lt;br/&gt;\nPresent Perfect: The cake has been eaten.&lt;br/&gt;\nPresent Progressive: The cake is being eaten.&lt;br/&gt;\nPast: The cake was eaten.&lt;br/&gt;\nPast Perfect: The cake had been eaten.&lt;br/&gt;\nPast Progressive: The cake was being eaten.&lt;br/&gt;\nFuture: The cake will be eaten.&lt;br/&gt;\nFuture Perfect: The cake will have been eaten.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice, though, that the thing that makes them passive tense is still that the object of the action (the cake, in this sense) is what is the subject of the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uses of Passive Voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While we usually hear about how evil passive voice is and how it should be avoided at all costs, there are two main reasons why you would use this type of sentence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) The object is more important than the person or thing acting upon it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we use these two sentences as examples \u2013 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Julia made the cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cake was made by Julia&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2013 information-wise, these sentences as identical.  However, the emphasis of the sentence is different.  In the first, the emphasis is on Julia, the person making the cake.  She is the most prominent part of the sentence.  In the second, the cake takes over being most prominent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does this matter?  Well, it can.  It all depends on what has come before and what will come after it.  For a simple example, if we were writing a story about a birthday party, and we had come to the unveiling of the cake, and are focused on said cake, it might behoove the author to use a passive sentence to keep the emphasis on the cake when the time comes to reveal who made it.  Alternatively, if we were in a section of the story focused on Julia and how hard she has worked to create the perfect birthday party, the active voice is probably going to be more suited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) The other main use for passive voice is when the person or thing responsible for the action is unknown.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tim ate the cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is an active voice sentence (Tim is the one doing the action, and he is the subject).  So, the passive voice would be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The cake was eaten by Tim.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let\u2019s say Tim is a really crafty fellow, and has managed to eat the cake without anyone knowing.  We could say:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Somebody ate the cake!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, we could simply say:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The cake was eaten!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This situation where the perpetrator of an action is unknown is a common use of passive voice.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The gems were stolen!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The princess was kidnapped!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All our soldiers were killed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things that are not passive voice but some people mistake for passive voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because passive voice sentences are made using a \u201cto be verb\u201d along with a past participle, there are a few instances where similar grammatical patterns emerge.  Just because a sentence has a \u201cto be verb\u201d or a past participle does not make it passive voice.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;John had studied for a week for his test.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not a passive sentence, as the person doing the action \u2013 John \u2013 is still the subject of the sentence.  This is just a past perfect sentence, a perfectly usual verb tense that can come up in writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To use a few, earlier examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tim had eaten the cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julia had made a cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bowser had kidnapped the princess before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of these sentences are in passive voice, even though they have a past participle.  The only thing that makes a sentence passive is the object of the action becoming the subject of a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are several active voice sentences that start to look like the different forms of the passive voice we saw in the section showing all the tenses of passive voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;John has been visiting Europe for a month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;John will have visited Europe for a month next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither of these sentences are in passive voice, as, again, the thing doing the action (John) is the subject of the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Passive voice is a tricky grammatical thing that throws a lot of writers for a loop and also is the subject of a lot of writing advice.  The most important thing to remember is that a passive sentence is made by placing the object of the action as the subject of a sentence \u2013 basically, at the beginning.  Other than that, remember that passive voice, like everything else in English, has its uses within writing \u2013 just make sure you know why you\u2019re using it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finished an incomplete sentence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spelling&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**Introduction: What is Passive Voice?**\n\nPassive voice is when the object of an action (the thing that has something happening to it) ends up as the subject of the sentence.

However, the emphasis of the sentence is different.  In the first, the emphasis is on Julia, the person making the cake.  She is the most prominent part of the sentence.

For example, &amp;quot;He was born in Winter.&amp;quot; You could theoretically say, &amp;quot;His mother birthed him in the winter,&amp;quot; but not only is this terribly awkward, but being born and giving birth are not exactly equivalent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, passive voice can be used for dramatic effect in some circumstances. For example, &amp;quot;He didn&amp;#39;t just die, he was murdered!&amp;quot; Can&amp;#39;t you just hear the &amp;quot;Dun dun duuuuun&amp;quot; after that?
