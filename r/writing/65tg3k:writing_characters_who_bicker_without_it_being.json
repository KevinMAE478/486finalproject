For Charlie, it always comes back to the Waitress, for Dennis, getting laid, for Frank, making money, etc.  \n\nOnce you've exhausted the obvious tie-ins, it's then fun to pick something that doesn't sound like money (like when Frank was all about guns), but then reveal it was really about his \"core\" (when it was revealed Frank ginned up the fear in the episode so people would buy guns so he could make money).  \n\nYou should have more than one thing for the characters to argue over.  The main thing, but they subsets of things that are important, but not THAT important.\n\nFinally, you can only take the bickering so far.  I'll have the dialogue go back and forth a couple of exchanges, break it up with some description of action, then go back and then end it.\n\nIn improv, we always heighten, so bickering should heighten, especially if you're going for comedy.  You pace of heightening shouldn't be too fast, especially if you're writing a novel, but each individual argument should heighten to a point.\n\nAnd understand that there is a reason characters bicker.
