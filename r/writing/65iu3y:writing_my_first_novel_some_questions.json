It can be very intimidating, and a lot of people throw in the towel early on. For quick sauce, I have self published two books with a third one (second in a series) coming out in August, and another (third in series) in December. I've used editors, and I've used non-professional editors. I've been doing this since 2012.\n\nI should have jotted your questions down in order, but I'll do the best I can here. On mobile, so if it looks funny, I apologize.\n\n1. There will never, ever be a day when you look at one of your books or stories, no matter who edited it, without seeing things you would change. Descriptions, character quirks, something will always feel like you could have done it better, and here's why: every day you experience life. That life changes you. Add a month or a year from when you wrote something, and of course you're going to see other, perhaps better, ways to say something. Your style is going to change drastically the more you write. My first book (2009) makes me cringe so bad I removed it from the Internet altogether. \n\nThe idea of a first draft is to get the story down, however it has to be told at first. It's NEVER EVER EVER going to be perfect the first time through. Probably not the fifth. Write your heart out. Use the same words over and over if you must, just to get the story down. Eventually you can go back through with a thesaurus and fix that.\n\nI know a prolific author who basically writes the outline of their masterpiece and then their editor fills in the details. Please don't ever be this author. Put the work in. \n\n2. I used family and friends at first also. Here is the thing. Family and friends know you want to write. They've known for years. They can't write, wouldn't dream of it. So when you asked them, of course they love it. They love you, and want to encourage and support you. Space Pigs Boning Purple Unicorns on Jupiter SOUNDS great, but that's a shit title. How are they going to know that? And how are they going to have the balls to tell this great writer in their life that their writing needs work? No one you know wants to be the asshole that pops your dream bubble. \n\nFind a writer's group. Try your local library, they will often have them once or twice a month. If you live in a small town where this isn't offered, you can often take part online. Let strangers tear it apart. It will make you a better writer. Facebook sucks, i know, but they have some of the better writing groups around. Just avoid the drama. Figure out what your genre is and search for the official editors/publishers of that. I write romantic adventure and I use the Romance Writers of America group when I can. They're great. \n\nAre you friends with any teachers? Often they'll look it over and nail you on everything you thought was perfect. \n\n3. As stated above in my sauce, yep, though no short stories, I'm a novelist through and through. I stumbled upon a hybrid publisher in 2015. I was connected with some editors, got my book out, and a month later the company closed. Suck ass, but they gave my rights back which can be unheard of. I kept the connections I made there, and my lady edits me for free because she's that involved with my characters in the series. This is invaluable as she charges anywhere from $.05-$.10 a word. Yes, a word. The last manuscript I sent to her would have been $400, and that wouldn't have taken me all the way through the process, as there are generally multiple rounds of edits. \n\nDo not accept the first editor that says they will go over your stuff. Send them a decent portion of it and ask for a test edit. You have to make sure their style matches yours. If they're a romance editor, you may not want them looking at your horror novel.\n\nPractice your self-editing. When you do go back through, look at every single sentence in your book, as a sentence, as a piece of the entire puzzle. Is it confusing? Does it add anything or take away from the feel? Check your word choices: are they dark when they should be light? Don't worry about commas and punctuation right off, save that for last. A good editor can see past that, if you aren't great with it. \n\nAnd finally, write every day. I know, I know. We're tired from work, life, and everything else. But if you have the energy to get wrapped up in a show on Netflix for four hours, you have an hour to immerse yourself in your own world building, and you'll probably be happier for it. I write full time now and don't turn on the television until well at my spouse returns from work during the day. Not because I should be writing or cleaning or whatever, but because nothing can hold my interest the way my characters should. If they can't suck ME in to work on them, who else is going to want to? \n\nAn hour a day, my friend, one hour. Find a corner in your house where all you do is write. Go there at the same time every day, use the same lighting, listen to the same type of music. Train your brain. Yes, writing requires inspiration but if you only write when you're inspired, you'll never finish. Writing is work. Hard, hard work that is heart breaking and soul crushing, and one of the greatest things I've done with my life so far. \n\nEdit: I meant $.005-$.010 a word. Apologies.

This is invaluable as she charges anywhere from $.05-$.10 a word. Yes, a word. The last manuscript I sent to her would have been $400, and that wouldn&amp;#39;t have taken me all the way through the process, as there are generally multiple rounds of edits. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not accept the first editor that says they will go over your stuff. Send them a decent portion of it and ask for a test edit. You have to make sure their style matches yours. If they&amp;#39;re a romance editor, you may not want them looking at your horror novel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Practice your self-editing. When you do go back through, look at every single sentence in your book, as a sentence, as a piece of the entire puzzle. Is it confusing? Does it add anything or take away from the feel? Check your word choices: are they dark when they should be light? Don&amp;#39;t worry about commas and punctuation right off, save that for last. A good editor can see past that, if you aren&amp;#39;t great with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, write every day. I know, I know. We&amp;#39;re tired from work, life, and everything else. But if you have the energy to get wrapped up in a show on Netflix for four hours, you have an hour to immerse yourself in your own world building, and you&amp;#39;ll probably be happier for it. I write full time now and don&amp;#39;t turn on the television until well at my spouse returns from work during the day. Not because I should be writing or cleaning or whatever, but because nothing can hold my interest the way my characters should. If they can&amp;#39;t suck ME in to work on them, who else is going to want to? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An hour a day, my friend, one hour. Find a corner in your house where all you do is write. Go there at the same time every day, use the same lighting, listen to the same type of music. Train your brain. Yes, writing requires inspiration but if you only write when you&amp;#39;re inspired, you&amp;#39;ll never finish. Writing is work. Hard, hard work that is heart breaking and soul crushing, and one of the greatest things I&amp;#39;ve done with my life so far. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I meant $.005-$.010 a word.
