Please note that I\u2019m not claiming any definitive end-all-be-all here, there is almost always an exception to any given rule. This is just meant to be a tool for writers to use to improve the characters in their writing and to get some discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is a character?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many people inside our fictional books, but not all of them qualify as characters, and some are characters more so than others. It\u2019s important to be mindful of which level a person will be when determining how much time to spend making them feel real and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Primary characters: Characters who are essential to the plot, in the limelight for a majority of the story, and who have arcs. These are the names you\u2019d mention in the pitch for your story. (Bruce Wayne, the Joker)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondary characters: Recurring characters who play vital roles in the story but don\u2019t push the plot forward. They may or may not have their own arc, but it will be more subtle than a primary character\u2019s if they do. (Alfred, Commissioner Gordon)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tertiary characters: Memorable characters who appear for a small time and have no arc. (Mob bosses, Gotham\u2019s mayor)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These first three levels share \u201ccharacterness\u201d. They count as characters, which means they probably have names, they have dialogue, and they should want something. Try to figure out what they desire, what perceived hole in their life drives that desire, what flaws that hole creates in their personality, what positive attributes their drive has created in them, and what thing they actually need to fill that hole. This is the \u201cEvery character should want something, even if it\u2019s just a glass of water\u201d principle. Once you know who they are and what they want, you can figure out how they will interact with the other characters - what they would bond over and what would spark conflict between them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last level lacks this \u201ccharacterness\u201d:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Setting: All of the people who aren\u2019t named, don\u2019t have meaningful dialogue, who are used to make the setting feel lived in or to give it detail. If your story is a movie, these would be the uncredited walk-ons and unnamed \u201cThug #3\u201d types.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all stories need characters in each of these levels, but it\u2019s good to keep in mind where a character is. The higher up a character is on this list, the more time you should spend fleshing them out because the reader will be spending more time with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To help keep characterization feeling cohesive, limit characters who have an arc to a single characterization arc at a time - don\u2019t have them trying to improve multiple facets of their personality simultaneously. This doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t have multiple flaws, though, they can and should have &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; flaws beside the one that they\u2019re growing in.  Also keep in mind that most people don\u2019t completely outgrow their personal faults, which can be particularly relevant for longer stories or series.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making characters interesting:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boring characters, especially boring protagonists, can kill an otherwise interesting story. In order to fix boring characters, the first thing to look at is &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; the character is as a person. If they weren\u2019t filling this role in this story, what would they be doing? Doing interesting things in interesting places with interesting people does not make a character interesting by association or proximity. They need to be interesting because of who they are right now. (And a dark, tortured past is no excuse for proper characterization.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real people have multiple facets of their life, they aren\u2019t defined by a single desire. Furthermore, interesting characters should have desires outside of the plot. Primary and secondary characters should have multiple desires, while tertiary characters can can have one desire define them as being one dimensional for a single scene can be entertaining while being one dimensional for a whole novel will quickly become tiresome. These other desires can be shown with as little as a single offhand line of dialogue - \u201cHow\u2019s your boy\u2019s teeball team doing?\u201d as an example. A specific pitfall to avoid is having a character who\u2019s only real desire is for the protagonist - either romantically or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another important way to make your characters interesting is to make them memorable through diversity, in both plot role and characterization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plot role diversity is important to streamline your story and keep each person\u2019s contributions clearly defined in the audience\u2019s memory. Take a look at your cast one by one and see which characters you couldn\u2019t tell the story without, and which characters could be combined or eliminated without hampering the story. Every character added will make your story longer and you\u2019ll risk making it less cohesive, so carefully evaluate who you want to include in the final draft. Once you decide which characters you need, figure out what background lead them to their starting place in the story. For example, if a character needs to be angry for plot purposes, figure out why they\u2019re angry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While diversity in race, gender, sexuality, age, ability, socioeconomic background and other big talking point topics are important, also keep in mind smaller areas. Diversity in alcohol preference, intro/extroversion (and Myers Briggs profiles in general), interests and hobbies, and other small topics will make even two characters from nearly identical backgrounds feel separate and individual, leaving no room for excuses when it comes to having monolithic groups (the \u201call dwarves are Gimli\u201d problem). Having each character being passionate about something specific that no one else in the story is passionate about will make them stand out and be remembered. This will also give them something to do unrelated to the main plot - which will make them feel more real, and provide opportunities to introduce minor conflicts. These conflicts can arise from each character\u2019s  unique view of each other character, having varied default emotions depending on who they\u2019re talking to. These subtle differences in how they interact with other people can reveal or reinforce aspects of characterization for both characters, opening the door for jealousy or misunderstandings or envy that subplots can be built around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have a character with some real characterization, try writing a scene of their backstory or a monologue from them to really explore all the aspects of their personality, take as much time as you can to get to know them as an individual before you put them into the actual story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other aspects of characterization are important as well:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSympathy\u201d - How much the audience likes a character as a person - not how interested they are in reading about them, but how much they want to be friends with this person - can make them interesting. Making characters &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; likeable gives you room to grow them during a story, can create memorable anti-heros, or make other characters more likeable by comparison. On the other hand, making a villain more likeable can make them feel less like a mustache-twirling cliche and more like a real person. Audiences tend to like characters more when: The psychic distance between the reader and character is smaller (first person makes the reader automatically like the PoV character more, third person omniscience will make characters less likeable). They are funny or witty, or have other positive attributes that the audience wishes to emulate. They have vulnerabilities - emotional, mental, or physical handicaps. They are self-aware about their shortcomings or negative attributes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCompetence\u201d - How skilled a character is also contributes to how interesting they are, but too much skill will make the audience root against rather than for them. &lt;strong&gt;Less&lt;/strong&gt; skill gives the character room to struggle with try/fail cycles and to grow. If skill is too high in too many areas, you risk creating a Mary Sue, though this can be avoided by showing the real, personal, significant price the character had to pay to achieve that skill. Showing how skillful someone is boils down to conveying 1) how difficult the task is and 2) how much effort the character exerts performing the task. You can show the first by having other characters fail at it, or by showing the character struggling despite being skilled in other unrelated areas (proving that they aren\u2019t simply inept). The second can be shown by how much you focus on the character\u2019s process - skip straight to the finished state without explaining the steps to show the reader that the character didn\u2019t have to think their way through the problem, they just figured it out quickly. You can also show a character succeeding at something early on and then failing as the situation changes later - showing the audience that this is now more difficult than it was before. If you need to quickly establish how skilled a new character is, especially later into the story, you can either have an established character attest to the newcomer&amp;#39;s skill (the established strongman saying someone else is strong) or have the newcomer best the established character (the newcomer beating the strongman at arm wrestling) (be careful not to do this too often, though, as you can risk eroding your established characterization - suddenly your strongman is getting beaten every chapter and starts to look average or even below average). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cProactivity\u201d - How active (not jumping and hitting things, but &lt;strong&gt;choosing&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;make efforts&lt;/strong&gt; toward &lt;strong&gt;plot goals&lt;/strong&gt;) a character is in the plot also helps determine how interesting they are. Good stories focus on protagonists who are consciously and purposefully making choices to further their plot goals. Once again, being &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; active gives your character room to grow, or prevents non-protagonists from stealing the spotlight. Keep in mind that if a character has no choice other than to act, that doesn\u2019t make them \u201cactive\u201d in this sense of the word. Making the &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; to do so (or to not do so) is crucial in making them interesting. Many stories begin be having the main character(s) reacting to their situation or the villain. This can be fixed by giving them smaller challenges as part of their reacting or additional challenges beyond the main plot to be active in trying to solve. If you think your main character(s) isn\u2019t active enough, or doesn\u2019t have sufficient motivation to believably choose to get involved, look at what stakes they have in the conflict and try to make those stakes more personal. You can also give them something else to do beside the main plot, especially if they\u2019re not the protagonist, or experiment with stripping them of friends and other resources that make problem solving too easy. If they\u2019re too easily reverting from active to inactive, consider making them less skilled - making them work harder to achieve their goals and failing more often leads to try/fail cycles or yes-but/no-and cycles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final method of making characters interesting is the most important: how they relate to the plot itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Primary characters need to have personal stakes in the story conflict. \u201cSave the world\u201d is fine and good, but the reader knows the world isn\u2019t likely to actually be destroyed. Make the stakes smaller, more personal, and you\u2019ll have the reader more interested in the character\u2019s plight. \u201cHe saved the world, but can he save his best friend too?\u201d tones down the stakes - the whole world won\u2019t blow up, but the best friend might fall off the ledge. Or the hero might not win the football game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along with plausible and personal stakes, the character needs to have the chance to make meaningful choices along the way as well. If a character is presented with two choices, and one of them is counter to who they are at their core, then they really don\u2019t have any choice. Make sure the choices your character has are &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; choices, and make those choices matter. They can choose what they want, but show the cost they have to pay for their choices. A worse pitfall is strong arming your protagonist into making a plot choice that goes against their characterization without sufficient motivation for doing so (and realize that this will tell the reader that whatever the motivation was is more important to the character than the aspect of themself that they compromised).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on these tips and tricks? Any that stand out as particularly useful, or particularly wrong? Who are some of your favorite characters? Least favorite characters? Characters you love to hate? How do you think the author got you to like them? Where would they fall on the Sympathy - Competence - Proactivity scales?
