Don\u2019t just straight out say it, work it into the first couple of sentences as part of the natural flow. Use keywords to get buyer\u2019s attention.\n\n* ##Do introduce your main character\n\n    You want buyers to know the person they\u2019re going to be reading about, or at least have some kind of idea. People relate to the main character, they invest themselves emotionally, so they need to know who that person is before they buy.\n\n* ##Don't blow your own trumpet\n\n    Be careful not to oversell yourself or your book. You don\u2019t want to say how amazing you or your writing is.
