It happens to everyone, because no one knows everything, and we&amp;#39;re often unaware of how little we actually know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to this: I&amp;#39;m not a fan of &amp;quot;write what you know&amp;quot; as a piece of advice. It&amp;#39;s too fraught with ambiguities. There&amp;#39;s not a firm consensus on what it actually means, and beginners are prone to going with the most literal interpretation, which is possibly the least helpful way to interpret that statement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tend to stay away from judging what people should/should not write about. If they fuck it up because they were unaware of their own ignorance and refused to ask for help, that&amp;#39;s their own problem.

Hundreds of studies have shown that &lt;a href=\"http://web.csulb.edu/%7Emfiebert/assault.htm\"&gt;women commit partner abuse&lt;/a&gt; at similar rates to men, and also commit &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/?utm_source=atlfb\"&gt;sexual assault&lt;/a&gt; against men at surprisingly high rates.  The consequences are not necessarily the same - men are much more likely to seriously injure or kill their victims - but the incidence of female perpetrated violence is still high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, a polarized view of the sexes (all men are this, all women are that) is very toxic to understanding human nature.  Men and women are more alike than different, and that applies to both our good and bad qualities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg9dqv3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492216884.0, "created_utc": 1492188084.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6597vo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6597vo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9pogu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "devious29", "parent_id": "t1_dg9d05o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The one memorable study was of men who called the police in the US in 2009, the results were less than encouraging:\n\nIn 49% of cases neither party was arrested\nIn 8% of cases both the abuser and abused was arrested\nIn 17% of cases only the abuser was arrested\nIn 26% of cases only the abused was arrested\n\nSo that's about 1 in 3 men who call the police about suffering domestic violence are arrested themselves.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one memorable study was of men who called the police in the US in 2009, the results were less than encouraging:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 49% of cases neither party was arrested\nIn 8% of cases both the abuser and abused was arrested\nIn 17% of cases only the abuser was arrested\nIn 26% of cases only the abused was arrested&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s about 1 in 3 men who call the police about suffering domestic violence are arrested themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg9pogu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492230998.0, "created_utc": 1492202198.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6597vo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9d0ag", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sorry_bad_english_", "parent_id": "t1_dg9d05o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; You're \n\n\\* you're.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* you&amp;#39;re.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg9d0ag", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492216049.0, "created_utc": 1492187249.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9d05o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "damn_yank", "parent_id": "t1_dg9biy3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're forgetting the social aspect.

It gets boring to always have a male protagonist and then stuff a female for all the love bullshit. No, even if you did save her, she's not going to love you back. You should be saving her just because she's weak and needs help, and in that case you should be helping your friends too.

You all are some weirdos. Yeah, I know, society wont accept men who have been suffering from \"abuse\" but the man could just defend himself with just threats and he's good to go. A woman can just say a little, \"No\" and be punched halfway across the room. One of the comments said that women can use scalding water and bats. Don't you think men can't do the same? That along with physical violence is gonna create a more fucked up result then what women create. Another comment said studies have show men suffer from violence too. Well, that \"violence\" is not violence if you classify the wrong way. Shouting at someone is abuse? Punching someone is abuse? Another comment said that women are more likely to use emotional abuse. Don't you think men are capable of doing the same?

That&amp;#39;s why i find it incredibly bullshit-y when men claim to be abused or raped by women, or whine whenever women get harassed because &amp;quot;Men ged harast doo.&amp;quot; No, it&amp;#39;s not the same and the evidence is right before you. You don&amp;#39;t even need to google it, you&amp;#39;ve studied history, you&amp;#39;re surrounded by females. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I disagree with you too. It gets boring to always have a male protagonist and then stuff a female for all the love bullshit. No, even if you did save her, she&amp;#39;s not going to love you back. You should be saving her just because she&amp;#39;s weak and needs help, and in that case you should be helping your friends too. The existence of female characters it to have the female readers relate to them and no, love stories are not going to help as it is biologically proven that men desire more sex than women do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Yesterday you were agreeing with him that women are less stronger than men and now you&amp;#39;re attacking me for saying that women &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; weaker than men and can&amp;#39;t do any harm. You all are some weirdos. Yeah, I know, society wont accept men who have been suffering from &amp;quot;abuse&amp;quot; but the man could just defend himself with just threats and he&amp;#39;s good to go. A woman can just say a little, &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; and be punched halfway across the room. One of the comments said that women can use scalding water and bats. Don&amp;#39;t you think men can&amp;#39;t do the same? That along with physical violence is gonna create a more fucked up result then what women create. Another comment said studies have show men suffer from violence too. Well, that &amp;quot;violence&amp;quot; is not violence if you classify the wrong way. Shouting at someone is abuse? Punching someone is abuse? Another comment said that women are more likely to use emotional abuse. Don&amp;#39;t you think men are capable of doing the same? And women &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; more emotional than men, so they suffer more from emotional abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg95cwm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492206619.0, "created_utc": 1492177819.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8l4ja", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JulyAmigo", "parent_id": "t3_6597vo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 1, "body": "I can't help but roll my eyes at Action Girls.

The ideas you expressed are deeply troubling and dangerous to have. \n\n&gt; Okay, last I checked, physical punishment is only considered abuse if it leaves a mark.\n\nWhere did you check this and who decided?  On what grounds was this deemed okay?  The person/people who decided this, what gives them the moral authority to make this decision for children *who don't have a say in the decision*?

I used extreme examples on purpose to illustrate a point: at what point does violence become unacceptable?\n\n&gt; Second, more often than not, the slap was triggered by the child making one disrespectful or uncalled for comment too many, or because they were doing legitimate rule breaking.\n\nIf I'm understanding this correctly, one \"too many\" disrespectful or uncalled for comments, or legitimate rule breaking, triggers the violence.  Are you trying to say because a certain action triggered the parent's \"response\" that it makes said response acceptable?  What is \"too many\"?  Five?  Ten comments?  What makes something \"uncalled for\"?\n\nMost importantly: **where do you draw the line?**  Is there any age where it *shouldn't* be acceptable to hit a child?  Is 10 too young?  5?  2?  Lashing out because you've \"snapped\" is not a legitimate reason to hit someone.  From my understanding, the only time it's okay to hit someone else (by law) is if you're defending yourself (or participate in sports).  I can't comprehend why children have less protection than adults, considering they are weaker, less experienced, and their ability to reason and make good decisions are still developing.\n\n&gt; Those are all offenses that would have gotten me worse than a slap from my parents.\n\nHere is the crux of the issue: you were brought up a certain way and exposed to certain \"traditions\".  Some people adopt these traditions as acceptable.  The logic behind this seems reasonable enough:\n\n* P1.  My parents care about me.\n* P2.  My parents hit me when I was \"bad\".\n* C. If someone I care about is bad, it's okay to hit them.\n\nand/or\n\n* P1.  My parents hit me when I was a child.\n* P2.  I turned out okay.\n* C.  Children who are hit turn out okay.\n\nYou get the idea.  Between rationalizing the behavior through logic, cognitive dissonance, or some other means, we think it's okay.\n\nHowever, I think we can agree that just because a person experiences something doesn't make that experience (necessarily) okay, right?  Someone who stabs you in the leg because you took the last slice of pizza doesn't make that action okay.\n\nIf a parent hits a child, that's abuse.  End of story.  We can discuss the severity of the abuse, but that doesn't change the nature of it.  The person may not be a monster, but they also do not deserve instant absolution. **Only** if the parent acknowledges what they did was wrong and never do it again is forgiveness acceptable.\n\nSo let me ask this: what is the purpose of using physical violence on a child?  To get them to acquiesce to parental authority?  What does a child learn from the experience?  **What if it turns out the parent was wrong or was missing information?**  \n\nWhen I was 10 or 11 I had my head slammed into the wood ladder of my bunk bed.  My brother was crying and my father had rushed in.  When he found out what happened, I got a nice, half-hearted apology.  My pops thought what he did was acceptable -- he was just mistaken *this time*.  So what had happened?   My brother stubbed his toe.\n\nThen there was this time I was going to my half-sister's father's house for the weekend (my brother loved to go and I would go occasionally because I was bored at home).  I was maybe 8 or 9 -- it's hard to remember exactly.  My half-sister, her father, me, and my brother were in his truck.  He stopped for gas.  When her dad came back, sis was crying.  Instant punch to the side of my head.  I saw white.  What happened?  She dropped her candy.  I didn't even get an apology, just a \"whoopsie\".   \n\nJust one more -- I think I was around 13 this time.  My half-sister was crying.  Mom's boyfriend (at the time) runs out, grabs me, and pushes me up against the back of the couch, holding my throat and choking me (didn't leave marks!).  I was terrified; there was rage burning in his eyes and pulling at the sides of his mouth as seethed through clenched teeth.  He **knew** I did something wrong.  Through clenched teeth he asks my sister what happened.  Well, funny story (you'll laugh -- he sure did), her watch broke in the basement because she dropped it.  Oh, and this is hilarious, I wasn't even in the basement! LOL!  But boy, did I sure learn my lesson.\n\nI have many more stories too, unfortunately.  And each time, the person who doled out the punishment thought they were doing \"the right thing\".  Every one of those people -- my father, my sister's dad, mom's ex-boyfriends, my step-father -- were abusive **pieces**.  **Of**.  **Shit**.  Chloe's step father *was* a bad guy if he physically hit her, regardless of whether she was guilty.\n\nIf you want to portray child abuse as okay in a story, that's your prerogative, but the idea that laying a hand on a child is acceptable, yours or not, for whatever reason, is not okay.  **It is never okay to hit a child for any reason.**  Anyone who thinks otherwise is ignorant and doesn't understand the negative ramifications of using violence as a tool for \"lessons\".", "edited": 1492235591.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know no one will probably see this except maybe one or two people, but it needs to be said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get this is a thread about cliches, but I take serious issue with your second point -- I disagree, vehemently, with your remarks about child abuse.

Instant punch to the side of my head.  I saw white.  What happened?  She dropped her candy.  I didn&amp;#39;t even get an apology, just a &amp;quot;whoopsie&amp;quot;.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just one more -- I think I was around 13 this time.  My half-sister was crying.  Mom&amp;#39;s boyfriend (at the time) runs out, grabs me, and pushes me up against the back of the couch, holding my throat and choking me (didn&amp;#39;t leave marks!).  I was terrified; there was rage burning in his eyes and pulling at the sides of his mouth as seethed through clenched teeth.  He &lt;strong&gt;knew&lt;/strong&gt; I did something wrong.  Through clenched teeth he asks my sister what happened.  Well, funny story (you&amp;#39;ll laugh -- he sure did), her watch broke in the basement because she dropped it.  Oh, and this is hilarious, I wasn&amp;#39;t even in the basement! LOL!  But boy, did I sure learn my lesson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have many more stories too, unfortunately.  And each time, the person who doled out the punishment thought they were doing &amp;quot;the right thing&amp;quot;.  Every one of those people -- my father, my sister&amp;#39;s dad, mom&amp;#39;s ex-boyfriends, my step-father -- were abusive &lt;strong&gt;pieces&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;Of&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;Shit&lt;/strong&gt;.  Chloe&amp;#39;s step father &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a bad guy if he physically hit her, regardless of whether she was guilty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to portray child abuse as okay in a story, that&amp;#39;s your prerogative, but the idea that laying a hand on a child is acceptable, yours or not, for whatever reason, is not okay.  &lt;strong&gt;It is never okay to hit a child for any reason.&lt;/strong&gt;  Anyone who thinks otherwise is ignorant and doesn&amp;#39;t understand the negative ramifications of using violence as a tool for &amp;quot;lessons&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dgacmhb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492263984.0, "created_utc": 1492235184.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6597vo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg93hgo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Slytherinpride22", "parent_id": "t1_dg91olt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "To be fair, I'm not sure the Romantic Comedy genre could even exist without that cliche=-p  Otherwise, it's just a regular Comedy that happens to have a Romantic subplot=-p lol", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I&amp;#39;m not sure the Romantic Comedy genre could even exist without that cliche=-p  Otherwise, it&amp;#39;s just a regular Comedy that happens to have a Romantic subplot=-p lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg93hgo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492203650.0, "created_utc": 1492174850.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6597vo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9thg6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CheeseQueenKariko", "parent_id": "t1_dg91olt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" (where that stupid cliche is a subplot)\n\nPretty sure that was Goblet of Fire, Phoenix was about Harry getting all the main good guys on his side.
