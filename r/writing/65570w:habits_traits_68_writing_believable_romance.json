Awesome! This is my wheelhouse :D&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I know many of you aren&amp;#39;t going to be writing romance novels, but you may wind up with a romance subplot on day and I hope that this will help you make it convincing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Above all else, a romance plot is a character arc plot. But with two characters (or more, I don&amp;#39;t judge, but for the sake of simplicity, let&amp;#39;s stick with two for now.) Both of these characters have to have some fundamental flaw or short-coming that they may not even realize themselves. But you know it&amp;#39;s there. You&amp;#39;re God and you see all. By the end of the plot/book/arc, not only will your characters have realized their fundamental flaw, but they&amp;#39;ll have learned how to overcome it through the power of &lt;em&gt;looooove&lt;/em&gt;. Cheesy, I know, but that&amp;#39;s romance for ya.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite books on the subject calls this stage &amp;quot;hole-hearted&amp;quot; (and the end-stage &amp;quot;whole-hearted.&amp;quot; Simple, right?) basically meaning that the character is missing something and maybe they don&amp;#39;t even know what it is, but it&amp;#39;s the other character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this is probably sounding kind of obvious. How do you get them from hole-hearted to whole-hearted?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, they need to have opposing goals and clashing personalities.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a saying in the romance community: If he&amp;#39;s a firefighter, she&amp;#39;s an arsonist. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get the best results when you pit together people that are nothing alike. She could take things too seriously and he never takes anything serious at all (my current WIP) or maybe she longs for adventure and he&amp;#39;s weary from his travels (my last book). Whatever the case may be, the uniting factor is &lt;strong&gt;they don&amp;#39;t realize what they&amp;#39;re doing is wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; Generally, they&amp;#39;re content with the way things are going, even if they&amp;#39;re not happy, and it&amp;#39;s the introduction of the other player that turns everything on its head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And remember, I said goals &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; personalities. Your characters have to have goals (you knew that, right? Of course you did.) and those goals &lt;strong&gt;should not&lt;/strong&gt; be romance. In fact, romance should be the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; thing they want and could actually get in the way of their goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See? We&amp;#39;re already building conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve got your personalities and goals fleshed out, it&amp;#39;s time to get down to the nitty gritty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Romance is often accused of being formulaic, and it is. A satisfying and convincing romance will follow the formula, but there is enough room for variation that you can make it your own. You can go with the minimum number of peaks and valleys, or you can go hog-wild and make your arc look like a roller coaster. It depends on what kind of romance you&amp;#39;re going for. Sweet and simple? Angsty and volatile? Something in the middle? You know what you want, I&amp;#39;m going to give you the tools to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A romance plot line has four distinct sections and I&amp;#39;ll go over each of them briefly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;(1) Getting to know each other&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where you introduce your characters to the reader, and to each other. It&amp;#39;s where you show that &amp;quot;hole-hearted&amp;quot; vision and the first hint that the other character is the answer to their problems. It&amp;#39;s also the first time one or both of your characters will grind their heels into the dirt and say &amp;quot;nu uh, no way, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is not the person for me.&amp;quot; This part is vital.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of this section, your plot thrust should have them stuck together like glue. It could be a forced proximity trope, or a marriage of convenience, or a quest to defeat the evil wizard. Whatever it may be, this is the point of no return for them and all the fun romancey stuff comes after it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;(2) Falling in love&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite part. It&amp;#39;s where the characters get to know each other on a deeper level. They&amp;#39;re still not quite over the &amp;quot;no way&amp;quot; and may reiterate it (or if one character didn&amp;#39;t have that thought before, now is the time). They&amp;#39;re still clinging to the comfort of their flaw and not quite ready to open up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, open up they do! Slowly, you have to incorporate mutual feelings of attraction. It may start out physical and move to emotional, or vice versa, depending on your characters. But this is a slow build. Think of romances you&amp;#39;ve read or seen in movies. There&amp;#39;s typically a moment where a character does something out of his/her &amp;quot;perceived&amp;quot; character. This is when the other person starts to think maybe there&amp;#39;s more to this person than what they originally thought. They show each other a different side of themselves and the door opens a little wider. With subsequent scenes, you keep chipping away at that wall they&amp;#39;ve built until the door is flung wide open. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of this section, you&amp;#39;ll be at the midpoint of your story/arc. This is typically when sex happens, or some other form of deep intimacy like revealing a secret or personal truth that they normally keep hidden. Everything is going good for the characters and they feel on top of the world with their newfound love. But, they don&amp;#39;t know what we know, and that&amp;#39;s that the next section is...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;(3) Falling out of love&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It couldn&amp;#39;t be that easy! Our characters still haven&amp;#39;t addressed their fundamental flaw, and they can&amp;#39;t get to whole-hearted without facing their demons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the part of the book where things start to fall apart. That flaw rears its ugly head in a way that makes the other person doubt what they were feeling. You have to keep piling on the doubt, and make sure it&amp;#39;s catered to your character&amp;#39;s specific flaw; ie if he&amp;#39;s convinced every woman is a cheater, you have to make it look like she&amp;#39;s two-timing him somehow. Really dig in hard on those insecurities and then pour some salt on the wound for good measure. The harder the journey to the end, the more satisfying it will be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These doubts grow on both sides of the equation until the unthinkable happens \u2014 the break-up. This is when the character gives into their flaw and chooses fear over love. You might know this as the black moment, or the dark night of the soul, or a million other things. Your character has hit rock bottom, and the worst part of it is? They &lt;strong&gt;did this to themselves&lt;/strong&gt;. That&amp;#39;s very important. It can&amp;#39;t be external forces making them separate. Maybe external forces exacerbated the flaws and doubts, but the direct cause of this black moment has to be a choice the character made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s important, because next is...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;(4) Making up&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point while your characters are wallowing in their own self-pity, something or someone comes along to snap them out of it. It could be a trusted friend or family member telling them to get their head out of their ass, or it could be realizing they were wrong about those doubts all along, or a million other things. It helps me to refer to this step as the &amp;quot;Wake up and smell the coffee, you idiot&amp;quot; phase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;ve really stepped in it, and winning back the heart of their love isn&amp;#39;t going to be easy. They&amp;#39;re going to need some kind of grand gesture. This is standing outside her window with a boombox, or confessing your love at a baseball game, or &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; but it&amp;#39;s generally much better if you can directly tie that back into the character&amp;#39;s flaw. Confessing your love in front of millions of people has a much bigger emotional impact if your character is terrified of public speaking than if he&amp;#39;s a stand-up comic used to seeing big crowds all the time. They have to show that they&amp;#39;re willing to overcome their flaw for the person they love and they have to show it in a &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, I generally add some declarations of love, an apology or two (normally both characters go through this arc, but not always simultaneously) and a kiss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You end the love arc by showing the characters being whole-hearted. That is, they&amp;#39;ve overcome their flaw, grown as a person, and have earned their happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Bonus:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not everyone interprets love in the same way. If you want to make sure your romance resonates with your audience, you&amp;#39;d do well to include each of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.kevinhalloran.net/what-are-the-five-love-languages-summary/\"&gt;Five Love Languages&lt;/a&gt;. This will ensure that every person, no matter how they express/receive love, will feel that these two people are truly meant for each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s it! That&amp;#39;s how I craft a convincing and believable romance.

The ending has to be that way -- because ultimately it&amp;#39;s a tragic ending for him; he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; get sorted out eventually and made a chaplain in the camp, but it&amp;#39;s still a tragedy for someone who was on course for a bishopric -- but if two characters want something, it&amp;#39;s hard not to give it to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;I used to be terrible at remembering to put romance in my stories, and&lt;/del&gt; Most of my characters were single and uninterested, f###-buddies, or happily married, but then I met my husband, and that became so much easier to write. I guess I don&amp;#39;t write pure romance, so in some regards it&amp;#39;s easier to have a romance plot that&amp;#39;s more like my own relationship, but this is all interesting information and if I do write a good romance then I&amp;#39;ll certainly use this advice. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg7i59o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492117176.0, "created_utc": 1492088376.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65570w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65570w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7pkwx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gingasaurusrexx", "parent_id": "t1_dg7jfgm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What you're referring to is often called the \"meet cute.\" And generally, it's the hardest part of the romance to get right.

It&amp;#39;s about the greatest possible tension. If two high school teachers meet and get together.. bleh. Who cares? Snore fest. A bartender and a customer meet up and hook up? Neat. What a boring endeavor. But a struggling alcoholic and a bartender? Or, as Ging says, a firefighter and an arsonist? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tension in a romance novel is as important as tension in anything else. The problem is, you don&amp;#39;t have evil wizards or exploding trains or anything like that to keep you involved. So where does the tension come from? The relationship. And like any good book, there needs to be a problem that can&amp;#39;t be solved until the end of the book or who the heck cares that you&amp;#39;re writing it. In a romance, the problem is love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s formulaic in the same way that most things are formulaic. Why do we have tropes like the &amp;quot;chosen one&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;old wise master who dies&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;best friend who tries to calm the chosen one down and amp up the tension&amp;quot; etc etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem I think you have with it (and I think this is perfectly fair) is that you&amp;#39;re not interested in the relationship as the cornerstone of the tension.

This is pretty much everything I *don't* want to see in a romance, either as a primary narrative, or a sub-plot. Let's dissect this. I'll be referencing one of the most iconic romantic couples in literature to help us along: Liz and Darcy from *Pride and Prejudice.*\n\n&gt;First, they need to have opposing goals and clashing personalities.\n\nNo. Never this. Never ever, ever this. Well, unless you're satirizing bad romance stories. Then do this. But, this is the most unrealistic thing you could possibly do in your romance. I know a lot of romance writers do it, and I think it's completely ridiculous. There's a reason every dating site uses \"compatibility\" algorithms instead of \"clashing\" algorithms. It's because people who like each other are compatible, and they don't clash. \n\nYour characters should have **complimentary** personalities. This doesn't mean they can't have disagreements or divergences of opinion; in fact, those things make the character dynamics more interesting. However, *at the fundamental level,* they should have more in common than uncommon. Clashing goals is also a bad idea. The characters should have overlapping or compatible goals. If two characters want the opposite thing, then they are more likely to destroy each other than fall in love. In short, a firefighter will not want to kiss an arsonist; a firefighter will want to see the arsonist behind bars. \n\nLiz and Darcy have neither opposing goals *nor* opposing personalities. Both of them are are respectable adults with a keen wit and cynical sense of humor. They both have a pragmatic set of values entailing what is best for their families and future. They are both well-read, and fall a tad on the unconventional side in terms of societal norms. They have many differences, but none in direct opposition to one another. Thus their relationship has a complex, yet believable, formula at its base.\n\n&gt; It's also the first time one or both of your characters will grind their heels into the dirt and say \"nu uh, no way, that is not the person for me.\" This part is vital.\n\nFirst, no, it's not vital. *Romeo and Juliet, Pretty Woman, Dune, Dragon Lance,* and even *Twilight* disregard the \"outright denial of affection\" trope, as I like to call it. They all have either a romantic plot or subplot that begins with, \"hey, I might actually like this person.\" \n\nNow, it's *possible* to pull of the Outright Denial of Affection, but it has to be done tactfully, or it will come across as absurd if the characters finally decide to hook up. Mild annoyance, initial avoidance, or even a subtle slight can serve to make the characters start off with a \"no way.\" For example, when Darcy left Liz unaccompanied at the first ball, it left a bad impression. *However,* this initial dislike can **not** be the result of a fundamental incompatibility between characters. Darcy did not single out Liz and go, \"Pff, no way, I'm not dancing with that chick.\" He was just shy. He wasn't dancing with *any* girls. So, this is an easily resolvable misunderstanding that served as a source of conversation for the characters to get to know one another better.\n\n&gt;By the end of this section, your plot thrust should have them stuck together like glue.\n\nNothing inherently wrong with this, but I would like to point out that *Pride and Prejudice* defies this as well. Liz has NO obligations to see Darcy again. In fact, nobody expects her to interact with Darcy. She is presented with other suitors, and is gradually distanced from Darcy over the course of the novel. However, for one reason or another, she keeps coming back to him. And this, in my opinion, is SO much more effective than forcing people together because when people actually like each other, they will go out of their way to be together. Staying connected in spite of circumstance is what makes a relationship truly memorable. \n\nNext, I would like to note that *Pride and Prejudice* inverts your falling out of love, and falling in love sections. Throughout the story, it is shown that Liz and Darcy have quite an amusing chemistry with each other, but they are prevented from fully falling in love by their titular flaws. Also, making up happens *before* Liz finally falls in love with Darcy. Darcy's show of humility in the final act and Liz coming to fully understand Darcy's motives and personality is the bridge that allows her to fall in love with him. \n\nSo, while I think there are some workable things in this formula, I think there are a few problems with it that need to be mitigated in order to make a convincing and believable romance. I also find that this formula is used so much, that it's become way too predictable. Even if you manage to write a believable romance, you need a LOT more substance to make it interesting. \n\nAnd, for the record, my all-time favorite couple is Tomoya and Nagisa from the anime *Clannad.* Needless to say, they throw this formula right out the window. *Clannad* holds the distinction of being the only work of fiction to make me cry. It must be doing something right. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have issues with quite a few aspects of this.

Mild annoyance, initial avoidance, or even a subtle slight can serve to make the characters start off with a &amp;quot;no way.&amp;quot; For example, when Darcy left Liz unaccompanied at the first ball, it left a bad impression. &lt;em&gt;However,&lt;/em&gt; this initial dislike can &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be the result of a fundamental incompatibility between characters. Darcy did not single out Liz and go, &amp;quot;Pff, no way, I&amp;#39;m not dancing with that chick.&amp;quot; He was just shy. He wasn&amp;#39;t dancing with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; girls. So, this is an easily resolvable misunderstanding that served as a source of conversation for the characters to get to know one another better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of this section, your plot thrust should have them stuck together like glue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing inherently wrong with this, but I would like to point out that &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; defies this as well. Liz has NO obligations to see Darcy again. In fact, nobody expects her to interact with Darcy. She is presented with other suitors, and is gradually distanced from Darcy over the course of the novel. However, for one reason or another, she keeps coming back to him. And this, in my opinion, is SO much more effective than forcing people together because when people actually like each other, they will go out of their way to be together. Staying connected in spite of circumstance is what makes a relationship truly memorable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, I would like to note that &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; inverts your falling out of love, and falling in love sections. Throughout the story, it is shown that Liz and Darcy have quite an amusing chemistry with each other, but they are prevented from fully falling in love by their titular flaws. Also, making up happens &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; Liz finally falls in love with Darcy. Darcy&amp;#39;s show of humility in the final act and Liz coming to fully understand Darcy&amp;#39;s motives and personality is the bridge that allows her to fall in love with him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, while I think there are some workable things in this formula, I think there are a few problems with it that need to be mitigated in order to make a convincing and believable romance. I also find that this formula is used so much, that it&amp;#39;s become way too predictable. Even if you manage to write a believable romance, you need a LOT more substance to make it interesting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, for the record, my all-time favorite couple is Tomoya and Nagisa from the anime &lt;em&gt;Clannad.&lt;/em&gt; Needless to say, they throw this formula right out the window. &lt;em&gt;Clannad&lt;/em&gt; holds the distinction of being the only work of fiction to make me cry. It must be doing something right. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg9pooc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492231005.0, "created_utc": 1492202205.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65570w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65570w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7n70z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MNBrian", "parent_id": "t1_dg7jawd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": ":D I'll let Ging thank you properly as well. :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;:D I&amp;#39;ll let Ging thank you properly as well. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg7n70z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123667.0, "created_utc": 1492094867.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65570w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7osrk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gingasaurusrexx", "parent_id": "t1_dg7jawd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My pleasure!
