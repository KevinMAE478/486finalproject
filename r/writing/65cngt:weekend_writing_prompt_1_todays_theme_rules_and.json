So today starts the first of my &amp;#39;Weekend Writing Prompt&amp;#39; thread. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One more quick rundown if you haven&amp;#39;t gotten a chance to see my earlier posts. This is a writing prompt to help interested reddit writers have a chance to write during the weekend for practice or enjoyment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every weekend will have a different theme about which to write; love, terror, addiction, pride etc.. I will pair up interested participants and you&amp;#39;ll each write one POV short through the eyes of one of two people having a life changing experience or interaction based on the theme. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a trial run, things could go wrong. We could have an uneven number of participants, people might not get along with who I partner them up with, their writing styles may conflict. Anything could happen but I&amp;#39;d like us all to keep an open mind about it and, of course, remember your reddiquite. If any of these things occur PM me and we will get it sorted out if possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, without further ado, let&amp;#39;s get started. This weekend&amp;#39;s Theme is something I think we have all experienced once or twice in our lives.....drum roll please.....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jealousy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Moral Indignation is jealousy with a halo&amp;quot; -H.G. Wells&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jealousy is something we&amp;#39;ve all experienced whether feeling it inside ourselves or being on the receiving end of someone else&amp;#39;s. It&amp;#39;s an emotion that can be hard to resist and it comes with plethora of other emotions, love, hate, admiration or even fear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about personal experiences you&amp;#39;ve had with jealousy and use them in writing your prompt. Ever been jealous of someone else&amp;#39;s love life? I know I have. What about their new game console or fancy new clothing? Me too. Use what you know and write something awesome! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve come up with a few rules to help us regulate the thread, partnerships and stories. They are as follows; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep the thread friendly and civil. I think this goes without saying but there are a lot of assholes out there. People are beginners here and some of them aren&amp;#39;t up to speed with others. I myself am in this category so make sure, especially when giving a critique, that you give good, constructive criticism and not just hate or insults.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In relation to #1, this is not a critique thread. I will not be expecting anyone to give or receive critiques. That is solely based on the duo who write the short. If they say go ahead, go ahead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don&amp;#39;t get along. A lot. So, if I pair you up with someone who doesn&amp;#39;t fit your writing style or who you think is just an asshat, PM me and we will work it out. I can try and find you a new partner or you&amp;#39;ll have to try again the next week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s keep the shorts to a max of 1,000 words per POV, 2,000 per partnership, no minimum required. This is a work in progress number we can change that up if need be next week whether it be too long or too short. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The shorts have to do with the theme&lt;/strong&gt;. I think this also goes without saying but I just want to make sure everyone is on the same page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a partnership thread meant to bring us all together while working on our writing. That being said, if you really want to try and write both pieces on your own then comment or PM me and we will see what we can do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All submissions to participate stop on Sunday at midnight. No late comers on Monday.

If you both decide you want to do a sci-fi or romance or historical fiction or whatever else &lt;strong&gt;still having to do with the theme&lt;/strong&gt; I encourage this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get in on the fun!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comment below or PM me if you wish.
