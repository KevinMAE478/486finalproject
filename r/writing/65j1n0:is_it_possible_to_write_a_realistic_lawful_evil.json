In these systems like in The Chronicles of Riddik (You keep what you kill), or Walking Dead, or even Game of Thrones, there is simply a power struggle and a resulting pecking order of the more brutal types of people because they survive. This is also happens with greed and money, hiring mercenaries, and a business like structure, this would be Mafia type structures, thieves guilds and gangs, where evil is illegal enterprise and the stuff that comes with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Religious beliefs can also hold sway over thousands of people with priesthood structures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evil always has a purpose.
