Lev Grossman&amp;#39;s books, and others like Rainbow Rowell&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Carry On&lt;/em&gt;, are successful because they embrace the Harry Potter comparison and provide meta commentary on the trope. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since you posted this, you probably have an idea - why not just write it and see where it takes you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dgbkrvt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492339850.0, "created_utc": 1492311050.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mvll", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mvll", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbscf5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hammuhshloggin88", "parent_id": "t1_dgbqk8d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Especially since Rothfuss doesn't blow off the issue of tuition with \"Your parents left you with gold, you lucky sonuvagun!\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially since Rothfuss doesn&amp;#39;t blow off the issue of tuition with &amp;quot;Your parents left you with gold, you lucky sonuvagun!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dgbscf5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492353562.0, "created_utc": 1492324762.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbqk8d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "60secs", "parent_id": "t3_65mvll", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Name of the Wind by Rothfuss does it amazingly well in a new direction.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name of the Wind by Rothfuss does it amazingly well in a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dgbqk8d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492349496.0, "created_utc": 1492320696.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mvll", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbshzw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "everwiser", "parent_id": "t3_65mvll", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You could have something like a military academy school of magic.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could have something like a military academy school of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dgbshzw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492353950.0, "created_utc": 1492325150.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mvll", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbxe76", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "istara", "parent_id": "t3_65mvll", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, since it wasn't even the first.
