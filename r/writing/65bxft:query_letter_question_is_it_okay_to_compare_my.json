You are, in fact, hindering yourself -- because if you don&amp;#39;t read in your genre then you have no idea what that genre&amp;#39;s expectations are and who is doing innovative work in the genre.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, the last thing I&amp;#39;ll say is this -- what you DO read is influencing your genre. So say you want to reinvent romance and all you read is high fantasy. Well, what you&amp;#39;re probably writing is a high fantasy book with a romance tilt. If you dislike a genre, that&amp;#39;s a good sign that you probably aren&amp;#39;t catering to its expectations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps! :) I totally get where you&amp;#39;re coming from, and the truth is whether you read in your genre or not, you need to query the book you wrote. Maybe you&amp;#39;ve made it harder on yourself by not reading in your genre. But who cares. You wrote the book you wanted to read and you need to query that book to see if anyone else would be interested in it. :D&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t go back and change the past. So instead, next time you write a book, I&amp;#39;d recommend helping yourself by reading in that genre. If you do, more power to you! If you don&amp;#39;t, I&amp;#39;d still tell you to query that next book, and the one after, and the one after. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg96brf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492207998.0, "created_utc": 1492179198.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg94tcd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rourensu", "parent_id": "t1_dg93io1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "(Not OP)\n\n&gt;you want to read your type of book just to know that you aren't falling into tropes.\n\nWhat should one do if there may not really be another \"your type of book\" and/or you're not interested in the \"closest\" books or even the genre?", "edited": 1492177360.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Not OP)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;you want to read your type of book just to know that you aren&amp;#39;t falling into tropes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should one do if there may not really be another &amp;quot;your type of book&amp;quot; and/or you&amp;#39;re not interested in the &amp;quot;closest&amp;quot; books or even the genre?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "writing", "name": "t1_dg94tcd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492205817.0, "created_utc": 1492177017.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg93io1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MNBrian", "parent_id": "t3_65bxft", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So a few things here.\n\n1) Crow and DP hit on the fact already that you want to read your type of book just to know that you aren't falling into tropes.\n\n2) A Mercy is a wonderful book, but as you rightfully point out, it's not in your genre and it's certainly more than 5 years old (I want to say it was written around 2000).
