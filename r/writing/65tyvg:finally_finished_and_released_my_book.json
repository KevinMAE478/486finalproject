Why not Bob and Sarah?\n\n - Why do I care to know Thal's name?  Why not just say \"the leader of ...\"?  Is his name supposed to mean something to me?  Is his only role to send these two guys out or is Thal going to do something else that you should be alluding to?\n\n - What cities are deserted?  The ones in the Alliance's home planet?

Now, if all you were referencing were the empty cities and the \"unknown fleet,\" then you don't need to say \"something more.\"  You already told us what that \"something\" is.\n\n - Why do I care about an \"unknown fleet\"?  Your book is titled \"First contact.\"  I kind of assume they're going to meet an unknown species.  The deserted cities is an intriguing hook, so let the audience piece together on their own that the deserted cities have something to do with the title of the book.  Make the reader feel smart when he figures this stuff out on his own ... or at least that he could have been smart because you left enough clues without giving it all away.  Obviously there's a lot more to your story than just the existence of this new fleet/species, but if there's something interesting about that fleet/species, tell us that interesting thing or nothing at all ... just telling us they exist doesn't do much.\n\nIf you're not going to give enough context, don't mention the details, including names.\n\nNow, as I hate giving a critique without offering a solution, here's a way that might help:\n\n*The age of peace is over.  No scout has returned from investigating the communications blackout at the edge of the galaxy.  Desperate for answers, the Alliance [of ...?] pleads for the Orlion Academy to get results.*\n\n*Two of their brightest cadets, Mutieto and Blade, are sent to investigate and find a missing Alliance operative: Yulara, who has actually been to the edge and back.  Upon arrival, when they find every city deserted, their curiosity leads to concern - both for their lives and the fate of the alliance.*\n\nIt's not perfect, but it's concise and hopefully may lead prospective readers to be curious about your book instead of confused by random bits of information without context :p", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have some nice hooks, but it would probably help sales to condense and intensify your blurb on Amizon.
