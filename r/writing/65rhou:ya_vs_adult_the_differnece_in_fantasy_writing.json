Protagonist MUST be between about 14-17. Younger is usually middle grade. Older is new adult.\n\n2. Extremely voicey. Most are in first person -- not necessarily a rule, but a trend. But the narrator's voice should be apparent within the first paragraph. No \"just get through the first chapter and you will start to hear it\". You should \"hear\" the narrator within the first few sentences.\n\n3. Plot-driven. This is not an exploration of the inner world where nothing happens but everything happens. You need a good, old-fashioned complicating incident, rising action, climax, the works.\n\n4. Interpersonal sub-plots usually deal with coming-of-age themes, although they can be pretty original. You can write about teen pregnancy, discovering identity, navigating puberty, chasing a dream. You can include romance or not. But teens should see their own struggles somewhere on the pages. Don't be preachy. Just tell a story they will resonate with. (I don't think I've read a fantasy book that deals with teen pregnancy, btw. That could be an interesting take, since contemporary YA is the current trend and teens are gobbling up stories where the narrator's life is in flames.)\n\n5. As for graphic descriptions, here's the quick and dirty: kisses can be descriptive and a little graphic. Anything past kissing should be implied, or fade-to-black. Unfortunately, LGBTQ kissing is considered more risque. I would de-sexualize any LGBTQ romantic subplots as much as possible (make the kiss more romantic than sexual).
