I&amp;#39;m going to paraphrase a bit here to shorten it up, but I should get to all of Williams questions. He asks -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hey Brian,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got some questions and I hope you can help me out. A lot of these are logistical things, but I&amp;#39;m hoping you can help. Many of my questions have to do with the business side - these interest me because I&amp;#39;m a buyer with a large wholesale company in the _________ industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(1) What&amp;#39;s the expected timeline from writing to publication? (2) I get that the actual writing/editing/polishing/etc process varies from writer to writer, but what&amp;#39;s the sweet spot to start pitching? I&amp;#39;ve heard of people pitching while they&amp;#39;re mid-write and signing, (3) getting part of an advance up front and the other part on completion. However, I&amp;#39;ve only ever seen a pitch guideline specify completed manuscripts. (4) From pitch to signing what happens? An agent gives the manuscript to an editor? Shops it around to publishers? (5) If I have contacts at publication houses do I need an agent? I would imagine so since I&amp;#39;m not published.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(6) Does an agent take a part of my profits, or does the publisher pay them a separate portion? For example; I sign for a print run at 10% MSRP. Does the agent get a percent of my 10%, or is it a percent of the MSRP? (7) And at what point do I talk to the publisher about the print run. I understand most print runs are (typically) 5000 units, but I&amp;#39;m 90% positive that I could confidently sell 20,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(8) My final question for the moment is about social media. I understand that agents look for established social media accounts. I have a very active Twitter and Instagram, and am looking into making an &amp;#39;authors&amp;#39; Facebook. Many of the things I see recommend making a &amp;quot;Page&amp;quot;. But the practice I&amp;#39;ve seen is for authors to have actual alternate Facebook accounts. Can you provide any traceable data one way or the other?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you so, so much for your time and for the services you&amp;#39;ve provided... I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So because William asked so many great questions, I&amp;#39;m just going to hit each one in quick succession with as much or as little detail as I feel is relevant! Hopefully this will help others with similar questions! Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;(1) What&amp;#39;s the expected timeline from writing to publication?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A traditionally published author will likely complete about 1 book per year. That&amp;#39;s from conception of the initial idea to the final version of the book (or at least the final version before it gets pitched to an editor). Some traditionally published authors are able to produce more. Some less. It really depends on the income earned off the books published and the specific financial position of the author, no doubt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;(2) Pitching While Mid-Writing. Good Idea? Bad Idea?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad idea. Very bad idea. Here&amp;#39;s why. Yes, sometimes it takes a while for an agent to get back to you. Yes, sometimes that while can be frustrating on the writers side. But sometimes... once in a while... you hear back RIGHT away. And if you&amp;#39;re only 50% done with your book and you just heard back? You&amp;#39;re in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, there are two caveats here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) If you are writing Non-Fiction, the process is different. You generally pitch NF before finishing the book. Often agents take a slightly more editorial role in these books to help cater to the editors they are considering pitching and to the market as they see it. When you research pitching NF, you&amp;#39;ll notice the normal procedure is producing something called a &amp;quot;book proposal&amp;quot; which is a query letter, a table of contents (showing the content you expect to cover) and a few sample chapters (sometimes one, and other times two or three chapters). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) If you&amp;#39;ve previously traditionally published (say you had an agent and you severed the relationship, and you&amp;#39;re looking for a new agent), or if you have an enormous platform (like a celebrity), you may... just maybe... be able to pitch a book on spec (aka - without completing it first). In the case of being previously traditionally published, you would likely be seen as a known commodity who has an established history of meeting deadlines, and thus an accurate understanding of how long it takes to produce a publishable work. In the case of a celebrity or someone with a massive platform, it simply comes down to the fact that your massive audience makes a strong argument for an agent scooping you up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;(3) Advances And How They Work (Likely)&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So advances vary widely based on your contract. But generally it works like this - &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually you are offered part of an advance up front, and then usually part either upon delivery of the final product (after editorial notes have been satisfied at the purchasing publishing house) or perhaps on release date (when your book hits shelves). Again, this varies depending, but when you see individuals get an advance against their royalties with some &amp;quot;on signing&amp;quot; and some at some later time, it&amp;#39;s done because crazy stuff happens in publishing. Good old contracts and thinking of worst-case scenarios - like if somehow the publisher ceases to be a business. Or if the writer fails to deliver the final novel. Or any number of other absolutely unlikely and crazy things that do happen from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, for those who don&amp;#39;t follow advances, here&amp;#39;s the simple version. Publishers are assuming a financial risk by signing an author for a particular book. Part of that financial risk is that the book will sell lots of copies. Based on how well they think this book might do, often publishers will pay the author an advance against future royalties. So, to make up random numbers, they might pay you $10,000 as an advance. But you still sort of pay it back. Because you don&amp;#39;t earn royalties until you &amp;quot;earn out&amp;quot; on your advance -- that is, until you earn $10,000 in profits. Different contracts could be structured in different ways, but in most cases you don&amp;#39;t technically owe this money to the publisher. It isn&amp;#39;t a loan. If you only earn $5,000 on your book, then it&amp;#39;s not like you owe the publisher. But you might have trouble convincing them to sell your next book, or explaining away how your first book didn&amp;#39;t do so well to your next publisher (because they will care about your previous books&amp;#39; sales numbers).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;(4) From When I Pitch To Publication, What Happens?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if tomorrow Agent Awesome picks you up, what happens? First thing&amp;#39;s first, editing. Most agents will have a few ideas on how to clean up your book or fill in some plot holes. Sometimes these ideas are pretty big. Sometimes, not so much. (Side note: It&amp;#39;s important to have this conversation when you get a call from an agent and they offer you representation. It is definitely something you want to know &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; you sign with an agent). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this, your agent will select a list of acquiring editors at different publishing houses (based on your own conversations about goals -- aka big houses or small houses or what you think is best as a strategy together). This process is called &amp;quot;going on submission&amp;quot; and it&amp;#39;s really a repeat of the querying process only it&amp;#39;s your agent who is querying editors to sell a book. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And from there, hopefully you get a contract from a publisher. After signing (and hopefully getting a nice advance) you are in what is known as the &amp;quot;pipeline&amp;quot; where magic fairy dust stuff happens. They work out your cover and you do another round (or more) of edits. And they work on your marketing/promotional plan. And a bunch of other magic stuff. I may just need a publicist at a big-5 to give us some insight on this part of the process at some point soon. :D&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;(5) I Know People In Publishing... What&amp;#39;s An Agent Gonna Do?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a slightly loaded question. You see, getting an editor to like your book when you dont&amp;#39; have an agent has a few results. For one, you&amp;#39;ll need to pay a lawyer to look over the contract, and they won&amp;#39;t be as well versed as an agent (because an agent looked at contracts for book sales of various sizes last week and most lawyers don&amp;#39;t turn around agent-quantities of publishing contracts -- although no doubt there are exceptions). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, you need to consider the future. Sure, if you luck into a contact who helps you now... what are you going to do if they don&amp;#39;t like your next book? Back to square one? Agents spend their careers building relationships with large quantities of editors so that they can build a writer career into a long lasting thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I suppose what I&amp;#39;m saying is this - If you just want to sell one book and you&amp;#39;ve always dreamed of being published by XYZ publisher and you happen to know an acquiring editor in XYZ and they happen to love your book... sure - go for it. But if you&amp;#39;re hoping to sell one book and then sell another and another? I&amp;#39;d recommend an agent as a best path forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;(6) How Do Agents Earn Profits&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Legitimate agents only get paid when you get paid. They take a percentage of what you earn. So based on your example, you sign for a print run at 10% MSRP for soft cover and 12% MSRP for hard cover, your agent will earn a flat percentage on your earnings, not MSRP -- taking into account the fact that you need to earn out on your advance (as described above). So to make numbers easy because I&amp;#39;m math-stupid - if your agent takes %10 and you earn %10 on MSRP of every soft cover sale and you&amp;#39;ve already earned out your advance, your agent is essentially earning 1% of MSRP and you&amp;#39;re earning the other 9%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;(7) When To Talk Numbers With Publishers&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh jeez, for talking about print runs, I&amp;#39;m honestly not even sure. Honestly, I&amp;#39;m sure the publisher, being that they are bearing the financial burden, will make these types of decisions without your say. Theoretically, if you sell a lot of books, they&amp;#39;ll put more money into your print run so you can sell a lot more books. Essentially whatever projects are working are likely the ones to get a larger percentage of the advertising budget. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;(8) Let&amp;#39;s Talk About Social Media (Facebook)&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, I&amp;#39;m gonna give you the short version here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Social media options change so much that whatever you do, you&amp;#39;d better love it. Facebook is a viable option. Lots of self pubbers use it in both ways you described above. But it really doesn&amp;#39;t work when using Facebook is a labor for the author and they don&amp;#39;t do it as much as they should. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, Facebook has changed their algorithms and how things show up in news feeds multiple times in favor of making &amp;quot;pages&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;brands&amp;quot; pay more money to reach their audience. There was a time when every post on a &amp;quot;page&amp;quot; showed up in every user who followed that page&amp;#39;s feed. It&amp;#39;s one of the reasons twitter is still so widely used by authors. Sure, it&amp;#39;s annoying that tweets disappear out of a feed almost immediately after being posted for those following 20000 people, but the fact is at least every post is showing up (at the moment). On facebook pages, only a small percentage of the followers you&amp;#39;ve earned are actually seeing your posts. People were pretty pissed about this. A lot of brands stopped paying much attention to Facebook when this happened. I personally was pissed. And we&amp;#39;re seeing a newfound buzz about brands having their own webpages now (surprise, surprise) where anyone who goes there can see your content. In the same breath, e-mail lists are making a comeback as well for the same reasons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But again, if you make a twitter account, or a personal website, or a blog or an email list, and you never use it? It&amp;#39;s gonna be worthless. It&amp;#39;s why I like reddit. Maybe reddit isn&amp;#39;t the best way for me to help authors, but I like it. It works for me. I know how it works and I know how to make posts and it seems to be working. So I&amp;#39;ll keep doing so long as I seem to understand it well enough to be effective. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all for today. On Thursday we&amp;#39;ve got (most likely) a post from our very own &lt;a href=\"/u/Gingasaurusrexx\"&gt;/u/Gingasaurusrexx&lt;/a&gt;! :) So get ready! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi Everyone!\n\nFor those who don't know me, my name is Brian and I work for a literary agent.

Hopefully this will help others with similar questions! Here we go!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##(1) What's the expected timeline from writing to publication? \n\nA traditionally published author will likely complete about 1 book per year.

In the case of being previously traditionally published, you would likely be seen as a known commodity who has an established history of meeting deadlines, and thus an accurate understanding of how long it takes to produce a publishable work. In the case of a celebrity or someone with a massive platform, it simply comes down to the fact that your massive audience makes a strong argument for an agent scooping you up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##(3) Advances And How They Work (Likely)\n\nSo advances vary widely based on your contract. But generally it works like this - \n\nUsually you are offered part of an advance up front, and then usually part either upon delivery of the final product (after editorial notes have been satisfied at the purchasing publishing house) or perhaps on release date (when your book hits shelves). Again, this varies depending, but when you see individuals get an advance against their royalties with some \"on signing\" and some at some later time, it's done because crazy stuff happens in publishing.

Agents spend their careers building relationships with large quantities of editors so that they can build a writer career into a long lasting thing.\n\nSo I suppose what I'm saying is this - If you just want to sell one book and you've always dreamed of being published by XYZ publisher and you happen to know an acquiring editor in XYZ and they happen to love your book... sure - go for it. But if you're hoping to sell one book and then sell another and another? I'd recommend an agent as a best path forward.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##(6) How Do Agents Earn Profits\n\nLegitimate agents only get paid when you get paid. They take a percentage of what you earn. So based on your example, you sign for a print run at 10% MSRP for soft cover and 12% MSRP for hard cover, your agent will earn a flat percentage on your earnings, not MSRP -- taking into account the fact that you need to earn out on your advance (as described above). So to make numbers easy because I'm math-stupid - if your agent takes %10 and you earn %10 on MSRP of every soft cover sale and you've already earned out your advance, your agent is essentially earning 1% of MSRP and you're earning the other 9%.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##(7) When To Talk Numbers With Publishers\n\nOh jeez, for talking about print runs, I'm honestly not even sure. Honestly, I'm sure the publisher, being that they are bearing the financial burden, will make these types of decisions without your say. Theoretically, if you sell a lot of books, they'll put more money into your print run so you can sell a lot more books. Essentially whatever projects are working are likely the ones to get a larger percentage of the advertising budget. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##(8) Let's Talk About Social Media (Facebook)\n\nOk, I'm gonna give you the short version here.\n\nSocial media options change so much that whatever you do, you'd better love it. Facebook is a viable option. Lots of self pubbers use it in both ways you described above. But it really doesn't work when using Facebook is a labor for the author and they don't do it as much as they should. \n\nPersonally, Facebook has changed their algorithms and how things show up in news feeds multiple times in favor of making \"pages\" and \"brands\" pay more money to reach their audience. There was a time when every post on a \"page\" showed up in every user who followed that page's feed. It's one of the reasons twitter is still so widely used by authors. Sure, it's annoying that tweets disappear out of a feed almost immediately after being posted for those following 20000 people, but the fact is at least every post is showing up (at the moment). On facebook pages, only a small percentage of the followers you've earned are actually seeing your posts. People were pretty pissed about this. A lot of brands stopped paying much attention to Facebook when this happened. I personally was pissed. And we're seeing a newfound buzz about brands having their own webpages now (surprise, surprise) where anyone who goes there can see your content. In the same breath, e-mail lists are making a comeback as well for the same reasons. \n\nBut again, if you make a twitter account, or a personal website, or a blog or an email list, and you never use it? It's gonna be worthless. It's why I like reddit. Maybe reddit isn't the best way for me to help authors, but I like it. It works for me. I know how it works and I know how to make posts and it seems to be working. So I'll keep doing so long as I seem to understand it well enough to be effective. :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat's all for today.
