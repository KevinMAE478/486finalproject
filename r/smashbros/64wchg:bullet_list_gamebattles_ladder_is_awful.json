Nearly every page has poor CSS and planning, but while it's bearable, things only get worse.\n&gt;&gt;Profile creation is unnecessarily painful. While registering you need to give a copious amount of information through a frankly idiotic process. For example, you will need to select a timezone yet be presented with literally 200 different options via a form. No simple \"EST\" or \"CET.\"\n\nThe best way to experience GameBattles at the moment is through the GameBattles App which will hopefully solve a number of the layout issues with the web view.\n\niOS - https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/gamebattles/id999434025?mt=8\nAndroid - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mlg.gb.standard&amp;hl=en_GB\n\n&gt;&gt;I don't know exactly how the ladder calculates your standing, but wins and losses are obviously weighted badly: https://imgur.com/a/9I4rQ\n\nLadder Ranking is based on ELO. You gain or lose Ladder XP based upon the rank of your opponent on the Smash Arena. To start with, this may not be accurate (As is always the case when ELO starts out) but will become more and more accurate as time goes on. \n\n&gt;&gt;Looking to play a set? Have fun. Hideous design. You can't tell who you're challenging. Rather than rank, they show you your opponents \"level\" (unnecessary and contrived concept). Hovering over details gives you brutally obvious information already available 5 cm to the right. To accept the match you must click accept which takes you to another page where you need to check an agreement box and click accept again.\n\nThe Match Finder is designed to make it difficult to find an exact opponent. This is to prevent teams from targeting lower ranked users for \"Easy wins\". There are however enough details shown that it is generally possible to play against a specific user if you are in contact with each other to set up a match.\n\n&gt;&gt;Apparently your \"gamertag\" needs to be your NNID. Not your actual tag. You could also put your NNID in something called a \"teamblast\" but your opponent does not have ready access to this so it's more convinient to write it as your gamertag. Unless of course you already made your gamertag. No problem, just chat with them and clear up what going on, right? Gamebattles does not feature chats for sets. The only way to contact someone is to send a message similar to an email, which is very tedious to use. Chats are a basic feature and not having them is beyond retarded.\n\nThe Gamertag Settings may be slightly outdated from today's settings. I'll look into that and have it updated. Currently I only have Smash on the 3DS so if you have any suggestions please send them my way!\n\n&gt;&gt;Gamebattles' ruleset is utterly fucked. Stages are chosen randomly, counterpicking via characters and stages does not exist.\n\nWe do not currently have functionality for a stage veto/counter picking system on ladders however any tournaments ran will utilise the current competitive system.\n\n&gt;&gt;Reporting scores lmfao. Type in scores for each individual match (stock counts?) then an overall score for the set. It's supposed to be a Bo3 but has 3 games listed as default? Incredibly easy to enter something as different from your opponent, but once you submit it the match goes into dispute and you cannot simply correct it by altering something. You have to wait for a moderator (I think? Never got that far. Anyway, I doubt one will be readily available).\n\nThe scores for individual maps is entirely optional and is not required to be input (This is from the old Halo days where having the individual kill counts was nice to have). The only thing required is the number of maps won/lost.\n\n&gt;&gt;Wtf is this jargon they're using? Repeatedly saying \"mapsets\" and shit about certain teams (1 player teams LOL) hosting: https://imgur.com/a/pFNXn. Whoever designed the ladder is not Sm4sh competent and doesn't know terminology. They could have simply contacted like... anyone to help do this (any TO, any moderately competitive player, even any melee/brawl/pm player ffs), but were too lazy.\n\nI apologise if the way the rules are written is confusing. Please let me know which parts need to be switched out and I will do so.\n\n&gt;&gt;No timer on matches. No way to checkin. No simple between-game reporting. You don't know if they're going to accept your friend request or who's going to put a room up. You don't even know if you sent a friend request to the right guy. When you try to use the message system to fix these problems that shouldn't exist, prepare for a headache.\n\nAt this time we do not have a real-time messaging system (Chat) for matches other than Private Messages. We do, however, use Discord for our other ladders. If this is something that would be beneficial then we can get it set up for the Smash arena.\n\nI'm not certain what you are referring to on the Timer on matches sorry!\n\n&gt;&gt;Edit: Another thing. I've heard of more than one occasion where someone \"lost\" a set they didn't play. Yes, the opponent was able to report the scores and - without any confirmation or moderation - take the W.\n\nMatches are reported within 3 hours if only one team reports the match. This is to ensure matches do not sit in limbo because an opponent did not report that they lost. We can revert matches that have been incorrectly reported due to this, so long as proof is provided showing the correct result.\n\nWe are always looking for feedback on how to improve our ladders.
