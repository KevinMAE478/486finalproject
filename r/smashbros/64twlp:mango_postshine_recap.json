So I&amp;#39;m biased. pretty bad even. Remember that. Not even the stuff above is bias free. &lt;em&gt;Yeah, it&amp;#39;s data, it&amp;#39;s objective, but it&amp;#39;s presented with a slant because it aint right to tear apart players the way we do. In my head at least. If you only focus on a person&amp;#39;s failure, then that person is a bunch of failures.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Not even Armada is immune. Evo. Second place hero.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I&amp;#39;ll start with my conclusion, Mang0 isn&amp;#39;t all washed up. He doesn&amp;#39;t have to live on smash mountain with PPMD, quit drinking on stream, or transform into a Mang0-Tafo hybrid. Personally, I see a pattern in his upsets. /u uhhhhmmmm summed it up in the recent Axe match like this: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;shine -&amp;gt; dair -&amp;gt; shine -&amp;gt; fsmash -&amp;gt; shine -&amp;gt; dair -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;get gimped during aggression&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; repeat&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting gimped was the running theme of at least 7 of the upsets.&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I&amp;#39;d even include the Mikehaze, Drunksloth and Kels losses. Let&amp;#39;s get more specific:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mang0 fights -&amp;gt; he wins -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;gets gimped&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;doubles down on aggression&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;gets gimped more&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;spirit shatters&lt;/strong&gt; + visions of mother crying and disappointed fans -&amp;gt; dead(beat) mango&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The weird thing is, I know Mang0 can play around gimps. If he couldn&amp;#39;t, he&amp;#39;d never beat Armada, m2k or hbox. Just watch his analyses against m2k, you know it&amp;#39;s something he thinks about. Here&amp;#39;s something I noticed about Mang0, &lt;strong&gt;he&amp;#39;s no spiderman&lt;/strong&gt;. Logically, he may know he&amp;#39;s in a bad spot, but he certainly doesn&amp;#39;t play that scared unless he has experience. And honestly, that&amp;#39;s fine, you don&amp;#39;t have to be scared, you have to be aware. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, against players like Axe or Chu, &lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think Mang0 respects how risky certain engages are.&lt;/strong&gt; He&amp;#39;s got no spidey-sense. Sure, it&amp;#39;s hard to gimp Mang0 when you&amp;#39;re fishing for gimps, but Axe, Chu and the rest didn&amp;#39;t really fish for gimps did they? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the pattern I saw in Mango&amp;#39;s losses. &lt;strong&gt;When he plays against neutral-focused players with strong punish games, Mang0 oversteps, gets gimped and tilts.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Player recap - my take on the matches/players&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me try to convince you by talking about the players some:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Axe:&lt;/strong&gt; Personally, I&amp;#39;d say &lt;strong&gt;Axe likes tagging people with a ton of smaller aerials.&lt;/strong&gt; While he is feared for his gimps, I wouldn&amp;#39;t say he hunts for them often outside FD. &lt;strong&gt;Axe&amp;#39;s gimps can be surprising since they happen more during scrambles&lt;/strong&gt; and usually involve a lightning fast reaction on Axe&amp;#39;s part. In his matches against Mango, his gimps were huge for set momentum. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chu:&lt;/strong&gt; I wouldn&amp;#39;t call Chu a premier wobbler, but Chu is still freaking scary. The Chu special involves standing still then calling out movement with an aerial. Pretty strange. His wobbles management to surprise and bamboozle even top players b/c a lot of the times there wasn&amp;#39;t any crazy set up. &lt;strong&gt;He plays a neutral and somehow finds grabs in neutral.&lt;/strong&gt; He&amp;#39;s not afraid to slow down the game to extend neutral either. His patience and playstyle tilted Mango hard in their matches. Mango also tilted himself in those matches. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nintendude:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t remember this set too well, but I know Nintendude has stated that he doesn&amp;#39;t fish for wobbles. Instead, &lt;strong&gt;he tries to play a solid neutral and takes wobbles when they&amp;#39;re presented.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drunksloth:&lt;/strong&gt; Drunksloth was also a different dial of icees. His fearless play was a blast to watch when he played m2k and I think the moon. Mango played full aggro from start to finish. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sfat:&lt;/strong&gt; Sfat plays neutral in a fairly risk-averse, methodical manner. However you&amp;#39;d characterize it, Sfat is very particular in the way he plays neutral. If I remember right, shine spikes were huge in his victory against mango. The gimps were pretty spontaneous. Still, mang0 typically respects foxes and marths more so they generally have to work hard for their kills. Mang0 may have gotten straight outplayed, I can&amp;#39;t remember.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MikeHaze:&lt;/strong&gt; Mike was looking sharp and mango was looking shook. I&amp;#39;m inclined to think Mango got outplayed here since it was against a fox who he&amp;#39;s generally careful of. Props to MikeHaze. Personally, I remember Mango playing weird until he hit m2k. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kels:&lt;/strong&gt; Gj kels. Mango played full aggro from start to finish. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that&amp;#39;s the narrative I&amp;#39;m building. &lt;strong&gt;Mango gets upset by patient, explosive neutral-oriented players and gets gimped into the shadow realm/the unemployment office.&lt;/strong&gt; He also gets upset by mikehaze and kels? They were pretty explosive those sets though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, Mango&amp;#39;s MikeHaze, Sfat, and Kels losses are the most worrisome. They represent losses to a character he normally respects. Mango mentioned that he can laser camp Joey out of respect. In general, Mango&amp;#39;s mentality versus Fox and Marth is a whole lot stronger and more adaptable. That&amp;#39;s my main argument for weighing these losses more. I&amp;#39;m not panicking about the other losses yet because Mango&amp;#39;s has proven himself against harder top players. I&amp;#39;m saying this downswing seems more than manageable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mango&amp;#39;s still strong man. You guys miss the old mango, but he&amp;#39;s the new mango playing against the new axe, nuchu, awakenedbox and droidmada. Everyone&amp;#39;s stronger. Old mango would get fucked. But I get what you&amp;#39;re saying, maybe a different Mango could keep up. Maybe a new mango could win. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey all,  \n\nI usually lurk, but with all these spicy Mango memes flying around I want to take a closer look at mister man-[kid](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kid). \n\nLet's start with a recap of big tournaments since Shine (August 2016).

The Chu special involves standing still then calling out movement with an aerial. Pretty strange. His wobbles management to surprise and bamboozle even top players b/c a lot of the times there wasn't any crazy set up. **He plays a neutral and somehow finds grabs in neutral.** He's not afraid to slow down the game to extend neutral either. His patience and playstyle tilted Mango hard in their matches. Mango also tilted himself in those matches. \n- **Nintendude:** I don't remember this set too well, but I know Nintendude has stated that he doesn't fish for wobbles. Instead, **he tries to play a solid neutral and takes wobbles when they're presented.** \n- **Drunksloth:** Drunksloth was also a different dial of icees. His fearless play was a blast to watch when he played m2k and I think the moon. Mango played full aggro from start to finish. \n- **Sfat:** Sfat plays neutral in a fairly risk-averse, methodical manner. However you'd characterize it, Sfat is very particular in the way he plays neutral. If I remember right, shine spikes were huge in his victory against mango. The gimps were pretty spontaneous. Still, mang0 typically respects foxes and marths more so they generally have to work hard for their kills. Mang0 may have gotten straight outplayed, I can't remember.\n- **MikeHaze:** Mike was looking sharp and mango was looking shook. I'm inclined to think Mango got outplayed here since it was against a fox who he's generally careful of. Props to MikeHaze. Personally, I remember Mango playing weird until he hit m2k. \n- **Kels:** Gj kels. Mango played full aggro from start to finish. \n\nSo yeah, that's the narrative I'm building. **Mango gets upset by patient, explosive neutral-oriented players and gets gimped into the shadow realm/the unemployment office.** He also gets upset by mikehaze and kels? They were pretty explosive those sets though. \n\n***\n#Conclusion\n***\n\nTo me, Mango's MikeHaze, Sfat, and Kels losses are the most worrisome. They represent losses to a character he normally respects. Mango mentioned that he can laser camp Joey out of respect. In general, Mango's mentality versus Fox and Marth is a whole lot stronger and more adaptable. That's my main argument for weighing these losses more. I'm not panicking about the other losses yet because Mango's has proven himself against harder top players. I'm saying this downswing seems more than manageable.\n\nMango's still strong man. You guys miss the old mango, but he's the new mango playing against the new axe, nuchu, awakenedbox and droidmada. Everyone's stronger. Old mango would get fucked. But I get what you're saying, maybe a different Mango could keep up. Maybe a new mango could win. \n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Melee", "id": "64twlp", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 222, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ToastieRepublic", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64twlp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.smashbros", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cz93mEeXi0Smr51S4qXqy2DP4Y-XyAS2pqidVIzvvNs.jpg?s=5a2540cd668fa27c1f45723a9309b169", "width": 245, "height": 245}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cz93mEeXi0Smr51S4qXqy2DP4Y-XyAS2pqidVIzvvNs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=c01d02d21c7d2ff9f1f7dd32ce27f6d5", "width": 108, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cz93mEeXi0Smr51S4qXqy2DP4Y-XyAS2pqidVIzvvNs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=51eb9753cedd1718ae63e863d8a48527", "width": 216, "height": 216}], "variants": {}, "id": "fcxhRjaaMFnccJ6-snulADVmi3IxQM521V-sS7LVmPI"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "edited": 1492029824.0, "link_flair_css_class": "melee", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/smashbros/comments/64twlp/mango_postshine_recap/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491975338.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/64twlp/mango_postshine_recap/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Mango Post-Shine Recap", "created_utc": 1491946538.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 81, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 222}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64twlp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64twlp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg55gwy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ToastieRepublic", "parent_id": "t1_dg4zmo9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh cool, yeah respecting other character's options is a good way of thinking about it.

They both count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He can practice with the guys he lost to&lt;/strong&gt; - It&amp;#39;ll help him develop a spidey sense. This approach worked great for wizzy. It has also helped him against S2J and Lucky countless times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He can prepare for matches&lt;/strong&gt; - ppmd does his hw. mango can do his. Realistically, I think minor stuff like: &amp;quot;respect Leff on ledge&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t get mew2grabbed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Jason&amp;#39;s a weiner on ledge&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t chase with doublejump vs axe&amp;quot; will make all the difference. Mango doesn&amp;#39;t need 10 pages of notes. Simple advice seems to work great for him a la duck. If you can&amp;#39;t think mid-match that&amp;#39;s fine, think before the match or in between matches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop that spidey sense&lt;/strong&gt; - practice against other players like Axe and chu. get into the habit of respecting those characters when they&amp;#39;re as scary as fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like Mango&amp;#39;s sliding downwards too quickly. Adjusting to the new age seems pretty doable. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg4yvx0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491975483.0, "created_utc": 1491946683.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64twlp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64twlp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5bqle", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ToastieRepublic", "parent_id": "t1_dg59jri", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "lol oops", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;lol oops&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg5bqle", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491992303.0, "created_utc": 1491963503.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg59jri", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "itotopping", "parent_id": "t3_64twlp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It took me a little bit to realize none was not n0ne. \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took me a little bit to realize none was not n0ne. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg59jri", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491989383.0, "created_utc": 1491960583.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64twlp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg51vgr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "uhhhhmmmm", "parent_id": "t3_64twlp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Lol weird to see my username in here randomly.\n\nImo he's had 2 really bad tournies.
