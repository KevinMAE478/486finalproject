And I think being harassed is super shitty. I also think calling out an entire region for sexism when there were probably a majority of the region that didn&amp;#39;t hear about it until afterwards is stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want this to get into an argument about what is reasonable to know about every member&amp;#39;s interaction with everyone else so I&amp;#39;ll say this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing harassment and doing nothing is awful. Hearing that someone got harassed after an event sucks. You can tell your region to not do that, but will it truly stop? And what is a smasher supposed to do after it happened? Other than do their best to not harass women and not be a bystander, they can&amp;#39;t see it happen all the time. There&amp;#39;s a point where people are going to be pieces of shit that are hard to keep track of. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I don&amp;#39;t want the reputation of the community to be that of sexist nerds who can&amp;#39;t control themselves around women. And I worry that we get that reputation too much. I fully support initiatives to get women more accepted,  and to teach TOs to not let it go unnoticed.
