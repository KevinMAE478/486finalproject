[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "smashbros", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very long time ago I posted &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/3chh2r/art_super_smash_bros_melee_rpg_playable/\"&gt;a gameplay concept for an RPG of Super Smash Bros Melee here&lt;/a&gt; and people seemed to like it, so I thought I&amp;#39;d give a shot at \nmaking it an actual game...after I made a decent demo to see what people think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/file/4mtax94mdz0sca7/Super+Smash+Bros+RPG+v1.zip\"&gt;Okay maybe you dont want to read about the game, you just want to play it. Thats cool, click here to go download it now if you want. Just know that some \nproblems/stuff/tips in the demo I address below.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So first off I&amp;#39;d like to say that while I did put demo in the title (and it is kinda a demo), I would hope to be able to use this more as a beta to gain feedback on what you guys think needs to be fixed, improved, or added. I&amp;#39;m more an art guy so I&amp;#39;m more capable of doing the art of the game (which I know that at the moment it isnt the best) than the programming for it. I&amp;#39;m honestly almost kinda winging it on making the game work; I know how to do a lot of basic stuff (only by using this one program) but anything more in coding and stuff is beyond me. So I just wanted to mention that I&amp;#39;m aware that some things in the demo might not look good and there&amp;#39;s a few things that dont work/are kinda iffy, so keep that in mind when you play (and maybe leave feedback).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re wondering what&amp;#39;s wrong here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;its noticable where the background tiles connect (gradient)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;fox&amp;#39;s side b (illusion) doesnt work when in open world (shine is also &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot; - you can slide/fly)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;fox stocks/health and puff health located in top corner in battle (not in intended spots)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;there&amp;#39;s no point in using anything other than attack/flee in battle unless you want to see them (the other options have animations but do nothing)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;no loading screens (yet)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;no sound right now (&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPYki-9eO4Y\"&gt;here&amp;#39;s paper mario TTYD battle theme for later if it gets to quiet for you&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough about that - I&amp;#39;m sure you guys can tell me everything else thats wrong. Let me tell you about the game! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHOW ME YOUR MOVES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for the demo (and the game if it happens) you play as Fox and for now you can just explore the small areas that are included. If you push the &amp;quot;i&amp;quot; key you &lt;del&gt;can do an illusion&lt;/del&gt; can attempt to do an illusion and if you push the &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; key you can do a shine. You can also crouch with &amp;quot;c&amp;quot; and do a few other moves with other keys. All these moves are either broken or are going to be removed, so enjoy doing upsmashes in midair and such while you can (in moderation though). If you break the game dont blame me though, I warned ya. But just running and jumping around is kinda boring though, right? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BATTLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The REAL challenge is the battle I included at the end of the demo! If you don&amp;#39;t want to know who you are facing (and cant already guess) and want to be surprised then dont read any farther! Also if you want to go into the battle without the knowledge of your defense options and find them out for yourself for increased difficulty dont look below (and good luck)!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO FIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright, getting into the battle. For now everything is pretty simple, so unfortunately dont expect to be doing anything crazy. Okay with that said, the enemy you have to face is &lt;em&gt;Jigglypuff&lt;/em&gt;, and just like in Melee she can be a tough opponent to face. One mistake can lead to a stock loss and potentially game over! There&amp;#39;s nothing too fancy about Fox&amp;#39;s attacks; select what you want and he&amp;#39;ll do it. So offense is pretty simple, but defending against Puff&amp;#39;s attacks is definitely harder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what you need to know to about your defense options:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jump - push the jump key (space) to get out of the way &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shine stall - jump (space) and then push the b button (x key) to temporarily stall with shine in midair&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Crouch - duck under attacks and crouch cancel certain attacks &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IF YOU GET GRABBED - make sure you DI properly if she grabs you (away off stage)\nIF YOU GET HIT/THROWN OFFSTAGE - jump (space) or side b (x key) to get back to stage&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: If you change the inputs when you start the game then you&amp;#39;ll have to push whatever you set instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all you need to know for now. Just a note though, the defensive options you can use vary depending on Puff&amp;#39;s attacks. If this didnt help and youre still struggling....just uh try again I guess...losing is learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, thats enough from me. If you&amp;#39;re interested now or were already interested in the concept before, then hurry up and play the game! As I said earlier, I&amp;#39;m looking to fix, improve, and add things so leave some feedback on what you want me to do next - Do you want to play as Falco? Do you want to wavedash? Do you want combos? Do you want me to change the game to 2.5D/3D instead of 2D? Let me know! Hey even leaving a comment saying you enjoyed this small &lt;del&gt;somehow functioning&lt;/del&gt; demo and want to see more means a lot. And of course if you have any questions I&amp;#39;ll definitely try to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you want to see any updates you can check out &lt;a href=\"https://thewhiteraccoon.wordpress.com/\"&gt;thewhiteraccoon.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; where I can try to \npost stuff as I do it if people are interested.
