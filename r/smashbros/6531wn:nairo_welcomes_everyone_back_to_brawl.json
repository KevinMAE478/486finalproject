Casually brawl is still my favorite, but smash 4 gives it a run for its money with  the roster being close to perfect imo. However, competitively, smash4 is superior imo. Ive tried watching even mk and icie banned brawl stuff   and it looks like clunkier smash 4 (even feels that way when I play). I respect the brawl scene&amp;#39;s attempt to revive itself but I&amp;#39;m not interested at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg7tdv6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492130341.0, "created_utc": 1492101541.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg74hv6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 86, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kingjumby", "parent_id": "t1_dg745ex", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Tbh it's the best one to play casually, although I do acknowledge your sick memery.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tbh it&amp;#39;s the best one to play casually, although I do acknowledge your sick memery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg74hv6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492085493.0, "created_utc": 1492056693.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 86}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg745ex", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 45, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DangerAwar", "parent_id": "t1_dg72gss", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The 3rd best game out of the official ones after Melee and 64", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3rd best game out of the official ones after Melee and 64&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg745ex", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492084968.0, "created_utc": 1492056168.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 45}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg72gss", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shirubaa", "parent_id": "t3_6531wn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What's Brawl?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s Brawl?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg72gss", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492082500.0, "created_utc": 1492053700.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6531wn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6531wn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6531wn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg76k2f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 22, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Happens_2u", "parent_id": "t1_dg76ge0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Whoops I saw MK and I thought \"oh, must be Nairo.\" I'm watching the stream now actually and Nairo's Falco is cool", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoops I saw MK and I thought &amp;quot;oh, must be Nairo.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m watching the stream now actually and Nairo&amp;#39;s Falco is cool&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg76k2f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492088869.0, "created_utc": 1492060069.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg76ge0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 73, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SC_Red", "parent_id": "t1_dg769ci", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He didn't drop it because it wasn't him doing it lmao", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t drop it because it wasn&amp;#39;t him doing it lmao&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg76ge0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492088693.0, "created_utc": 1492059893.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 73}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg769ci", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Happens_2u", "parent_id": "t3_6531wn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm surprised Gunblade didn't drop the chaingrab.
