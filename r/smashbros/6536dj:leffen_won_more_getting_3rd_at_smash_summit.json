If you're a liberal, you most likely hate taxes because most of your taxes go to the military rather than education, infrastructure, social programs, etc. If you're a conservative, you most likely hate taxes because they go to social programs (far, far less than the military, but I digress), which are client politics (everyone pays a little, but only one particular group of people benefits).\n\nMost Americans do not disagree fundamentally with the idea of taxation (except if you're an extreme libertarian, an anarcho-capitalist, or anyone else in the \"taxation is theft\" camp, but they're a small minority).

Please don&amp;#39;t misunderstand I think those two are amazing players, but they do nothing to brand themselves and have pretty weak followings compared to others at their skill level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you combine more concentrated views with the rabid voting of the fans, and you get a lot of income coming in. Not to mention Summit&amp;#39;s overhead is WAY SMALLER than a huge venue like Big House.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually think the Exhibition style Melee will somewhat overtake mid sized nationals.  We will always see Genesis &amp;amp; Big House, but the smaller ones like Sandstorm, Frame Perfect, UGC etc are probably going to drop down to regional size.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg7q1d1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126774.0, "created_utc": 1492097974.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
