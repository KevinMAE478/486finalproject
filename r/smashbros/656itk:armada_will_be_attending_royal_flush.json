However Armada and Android would already be traveling to the united states two weeks later. Thus they would have to make a &lt;em&gt;20-hour trip&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;twice&lt;/strong&gt;, get a week of rest when they came back and then do the same trip again. It is not about the money, but more if people &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to see Armada more at tournaments. He said he would endure the traveling if his fans really wanted him there. Thus the donation drive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question was raised so many times in chat that it is understandable Armada was tired of answering it. I still find it sick Armada traveling over the Atlantic Sea so many times a year. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg88hbo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492146740.0, "created_utc": 1492117940.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656itk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8ozi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Armada_", "parent_id": "t1_dg87s8n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I explained the story 20 + times on stream AND we had a command for it which I also stated when the question got brought up.\n\nMaight not have been you but at least someone did ask why we had the goal and I did not feel for explaining again when I did it 20+ times and we had a command (which I also did mention).
