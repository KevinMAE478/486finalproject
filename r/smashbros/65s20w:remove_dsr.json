A win for Nairo from SSC 2016 and two from Umebura SAT, and a win for Mr R at SSC 2016 and TBH6. Shots Fired 2 (2-1) is pre-patch, since 1.1.5 was on 3/15/15, while SF2 was on the 5th, and they didn&amp;#39;t go to SV at G4 (I checked). The remaining game is a Cloud-Bayo game from Umebura that Mr R won. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main issue with this is that SSC and Umebura were literally a week apart and was in August, meaning saying he would be better off on SV &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; is dubious. In addition, both of Nairo&amp;#39;s losses were two stocks, while his wins had a two stock and two close games. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nairo-Mr R on FD is 0-1, from G4, so while saying Nairo never won on FD is technically true, it&amp;#39;s misleading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the data doesn&amp;#39;t actually support either one, and it&amp;#39;s really a pick your poison kind of pick. Maybe Nairo just doesn&amp;#39;t like SV, maybe he preferred FD, either way, going SV is not, from a data standpoint, anywhere near a guaranteed better shot at a win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Oh hey, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of Nairo&amp;#39;s losses are two sotkcs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dgcv1cc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492419436.0, "created_utc": 1492390636.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s20w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s20w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s20w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s20w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcryle", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Assassannerr", "parent_id": "t1_dgcrv4k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 1, "body": "That's also the point of a ban... \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s also the point of a ban... \u00af\\&lt;em&gt;(\u30c4)&lt;/em&gt;/\u00af&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dgcryle", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492415273.0, "created_utc": 1492386473.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcrv4k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MadSpaceYT", "parent_id": "t1_dgcrrl0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; If we didn't have it, you'd essentially be forced to play your opponent on their best/favorite stage or on your worst/least favorite stage every time they get to pick.\n\nThat's.
