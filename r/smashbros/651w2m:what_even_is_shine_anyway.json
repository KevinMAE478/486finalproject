Up until Brawl, there was no sign of how Fox activated his Reflectors, as he simply held a stance and the energy shield simply &amp;quot;appeared&amp;quot; around them. However, Subspace Emissary and the Star Fox cast&amp;#39;s redesigns in Brawl revealed that their reflectors were miniature devices that activated on a swipe of their hands. These devices would later make their first canonical appearance in Star Fox Zero, once again attached to Fox and Falco&amp;#39;s belts but serving no purpose in gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So... it&amp;#39;s an energy shield.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not realistic someone punches so hard it lights his hand on fire in the shape of a Falcon, either, the shine doesn&amp;#39;t have to be logical.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg71y9x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492081787.0, "created_utc": 1492052987.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651w2m", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651w2m", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7n9tm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shake_N_Bake01", "parent_id": "t1_dg75iub", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Reminds me of how godlike Subspace Emissary was ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of how godlike Subspace Emissary was &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "smashbros", "name": "t1_dg7n9tm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123756.0, "created_utc": 1492094956.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiep", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651w2m", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7d2wh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThermalFlask", "parent_id": "t1_dg75iub", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/smashbros", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wow, I forgot there was ever a scene like that in Subspace Emissary.
