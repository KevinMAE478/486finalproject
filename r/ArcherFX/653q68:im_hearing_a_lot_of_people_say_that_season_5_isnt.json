Iraq.  Syria?  Whatever, anyway I understand the anger this can cause some viewers due to the reverse canon effect on the story thus far, but yesterday was never promised unless you were there to see it.

Now if you were to tune in at episode 2 or 3 of that arc then yes you would not know exactly what's going on and would probably not enjoy it as much, which I imagine is why a lot of people stopped watching. But one doesn't pick up Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad halfway through a season, does one?  Then at the end of the season there's like a four or 5 episode arc with the same issue. So it really comes down to what kind of entertainment you're looking for. If you want Family Guy, well this isn't Family Guy. I like Family guy to relax and unwind after work or something, put on in the background while I'm busy. But you've made it this far so you already know that Archer is best with some attention paid. And it's not like you have to wait a week in between episodes. Now in its eighth season they are doing the continuity thing again, picking up episode 2 the literal second episode 1 left off. I think it's safe to say this show has found its core audience at this point and it's having a positive response this time around. But again, you made it this far. Watch it.
