(Other examples of Child Wonder Fiction include *Tomorrowland* and *Polar Express*).  A certain kind of adult is enchanted by childhood wonder; they just can't get enough of it.  Note how I specify that adults are the ones who value wonder... children don't, especially children with active imaginations and quite a bit of wonder themselves.  The reason for adults valuing childhood wonder, and children not valuing it, is actually quite simple:  *Wonder is the experience of pre-cognitive amazement and awe at unknown phenomena.*\n\nYou can only have wonder for something you do not understand:  A child who will grow up to eventually become an astronomer looks at the night sky, and experiences wonder... this is because he doesn't really know what the stars are, or how far away they are, or what they are made of, or how old they are, or any other pertinent information... they could be anything that his imagination, unconstrained by knowledge, is able to dream up.  After he grows up and becomes an astronomer, his knowledge constrains what he can imagine: he can no longer imagine that the stars are candles being held by angels or whatever.  He might still experience wonder when looking at the stars, but now it is focussed on things that remain beyond what he knows despite having learned all about the subject... perhaps life that exists on planets orbiting those stars. (That's the secret to continuing to experience wonder as an adult: no matter what you know, no matter how far you expand the horizon of your understanding, that horizon never goes away, and you'll never know what is or isn't on the other side of it).  \n\nAdults who intensely value childhood wonder feel the constraints of their own knowledge quite fiercely.  Perhaps they became invested in ideas as a child that they now know to be impossible and as a result are nostalgic for the time when they could live in their delusions unmolested by facts.  Perhaps nobody ever taught them the trick of expanding their mind to consider the world beyond the horizon of their knowledge.  Whatever the reason, there is a subset of adults who find the banality of the world they know pressing, and long for the freedom of child-like wonder.  Children themselves don't value wonder like this because they live in a world characterized by what they don't know or can't do... the ignorance and lack of understanding that wonder is predicated upon is an impediment to them on a daily basis one that healthy children long to discard.  Also, familiarity breeds contempt.  Children, insofar as they experience boundless imagination, have no real experience with bounded imagination to compare it with... like a rich kid who just doesn't notice that the utensils that he uses everyday are sterling silver... to him, its always been like that; so what's the big deal?\n\nThe result is Child Wonder Fiction... a class of \"children's story\" that appeals more to the parents than the children.  It enshrines wonder, and belief, and uncritical perception of the world because, through the distorted lens of nostalgia, that is what parents remember from their own childhood and thus love to see in their own children.  Child viewers, on the other hand, see child characters who are essentially trapped in a roller-coaster: impressive visuals, exciting action, but ultimately not able to escape the state of being powerless, knowledge-less, passengers on a ride that others control... normal life as a child in other words.  Children, themselves, want stories that place the character that the child identifies with (and it doesn't have to be a child character) in CONTROL of his own fate.  Children long for responsibility, and for the confidence that comes with understanding the world around them, and grown-up roles.
