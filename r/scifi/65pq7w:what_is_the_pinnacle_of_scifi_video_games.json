So, it really depends on what you are looking for in terms of themes and execution.\n\n**Best space opera:** I think most people would agree *Mass Effect* deserves this title. It's really the only space opera that belongs exclusively to video games, and no other medium. It is the \"Star Wars of video games.\" *Halo* and *StarCraft: Broodwar* are both close seconds though.\n\n**Best hard sci-fi:** This one is a little harder. There aren't many hard sci-fi games. I think Eve Online, or Elite would probably be the best contenders here. Maybe *Kerbal Space Program* if you count that.\n\n**Best sci-fi fantasy:** sounds weird, but I'd put DOOM or Quake in this category. Supernatural elements combined with great, timeless gameplay.\n\n**Best horror sci-fi:** *System Shock 2*, *SOMA*, and *Dead Space* are all strong contenders here. *System Shock 2* was certainly the most groundbreaking and influential. *SOMA* definitely has the strongest writing. *Dead Space* is definitely the most mechanically sound game. Pick your poison I guess.\n\n**Best dystopian sci-fi:** My vote goes to *Half-Life 2* here, but a lot of people would probably say *Deus Ex*.\n\n**Best post apocalyptic sci-fi:** My personal choices would be *Fallout 2* or *S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl*.\n\n**Best over-all sci-fi:** I think in terms of pacing, quality of writing, variety of tone, *Portal* is probably the best overall sci-fi game ever made.

You have absolutely no hints about where to go next, and every adventure to the next save point is a bet against death.

The puzzle design and the story-telling here is *phenomenal*, but this one is probably the least Metroid-esque of the lot.

[**Axiom Verge:**](http://www.axiomverge.com/) A unique mystery story, and quite grim. SNES-retro. Loads of weapons and new types of power-ups (or thoughtful twists on old ones) that come as a breath of fresh air. Fewer bosses than ESA, but more detail to story-telling and the graphics would make Super Metroid designers nod in respect.\n\n4. [**Cave Story+:**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200900/) This is an oldie, by now. SNES graphics, and more combat-oriented than Metroid, but still worth the playthrough. I don't remember much, other than that I really enjoyed it six years ago.\n\n5. [**HeroCore:**](http://www.remar.se/daniel/herocore.php) This game is free. Atari-retro with modern controls and design. You can play it right now.
