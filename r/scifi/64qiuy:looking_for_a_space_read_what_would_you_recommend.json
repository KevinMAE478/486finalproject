The Neptunian tells him that essential parts of his memory were removed and stored by the very government that Phaethon believes to be wholly honorable. It shakes his faith. He is an exile from himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so Phaethon embarks upon a quest across the transformed solar system--Jupiter is now a second sun, Mars and Venus terraformed, humanity immortal--among humans, intelligent machines, and bizarre life forms that are partly both, to recover his memory, and to learn what crime he planned that warranted such preemptive punishment. His quest is to regain his true identity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Golden Age is one of the major, ambitious SF novels of the year and the international launch of an important new writer in the genre.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "scifi", "name": "t1_dg4ojbc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491963987.0, "created_utc": 1491935187.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qiuy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ql2h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fatoldhippy", "parent_id": "t3_64qiuy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/scifi", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ursala K LeGuinn,  \"The Left Hand of Darkness\", The Dispossed\", \"Rocannons World\", others", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ursala K LeGuinn,  &amp;quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&amp;quot;, The Dispossed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Rocannons World&amp;quot;, others&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "scifi", "name": "t1_dg4ql2h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491966179.0, "created_utc": 1491937379.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qiuy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qiuy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4u80e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "VincentGrayson", "parent_id": "t1_dg4r8tj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/scifi", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is the best science fiction I've read in ages.
