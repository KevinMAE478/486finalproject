The origami that Gaff does also includes other animal and human shapes, and if he does have knowledge of the memories implanted into replicants, perhaps those are also used.  I took the message of him leaving behind the unicorn origami to simply mean, &amp;#39;i was here, i didn&amp;#39;t kill Rachel, you&amp;#39;re both free to go&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I prefer Deckard to be human as his relationship with Rachel then sort of says, &amp;#39;both of these people are different but human enough&amp;#39; to make a life together, however &amp;#39;human&amp;#39; is defined.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit* also a unicorn is a rare creature in mythology, so it might even represent the uniqueness of them being together.  That&amp;#39;s what i love about the film really, it allows people to come away with their own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "scifi", "name": "t1_dge8m1w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492497135.0, "created_utc": 1492468335.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qfia", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qfia", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qfia", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qfia", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdq7c6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "justkirk", "parent_id": "t1_dgdmht8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/scifi", "controversiality": 0, "body": "/r/nocontext ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/nocontext\"&gt;/r/nocontext&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "scifi", "name": "t1_dgdq7c6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476021.0, "created_utc": 1492447221.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qfia", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdqd1m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TotesMessenger", "parent_id": "t1_dgdmht8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/scifi", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.
