I am not really interested in the Wheel of Time series.

I do enjoy Sanderson in general, though didn&amp;#39;t manage to stay interested in Elantris.\nI went back to The Sword of Shanara recently, having remembered that title from my youth many years ago...and it seemed a bit childish. I couldn&amp;#39;t really get into it.\nI enjoyed the Inheritance, particularly the detail to the battle and system of magic. That was fun. A bit on the childish side, particularly the first book (understandably).\nIf you haven&amp;#39;t noticed the trend here, it&amp;#39;s that I&amp;#39;m only really aware of the uber popular books that make it into the mainstream.
