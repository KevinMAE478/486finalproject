I'm not even sure I'd count some of the cyberpunk stuff. *The Drowned World* and *Day of the Triffids* are also straight-up apocalypse stories of different sorts, though at least there are more genuinely dystopian tales by the same writers on the list (*High Rise* and *The Chrysalids*). There's no way *The Drowned World* should be higher up than *High Rise* though especially given it's much more tenuously dystopian nature.
