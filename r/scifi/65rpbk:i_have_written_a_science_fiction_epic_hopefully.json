It details an expedition to a recently discovered star system full of anomalies, one of which is an artificial ring around a planet they later find out is just one of many vast terraforming structures the machine race behind it built, cultivating a new world for a far flung galactic power that has yet to send its first settlers. The &amp;#39;lateness&amp;#39; of their masters becomes a crucial point in the 3rd act tonal shift.\nThe crew of the explorer ship have their own issues, be it with each other, with their own disorders or social dysfunctions, or things they regret, all of which become clear and are solved/made worse when the expedition takes more and more swerves in what they find, and what more it implies to be out there.\nThere is no obvious main character among the crew, as nobody really get put to the side by the narrative. But its the one in charge of security who takes command when things go wrong, and the normal captain of the ship, who have what&amp;#39;s the primary character based conflict.\nOtger characters include the ship&amp;#39;s enlisted xenoarchaeologist, engineer, pilot and ship AI, but additionally individuals among the AI race they find behind these constructs, some of whom prove as allies, others not so much.\nIts set in the early 3500s, and primarily in a time when humans and 4 other notable spacefaring races mingle and have settled in a 5000 light year wide cluster within out galactic arm. A big region to work stories in, but still a small fraction of the galaxy. \nIt has yet to get much attention [any at all...], but it isn&amp;#39;t my first piece of writing, that would be the years of posting ideas/short stories on various other fandom, and science fiction sites.\nIf anyone can give it a read, that would be great. And like I said, if you want a full read before you buy and can&amp;#39;t get it via kindle preview or whatever, let me know, I can send you a manuscript.\nMany thanks.\nBook&amp;#39;s name is Vanguards of the Primacy, by Alexander Charles O&amp;#39;Donnell.
