If so... \n\nDo you know that \"skirt\" is *masculine* in German?  \"Den anderen, ich mag *ihn* mehr\" is what a German woman would tell her friend who shows two skirts and asks about an opinion.  In English it reads \"The other, I like *him* more.\"\n\nDo you know that some languages have a separate gender for \nthings such as flowers and colours?\n\n[Have you tried this?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender)\n\nHave you read Ann Leckie's trilogy?\n\nWhat I am trying to suggest here is that you are struggling due to your own linguistic bias and most likely you will make the same mistake as Ann Leckie who failed quite spectacularly at the literary quality of her gimmick (it works within the story but it could be much better) because she only speaks English  and thus fails to realize that the strong distinction between men women and objects is just a feature of this particular language. Because she is American she also fails at understanding that English is the global language due to a historical accident and in the past other languages held this function.  It is true that she wrote with American audience in mind and was making a political point but it still fell short what it could achieve. \n\nIn other words if you are English-centric and American-centric \nyou are going to have a hard time doing what you want to do because you are not skilled enough to handle it naturally. You are someone who lived your whole life in a desert riding horses and you really want to try your hand at surfing. How do you think it will go?\n\nHere's what I recommend. Recognize that languages serve a function. If your aliens are genderless then their language will have other quirks. See Hungarian and Finnish (I am listing European languages because of familiarity) for the number of noun cases  of which there are *none* used in English anymore.\nSee the number of grammatical tenses in English and compare with languages which have three like most Slavic languages. See how German has sentence structures which put word order in reverse in some instances while English has always a rigid sentence structure...while Slavic languages (and Latin to an extent) allow almost any structure and still make sense.\n\nSo if your alien has no gender then their language will have one of the two - either it will have no gender at all and your alien should make constant jokes at how your human male protagonist is troubled with using the \"derogatory\" **it** towards it while it doesn't give a flying fuck because it's like trying to determine which font to use while writing someone's name. Would you care if I called you **Xais56** rather than *Xais56* or X a i s 5 6 ? This is what the distinction between he, she and it would really be for such alien.    Remember that your discomfort coming from the use of **it** is purely *your own* stemming from your own limitation as a native English speaker and the nonsense that a handful of people with their own problems try to project onto your sens of the language. You and they project your understanding of language on that particular word and it has *nothing* in common with how someone speaking a different language evolved in a completely different culture and reality would see it. The alien wouldn't understand your misgivings. If anything it would be insanely hilarious. What do the words \"he\" \"she\" and \"it\" mean at all?   So instead of trying to make a square round make its language terribly complicated in other aspects. For example make it have 40 grammatical tenses and 10 forms of address which it will constantly fuss about because it will see English as impolite. (see Japanese here!). If you do this you will avoid pitfalls of pandering to the linguistically retarded sensibilities of SJWs and instead make a greater and more insightful point on the function and form of language. Both the alien and your protagonist will be troubled by one aspect of the language and disregard another but they will be not the same aspect. Make fun of it. Have a human female secondary character from Russia (or another country where language has multiple genders for all nouns) and have her call the alien \"he\" without much regard for propriety because in Russian \"alien\" is \n\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d and it's a \"he\" - the noun is masculine so who cares what he is sexually. Make it really weird for your English-speaking protagonist.  *Make it interesting and fun at the same time*.  Being politically correct -which is what you are doing - is the opposite of expanding one's mind- which is what SF should be all about.\n\nBy the way the best way to solve such problem is ask \"how should I address you\"? And the alien tells you. Make it something ridiculous. Do you know what Ann Leckie did right in her novel? The Presger translator. It wasn't ideal but it worked so much better than her language gimmick and really did show the *alienness* of the aliens in a humoristic way. \n\n\nAlternatively make the alien's language have 100 genders. For example how about the alien has a different gender for *itself* depending on what it does? It sleeps? It's a he. It prays? It's a she. It fights? It is an it. It cares for children? It is a vir. It is in mourning? It is a ze. Gender in language serves a function. For example in German if you say a noun once you can refer to the same noun by its article in the future. der Kaffee can be referred to it (he!) as \"der\" in another sentence. Make it work the same way:\n\n\"I need to speak to Thsospahgp\"        \n\"Thsospahgp is sleeping.\"       \n\"I really need to speak to him\"      \n\"He must rest now.\"      \n\"I have an important message.\"     \n\"She will see you in six hours\"  (*She* indicates the availability for social function unlike the unconscious *he*)\n\nAnd so on...   Make it a point of contention too just like the forms of address in the above example and make your human male protagonist lose his mind about the insane complexity of it, make him make constant mistakes, make him attend a function where no translators are allowed and he will have to learn a phrase in alien language (See Picard ) and have him botch it. Make the aliens offended far more than a blue-haired tumblr otherkin would be if you called zxyz a \"he\" because zxyz still has a penis dangling between zxyz legs.\n\nMake it smart and scientific. It's called *science* fiction for a reason. Let's not make it all about linguistic illiteracy that occupies the minds of people who probably never read a sci-fi book in their life. There is a reason why the obsession with genders is so prevalent in English and a handful of languges with old Germanic roots. It's because those people lack the *perspective* of having multiple genders everywhere around them or *none* gender at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo here's what I recommend. \n\n", "edited": 1492119127.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will wager a guess that you do not speak other languages and have not studied linguistics?
