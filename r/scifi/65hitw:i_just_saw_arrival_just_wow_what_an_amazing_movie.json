It's something of a dodge to say \"oh you can't judge this movie on the other characters\". Sure we can. \n\nI understand why people like this movie. I'm not even of the opinion that it's really a \"bad\" movie. But I thoroughly disliked it, which was a shame because I really wanted to like it.\n\nMy main problems with the movie:\n\nThe characters who aren't Amy Adams are so weak and so terribly written. Christ, Forest Whitaker's character was so bad. He's an amazing actor but there was nothing he could do with that pile of shit. They gave him an of-the-shelf SyFy movie-of-the-week obstructionist army dude. And not even a good version of one. It's so cliche I felt a bit embarrassed for him. And holy shit, he's so dumb. Out of all the guys in the US government this is the guy they put in charge of maybe the biggest event in known human history, and he doesn't understand why we can't just talk to the aliens. He has to have Amy Adams ELI5 it for him. \n\nIt treats the audience like morons. Maybe it's just a pet-peeve of mine, but I really can't stand when a science fiction movie doesn't have faith in its audience. I understand that the scene where Amy Adams has to explain the hurdles of talking to the aliens to Forest Whitaker is not actually for his benefit, but for ours (the audience). But to me, that's even worse. Just another cliche whiteboard scene where the main character has to explain the crux of the movie to the audience. Completely takes me out of the movie and feels insulting, either trust that the audience can understand without your hand holding, or at least **show** rather than tell.\n\n[Spoiler](/s \"The story of her daughter and the 'twist' felt less like some kind of cathartic emotional reveal and more like manipulation. The repeated soft light, slightly-out-of-focus feel-good memory scenes were saccharine and intentionally misleading. And in the end it doesn't even allow the viewer to explore the implications. In predictable Hollywood style the movie pushes the interpretation that Amy Adams 'chose' to do it all anyway. Not that she was actually always consigned to that fate and that she was just a passenger with little agency of her own. The ending would have had much more power if this was left open-ended. But the implication that we lack agency in our own lives is a bit depressing.\")\n\nThings I liked about the movie:\n\nThe atmosphere was great. I really liked the minimalist set design, the score, etc. Overall really I liked the feel of the movie. I thought the pacing was good. I know many people have complained about how slow this movie was. I really like slow science fiction movies and I thought it was paced very well. At least up until the final act which felt very rushed and forced.\n\nSorry to rant at you. I didn't expect this post to be so long.\n\n\n", "edited": 1492276866.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I disagree. It&amp;#39;s something of a dodge to say &amp;quot;oh you can&amp;#39;t judge this movie on the other characters&amp;quot;. Sure we can. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand why people like this movie. I&amp;#39;m not even of the opinion that it&amp;#39;s really a &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; movie. But I thoroughly disliked it, which was a shame because I really wanted to like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My main problems with the movie:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The characters who aren&amp;#39;t Amy Adams are so weak and so terribly written. Christ, Forest Whitaker&amp;#39;s character was so bad. He&amp;#39;s an amazing actor but there was nothing he could do with that pile of shit. They gave him an of-the-shelf SyFy movie-of-the-week obstructionist army dude. And not even a good version of one. It&amp;#39;s so cliche I felt a bit embarrassed for him. And holy shit, he&amp;#39;s so dumb. Out of all the guys in the US government this is the guy they put in charge of maybe the biggest event in known human history, and he doesn&amp;#39;t understand why we can&amp;#39;t just talk to the aliens. He has to have Amy Adams ELI5 it for him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It treats the audience like morons. Maybe it&amp;#39;s just a pet-peeve of mine, but I really can&amp;#39;t stand when a science fiction movie doesn&amp;#39;t have faith in its audience. I understand that the scene where Amy Adams has to explain the hurdles of talking to the aliens to Forest Whitaker is not actually for his benefit, but for ours (the audience). But to me, that&amp;#39;s even worse. Just another cliche whiteboard scene where the main character has to explain the crux of the movie to the audience. Completely takes me out of the movie and feels insulting, either trust that the audience can understand without your hand holding, or at least &lt;strong&gt;show&lt;/strong&gt; rather than tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"The story of her daughter and the &amp;#39;twist&amp;#39; felt less like some kind of cathartic emotional reveal and more like manipulation. The repeated soft light, slightly-out-of-focus feel-good memory scenes were saccharine and intentionally misleading. And in the end it doesn&amp;#39;t even allow the viewer to explore the implications. In predictable Hollywood style the movie pushes the interpretation that Amy Adams &amp;#39;chose&amp;#39; to do it all anyway. Not that she was actually always consigned to that fate and that she was just a passenger with little agency of her own. The ending would have had much more power if this was left open-ended. But the implication that we lack agency in our own lives is a bit depressing.\"&gt;Spoiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things I liked about the movie:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere was great. I really liked the minimalist set design, the score, etc. Overall really I liked the feel of the movie. I thought the pacing was good. I know many people have complained about how slow this movie was. I really like slow science fiction movies and I thought it was paced very well. At least up until the final act which felt very rushed and forced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry to rant at you.

The time travel twist was thought provoking, although I thought the idea that learning a language could grant time travel perceptions was a bit of a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was also interested to see this Hollywood movie put the Chinese in a &amp;quot;cross-tagonist&amp;quot; position. Not so much as rivals, but more as fellow researchers who are looking for answers, and who break something but then help to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One issue that I thought deserved a bit more thought is whether the Chinese linguists would be more likely to be the first to crack the code, given that Chinese is at heart an iconographic script rather than an alphabetic one. Still, this element is easily explained away if you assume that General Xiang was a military mind foremost and a linguist secondarily (and thus the American linguist&amp;#39;s expertise carried the day due to specialization over mere familiarity).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope many more movies follow the intellectual inquisitiveness of Arrival!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "scifi", "name": "t1_dgaq756", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492296972.0, "created_utc": 1492268172.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hitw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hitw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgasm1h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "vladimirpoopen", "parent_id": "t1_dgas118", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/scifi", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree.
