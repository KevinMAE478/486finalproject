See swiftkey for comparison. There you always know whats next. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the autocorrect doesn&amp;#39;t work. So you are mashing keyboard and see the correct word and instead getting that corrected one, you get gibberish inserted. And sometimes it is fine. Weird. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is also an irritating thing: when you go to emoji board/selection the top border of keyboard grows couple of pixels. When you return to normal keyboard it reduces it height for couple of pixels. It definitely is not nice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seems to me that it crashes more than swiftkey. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to use this keyboard more, but there is still a lot of progress to be done. But good work so far and thanks for adding more languages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "apple", "name": "t1_dg539be", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491981054.0, "created_utc": 1491952254.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tnws", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tnws", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6paap", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PeaceBull", "parent_id": "t1_dg55rjc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/apple", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They got rid of text replacement when using characters.
