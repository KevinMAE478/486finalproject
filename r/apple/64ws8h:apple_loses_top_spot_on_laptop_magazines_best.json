Even Lenovo&amp;#39;s flagship P50 is $2,415.60, which is right at the 15&amp;quot; MBP&amp;#39;s entry price of $2,399.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carbon X: i5 7200U; 8GB DDR3; 256GB PCIe NVMe; 1080p display = $1,569.00&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T460s: i5 6300U; (everything else the same as Carbon X) = $1,421.10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though Asus has a pretty low cost of entry, their new Zenbook 3 Deluxe has a starting price of $1,699 &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; is following the controversial route of only having USB-C ports. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t say that I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;defending&amp;quot; Apple here, but just questioning the placement of companies on this list. Dell sitting behind Asus (after their very successful XPS 13 and 15 lineups), Lenovo sitting in first place with a similarly priced lineup to Apple (which is arguably the sole reason why people are starting to stray away from MBPs), and Microsoft being dead last after an increasingly popular (albeit expensive) Surface lineup just seems off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would put Dell first &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt;, then it would be a close race for second between Lenovo/Apple/HP (they all have their own pros and cons and all make great machines), then another close race for third between Asus and MS.
