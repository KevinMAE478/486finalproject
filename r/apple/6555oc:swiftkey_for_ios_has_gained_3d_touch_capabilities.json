For example, if you swiped the word &amp;#39;contraption&amp;#39;, but meant to swipe &amp;#39;contraction&amp;#39;, you can backspace to &amp;#39;contra&amp;#39;, swipe &amp;#39;ction&amp;#39;, and it auto-joins the two together. Gboard treats them as separate parts. So you can&amp;#39;t really swipe-correct words. You have to finish typing the rest of the word. Or re-swipe from the beginning.
