What is your preferred terminology for the process in which a bass player goes into the studio, plugs into an amp, puts microphone in front of it, records to tape, and is mixed and mastered without being processed through a computer vs opening up protools and programming in the bass line... My brother in law works at a studio like the former that operates without computers, and the owner refers to it as an analog studio. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I play for a guy who write records and releases everything using the latter process, so he does everything in his room, programs in the drums and bass and keys, records guitar and vocals and releases it, then we learn it and adapt it for live. So, since sound is analog, does he and his MacBook Pro qualify?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "apple", "name": "t1_dgbnozz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492344342.0, "created_utc": 1492315542.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lwib", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbnyce", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jdbrew", "parent_id": "t1_dgbnd3g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/apple", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Actually, this is really bugging me.
