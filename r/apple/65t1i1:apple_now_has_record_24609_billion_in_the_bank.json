So long as Apple fund enough money towards creating a team of people capable of solving these problems, there isn't a whole lot else they can do. If it costs Apple $200m a year to give their PhD scientists all the hardware, machinery and tools they need to work on the most difficult issues like solving problems around expanding FOV for AR wearables, then there is little point piling more money into the problem, because it doesn't give them anything else. They already have everything they need to solve the problem, it's just a case of whether they have the right people and whether they solve it before the rest of silicion valley does.

So if they are pushing hard, I am not sure what they are doing. Perhaps they have found a way to do a lot of the data gathering on-site, hidden testing grounds, huge warehouses.. or even simulating it on a computer rather than physically driving. Who knows.

AR and SDCs are new right now (AR moreso than SDCs), and there are still some very core technical problems to solve. So long as Apple fund enough money towards creating a team of people capable of solving these problems, there isn&amp;#39;t a whole lot else they can do. If it costs Apple $200m a year to give their PhD scientists all the hardware, machinery and tools they need to work on the most difficult issues like solving problems around expanding FOV for AR wearables, then there is little point piling more money into the problem, because it doesn&amp;#39;t give them anything else. They already have everything they need to solve the problem, it&amp;#39;s just a case of whether they have the right people and whether they solve it before the rest of silicion valley does. And in terms of acquiring the right people, that is essentially a trivial amount of money, and I doubt it is reflected in the R&amp;amp;D budget itself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SDCs you could argue are different, as that &amp;#39;problem&amp;#39; is essentially a function of data and high performance compute. The HPC part is easy for Apple, obviously, they have huge amounts of compute available to them and can spin up new data centers in no time if need be. The data part though just comes down to Apple driving around as many cars as possible, something we have not seen nor is there any evidence to suggest they have more than a handful of SDC test vehicles right now. So if they are pushing hard, I am not sure what they are doing. Perhaps they have found a way to do a lot of the data gathering on-site, hidden testing grounds, huge warehouses.. or even simulating it on a computer rather than physically driving. Who knows. Maybe they are working on the hardware technologies themselves right now and will scale up testing of them at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "apple", "name": "t1_dgdhbvd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492464913.0, "created_utc": 1492436113.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65t1i1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdplq9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pi-Guy", "parent_id": "t1_dgdgqt3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/apple", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There are problems money can't fix.
