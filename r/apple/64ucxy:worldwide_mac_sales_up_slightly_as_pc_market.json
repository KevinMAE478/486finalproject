Most issues just come from it being really difficult to print a grid of photos as the wizard windows gives allows you to.\n\nForgive me for being a \"Let Me Google That For You\" kind of jerk but the answer to easily printing multiple photos on one page was literally a 60 second affair:\n\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/262632/is-there-a-simple-way-to-print-multiple-images-on-the-same-page-in-mac-os-x\n\nAlso, found this forum discussion:\n\nhttps://forums.macrumors.com/threads/print-multiple-photos-on-one-page.1133769/\n\n...contained this brief but similar set of instructions:\n\n&gt; Open all the photos you want to print simultaneously in Preview. Make sure all the images you want to print are selected in the side panel. \n\n&gt; Go to File -&gt; Print Selected Images\n\n&gt; Now you are in the print dialogue. First, make sure you see the extended version. If your dialogue is only 2 or 3 lines long, click on the black triangle next to the printer name.\n\n&gt; About half way down, you should see a drop down menu... mine says \"Preview\". Change that to Layout (see Screen Grab). Pick how many photos per page you want to print. Print. You're done.  :)\n\n&gt; ps You still don't get a lot of choice over size and placement, but this is fast. You get to choose how many per page. More = smaller. For more exact control, set up some templates in Pages, the page layout side. Create some templates with the sizes you want for each photos as a graphics box. Save As Template is what you are looking for. Failing that, then you are probably looking at Aperture or Lightroom. Though, I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't some SW packages for creating picture packages. You might have to search for those. Use the term Picture Package to start with, until you get a better sense of what kind of terminology is being used for what you are looking for. Good Luck.\n\nAs someone who constantly has to move between Windows, macOS, &amp; Linux I find that it is best to never assume that completing a task will be the same on one OS as it is on the others. If I start with the mindset of 'I wonder how I do [task] in [OS]' rather than 'Why doesn't this work the same in [OS1] as it does in [my most familiar OS]' I'm much more inclined to do a quick Google search, read a few recipes, pick one, try it, and then once the task is complete I'm less frustrated and more apt to think, 'Cool. Now, I know how to do this in [OS]'.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most issues just come from it being really difficult to print a grid of photos as the wizard windows gives allows you to.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forgive me for being a &amp;quot;Let Me Google That For You&amp;quot; kind of jerk but the answer to easily printing multiple photos on one page was literally a 60 second affair:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/262632/is-there-a-simple-way-to-print-multiple-images-on-the-same-page-in-mac-os-x\"&gt;https://superuser.com/questions/262632/is-there-a-simple-way-to-print-multiple-images-on-the-same-page-in-mac-os-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, found this forum discussion:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/print-multiple-photos-on-one-page.1133769/\"&gt;https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/print-multiple-photos-on-one-page.1133769/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...contained this brief but similar set of instructions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open all the photos you want to print simultaneously in Preview. Make sure all the images you want to print are selected in the side panel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to File -&amp;gt; Print Selected Images&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you are in the print dialogue. First, make sure you see the extended version. If your dialogue is only 2 or 3 lines long, click on the black triangle next to the printer name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About half way down, you should see a drop down menu... mine says &amp;quot;Preview&amp;quot;. Change that to Layout (see Screen Grab). Pick how many photos per page you want to print. Print. You&amp;#39;re done.  :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ps You still don&amp;#39;t get a lot of choice over size and placement, but this is fast. You get to choose how many per page. More = smaller. For more exact control, set up some templates in Pages, the page layout side. Create some templates with the sizes you want for each photos as a graphics box. Save As Template is what you are looking for. Failing that, then you are probably looking at Aperture or Lightroom. Though, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if there aren&amp;#39;t some SW packages for creating picture packages. You might have to search for those. Use the term Picture Package to start with, until you get a better sense of what kind of terminology is being used for what you are looking for.
