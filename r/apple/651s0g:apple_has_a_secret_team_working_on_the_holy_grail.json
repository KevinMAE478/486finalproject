While it would definitely be nice to do this without inserting a wire under my skin and dealing with disposable sensors and transmitters (current set up), it&amp;#39;s not my biggest issue. What is my biggest issue is then taking data from my CGM and automating insulin delivery based on those data (a la artificial pancreas). We&amp;#39;re getting there but not just yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that while all this diabetes tech is cool (consider that most is aimed at T1s), the cost is considerable and still out of reach for many. Even old fashioned test strips are often cost prohibitive for many T1s. CGMs and pumps (most currently advanced technology for managing T1) are out of reach for many because of money or lack of insurance coverage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if Apple could develop this at a ridiculously low cost, that would be amazing. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "apple", "name": "t1_dg6vpjb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492073914.0, "created_utc": 1492045114.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651s0g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg75i2a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "QuantumInteger", "parent_id": "t3_651s0g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/apple", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So an Apple a day really does keep the doctors away.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So an Apple a day really does keep the doctors away.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "apple", "name": "t1_dg75i2a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492087085.0, "created_utc": 1492058285.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651s0g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7c3gs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "whapp99", "parent_id": "t3_651s0g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/apple", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As a type 1 \nI love Apple \u2764\ufe0f", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a type 1 \nI love Apple \u2764\ufe0f&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "apple", "name": "t1_dg7c3gs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492102997.0, "created_utc": 1492074197.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651s0g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6wpcy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "megablast", "parent_id": "t3_651s0g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/apple", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I bet they have people working on all sort of sensors for the watch.
