But as OP wrote, if the terminal supports CDCMV (&lt;a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202527\"&gt;Consumer Device Cardholder Verification Method&lt;/a&gt;), it will likely work with payments above \u00a330/equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is part of the standard defined by EMV, the same body behind regular contactless cards. In this case, Apple Pay is merely the branding, but Android Pay and others work exactly the same way. On these terminals, the payment receipt will usually say &amp;quot;Verified by cardholder device&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;Verified by PIN&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No cardholder verification&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the only time I&amp;#39;ve been unable to pay with Apple Pay is if the terminal is offline-only, where I have then had to resort to my normal contactless card.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "apple", "name": "t1_dg8evga", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492154992.0, "created_utc": 1492126192.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8cpfd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg7y93l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/apple", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "apple", "name": "t1_dg8cpfd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492152104.0, "created_utc": 1492123304.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7y93l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kris15o", "parent_id": "t3_656rq1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/apple", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My biggest problem, and this may just be me, but the moment the value goes over \u00a330 I put my phone away and bring out the plastic.\n\nI really don't want the hassle of asking \"do you support Apple Pay for more than \u00a330\".
