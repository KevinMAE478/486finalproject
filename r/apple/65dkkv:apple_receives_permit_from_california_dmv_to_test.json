Apple is going to take the ambitious route of designing their own vehicle from the ground up. They have the resources to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s frankly the perfect time for a company like Apple to jump into cars. Cars will soon be computers on wheels, and will require a total re-thinking of how they operate, and what the user experience should be like. The 100+ year experience of the usual auto industry manufacturers will be a hinderance-- lots of assumptions made about what the car experience, design, engineering, etc. &amp;quot;should be&amp;quot;, as opposed to Apple coming in with a fresh eye AND utilizing top level consultants from the auto industry. This will be a total re-think of the experience of a car, from an autonomous perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "apple", "name": "t1_dgapo2x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492296167.0, "created_utc": 1492267367.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgafb6x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nsomnac", "parent_id": "t1_dga83u9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/apple", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're very short sighted.
