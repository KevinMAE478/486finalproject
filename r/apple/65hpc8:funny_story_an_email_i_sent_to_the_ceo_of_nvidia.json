Part of me wonders if it's not up to which GPU company approaches Apple, but what the software devs for MacOS and Apple's pro software want to develop for dictating what GPU's are used. If that's the case, the devs behind FCPX/iMovie have a lot to do with the decision. \n\nAs far as believability, I hope I don't give you guys any reason to think I'm BS'ing (and it'd be kind of a strange lie to fabricate). I've been running the whole eGPU thing with the Maxwell Titan X for the last couple months and the thing that made me reach out to Nvidia was the release of the 1080ti and seeing professionals leave MacOS over this in other communities (primarily LiftGammaGain, where colorists are heavily reliant on powerful GPU's with lots of vram) after I had recently purchased another Mac system. Started to make me sweat bullets thinking I'd eventually be moving back to Windows to continue any post production stuff.

Part of me wonders if it&amp;#39;s not up to which GPU company approaches Apple, but what the software devs for MacOS and Apple&amp;#39;s pro software want to develop for dictating what GPU&amp;#39;s are used. If that&amp;#39;s the case, the devs behind FCPX/iMovie have a lot to do with the decision. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as believability, I hope I don&amp;#39;t give you guys any reason to think I&amp;#39;m BS&amp;#39;ing (and it&amp;#39;d be kind of a strange lie to fabricate).
