Like I mean that monitors have that part around the side of the screen that doesn&amp;#39;t display anything. So if you were to have two screens side by side or even up or down and they were working together to display one thing, then wouldn&amp;#39;t that make it annoying when you&amp;#39;re playing games because you&amp;#39;d have a &amp;quot;break&amp;quot; in the image. It wouldn&amp;#39;t be continuous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I ask because I just saw some photos of curved screens on google and someone had three of them side-by-side where all the screens were displaying one thing. Aside from having a that continuity issue I was also wondering if the images would then look weird too because you&amp;#39;ve got three ultrawide screens that side-by-side and no screens on top to balance out the ratios again.
