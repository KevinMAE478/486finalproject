I use MobaXterm to ssh from my windows laptop to my Ubuntu desktop because I have a lot of copy pasting I need to do in between my excel sheets and emails on my windows laptop and my log files and other code related items on my Linux PC. I have my entire dev environment on my Linux machine, and I forward my GUI components (terminals, pycharm, firefox, sublime text, etc.) over to my windows laptop through X11 forwarding. Lower bandwidth usage than RDP and I get to work seamlessly between both windows and Linux without the hassle of synergy or need an extra set of peripherals!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I researched a lot to get my optimal setup and learning to work between Windows and Linux machines, and this is literally the best and easiest setup I&amp;#39;ve gotten. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "battlestations", "name": "t1_dg5ew49", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491996805.0, "created_utc": 1491968005.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5e8r9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 20, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mmmken", "parent_id": "t1_dg5dljg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/battlestations", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm normally on Ubuntu 16.04, but Windows 10 is on dual boot for Photoshop and the occasional game.\n\nThe Macbook is really because I need XCode, so I build on that and run the packager (and code) on my desktop.\n\nSometimes Synergy makes this a little better.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m normally on Ubuntu 16.04, but Windows 10 is on dual boot for Photoshop and the occasional game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Macbook is really because I need XCode, so I build on that and run the packager (and code) on my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes Synergy makes this a little better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "battlestations", "name": "t1_dg5e8r9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491995827.0, "created_utc": 1491967027.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5dljg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "my_blue_snog_box", "parent_id": "t1_dg546zl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/battlestations", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What is your primary OS for programming on that machine?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your primary OS for programming on that machine?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "battlestations", "name": "t1_dg5dljg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491994888.0, "created_utc": 1491966088.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rdbn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64u9ir", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5qblw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "worker76", "parent_id": "t1_dg546zl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/battlestations", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How do you like React Native?
