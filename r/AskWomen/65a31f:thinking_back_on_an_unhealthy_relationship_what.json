A couple times he wanted to meet up and talk things out as friends, &amp;quot;Oh sorry I can&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m working&amp;quot;. All that jazz. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to make it seem like I was fading away due to my own issues, not pushing him away. Pushing away triggered his abandonment issues. That way, when he finally grew tired of my non-response, he could &amp;quot;reject&amp;quot; me from his life and it would not trigger his abandonment response and craziness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I broke up in early 2014 with him. It wasn&amp;#39;t until early 2017 that he finally unfriended me on Facebook and stopped sending me the odd message here and there. It took years but I am so glad. A mutual friend tells me that he thinks I&amp;#39;m chronically depressed, living at home with my parents, and miserable. Lol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am free!  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg8roes", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492173574.0, "created_utc": 1492144774.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 276}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8pfxe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 91, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FATCAMPMTV", "parent_id": "t1_dg8p1y4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My ex had abandonment issues too, how were you able to finally break up with him?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My ex had abandonment issues too, how were you able to finally break up with him?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg8pfxe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492169876.0, "created_utc": 1492141076.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 91}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8p1y4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 401, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SecularNotLiberal", "parent_id": "t3_65a31f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Within days of us getting together (we were friends for years), I ran into his old best friend.
