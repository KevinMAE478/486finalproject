So why bother restricting myself with clothes to \"fix\" my issues?  No one's fooled.  I may as well *wear whatever the fuck I like and choose clothes that make me happy and that feel comfortable and make me feel awesome*.  Wear a pair of rainbow-unicorn-cloud-print tights under a pair of ripped fishnets under that skirt made of a dozen silk hankies.  Wear a cloak as part of your everyday clothes.  Choose the shoes with glittery forest animals in the place of heels.  Wear the overalls and cute t-shirts even though fashion rules say that's not \"flattering\" on your figure.  Or wear jeans and a t-shirt or the same uniform of leggings and baggy jumpers because those are comfy as fuck.\n\nI'm \"ugly\" therefore make-up will only ever be a layer of gunk on top of an ugly face.  So instead of spending ages fretting about perfecting contours and concealer and nude make-up to cover up and conceal my terrible face, choose the make-up that I want to wear.  Wear no make-up ever at all because you don't like it.  Wear nothing except intricate instagram brows you spend an hour on every day.  Wear an explosion of galaxy-themed glitter and massive winged eyeliner.  Or *do* wear the neutral nude palette and the contour because you genuinely love it.\n\nShave.  Or don't shave.  Choose the beauty and skin and hair routine that suits your lifestyle and preferences because it works for you.  If people were going to give me shit for the way I looked regardless of how much effort I made, I sure as fuck wasn't going to waste time and put up with bleeding ankles to try and score some Pretty Points.  And turns out my body hair is super fuzzy and I kinda love it.\n\nDon't read magazines that contain \"articles\" in which photos of celebrities living their lives are zoomed in on with red circles drawn around cellulite and the barest hint of chub or wrinkle or stubble.  Don't read magazines that tell you all the ways to get that \"perfect\" body/face/hair/skin/whatever that never actually work and will be another forgotten ridiculed trend a few months from now.\n\nExercise.  Find ways of moving your body that you enjoy doing.  Things that make you feel good.  Don't worry about looking ridiculous if you're a beginner, or if you're just never going to be coordinated enough to look like a pro.  Do it because you enjoy it, because it feels good, because it improves your health, because it's fun.  Lift weight and ignore people who worry it'll \"make you bulky\".  Learn yoga or ballet or pole-dancing even though people think fat people can't bend, or jump, or look sexy, because you always wanted to try them.  Learn MMA or another contact sport and ignore people who worry about scars and bruises.  Love your body for what it can do.  And if disability or illness or other issues prevent you from doing as much as you'd like, love it for what it can give you and always remember your well-being and happiness matters more than anyone else's expectations.\n\nHydrate.  Eat well.  Don't deny yourself good things that make you happy, but remember to focus on good fuel to keep that body doing the things it needs to do.  Find recipes to make those good foods more enjoyable.  Don't eat a wilting plate of bland Punishment Lettuce when you could instead make a salad so good you'll want seconds.\n\nTake care of your mind.
