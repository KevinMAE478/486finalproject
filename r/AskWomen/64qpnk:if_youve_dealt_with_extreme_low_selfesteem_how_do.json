I&amp;#39;m lucky to have someone who at least makes me feel secure in terms of faithfulness. \nI collect the little memories of the little things that showed genuine love, and I refer to those when I&amp;#39;m feeling the insecurity creep in. Sometimes it helps, other times I have to tell myself to stop going down the slippery slope.\nIt&amp;#39;s a journey. But of course any criticism or bump in the relationship is felt 999x more, because the insecurity is just like !!!!!!!!! SMTH IS WRONG !!!!!!!!! And then I start to believe they may not love me anymore and I get really scared. \nOver the years I&amp;#39;ve learned to put it on them less and less, and that it&amp;#39;s something I should handle on my own for the most part. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg4a77c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491947873.0, "created_utc": 1491919073.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qpnk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4rulh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "master-of-some", "parent_id": "t3_64qpnk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm a guy that's dealt with really low self esteem.
