It got uncomfortable and would rub on certain kinds of shoes, or hurt badly if i bumped it on something. At 37 I noticed it really growing and looking abnormal. I saw a dermatologist for it and a week after I turned 38, the pathology came back that it's a rare, invasive, aggressive type of cancer. I had to have a 2 hour, $6K USD surgery to remove it and skin-graft the area. I'll be out of work a month :( I'm stuck in this huge dressing, immobilizer boot, and wound vac. Then I have to get checked to see if the cancer spread. If it did, this cancer doesn't respond to chemo or radiation, it's just a death sentence.\n\nI really wasn't expecting any kind of cancer this young. Otherwise I didn't see many changes to my body over the years. I was never pregnant but starting about 31 when I got an IUD I'd have to pee somewhat more frequently. I have about 3 hairs that are translucent (not white/gray) at the root. I get my hair colored anyway. I noticed a minor hemorrhoid about age 29. Slight lines around my eyes if I look super close in the mirror, but I use good moisturizers and anti-aging products. I've always been super un-hairy. No hairs on chin, boobs, ever. Little on legs/arms. That didn't change and the few translucents are on my head, not pubic.\n\nOtherwise no changes.

I saw a dermatologist for it and a week after I turned 38, the pathology came back that it&amp;#39;s a rare, invasive, aggressive type of cancer. I had to have a 2 hour, $6K USD surgery to remove it and skin-graft the area. I&amp;#39;ll be out of work a month :( I&amp;#39;m stuck in this huge dressing, immobilizer boot, and wound vac.
