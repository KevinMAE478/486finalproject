My family doesn't touch much, so I'd have panic attacks before kissing a guy for the first few times, for instance. My boyfriend's love language is touch, but he's extremely passive and wanted me to initiate the kisses and stuff to make sure I was comfortable. This was very sweet of him but also a bit scary for me to take on an active role in touching. In everything else, I'm a go-getter, but with touch I was very shy at first. I also had a guy make out with me without my consent and so I was afraid to take the next step with my boyfriend for a long time. His patience and open talks about what we both wanted really helped us jump that hurdle, and when we both made out for the first time, it was *amazing*. For two physically reserved people, it was insane that we had so much passion and chemistry. Long story short, I really tried to work my way up to touching him more and more every day, and he was super patient and understanding. We were honest with each other about our reservations. He's also very happy with little things, like when I simply give him a back rub or stroke his hair. It's nice that he appreciates even the really tiny things I do.\n\nMy love language is words of affirmation, and this was one that he can have a difficult time with. He's extremely reserved and can be hard to read, and even after 2.5 years I need to lead most of our conversations. However, he's opened up a bunch with me, especially when he learned how important talking and joking around (and, vain as it might sound, both giving and getting compliments) are to me in terms of romance, and his friends and family in general think he's become more open and talkative since meeting me (he was a bit of a recluse for a while). I never used to understand why my boyfriend would get super quiet when I'd compliment him a ton, so one day I asked him. He told me it's appreciated but he's uncomfortable with receiving too many compliments, so I've backed off a bit on that. However, he gives me compliments regularly now, which I really appreciate. :)  I write poems for him sometimes and, even though words aren't his love language, he really appreciates them because he knows they come from my heart. He even wrote me a poem as well, which I really treasure. My boyfriend and I are both people pleasers, but I can be direct when it benefits everyone involved, whereas my boyfriend often shies away from giving his real opinion if he's worried it will hurt me (even when most the time it won't). He's come to realize that I'm receptive to what he has to say, even if it might be a tough pill for me to swallow, and I reassure him that I'd rather he tell me when I do something that bothers him than keep it a secret. Ironically, I can be guilty of the same thing and bottle up my feelings regarding something ongoing between us until I get stressed and start crying (I cry easily, haha). It's something we both have to work on, but in general I tend to initiate these more honest conversations and try to create a space for him to say what he's feeling about what I'm doing, too.
