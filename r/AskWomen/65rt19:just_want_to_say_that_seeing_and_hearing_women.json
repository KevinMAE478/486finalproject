I mean, they&amp;#39;re 50% of the population, I would be living in constant paranoia and limiting myself a lot, and potentially missing out on such a huge number of great people if I decided to discriminate against men just because I got mugged by one, or raped, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can understand victims of abuse and such who have issues trusting people similar to the ones who have wronged them, but there&amp;#39;s a difference between it being a side effect of trauma that you can&amp;#39;t control, and acknowledging this as unfair to those people (without necessarily shaming yourself) and trying to get over it, versus doing it in a deliberate way and legitimising this belief.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dge5pp2", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492493497.0, "created_utc": 1492464697.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdzuwx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "harmonyineverything", "parent_id": "t1_dgdtb3k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I guess I'm more sympathetic to the radfem desire to stay away from men because a lot of them have very valid reasons to be afraid of or repulsed by men like sexual trauma, actual legal oppression, general harassment, etc. And tbh I somewhat lean that way, too: I prioritize women in my life (although not ever dealing with men *in public* is a little much).
