I hate being the RA on call once a week, because I can&amp;#39;t go more than 5 minutes outside of the apartment areas due to emergency response times, you get calls at 2 am of people having issues or getting locked out, you have to make rounds through the buildings multiple times, taking up a solid 40 minutes each time, and when it&amp;#39;s finally over and you are off duty, you have paperwork to fill out detailing any calls and the specifics of the call, the round times, any actions taken in the capacity of being the RA on call, and any noticed maintenance or facilities issues. I would imagine it was similar for your school? And that&amp;#39;s an easy night, when the biggest issue may be a lockout. Now I&amp;#39;m imagining all the paperwork involved in documenting policy violations on top of that when it sounds like just existing results in you walking the line of being written up....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this wordy/ranty, like I said, the more I thought about it, the more I became upset that you dealt with that and that administrators and RAs exist who really just want to show that they have power...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg7fb60", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492112048.0, "created_utc": 1492083248.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6mr9b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 39, "report_reasons": null, "author": "heavyhandedsara", "parent_id": "t1_dg6gksu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's an unthinkably liberal policy compared to the school I attended.
