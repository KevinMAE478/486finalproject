I'm a 30-something who spent 5 years living alone after a divorce, then successfully convinced another man to live with me. I dated during those years in between but never felt like I had a serious boyfriend I could really rely on. Here are my tips:\n\nPut time and energy into friendships. Find your people and do nice things for them. Have meaningful conversations. Become the kind of person your friends will call in a crisis. Know that you have people you can call if the crisis happens to you. When you feel rejected by a potential romantic partner, it doesn't hurt your self esteem as much when you have a long list of other people in your life who know how awesome you are.\n\nBecome part of a team. Find a hobby that requires you to meet with a group on a regular schedule. If you don't show up, you'll be missed. You make the soccer team/choir/volunteer group better with your contributions. With your team you achieve things that nobody could do by herself. It's an awesome feeling. \n\nBuild something and/or lead something. Take point on a new project at work. Figure out what you need to do to create a neighborhood garden. Host a weekly potluck-and-crafts night. Develop a side hustle. Find a thing that you're awesome at, and demonstrate it to others. People will start to see you as the go-to person and authority on that thing. Being known for and defined by your leadership, accomplishments, and expertise feels great.\n\nImprove yourself. Always have one thing that you're getting better at, in a way where you can track your progress. Learn a language, start a new fitness routine, practice art, take online business courses. This keeps you from being bored/boring.\n\nRelish your downtime. When you build a busy life using the tactics above, a day to yourself feels like a treat, not a failure. Create special me-time rituals that you can look forward to: a stack of library books and a pot of fancy tea, a favorite trashy reality show that you half-watch while doing your nails, long runs followed by a shower beer.
