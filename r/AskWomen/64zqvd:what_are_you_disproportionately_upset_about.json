His boss let him take a long lunch to come take me to the courthouse because, stupid me, I didn&amp;#39;t have my credit card or any cash on me to take a cab. I was shaking my whole time there and they had us answer a bunch of pretty personal questions in front of the group. Remember how I said I am extra emotional? Yeah, that plus asking me personal questions plus my anxiety equaled me crying in front of the judge and all of my peers. Not my best moment. Luckily they dismissed me because they don&amp;#39;t need a crying white lady in their jury so I&amp;#39;m done with jury duty. Unfortunately, all of it caused me to get a migraine so, yeah. What should be a no big deal, civic duty obligation turned me into a crying, snotty mess in front of about 30 people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg6r9e1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492068510.0, "created_utc": 1492039710.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zqvd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zqvd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7flqi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Svataben", "parent_id": "t1_dg6uke5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I really hope it gets better for you.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really hope it gets better for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg7flqi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492112695.0, "created_utc": 1492083895.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6uke5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "carolnuts", "parent_id": "t3_64zqvd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I had a mental breakdown on Monday because I had no cake to eat when I got home.\n\nCried, threw plates over the kitchen, screamed, the whole deal.\n\nBecause there was no cake and it was a really hard week for me :(", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a mental breakdown on Monday because I had no cake to eat when I got home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cried, threw plates over the kitchen, screamed, the whole deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because there was no cake and it was a really hard week for me :(&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg6uke5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492072567.0, "created_utc": 1492043767.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zqvd", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg78dtj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "username404error", "parent_id": "t3_64zqvd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Neutral eBay feedback..
