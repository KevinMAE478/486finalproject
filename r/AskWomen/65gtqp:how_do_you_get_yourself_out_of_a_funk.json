When it&amp;#39;s done, pour out that hot water into a cup of something nice - a really good herbal tea, or coffee, or a chocolate drink or whatever you enjoy.  And drink it, as a reward for Doing A Thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Option Two:  Air Punch Music.  The Spotify Air Punch playlist is cliche and cheesy, but it fucking works.  Crank that shit.  Close the doors and the curtains if you need to and then DANCE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Option Three:  Leave the fucking house.  Go anywhere that is outside, that is green from plants or blue from the sea and just look at it all and listen to the sounds around you and breathe.  It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if the place you go is the graveyard around the corner, a park only 5 foot square, or just a spot on the path with a view of other people&amp;#39;s nice gardens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Option Four:  Take a bath.  Chuck some salt in that water or a handful of oats in a tea-ball or something to make the water extra soothing.  If you don&amp;#39;t have a bath, take a shower or fill a bowl with hot water and gently wash and massage your face or feet or hands.  Or all 3, if you like.  Refresh yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Option Five:  Call in on someone.  The neighbour who recently lost their partner.  The older person across the road who doesn&amp;#39;t get out much.  The homeless person who would really appreciate someone buying them a cup of coffee and just chatting for 5 minutes.  Take yourself out of yourself and give to another person.  It makes a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dgask3x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492300349.0, "created_utc": 1492271549.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gtqp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gtqp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gtqp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gtqp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgadcc0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "vampyrotoothus", "parent_id": "t1_dgaa3a7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're so sweet!
