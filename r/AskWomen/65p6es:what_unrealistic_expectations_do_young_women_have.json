Prince Charming's a myth that hasn't actually been around in decades. Over the past twenty years, we've had:\n\nPrince Naveen, who is irresponsible. He parties too much. He flirts with other girls. He has a THOUSAND flaws - even at the end of the film - including having no practical skills, and giving up when things are difficult, not taking anything seriously. He was annoying and pushy like woah, with women, and totally prepared to marry for money. \n\nChristoff, who we're told smells bad, shares his food with a reindeer, is lazy, and as we see, a bit of a coward. He gives up on Anna pretty much instantly. Dude has a thousand flaws - including being crude/gross, and judgemental/cranky. Christoff wasn't pushy, true, but also wasn't confident pretty much ever. The only real conviction we see from him is that you can't marry a man you've just met. And let's face it - they make it pretty clear that his only interest in helping at the start is, again, money. He can't afford what he needs, and the ice/snow from Elsa is going to put a serious dent in his business. \n\nDon't get me started on Flynn Ryder, who is a straight-up thief, a compulsive liar, and has zero self-confidence, who has pretty much made up everything about himself because he doesn't want anyone to know he's hugely emotionally vulnerable. He has one big heroic moment, but man, for the most part he's a total jerk to Rapunzel, tries to scare her out of her quest, and as we've seen has a long history as a con artist. Not exactly perfection, there.\n\nLi Shang's not exactly smooth, no confidence when it comes to women, doesn't listen - literally 90% of their problems would have been solved if he'd actually communicated with Mulan like she was a HUMAN BEING and had a DROP of empathy. But he had none. He made snap decisions and never reconsidered them, had zero faith in anyone else, not exactly hitting it out of the park. He tries to do everything himself, has NO idea how to cooperate or work WITH people. \n\nOh, and you have the HUGE subversion of things with Hans, in Frozen, too. \n\nHeck, as far ago as Beauty and the Beast, that dude has a vicious temper. He's stubborn, and vain. The dude's not perfect.

", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate defending Disney like this, but man, have you been watching Disney movies any time recently? Prince Charming&amp;#39;s a myth that hasn&amp;#39;t actually been around in decades. Over the past twenty years, we&amp;#39;ve had:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prince Naveen, who is irresponsible. He parties too much. He flirts with other girls. He has a THOUSAND flaws - even at the end of the film - including having no practical skills, and giving up when things are difficult, not taking anything seriously. He was annoying and pushy like woah, with women, and totally prepared to marry for money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Christoff, who we&amp;#39;re told smells bad, shares his food with a reindeer, is lazy, and as we see, a bit of a coward. He gives up on Anna pretty much instantly. Dude has a thousand flaws - including being crude/gross, and judgemental/cranky. Christoff wasn&amp;#39;t pushy, true, but also wasn&amp;#39;t confident pretty much ever. The only real conviction we see from him is that you can&amp;#39;t marry a man you&amp;#39;ve just met. And let&amp;#39;s face it - they make it pretty clear that his only interest in helping at the start is, again, money. He can&amp;#39;t afford what he needs, and the ice/snow from Elsa is going to put a serious dent in his business. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me started on Flynn Ryder, who is a straight-up thief, a compulsive liar, and has zero self-confidence, who has pretty much made up everything about himself because he doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone to know he&amp;#39;s hugely emotionally vulnerable. He has one big heroic moment, but man, for the most part he&amp;#39;s a total jerk to Rapunzel, tries to scare her out of her quest, and as we&amp;#39;ve seen has a long history as a con artist. Not exactly perfection, there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Li Shang&amp;#39;s not exactly smooth, no confidence when it comes to women, doesn&amp;#39;t listen - literally 90% of their problems would have been solved if he&amp;#39;d actually communicated with Mulan like she was a HUMAN BEING and had a DROP of empathy. But he had none. He made snap decisions and never reconsidered them, had zero faith in anyone else, not exactly hitting it out of the park. He tries to do everything himself, has NO idea how to cooperate or work WITH people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you have the HUGE subversion of things with Hans, in Frozen, too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heck, as far ago as Beauty and the Beast, that dude has a vicious temper.

That men don&amp;#39;t have feelings or that a man who expresses his feelings is weak. That all men just want sex. That a man should always &amp;quot;take charge,&amp;quot; and if he&amp;#39;s a more passive type, he&amp;#39;s a wimp. That men can read minds even when you don&amp;#39;t communicate then them, and that if a man is doing something wrong it&amp;#39;s intentional (when you haven&amp;#39;t told him otherwise). Not all women think this way, but a sizeable amount do (including some of my friends) and it&amp;#39;s shocking.
