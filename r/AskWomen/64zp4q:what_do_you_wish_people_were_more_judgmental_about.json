It&amp;#39;s always been odd to me that a general lack of empathy, judgmental attitude, and bullying is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as socially shamed as something that is considered &amp;quot;eccentric but harmless&amp;quot;, such as what someone wears, or someone just appearing &amp;#39;odd&amp;#39; or different in some way. We even judge people who we deem &amp;quot;weak&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dependent&amp;quot; more than we judge the people who scoff at them. Only one person in that situation is actually doing something morally wrong - the scoffers - the people who are &amp;quot;dependent&amp;quot; just have low self esteem (which is another thing we judge for some reason?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to work in a huge office of full-grown adults where I witnessed an extremely shy bloke get publicly humiliated for his anxiety; while a man who pubicly admitted to bullying a former schoolmate until he attempted suicide was the most popular guy around because he was &amp;#39;charming&amp;#39; (I actually thought he came off as sociopathic from day one but apparently others thought he was charming). As far as I am concerned you should not be able to laugh and joke about torturing another human being and still have friends at the end of it. I can&amp;#39;t believe others reduce their standards so much for people just because they&amp;#39;re popular and everyone wants to &amp;quot;fit in&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s always been the biggest thing that bugs me about society. We shit on the little guy and we exalt the monsters, so long as the monsters are &amp;quot;popular&amp;quot;. Not all of us, of course, but I still think this is true as a mass generalisation. It&amp;#39;s one of those things I thought would end after adolescence but so far it seems like it continues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg6mko1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492062701.0, "created_utc": 1492033901.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 76}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zp4q", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zp4q", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zp4q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6syza", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 22, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nikita46", "parent_id": "t1_dg6rpc5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I sooooo agree with you.
