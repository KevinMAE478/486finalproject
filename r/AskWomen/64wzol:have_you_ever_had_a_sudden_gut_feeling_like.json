He always creeped me out after that. He had the creepiest leering eyes all the time. Anyway, five or six years later, he was arrested after being setup by a cop posing as a 14yr old girl in a chat room. It later came out that he had also been molesting his two step daughters, and his best friend&amp;#39;s niece. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg6g6iy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492055692.0, "created_utc": 1492026892.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 35}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6enzq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 29, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sleepisbeauty", "parent_id": "t1_dg69b6o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Couldn't really say.

We had gotten along so well for months and did all the typical staying-up-too-late-with-each-other nonsense and whatnot. I remember thinking we were on the same wavelength and we finished each others' sentences. And I had seen him over Skype (albeit he kept his room dark, clearly on purpose) so I ignored a lot of gut feelings. The second time I went to see him something was very off. I went from arguing with myself over whether or not I was attracted to him, to being anxious to go home. All I wanted to do was leave. I think he sensed something was off. I reassured him until I could safely leave and drive back home (two states away). I broke up with him via text shortly after. I didn't have the courage to tell this person I had done a complete 180 with that the truth was he gave me the creeps. I made the mistake of blaming it on remaining feelings for my ex. He blew up at me for my method of breaking up with him (although he asked me out via text, apparently breaking up with him via text was inappropriate), and how he thought I was different, blah blah blah. He went radio silence for a couple of weeks, but I didn't mind of course. I was relieved and started talking to another guy.  Then he came back thinking he would just wait til I got over my ex.  Nothing I could say after that would he believe. I tried to be nice at first, then I straight up told him in no uncertain terms what I really thought of him but he wasn't having it.\n\nWell, I could retell the whole story of the build up in all of its disgusting detail, but honestly I hate reliving it, even in memories.  So, I'll cut to the chase: he started stalking me. At first it was just in-game (we met through a video game) where he would literally follow my character around.  Which of course, is not breaking any rules.  He didn't try to speak to me, which would have been against the rules, he just followed me. I couldn't go anywhere or play with my friends without him showing up. Then he started posting my pictures online with a link to my facebook, so I would get lots of random messages from strangers. He did it anonymously and through a proxy server. Some websites just removed what I asked them to (but I had to keep proving who I was, and they would never answer my questions, just respond \"this picture has been removed\"), but one website had somebody who genuinely tried to help me. They wanted to ban his username and block his IP but all he had to do was create a new one and use proxy servers and they couldn't do anything.  So I paid a significant (to me at the time) amount of money to transfer my characters in the game to a different server. He created a new character (unbeknownst to me) and joined my guild on the new server and began talking to me.  He didn't give himself away so we talked but something about it seemed off.  The things he said were just a little too perfect, too tailored.  Finally, he gave himself away to the point that I was 100% sure who he was and I had a panic attack.  Reported him, but the mods couldn't do anything because my previous reports had not been taken seriously or documented properly so they, and I quote, \"couldn't prove this wasn't his first offense\".\n\nAt one point months before that, when I had argued with him and told him to fuck off, I mentioned that I was glad I never gave him my address. He informed that I had, I just didn't remember, and he still had it.  I literally had to tell my parents that if they ever saw a grey charger in the driveway, to call the cops.  Luckily I ended up moving 2000+ miles away a few months later and my parents retired and moved 1000+ miles away, too.  He somehow found out the town I live in now but he doesn't have my address so I feel safer, but I still don't use a real picture of myself as my Facebook profile picture and I don't play the game I used to love anymore. \n\n**tl;dr:** Dated a guy, got a bad feeling about him when I met him in person so I broke up with him... he ended up stalking me.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dated a guy I met online for two months.

He blew up at me for my method of breaking up with him (although he asked me out via text, apparently breaking up with him via text was inappropriate), and how he thought I was different, blah blah blah. He went radio silence for a couple of weeks, but I didn&amp;#39;t mind of course. I was relieved and started talking to another guy.  Then he came back thinking he would just wait til I got over my ex.  Nothing I could say after that would he believe. I tried to be nice at first, then I straight up told him in no uncertain terms what I really thought of him but he wasn&amp;#39;t having it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I could retell the whole story of the build up in all of its disgusting detail, but honestly I hate reliving it, even in memories.  So, I&amp;#39;ll cut to the chase: he started stalking me. At first it was just in-game (we met through a video game) where he would literally follow my character around.  Which of course, is not breaking any rules.  He didn&amp;#39;t try to speak to me, which would have been against the rules, he just followed me. I couldn&amp;#39;t go anywhere or play with my friends without him showing up. Then he started posting my pictures online with a link to my facebook, so I would get lots of random messages from strangers. He did it anonymously and through a proxy server. Some websites just removed what I asked them to (but I had to keep proving who I was, and they would never answer my questions, just respond &amp;quot;this picture has been removed&amp;quot;), but one website had somebody who genuinely tried to help me. They wanted to ban his username and block his IP but all he had to do was create a new one and use proxy servers and they couldn&amp;#39;t do anything.  So I paid a significant (to me at the time) amount of money to transfer my characters in the game to a different server. He created a new character (unbeknownst to me) and joined my guild on the new server and began talking to me.  He didn&amp;#39;t give himself away so we talked but something about it seemed off.  The things he said were just a little too perfect, too tailored.  Finally, he gave himself away to the point that I was 100% sure who he was and I had a panic attack.  Reported him, but the mods couldn&amp;#39;t do anything because my previous reports had not been taken seriously or documented properly so they, and I quote, &amp;quot;couldn&amp;#39;t prove this wasn&amp;#39;t his first offense&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point months before that, when I had argued with him and told him to fuck off, I mentioned that I was glad I never gave him my address. He informed that I had, I just didn&amp;#39;t remember, and he still had it.  I literally had to tell my parents that if they ever saw a grey charger in the driveway, to call the cops.  Luckily I ended up moving 2000+ miles away a few months later and my parents retired and moved 1000+ miles away, too.  He somehow found out the town I live in now but he doesn&amp;#39;t have my address so I feel safer, but I still don&amp;#39;t use a real picture of myself as my Facebook profile picture and I don&amp;#39;t play the game I used to love anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; Dated a guy, got a bad feeling about him when I met him in person so I broke up with him... he ended up stalking me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg5s3pg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492028232.0, "created_utc": 1491999432.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 429}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wzol", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wzol", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wzol", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5x5vc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 33, "report_reasons": null, "author": "-Zosia-", "parent_id": "t1_dg5t2sy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hm.

(Pre-Katrina -- anyone from anywhere near the area will wonder.) I'd found a decent hotel on Canal Street and could see that it was six blocks to the French Quarter where my friends were staying. I arrived at the hotel about an hour before checkin, so I was going to just leave my bags with the concierge and check in later. \n\nSo there was this group of what appeared to be college kids, and they had one of those cart thingies and were loading up all their stuff -- doing the same thing I was, leaving their bags with the concierge. It was a pretty large group so I sat down to patiently wait my turn and just people watched. Boy, was that ever a great idea. \n\nAt first, I'm just watching the group of college kids, chuckling to myself because I've done road trips with college buddies and there's always one woman who appoints herself The Organizer\u00ae, so she was making sure everyone had what they needed and they'd appropriated sufficient beers for the next couple hours. So I'm watching this woman Organize All The Things, and my attention wanders off. I spot this guy who looked to me what I thought a Cajun must look like. I observed him for a while; he was just hanging around in the lobby and didn't seem to be with anyone or particularly interested in doing anything like checking in or leaving his bags with concierge. Because he had no bags. Just a dude wandering around the lobby. \n\nIt was raining that day, and by the time I got my bag checked, I realized I'd left my umbrella in the car, which was valet parked. I didn't want to ask for my car to be brought around just to get my umbrella out of it, so I decided to find a Walgreens and pick up another one. \n\nI start walking down Canal St. and just as I was about to duck into the Walgreens a couple blocks away, I spotted Cajun Guy, walking behind me. Hmm... that's weird, I thought. And that's when my Spidey Sense pinged into the red. \n\nI take my time in Walgreens and when I stepped back out on the sidewalk, I took my sweet time opening the umbrella so I could look around a bit more*. Sure enough, there's Cajun Guy hanging out in some doorway to some store just down the block. I walk a few steps to the cross walk, turn and look behind me, and he's there, just a few steps behind me. \n\nI cross Canal St., which has about four lanes plus a trolly track in the middle, so it's pretty wide. I stop at the opposite corner and look back and see Cajun Guy standing there. I make eye contact, point right at him, and then turn and walk on down Canal St. A couple blocks later, I found the street in the French Quarter, and my friends' hotel was only about a block in, and I quickly connected with them and all was well. I told them what happened and they wouldn't let me walk by myself -- they'd hail a cab for me whenever it was time for me to go back to my room. \n\n* I learned this technique from my mom. We were in the Bahamas once and she thought someone was following us, so she told me to stop. She said it pretty forcefully, which is SO not like my mom, so I did and then had to be all \"WTF is going on?\" She instructed me, if anyone is ever following you, they don't want a mark that will fight back. They want an easy target and the easiest targets are people who are completely unaware of their surroundings and haven't noticed WHO is around them. She said to stop and make eye contact so the person following you understands that you have noticed them and can now make a positive ID to the cops, should things go all pear-shaped. I thought she was completely full of shit and was just being paranoid about being followed in the Bahamas until I spotted Cajun Guy following me down Canal Street.

He had many over the next three years. I guess the expectation of death being at his door he (unknowingly to me) decided to cut off contact with me, on my twentieth birthday. He hugged me with tears in his eyes, walked to his truck, stopped short and came back for one final bear squeeze. It was with the best intentions I'm sure. I had a small family of my own I had started and I guess he didn't want to weigh me down with his illness.\n\n   For months I would call and leave messages first asking for him to call me, eventually begging, and finally screaming into his voicemail that it wasn't up to him. If I wanted to deal with the *\"burden\"* he considered himself, he should let me choose. \n\n   He only responded once. Trying to play off everything that I had said, how long it had been. He simply called and said, \"Hey you, I was just wondering if you saw that movie we talked about finally came out on Lifetime. Are you gonna watch it? Man, I am! I love Lifetime movies!\"  I was having none of his distractions. I was hurt. Angry. I said, \"Yeah, I saw. How is your heart?\" His answer, \"Still beating. It's the one where the lady kills her husband on the cruise! Remember? Man I've waited so long to see it!\" I couldn't take it. \n\n   Why wouldn't he just talk to me? Like, really talk to me? He was so different. I just couldn't put my finger on it. I cried the rest of our conversation trying to make him the 'old' him. He said in a monotone voice, listen, I'm dying. This medicine is making me worse. I can't work anymore. I live alone. I had to get rid of my dog after mom left. I'm miserable. But I want you to be happy. He told me the movie would start at 8:00, and we'll be watching together from our own living rooms.\n\n   Months went by, I hadn't heard from him since. So I figured it's not about me. In the face of death, you change. He was trying to protect me, so I needed to try to respect his wishes. My mom and I didn't talk much, when we did she would update me on how he was. Though they had divorced she still took him to the hospital and went to dinner on Friday's.\n\n   I had to adjust. I figured when he was ready, he'd call me, seeing as he wasn't answering again. \n\n   One night I'm out to dinner with my little family and I just get overwhelmingly ill. It was so weird because up until then I was having a great day. We were eating Chinese food! Yum! Then all the sudden, nausea, dizziness and a feeling of doom. The rest of the night was so weird. I lost all my energy. \n\n   The next morning I'm making coffee and determined to have a good day. So I put on some music to start cleaning, I pour myself a cup of coffee and BOOM! I lose my balance. Dizzy again. I nearly drop the coffee, and grab both the counter tops to balance myself. This time all I see is him. My dad. Just flashes, it was like a daydream, but out of the blue.\n\n   I pick up my phone and call, just one more time, maybe the feeling is my brain telling me to call. Or maybe somethings wrong? I'm dialing so fast I mess it up. *Crap.* I start over, shaking now. *Why am I shaking?* It rings once. Twice. And a woman answers. *What? Who the hell?* \"Uh, Hi. I may have the wrong number, is dad's name there?\" She says, \"Oh hi! You must be OhYouLikeThat? Your dad has not stopped talking about you! No honey he's not here. He coded last night and is in the hospital. Your mom didn't tell you? She wont let me see him. She wont let anyone see him. He really loves you sweetheart. He really does, I just want you to know that.\" She gave me the hospital number.\n\n\nI called the hospital and begged to talk to him. That poor man that had to deal with me.. Christ I can't even imagine. He wasn't permitted to tell me anything thanks to my mom. I left a message. I didn't grasp that people don't usually come out of a vegetative state, or what that meant, really. He was so kind, his voice dropped when he heard I was the daughter of this man he wasn't allowed to talk about. I remember gasping for air, I asked, \"Can you just say if he's alive please? Please is he alive?\" His voice was so.. shook. He said \"Yeah honey, he's alive. I'll write what you said. I'll put it on his table okay? Just.. Listen honey if you can just call your mom.. Have her call and okay access to you then call me back, or come see him. But you've got to call your mom.\"\n\n   I called my mom with every intention to give her the benefit of the doubt. It didn't last. It went something like this. \"Why didn't you tell me about Pop? Is he okay? Why didn't you call? What happened? Who is at his house? Why is she telling me you know things? The hospital wont tell me anything!  I need to see him! TELL ME!\" She said, \"I didn't know what to say.. I was going to call after.. I was going to tell everyone eventually, I just hadn't figured it out yet.\" Me \"You were what?! after what? What is going on? Where is he?\" The next thing I know I'm screaming at my mom. I told her to lift this ban she has for visitors or consider our relationship over.\n\nI call the mystery woman back and ask what she knows. That's when she had to tell me what the hell coded means.. My dad attempted suicide two weeks sooner. It landed him in the hospital, my mom opted to resuscitate him. He lived! Then he did it again. But not before changing his paperwork, you see up until this point he had made my mom responsible for all decisions. Until this last incident in the hospital. Imagine his surprise waking up in a hospital when he thought he was going to die. He left her in charge with one change to make his file a DNR. He was now in a vegetative state. His life completely run by machine and less than 24 hours until they unplug everything and let nature happen. \n\n  \n   The story with my mom is an even longer story for another time. I got to see him. Or the shell of him. I talked to him. I don't know if he could hear me. I've watched too many movies and had no life experience in this field. But his hand twitched in mine, his lips quivered as I cried. I told him about my sons, how they had grown.. I don't know, I just wanted to tell him nice things, I thought he would open his eyes to look, or answer if he knew I wouldn't ask anymore questions. I just wanted my dad. \n\nThen it was time to go. My mom took me to a deli for a sandwich. She had this talk with me about not having any expectations to ever see him again. \"I hope you got your goodbyes in.\" She said. She dropped me off and texted me the next morning. \"It's done. His machines are all off.\" 30 minutes later another text. \"He's gone.\"\n\nThe feeling I had experienced the nausea, dizziness, and impending doom. It was at the same time he had coded unbeknownst to me. The flashes of him the waves of emotion. The shaky hands. He had gone into cardiac arrest before I called. He bit through his breathing tube and nearly choked to death. I don't know how my intuition knew, but somehow I knew. \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was a teenager, my dad had a heart attack in the middle of the night.

Me and a friend were walking back to my car (about 3 blocks away since I wanted to free up parking spaces near the clinic for the patients) when a tall older man started speed walking up to us with his phone out. He was taking photos of us. \n\nAs he walked up, he started yelling at us, calling us baby killers, asking if we would enjoy hell, etc. He was walking so closely to me that I could smell his nasty old person stank, so I told him that if he kept following us, I would call the police. He told me to do it, \"I'm on public land, I can walk where I want.\" We had another 2 blocks to my car, and my friend was looking really unnerved, so finally I told him to back the fuck off, and we heel turned and bolted back to the clinic where we asked a security guard to escort us to my car. When the guard walked us to my car, the creepy guy was nowhere to be seen. I gave the guard his description, signed my name on an \"I'm telling the truth\" type deal just in case the guy gets caught, and we went on our merry way. This happened last September-ish.\n\nFast forward to a month or so ago. I'm scrolling FB when I see the creepy guy's photo. Turns out that he was planning on bombing the very clinic I was protesting for THE DAY I WAS THERE.

Me and a friend were walking back to my car (about 3 blocks away since I wanted to free up parking spaces near the clinic for the patients) when a tall older man started speed walking up to us with his phone out. He was taking photos of us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As he walked up, he started yelling at us, calling us baby killers, asking if we would enjoy hell, etc. He was walking so closely to me that I could smell his nasty old person stank, so I told him that if he kept following us, I would call the police. He told me to do it, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m on public land, I can walk where I want.&amp;quot; We had another 2 blocks to my car, and my friend was looking really unnerved, so finally I told him to back the fuck off, and we heel turned and bolted back to the clinic where we asked a security guard to escort us to my car. When the guard walked us to my car, the creepy guy was nowhere to be seen. I gave the guard his description, signed my name on an &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m telling the truth&amp;quot; type deal just in case the guy gets caught, and we went on our merry way.

I noticed the staring thing when we were out having dinner or whatever, but it didn&amp;#39;t raise alarms because I wasn&amp;#39;t interested in him romantically - but as soon as my friends told me how uncomfortable they felt because he&amp;#39;d taken an interest in them more than he should&amp;#39;ve was when I cut the cord. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: he was a creep goodbye &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg5yodx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492037401.0, "created_utc": 1492008601.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 34}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wzol", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wzol", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6map9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 35, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thebloodofthematador", "parent_id": "t1_dg67h6x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And more people need to believe women when they say someone creeps them out.

As I pull up behind him,  I see his head stick out over the line - on a 10+ lane freeway where most slow people go 70+ to check his tire. I get out of my car and yell at him to get his ass back in the car and wait for a tow. Sure enough a tow truck shows up  (they sit and wait, watching cameras, because you are legally required to have your car towed immediately when/if it can move on its own). We waited behind the barracade together and I drove him to the shop after. He asked me why I was there and I told him it was because I knew he was going to stick his neck over the white line. He didn&amp;#39;t question it much. He knows I&amp;#39;m weird. We&amp;#39;re getting married in the next couple months. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg67ssn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492047113.0, "created_utc": 1492018313.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wzol", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6el1a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JWitch90", "parent_id": "t3_64wzol", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah once I was hitchhiking and had a bad feeling about the guy who gave me a ride, despite the fact that he was being nice.
