We weren't outright mean to them, but we weren't nice, if that makes sense. If Sarah had a sleepover at her house, these girls would be invited. But if I had a sleepover at mine, they wouldn't be.

So she'd find a reason to cut them out: Ashley was \"crazy\" and had made up all these lies about a friend of ours, Jessica was being *soooo mean*, didn't you notice how nasty she's been lately?

I think I came to this realization my first semester of college, when I was suffering socially (but for completely unrelated reasons than how I acted in high school), and I thought it was karma for how I had acted. I was very obnoxious and I often went home feeling terrible for how loud and rude I was to people, but I think the people I hung out with encouraged it. I was acquaintances with a group of girls who were athletes, so I guess they were kind of popular. They were very sarcastic and so I think I was obnoxious because I had to defend myself constantly. (I think you could argue I was to some degree bullied by these girls, but I was far from innocent myself.) I feel terrible about how I acted and I wish I had been nicer.\n\nAs for after high school, I noticed multiple people unfriended me on Facebook. I think it bothered me a bit because I wondered exactly what I did and how I acted to have them delete me (I don't ever post anything, so it can't be that). Nowadays, if I ever run into the girls I was acquaintances with, I am always friendly and I always keep the conversation about them. I don't expect anyone to care how I'm doing.\n\nI've actually struggled a lot with finding an identity outside of high school. I don't live my life with regret, but I am genuinely sorry for how I treated a lot of people. The thing is, I don't know exactly what those people remember about me and like I said, it was often a two-way street. I sometimes wonder if my post-high school success is a further insult to those I hurt, considering how everyone always paints the mean people in high school as losers who never succeed in life. I guess the best I can do moving forward is realize my mistakes and don't make them again.\n\nAlso, I thought I should mention my social status. I wasn't even close to popular, but I was pretty well known among athletes as a lot of them were also in advanced classes. I graduated either 2nd or 3rd in my class, so I was known as being pretty advanced. I looked down on people who did nothing but party, and I think I definitely could've been nicer to those kids.", "edited": 1491877085.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t anything close to popular, but I realize in hindsight I was not a very nice person. I think I came to this realization my first semester of college, when I was suffering socially (but for completely unrelated reasons than how I acted in high school), and I thought it was karma for how I had acted. I was very obnoxious and I often went home feeling terrible for how loud and rude I was to people, but I think the people I hung out with encouraged it. I was acquaintances with a group of girls who were athletes, so I guess they were kind of popular. They were very sarcastic and so I think I was obnoxious because I had to defend myself constantly. (I think you could argue I was to some degree bullied by these girls, but I was far from innocent myself.) I feel terrible about how I acted and I wish I had been nicer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for after high school, I noticed multiple people unfriended me on Facebook. I think it bothered me a bit because I wondered exactly what I did and how I acted to have them delete me (I don&amp;#39;t ever post anything, so it can&amp;#39;t be that). Nowadays, if I ever run into the girls I was acquaintances with, I am always friendly and I always keep the conversation about them. I don&amp;#39;t expect anyone to care how I&amp;#39;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve actually struggled a lot with finding an identity outside of high school. I don&amp;#39;t live my life with regret, but I am genuinely sorry for how I treated a lot of people. The thing is, I don&amp;#39;t know exactly what those people remember about me and like I said, it was often a two-way street. I sometimes wonder if my post-high school success is a further insult to those I hurt, considering how everyone always paints the mean people in high school as losers who never succeed in life. I guess the best I can do moving forward is realize my mistakes and don&amp;#39;t make them again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I thought I should mention my social status. I wasn&amp;#39;t even close to popular, but I was pretty well known among athletes as a lot of them were also in advanced classes. I graduated either 2nd or 3rd in my class, so I was known as being pretty advanced.
