And I wasn't very social in the first place but over the 4 years of being in a social sorority, I grew my social awareness, networking skills, and morals. I'm kinda nerdy and always have been- majored in STEM in college, I would limit my partying to just a few nights/month, wasn't the most open but I still found a spot perfectly carved for me. It really helped my studying because in about 50% of my classes (everything but my core classes), I knew someone else and could always go to them with questions/study with them. Another aspect I liked a lot was that we had a chef in our sorority house so I never had to personally pay for meals- it was included in my dues. I knew, no matter how much money I did or didn't have that month, I'd still be able to get 3 healthy meals and 2 snacks every day. Thankfully, my mom paid for my dues so my $10/hr job didn't go towards food really ever. Also, because I majored in STEM, I like to put on my resume that I was in a social sorority because it shows that I am socially apt and a team player, which is not the easiest thing to find in science fields. \n\nWorst part? The drama. There's so much drama, but absolutely not more than any other organization that you spend a lot of time with. I was in marching band and track in high school and it was prettttty much the same level if you negate living together. 55 girls shared a house together and 3-4 girls shared a room so we didn't have that in my high school activities so it was a little bit more drama, just because we literally saw each other 24/7. \n\nHow old?

It was an incredible experience. \n\n- I'm not a person who makes friends or gets super close to people very easily. I would say I have a lot of \"good friends\" who are more like acquaintances. But my sorority gave me two or three of my closest friends I've ever had. Besides being that close to someone, just not having to worry about where to sit in a class or in the caf was always a relief -- I'm naturally shy and introverted, but knowing that there were always people you could sit with was a big comfort during college. And even some of those \"good friends\" that were really only surface friends came through at very, very difficult times for me. \n\nWorst experiences:\n\n- Preparing for recruitment in general. Not that this was innately bad; I'm just not really a social person, and this was basically a month of late nights with 60 other girls, training to do small talk with 100 people going through Rush. Some girls absolutely *lived* for recruitment; I was never one of them. I was thankful that for 2 of the 3 years I was in a sorority, I was unaffiliated (being on Panhellenic at the time of recruitment) and didn't have to prep for recruitment. \n\n- I really hated the politics that could go on behind the scenes. In particular, my junior year, our presidential board of our group really bullied another good friend of mine because she used to date (super briefly) the boyfriend of one of the board chicks. It was ridiculous, and if it had just been perpetrated by petty college chicks, whatever; but one of our advisors was in on it, too, because she was super close to the board chick who was instigating it. Bullying anyone is bad anyway, but this friend was having a really hard time because she'd chosen to go through recruitment as an older student (a junior, I think) and none of them -- including my sorority -- picked her up. So it was just extra salt in the wound. \n\n- My senior year, I was on Panhellenic and unaffiliated for eight months (as opposed to the previous year, when I'd filled a vacancy left by someone suddenly leaving the council, so I was only unaffiliated for about 2 months). It was kind of hard separating myself even partially from my organization, and it really opened my eyes to some of the messed up politics going on behind the scenes. After our spring recruitment, I was affiliated again but really disillusioned. By graduation, I was ready to be rid of everyone and everything. \n\nThe Verdict:\n\n- Joining a sorority was absolutely one of the best decisions I've made in my life. If I had been at a large university, I probably wouldn't have -- in fact, I didn't my freshman year at my small school because I just loathed the idea of being in a sorority -- but my school and the environment we were all in made it a really enriching part of my college experience. Yes, there were some bad experiences, but there were so so so many great ones, too. I'm far enough out of college now for all those negative feelings I had upon graduation to be long gone, and I really appreciate the years I spent with my sisters.

I don't know that there's a limit, other than if you're several years older than all the other women going through recruitment, you just may not have much in common with them.
