We had our first period class together that year, so when I walked in on the first day, I sat behind him. The teacher started going through the syllabus and \"what not to do in an AP class\" or something and came to a slide that said something along the lines of \"Get your girlfriend to do your homework.\" The class laughed a little and he turned around and said to me, \"hey, you got me right?\" We hadn't even gone on our first date yet! I turned super bright red, people noticed. He would say blunt things like that all the time to watch me blush really hard because he thought it was fun.\n\nBefore all of this though, he didn't speak unless he was spoken to and was a really reserved guy. I'm the only person he's ever been with because he never initiated anything with anyone else he liked. Even he's said that he doesn't know where all of that confidence came from with me.
