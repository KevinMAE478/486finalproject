It's Me, Margaret\" is a fantastic book for girls approaching or already beginning puberty. I've raised my daughter Atheist, so she didn't understand why Margaret was speaking to God, but I explained it a bit and she really enjoyed the book. \n\n\n\nTwo other books that really stuck with me are, \"Island of the Blue Dolphins\" and \"Walk Two Moons\". Anything about young girls and coming of age are great for them to read. \n\n\n\nA book I didn't know existed until my sister told me about it is, \"Then Again, Maybe I Won't\". I bought it for my daughter. It's by Judy Blume (same author as \"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret\") but from the boy's perspective of growing up and going through puberty. I think it's good for kids to know what happens with both genders so it's not so mysterious and they can empathize with what they're going through. Puberty is rough for both boys and girls.
