I fairly recently had developed a crush on a FWB. We'd been hooking up off and on for like a year. We got sort of close earlier last year, like texting nearly every day and such. I felt like she was the first person to really get me in a long time. It sounds silly, but she was/is the only person who knew where all the quotes from my tattoos came from. I don't know why that meant anything to me, but it did.\n\nAnyway. I started developing legit feelings for her last summer. But around that time, she wasn't texting me as much anymore. So I asked how she was doing one day, and we caught up, and she mentioned that she started seeing someone. I was bummed out, because I'd kind of been toying with the idea of finally asking her out. I waited it out, but a couple of months ago, I saw on her Snapchat that she'd moved in with her GF. That was the, \"Oh, so it's srs\" moment.\n\nI deleted her from social media, just because I didn't see the point of following her adventures with her GF.

I fairly recently had developed a crush on a FWB. We&amp;#39;d been hooking up off and on for like a year. We got sort of close earlier last year, like texting nearly every day and such. I felt like she was the first person to really get me in a long time. It sounds silly, but she was/is the only person who knew where all the quotes from my tattoos came from. I don&amp;#39;t know why that meant anything to me, but it did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I started developing legit feelings for her last summer. But around that time, she wasn&amp;#39;t texting me as much anymore. So I asked how she was doing one day, and we caught up, and she mentioned that she started seeing someone. I was bummed out, because I&amp;#39;d kind of been toying with the idea of finally asking her out. I waited it out, but a couple of months ago, I saw on her Snapchat that she&amp;#39;d moved in with her GF. That was the, &amp;quot;Oh, so it&amp;#39;s srs&amp;quot; moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I deleted her from social media, just because I didn&amp;#39;t see the point of following her adventures with her GF.

We texted for a few weeks, since he was from out of town, and when he made it to town we went out on a date. I fell hard right away. \n\nWe went on 3 dates (a total of 6 days since each was a sleepover) in the two weeks he was in town and then he went back to Colorado. About a month after he left, he told me her got back together with his ex fianc\u00e9. I was sad, but I understood. I was still in a place where I would have gotten back with mine and our engagements falling apart was something we bonded over. Then I went to Europe for 3 months. He called me on Memorial Day having a break down, he's a vet and has a hard time sometimes, and I stayed on the phone with him for nearly 6 hours. Two days later he called and asked if we could talk about what things would be like if we were together considering how different we are (me being the \"rich girl from the suburbs\" in law school and him living right on the poverty line with two kids from two different woman and who was homeless as a teen). The conversation ended, I feel asleep, and was woken up by a text at like 5am saying he left his fianc\u00e9 to \"explore what's between us.\" \n\nWe did a complicated long distance thing and never gave a title to our relationship. He has a drinking problem and one night during a fight I realized that most of the really good moments in our relationship (deep conversations or conversations about our future) happened while he was blacked out and he had no recollection of them. \n\nHe slept with someone, I forgave him, he broke up with me a few days later. A week later he called drunk and crying saying he never meant to break up with me. I took him back. I went to visit. \n\nWe spent 5 days together and it was amazing. It was like an escape from reality. There was a lot of drinking involved. I told him I loved him, and just like I knew would happen, he said that he couldn't say it back but he cared about me very much. The next day we agreed to chalk it up to me being drunk and pretend it didn't happen. \n\nA few weeks after I got back, his sister (who's kind of a career mentor for me since she's a lawyer and in her words \"women lawyers need to stick together) tells me he told her he didn't need a plus one to her wedding, which I assumed I was going to. She sent me some screenshots of him telling her he wasn't seeing anyone and that he wasn't in a place where he could be in a relationship, that his daughter is the only person he wants to focus on (which I can respect). I didn't tell him I knew all of that, because I don't want to cause family drama, but I told him I could no longer move across the country for him after I graduated, but that I still wanted us to be us, even if we aren't really together anymore. Things got weird after that. He got very distant. \n\nI met someone else, told him about it. He pretty much just said good luck. That guy screwed me over, I called him crying and we spoke for hours. He told me he thought I was mad at him and that's why he had been weird. \n\nAnd now we are friends and I'm happy about us being friends. Maybe one day things will be different, but as of now, I'm just happy he is in my life. If anything, he pulled me out of a bad place. When we met I was in a really dark place and he helped me find myself. \n\nSo I guess I got over it by realizing that even if we aren't together, he still made an important and positive impact on my life.

So here it goes...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We met on a dating app 3 months after my engagement to another man ended (7 year relationship starting when I was 18, so you can imagine my mental state when I met this guy). We texted for a few weeks, since he was from out of town, and when he made it to town we went out on a date. I fell hard right away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We went on 3 dates (a total of 6 days since each was a sleepover) in the two weeks he was in town and then he went back to Colorado. About a month after he left, he told me her got back together with his ex fianc\u00e9. I was sad, but I understood. I was still in a place where I would have gotten back with mine and our engagements falling apart was something we bonded over. Then I went to Europe for 3 months. He called me on Memorial Day having a break down, he&amp;#39;s a vet and has a hard time sometimes, and I stayed on the phone with him for nearly 6 hours. Two days later he called and asked if we could talk about what things would be like if we were together considering how different we are (me being the &amp;quot;rich girl from the suburbs&amp;quot; in law school and him living right on the poverty line with two kids from two different woman and who was homeless as a teen). The conversation ended, I feel asleep, and was woken up by a text at like 5am saying he left his fianc\u00e9 to &amp;quot;explore what&amp;#39;s between us.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We did a complicated long distance thing and never gave a title to our relationship. He has a drinking problem and one night during a fight I realized that most of the really good moments in our relationship (deep conversations or conversations about our future) happened while he was blacked out and he had no recollection of them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He slept with someone, I forgave him, he broke up with me a few days later. A week later he called drunk and crying saying he never meant to break up with me. I took him back. I went to visit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We spent 5 days together and it was amazing.

We were friends for several years, my life was/is in chaos. Had no job. Recently lost a friend to leukemia back in November. Anyway, I have to say in that whole situation he told me he loved me. I told him I loved him, but the issue was at hand we were in different states, and I couldn't do anything at the time to move to be with him. He wanted me to move, and move in with him. We weren't even a couple mind you, but we definitely or at least I had assumed loved each other. He started going out with girls on Tinder I accepted it, cause I wasn't his girlfriend, I mean what could I do about it? \n\nAfter a while in October, he apparently meets someone doesn't even tell me about the whole situation, is being completely discreet. Nothing ever really about it. I asked him is he still interested in me? He said he wasn't answering that. I said why? I thought man I deserved to know we were friends or at least I thought we were. I had thought about it, later on I sent him a message that I thought we shouldn't speak anymore without reason. It lasted maybe 2 weeks then I messaged him that I was sorry for cutting him off without at least telling him why. I told him, I thought he was being a bad friend, which he was. Sigh.\n\nHe gets in a relationship in December. I texted him maybe 2-3 days later saying I didn't know where our \"friendship\" was heading in the future, and didn't want to speak for a while. Truth was I can't watch him be in another relationship with someone else. It was too difficult. He begged me to not stop being friends with him. I didn't wish him a merry Christmas, he randomly sent me a '&lt;3' at one day in January at 3 am. I sent him a happy birthday text. \n\nHe messages me last month saying he missed talking to me. I was pretty cold towards him, told him I missed talking to him as well. I'd text him when I got some time. Around 2 weeks after that...I messaged him my new number. He hasn't texted me since, and I just don't feel the need to do so. I feel if he wants something genuine with me friendship or other. He knows how to reach me.\n\nIt's interesting though after he got in a relationship. I got a really great job, and making a great amount for myself each month. I wonder if I had gotten that job sooner, would things had been different for us?\n\nWhile I'm not over him and possibly do believe at some point down the road maybe things will happen for him and myself. Something that did help was putting myself into my work. It's distracting, and I would rarely think about it. I mean I got deadlines ain't got time to worry about someone in another state, when my job/check is on the line.\n\nAnother thing that helped was a really good friend of mine putting a perspective in things. She knew about the situation about him and myself, she gave some open honest advice. She felt that he was using me as a back up plan. It took me a while to see what she meant, but I get it now, and I can honestly see that.

Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gets in a relationship in December. I texted him maybe 2-3 days later saying I didn&amp;#39;t know where our &amp;quot;friendship&amp;quot; was heading in the future, and didn&amp;#39;t want to speak for a while. Truth was I can&amp;#39;t watch him be in another relationship with someone else. It was too difficult. He begged me to not stop being friends with him. I didn&amp;#39;t wish him a merry Christmas, he randomly sent me a &amp;#39;&amp;lt;3&amp;#39; at one day in January at 3 am. I sent him a happy birthday text. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He messages me last month saying he missed talking to me. I was pretty cold towards him, told him I missed talking to him as well. I&amp;#39;d text him when I got some time. Around 2 weeks after that...I messaged him my new number. He hasn&amp;#39;t texted me since, and I just don&amp;#39;t feel the need to do so. I feel if he wants something genuine with me friendship or other. He knows how to reach me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interesting though after he got in a relationship. I got a really great job, and making a great amount for myself each month. I wonder if I had gotten that job sooner, would things had been different for us?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m not over him and possibly do believe at some point down the road maybe things will happen for him and myself. Something that did help was putting myself into my work. It&amp;#39;s distracting, and I would rarely think about it. I mean I got deadlines ain&amp;#39;t got time to worry about someone in another state, when my job/check is on the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing that helped was a really good friend of mine putting a perspective in things. She knew about the situation about him and myself, she gave some open honest advice. She felt that he was using me as a back up plan. It took me a while to see what she meant, but I get it now, and I can honestly see that. Whenever I think of that, it just pushes him further from my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the rambling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dgbsmom", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492354278.0, "created_utc": 1492325478.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
