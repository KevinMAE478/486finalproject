When she left my father I allowed her to stay in my home for almost a year. I tried to get a conversation going about the abuse, but her eyes glazed over and she never said a word. After she left she told my brother and sister in law that I was crazy. She found out that I talked to them about the abuse and she tried to invalidate me even to my brother, who had witnessed her abuse towards me. Thankfully people have been very supportive and understanding when I tell them that I no longer have my parents in my life due to abuse. I reached out to two of my aunts for female support and was pleasantly surprised when they were nothing but supportive. They have never tried to get me to reconcile with my mother. I really don't know anyone in real life that is in the same situation as I am with my parents. Abuse is a hard thing to talk about. My life is good now. I have  struggled many years, but going to therapy is helping me through the process of grieving for the parents I never had, but definitely deserved. My boyfriend is also very supportive and has said that he never would have allowed my mother to stay with us last year if I had told him some of the things she did to me. He is protective. It's nice having someone that has your back. My boyfriend's mom has been very understanding and has never questioned my sincerity. She asked about my mother once, but after I told her that I was abused, she never brought her up again. I have a child who I love so much. I know that the cycle of violence and abuse can be stopped, because it stopped with me. I have never even spanked my child. Talking to him always worked. I could never bring myself to treat my son the way my parents treated me. I think that at some point I will stop grieving the fact that I never had good parents. I have been NC with my mom for a year, and it has already gotten easier to live with. I feel less guilt about it everyday. I do still feel a twinge of jealousy when I see a mom and daughter having a good time together, but I have been very lucky in that my friend's moms have always filled that role in some capacity, even when I was a kid.\n\nEdit: A sentence.
