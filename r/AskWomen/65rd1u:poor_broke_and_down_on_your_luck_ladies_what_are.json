That&amp;#39;s how it goes for most people my age. I know two girls who own condos and they both act like everyone who doesn&amp;#39;t is an idiot for not buying, as the costs just keep climbing. Twist, neither of them paid for them, their parents did. Ugh, stop. I don&amp;#39;t even &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to live in a condo if I could afford it! Or people who are saving up to buy one way out in the suburbs - sorry, I don&amp;#39;t want to have to travel an hour plus to work every day. Yes, I guess I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;throwing away&amp;quot; money on rent, but that&amp;#39;s a decision I&amp;#39;ve made because the alternatives are entirely unappealing to me. There&amp;#39;s a general &amp;quot;just save up and buy a home&amp;quot; attitude on Reddit too sometimes and like...

I get why a \u20ac50 chair sounds like a lot when you know I don't have money, but please consider that I need this chair because I literally can't move if I sit too long in a different one. I don't want to spend money on crap like that. Or, another reason, because I try to make ends meet somehow. I paint once in a while, to get my mind off of things and to maybe even sell it, so I need supplies for that. (I buy the cheapest once I can find.) I do some voice acting, which gives me a little cash once in a while, so I need a microphone and a computer. (And both are cheap, and my laptop is almost over and done with, which really sucks since I need it but I can't afford a new one.) I try to do things whenever I physically can, just to earn money.

No one can go a year without a holiday!\" or \"Why don't you travel outside the country more often? You need to do that, because experience!\".

What if your washing machine breaks? You need savings!\" I know, we all do. But, once again, food is more important. I'd rather be fed than have a washing machine.\n\nWhen your bank account holds more money than mine, don't judge me. Especially when you have a stable job, your health, and all the opportunities you can find.\n\nI don't want to throw a pity party, I hate that, but this thread just makes me think a lot and being broke sucks. I didn't choose to get sick, I worked my ass off for my diplomas and it broke me, friends with way more money took advantage of my hospitality, and my dad still owes me at least \u20ac30,000. I didn't choose for this situation but I'm making the best out of it. Yeah, it's not much to anyone else, but at least I have food, a roof over my head and people I love dearly.

I&amp;#39;ve been looking into everything you can imagine. I can&amp;#39;t, I hate it, I feel like a burden to everyone and everything. I don&amp;#39;t want this at all, I wasn&amp;#39;t raised to do nothing. Thanks for making me feel worse about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why are you spending money on that when you &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; you don&amp;#39;t have any?&amp;quot; Oh, so many reasons. Because I need it to make my life more comfortable so that I&amp;#39;m not in pain constantly. I get why a \u20ac50 chair sounds like a lot when you know I don&amp;#39;t have money, but please consider that I need this chair because I literally can&amp;#39;t move if I sit too long in a different one. I don&amp;#39;t want to spend money on crap like that. Or, another reason, because I try to make ends meet somehow. I paint once in a while, to get my mind off of things and to maybe even sell it, so I need supplies for that. (I buy the cheapest once I can find.) I do some voice acting, which gives me a little cash once in a while, so I need a microphone and a computer. (And both are cheap, and my laptop is almost over and done with, which really sucks since I need it but I can&amp;#39;t afford a new one.) I try to do things whenever I physically can, just to earn money. And for a third reason: maybe because I want to make my shitty life feel a little more bearable once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ugh, my last vacation was last year, I really need one! No one can go a year without a holiday!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t you travel outside the country more often? You need to do that, because experience!&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve been to four different countries on four holidays.. in my life. You can do without them when food is more important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You need to save some money, what if something happens in the future? What if your washing machine breaks? You need savings!&amp;quot; I know, we all do. But, once again, food is more important. I&amp;#39;d rather be fed than have a washing machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When your bank account holds more money than mine, don&amp;#39;t judge me. Especially when you have a stable job, your health, and all the opportunities you can find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to throw a pity party, I hate that, but this thread just makes me think a lot and being broke sucks. I didn&amp;#39;t choose to get sick, I worked my ass off for my diplomas and it broke me, friends with way more money took advantage of my hospitality, and my dad still owes me at least \u20ac30,000. I didn&amp;#39;t choose for this situation but I&amp;#39;m making the best out of it. Yeah, it&amp;#39;s not much to anyone else, but at least I have food, a roof over my head and people I love dearly. I do my best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m actually pretty fucking proud of myself most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To all the lesser fortunate people here: I hope it all works out. Stay strong, you can do this.
