If she acted in a manner which was objectively positive and worthy of respect, chances are he&amp;#39;s going to be a great guy to date (for example, the guy I briefly dated who was raised by a blind mother). If she acted in a way that betrayed a kid&amp;#39;s trust, let him down a lot, and so on, I will never be able to make up for all her sins and sadly that is probably what, on some level, he&amp;#39;s going to expect me to do.
