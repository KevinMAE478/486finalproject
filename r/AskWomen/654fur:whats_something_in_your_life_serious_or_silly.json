I think it comes down to two things that are kind of making sense. \n\n1. Physical drive/instinct. I think a lot of people have that, which is why people make jokes about women and their maternal clock. I've seen it happen to women around me my whole life. Swinging from \"NO, NEVER! EWW!\" to \"Ohhh, look at the sweet little baby,\" with tears in their eyes as they stare down their SO or nearest male. It makes sense though, I think most living things have drive to breed or have sex. When I think of octopuses having babies I get sad, because in the ecology classes I took in college you learn that when an organism has a baby it starts kind of dying for it. An octopus is a great example, the Giant Pacific Octopus lays eggs and then spends the remainder of it's life not eating, taking care of itself or resting, but cleaning the eggs and protecting them. As soon as they begin to hatch the octopus dies. It is FUCKING sad, but not unheard of in nature. So when you see your friends losing sleep and tormenting themselves and saying, \"It's sooooo worth it, its the best thing I've ever done.\" It's instinct and drive. Their brain releases chemicals to make them feel that way, even if it really is harming them. If the brain doesn't release those chemicals you end up abandoning your kids or hating every waking second of it. I've been in the room while people gave birth and you can almost sense the love drugs flowing around during the process. People get high on babies. Obviously not all of us, which is why the people who don't get it, REALLY don't get it. \n\n2. Raised around children, or in a community that were really into child rearing. A lot of people I know who love kids had younger siblings they helped raise, or with cousins that were younger.

I think it comes down to two things that are kind of making sense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical drive/instinct. I think a lot of people have that, which is why people make jokes about women and their maternal clock. I&amp;#39;ve seen it happen to women around me my whole life. Swinging from &amp;quot;NO, NEVER! EWW!&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Ohhh, look at the sweet little baby,&amp;quot; with tears in their eyes as they stare down their SO or nearest male. It makes sense though, I think most living things have drive to breed or have sex. When I think of octopuses having babies I get sad, because in the ecology classes I took in college you learn that when an organism has a baby it starts kind of dying for it. An octopus is a great example, the Giant Pacific Octopus lays eggs and then spends the remainder of it&amp;#39;s life not eating, taking care of itself or resting, but cleaning the eggs and protecting them. As soon as they begin to hatch the octopus dies. It is FUCKING sad, but not unheard of in nature. So when you see your friends losing sleep and tormenting themselves and saying, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s sooooo worth it, its the best thing I&amp;#39;ve ever done.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s instinct and drive. Their brain releases chemicals to make them feel that way, even if it really is harming them. If the brain doesn&amp;#39;t release those chemicals you end up abandoning your kids or hating every waking second of it. I&amp;#39;ve been in the room while people gave birth and you can almost sense the love drugs flowing around during the process. People get high on babies. Obviously not all of us, which is why the people who don&amp;#39;t get it, REALLY don&amp;#39;t get it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raised around children, or in a community that were really into child rearing. A lot of people I know who love kids had younger siblings they helped raise, or with cousins that were younger. Or babysat at younger ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg7mtcw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123233.0, "created_utc": 1492094433.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654fur", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7qnx9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ohokmmhmm", "parent_id": "t1_dg7e16e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What I find most interesting is that people say that having kids is self-serving, but having kids sounds awful!!
