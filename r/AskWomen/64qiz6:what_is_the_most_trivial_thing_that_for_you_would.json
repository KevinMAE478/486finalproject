Stand.  Whistling.  Drives me up the wall, nails on chalkboard, I swear I can hear if someone&amp;#39;s doing it across the street from me and it grates.  And I know it&amp;#39;s an irrational thing to feel that much hatred for, but I&amp;#39;ve tried exposing myself to it to get over it and all that does is make me fractious and hyper-aware and brings out all my little tics that make my mental health issues a bit more obvious than I&amp;#39;d like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I don&amp;#39;t pursue or maintain friendships with people who whistle.  I&amp;#39;ve noticed people tend to be either happy-whistlers or not, and whistlers tend to skew older, so fortunately I&amp;#39;m not blocking myself from a large number of peers by doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;d be hard pressed to think of anything more trivial I could possibly de-friend someone for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg4udgl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491970269.0, "created_utc": 1491941469.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qiz6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qiz6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qiz6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qiz6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qiz6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qiz6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qiz6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qiz6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4mnx2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "todayonbloopers", "parent_id": "t1_dg4jnti", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "well, shit.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;well, shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg4mnx2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491961919.0, "created_utc": 1491933119.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4jnti", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg4ht53", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg4jnti", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491958640.0, "created_utc": 1491929840.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ht53", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "todayonbloopers", "parent_id": "t1_dg4fv8n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "what was the ''lie'' version? i'm fascinated. at what point did she confess?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;what was the &amp;#39;&amp;#39;lie&amp;#39;&amp;#39; version? i&amp;#39;m fascinated. at what point did she confess?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg4ht53", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491956618.0, "created_utc": 1491927818.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qiz6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg61rbo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tanglible_Dream", "parent_id": "t1_dg4fv8n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hard to say.
