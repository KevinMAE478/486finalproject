I was so set on following the instructions on the box I didn't realise there were instructions on the individual packets within the box. I had made the jelly and sponge bottom, then proceeded to the middle layer of custard. I have never made custard before but I knew in trifle it should have set in the time I had left it in the fridge. As I was running out of setting time before my mum came home, I made the final toping and put it on top, thinking the custard will eventually set with this on top. Advancing 7 hours, my mum came home excited for the trifle I had prepared, she went to take a scoop and again the custard layer had still not set, I was baffled as to why it was as liquidated as a chicken stock. My mum asked me the exact steps I took to make the 'very easy rifle mix' and after going through the whole process did I realise that to make custard you actually have to boil it and not just mix it up and stick it in.

I was so set on following the instructions on the box I didn&amp;#39;t realise there were instructions on the individual packets within the box. I had made the jelly and sponge bottom, then proceeded to the middle layer of custard. I have never made custard before but I knew in trifle it should have set in the time I had left it in the fridge. As I was running out of setting time before my mum came home, I made the final toping and put it on top, thinking the custard will eventually set with this on top.
