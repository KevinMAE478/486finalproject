I can answer this one. It's long, but there's a reason for it.\n\nIn 2010 I woke up, couldn't walk on my leg, and discovered a small lump in the back of my right thigh. The pain got worse, until I could barely walk on it. For 3 years, doctors kept telling me I was being a hypochondriac and there was nothing wrong with my leg (despite the large bump, yes), it's a spasming muscle, etc. Finally, I went to a new doctor who, after just seeing the lump, sent me for advanced testing and they discovered a tumour happily growing around my sciatic nerve. I had to endure 3 different biopsies while the surgeons were trying to figure out how to fix this, if it was cancerous, etc. Because if how it was growing, there was a distinct possibility that I could lose mobility and feeling in my leg completely. The second last biopsy made me pass out from pain - did I mention it was around my sciatic nerve? NO pain medication helped. My cupboard was an opiate addict's dream with pills that didn't even dull the pain a little. It took 4 years from me waking up with this lump to having it removed.\n\nANYWAY, about 6 months before the op while I was crying every day because of how much pain I was in, a lovely lady (who gives people spiritual mushroom journeys in my town) sent along some marijuana for me to smoke, and then some baked in to cookies to try to help with the pain. After the hundredth pill I used that I discovered I was allergic to (amitriptyline, wtf), I sucked it up and used the weed. I smoked it in a bong, and that night for the first night in almost 3 years I was able to sleep comfortably. I wasn't in tears from pain. I smoked every damned day, and was stoned most of the time until I had to prepare for my operation. I couldn't work because I couldn't walk. I could barely use the toilet by myself. The only time I had major pain was my last biopsy, and when I wasn't chronically smoking.\n\nAfter the op I didn't need any pain medication whatsoever, not even in the recovery room (they somehow forgot to give me morphine, which I then declined because I didnt have pain). Apparently the pain the tumour caused was worse than having a 30cm cut and a giant hole cut out of my muscle.\n\nI DID get withdrawal when I stopped smoking suddenly, but if I had to do it again, I wouldn't change a thing except start smoking earlier in my diagnostics. I had serious mood and depression issues after the op, but my therapist thought that might have been because of the \"trauma\" of the op, and not the withdrawal from weed. I think it was a bit of both. I also tried to use it to dull the pain of the nerves regrowing back, but even though it did help a tiny bit, it didnt work as well for that.\n\nI mainly smoked a hybrid, mostly indica though, but sativa worked well too.\n\nAnyways. I now understand why people who have chronic pain and are using opiates to manage it get hooked on it. You'll do anything to make the pain go away for just a little bit. Luckily for me, I didn't get addicted to opiates and just weed, which was easy enough to quite on my own. I still do smoke (it's just become legal in my country), but nowhere near as much as I did when I had my tumour.

[Indica](https://www.leafly.com/explore/category-indica) vs [Sativa](https://www.leafly.com/explore/category-sativa) strains) but you should expect red eyes, lowered blood pressure, dryness of the throat and mouth (cotton mouth), raised desires and pleasures in libido and appetite, and stronger emotional responses amid other affects. Marijuana has essentially no aftershock effects such as hangovers or anything.\n\nAfter sustained use and varying on your frequency of usage you will start to notice yellowing of the teeth, forgetfulness of small details, more dryness of the mouth, increased spending on cannabis related products (usually to discover personal preferences) and hoarseness of your voice.

Smoke inhalation helps provide irritation and debris to your vocal cords making it easier to form permanent nodes that cause the voice to lose strength and smoothness when singing.\n\n\nJoints are very harsh and hot but can be smoked.

Unfortunately vaporizers are expensive to purchase and hard to conduct research on.  I recommend purchasing a vape pen or bubbler that is small and easy to conceal if you are concerned with storing it out of sight.
