I was addicted to heroin 9 months ago, and addiction has got to be one of the toughest mental illnesses to fight that I know of. It seemed impossible to choose not to walk out the door, bike each block one at a time to my dealer&amp;#39;s place, and buy smack from him. Each step I took towards his house was a decision I made, where I had the choice to walk away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also had trouble with drinking, and found there were smaller decisions that were easier to make that prevented me from having to deal with the more difficult choice of whether I got off my bike to walk in the liquor store or not (ex. choosing a different route to bike home which avoided it). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully some of this translates to your situation, as I&amp;#39;m sure you can make decisions and reign back control into your life, and that you will do it because you can. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg5xgv2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492035998.0, "created_utc": 1492007198.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5i52p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "blushinggloom", "parent_id": "t3_64vi1v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My mental illness slowly killing me from the inside.\nThere's nothing worse than watching yourself crumble in front of your own eyes and the only thing you can do is sit and observe.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mental illness slowly killing me from the inside.\nThere&amp;#39;s nothing worse than watching yourself crumble in front of your own eyes and the only thing you can do is sit and observe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg5i52p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492002377.0, "created_utc": 1491973577.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vi1v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vi1v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vi1v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vi1v", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ekhk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "waddlinmabel", "parent_id": "t1_dg5qpg9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would split- no job is worth you being miserable.
