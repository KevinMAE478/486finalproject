I work as a supporter/comms/fundraising strategy specialist for a charity in north London.\n\nIt's mostly because, back in Melbourne, I was volunteering and working as a fundraising/relationship management specialist alongside finishing my degree. I had a really strong interest in international development at the time, and the job was kind of a natural progression from that, given that I already had experience in the third sector.\n\nIt's not what I wanted to do because it doesn't have a lot to do with my postgrad, and additionally, it's not a direct-impact charity - I'm not improving anyone's lives by doing this work, whether it's building wells or setting up scolarship funds for schools. As a development professional, impact is usually a really big motivational driver for our work, and I don't have that anymore.\n\nI think that's why, even though I'm happy, I still wonder if I fulfilled my goals when I came here. I'm starting to learn to let go of the idea that I might ever work in diplomacy or security, or at least learn not to define my happiness by it - international relations is at once a difficult and an easy major, because it's well-respected and opens doors, but it's also difficult to get a job that's directly related to national security or policy when you're in a country that's not your own. I've got a few job interviews and tests lined up for if and when I get home, with some major Australian government agencies, so it's not like it's the end of the road for me, but I'm keeping my options open.\n\nSo I'm currently balancing my desire to stay for my partner, and going home, where I have a better chance of breaking into the public sector. I'm a natural problem solver, and career-wise, I'm obsessed with how to track and measure progress, assess performance, improve processes, and develop stronger strategy for success. Those are things that charities recognise they need to do but have neither the money nor the will to prioritise. So after doing some soul-searching and chatting to people in different sectors, I've decided that consulting seems like the way forward for now. Maybe once I'm there I can wrangle my way back to policy and security consulting in the private sector.\n\nHaving said all this, I'm still really young and new to the working world. I finished my masters degree at 23, volunteered and worked dead end jobs until I was 24, moved overseas and finally scored a career job at 25. I really haven't don't much with my life yet and don't have a wealth of wisdom to share - the only thing I've learnt is to hold on to my faith that it'll work out and keep putting one foot in front of the other - but I do hope this all helps!

I just never was quite like everyone else on my family and it allowed me to grow up on a culture that is a bit easier to be different as Los Angeles is a pretty diverse place. I&amp;#39;ve gone to visit the homeland and just could not imagine myself staying if I was raised there til adulthood. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took it further as an adult and moved around to different cities every year. I think this is healthy. You get to learn about the different ways cities are unique and either you find one you fit better or realize where you grew up might be where you belong. Theres job industries that is more abundant elsewhere than home. Either way I think as a young adult before you have any responsibility or things holding you back, it&amp;#39;s good to travel, move around, take that foreign exchange program, etc.  You&amp;#39;ll learn about people, you&amp;#39;ll learn about yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am happy where I landed, in Las Vegas...I learned living in the East Coast is not for me.
