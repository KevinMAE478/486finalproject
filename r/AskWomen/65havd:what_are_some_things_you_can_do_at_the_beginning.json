I could tell he was being genuine.  We'd had issues in the past with him \"smothering\" me. Now, if I ever feel like I need some time to myself, I can just say that, and he listens. Communication is kept open, and he finally stopped taking my need for alone time as a personal slight against him. \n\nNot sure if a similar statement would apply in your situation, but respecting her space and autonomy is important. Some of my relationships in the past failed because I felt like the guy was trying to \"own\" me, but my current SO really recognizes me as my own person, which is super attractive. \n\nAt the same time, I feel like a lot of guys interpret this as a hands-off approach to jealously, and I'd say most women prefer mild to moderate (though not violently extreme) jealously.  If another guy is interested in her and you express zero concern, then it just seems like you're not invested and don't care about the future of your relationship.  Respect her as an individual, but also express your care and devotion and interest in the two of you being together long term (not her being with other dudes). \n\nAbove all, try to listen to her in an *active* way.

I could tell he was being genuine.  We&amp;#39;d had issues in the past with him &amp;quot;smothering&amp;quot; me. Now, if I ever feel like I need some time to myself, I can just say that, and he listens. Communication is kept open, and he finally stopped taking my need for alone time as a personal slight against him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure if a similar statement would apply in your situation, but respecting her space and autonomy is important. Some of my relationships in the past failed because I felt like the guy was trying to &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; me, but my current SO really recognizes me as my own person, which is super attractive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I feel like a lot of guys interpret this as a hands-off approach to jealously, and I&amp;#39;d say most women prefer mild to moderate (though not violently extreme) jealously.
