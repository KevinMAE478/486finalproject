People are always shocked that I speak English fluently, without any traces of a Chinese accent. I was born and raised in NYC, but people insist that I wasn&amp;#39;t. When I reiterate that I am definitely from here, they&amp;#39;re always shocked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When applying for colleges, I was turned down by several excellent schools, despite being valedictorian, scoring near perfect on the SATs, having many desired extracurriculars, leadership roles, and maintaining a perfect GPA. Many of my acquaintances, also Asians, were turned down with impressive  backgrounds, too. People of non-asian ethnicities with less stellar accomplishments got accepted. I had a ton of financial hardships growing up and maintained all my activities in a poor income neighborhood and a school with extremely low graduation rates. This was not enough for me to be accepted to the schools I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, as a nurse, I get patients that speak to me by saying, &amp;quot;ching chong.&amp;quot; Co-workers always run to me to tell me to &amp;quot;speak to this patient in Chinese.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve also had patients and their family members insult me because of wait times in the emergency room. I get called chink several times a week. I&amp;#39;m so over it all. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dge38kk", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492490607.0, "created_utc": 1492461807.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vweo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge4whj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "alison-is_a_mermaid", "parent_id": "t3_65vweo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hahaha I work in finance......Make of that what you will.
