It&amp;#39;s openly fine, and even &amp;quot;understandable&amp;quot; for a man to complain that his wife is having a daughter. &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/VrAcV2ywnqc\"&gt;Exhibit fucking-A on the dad&amp;#39;s reaction&lt;/a&gt;. The little boy&amp;#39;s reaction is understandable, because, you know, he&amp;#39;s just a little kid and doesn&amp;#39;t understand (also little kids of his age often tend to relate better to other kids of the same gender). The dad&amp;#39;s actions, however, (especially because they were captured on camera and his daughter will one day see that her dad is &amp;quot;disappointed&amp;quot; for her not being born a boy) are completely sexist and inexcusable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then you have &lt;a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/9b/3d/e7/9b3de784e4d934f4863c82676fcb8c39.png\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; stupid tropes&lt;/a&gt;, that are shared around as &amp;quot;sooooooo hilarious&amp;quot; by women on Pinterest. Yes, men think these are hilarious &amp;quot;jokes&amp;quot;, too, but the Pinterest crowd is predominantly women. Women share shit like this all the time and they think it&amp;#39;s just priceless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, the whole thing is just another example of internalized misogyny. People think that women cannot be sexist against women, however this is very far from the truth.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: link didn&amp;#39;t work&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dg9514t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492206140.0, "created_utc": 1492177340.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8n34p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Elizabethanne0321", "parent_id": "t3_65875p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There's a hashtag trend on insta, #boymom (and so many iterations of it) that has 2.2 million pictures.
