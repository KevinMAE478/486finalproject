I have three and while the other two are young (5 years, and a puppy) I want them to understand that the oldest isn&amp;#39;t going to be around much longer. I&amp;#39;m so afraid for how it&amp;#39;s going to affect them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also really want to have a serious conversation with the puppy. She needs to know how thankful I am for bringing him back to life, so to speak. Before we got her, all he would do is lay around all day. Now he still lays around quite a bit, but he&amp;#39;s old, and deaf, and blind. So I mean, I understand. But he plays with her, he loves her. He acts like a puppy sometimes in so many ways. Plays with her toys, plays tug of war with her. He hadn&amp;#39;t played with my other dog in at least a year, then we got the puppy and something in him changed and I&amp;#39;m so thankful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I also want to tell her that she needs to lay off a bit. She can&amp;#39;t be so rough with him. Playing is fine, but she needs to lay off around his neck, he can&amp;#39;t breathe when she does that, and it&amp;#39;s only going to get harder. She needs to give him space and stop playing when he starts coughing and stuff, or when he needs a break. She also needs to stop eating his food and getting jealous that he gets different food than she does. She also needs to lay off the other dog and understand that they both care about him in the same way, she doesn&amp;#39;t need to get jealous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the other dog, I would tell her she needs to lay off the old man a bit too. She needs to confront her feelings that though she&amp;#39;s a very independent dog who doesn&amp;#39;t like other dogs around her, she knows that she cares about him because whenever the puppy is too tough with him she tries to regulate. She needs to understand the depth of her feelings and stop getting into little tiffs with the both of them. I want to tell her too that she needs to rely on her instincts too when encountering people or other creatures. Dogs are smart and intuitive, but she should be more discerning. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskWomen", "name": "t1_dgdq88x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476049.0, "created_utc": 1492447249.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdfduf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 180, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fartingxfarts", "parent_id": "t3_65v8wz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd have to have a serious talk with them about death.
