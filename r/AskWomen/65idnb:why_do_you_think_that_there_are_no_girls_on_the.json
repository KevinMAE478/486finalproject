It's always been sexism. I've had the curious perspective of being able to see the evolution of this particular phenomenon over time.\n\nIt's a concept of a boys club that never was brought on by anonymity, a sense of male as default and ignorance of just how many people out there were female. At first, I think it was honestly just out of ignorance and a sense of \"well I'm a dude therefore everyone is a dude\" and when women, early on, brought up their gender they'd be pounded by PM requests in chatrooms. Didn't help that so many pub chats in the early-mid 90's straight up consisted half of the nerd mating call, \"A/S/L\". A lot of women just didn't bother talking about their gender out of fear of getting those pm's out of nowhere \"want to cyber?\" FFS I was 14 in the early *early* days of the wider internet when I learned to make a gender neutral name out of fear of constant sexual harassment\n\nTime went on, video game companies stopped marketing to girls in general unless they were specific \"pinkified\" games despite the fact the user base didn't change all that much. As technology improved and voice became a thing, women didn't use it as much because of sexualization or being mistaken for 14 year old boy. (hmm... which sounds more appealing. Ransom dick pics, being called an adolescent and not taken seriously or just being silent)\n\nIt was made worse by 4chan's shitty-ass meme that declared if a woman indicates her gender in any way, she's only doing it for attention because \"gender doesn't matter online\" as though it's some sort of flat meritocracy despite the unironic \"tits or GTFO\" and extreme harassment of so many women online on a gendered basis. \n\nSo many of these idiots who claim it's *not* gendered have no issue with men claiming their own gender either overtly and outrightly or through other means and they'll quickly and *angrily* correct anyone who calls them by the wrong pronoun. However, dare a feeemale to politely correct someone \"actually, it's she\" Even after a whole story about their first period while they were trying on bras, with their boyfriend, and their mother who shares their same name etc etc is met with \"NOBODY CARES IF YOU\"RE A GIRL ATTENTION WHORE\" type stuff. It could be really aggressive and seriously uncalled for. Meanwhile men freely talked to each other about being men, about their genitals, about what they find sexually appealing and once reddit opened up to more than just technology- Oh god the sexual imagery of women. Why might women not flock to it with all the comments in those thread? It's a fucking mystery.\n\nI created this subreddit after twoxchromosomes was too inundated by men asking \"DO WOMEN LIKE X...\" questions./r/Twoxchromosomes is so named because /r/women was snapped up by power user men who give no fucks about it- to this day. They just wanted the name. \n\nShortly after creating this subreddit it was flooded with \"WHY IS THERE NO ASKMEN\" and most conversations were about men despite trying to carve out a space where *women* could answer questions. Any questions. Because seriously askreddit was askmen back then. \"reddit, what kind of boobs do you like\" \"reddit, who is hotter, Selma Hayak or Natalie Portman\" \"reddit, when was the last time you caught your dick in your zipper\". Good luck trying to ask about Brad Pitt Vs Johnny Depp- the funny thing is they were more likely to assume you were gay than a woman. \n\nSo this space was created. We existed. A lot of people *still* didn't believe we were women and a lot of people *still didn't believe our opinions mattered.* On anything. At all. Even one of the mods of askmen had the fucking audacity to come *here* and post that shitty 4chan  meme about \"no girls on the internet \"because gender doesn't matter\" Mother fucker, you mod a subreddit called askmen. Clearly gender matters to you. \n\nThe message is gender matters, but only if that gender is male. If it's female, it should be silent and unnoticed. \n\nEdit: if you came here to reply to me to defend this nonsense, stoppit. First off, I've got shit to do today so I'm not going to he each and every one of your hands and patiently explain to you why it's pretty clear you didn't read any of that wall of text up there and that you're *still* being sexist. Second I don't need a legion of 20 year olds trying to explain a thing to me that I watched develop while y'all were still watching Dora the explorer. Third, y'all are completely bypassing the fact that pEople say it TO women. Actual women. Not men they think are pretending to be women but to women. To shut them up. Literally. It's a thing they do. Tell womb to not talk about th fact that they're women even when relevant to the conversation (which again goes back to the fact that those twits didn't bother to read this shit, they just wanted to assert themselves by proclaiming, apparently, I either don't exist or I'm an attention whore or a dude or a banshee or a land shark or something.)\n\n", "edited": 1492277786.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to pull a &amp;quot;get off my lawn&amp;quot; or anything, but having been on the internet since the late 80&amp;#39;s with BBS* (I hate you autocorrect) type shit, Atari&amp;#39;s Genie and IRC even before AOL was a thing, it&amp;#39;s straight up sexism.
