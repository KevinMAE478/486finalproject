Use the time saved and spend more time in Xi'an and visit the terracotta warriors and enjoy the night markets. You should also try to spend more time in Chengdu as it is known to be a slow paced city that knows how to enjoy life with a fantastic Sichuan food culture. I see how you plan on adding jiuzhai valley as part of your itinerary, but from your time frame, its going to be really hard to fit it in due to its isolation and long travel times so I suggest you to save it for the next time you visit China. \n\nI've never been to Kunming, Laos or Vietnam so I'm going to skip commenting on that part of the journey but I've heard nothing but fantastic stories from friends and family that's been to Kunming area. \n\nOn your way back from Vietnam, you should definitely skip Nanning and visit Guangzhou/Hongkong for a bit, it is a great place for you to check out especially if you would like to have a completely different experience from mainland China. \n\nI went to Guilin and Zhangjiajie in the summer of 2015 and both are extremely touristy during the summer. You should definitely visit Yangshuo which is a close county near the city of Guilin. The county itself is very westernized due to the fact alot of expats live in the area but it is also very touristy. You can get to Yangshuo via river cruise which has some of the best views of Guilin. Zhangjiajie wise i personally believe one day in the national park is enough as long as you spend the whole day in it. While in Zhangjiajie you should also check out Tianmen mountain, I loved the experience of standing above the cloud but waiting for the cable car early in the morning was not fun at all, the lines were insane! So make sure to get there before they open and have your ticket ready! If time allows I would also recommend visit the Nanjing - Suzhou - Wuxi - Shanghai - Hangzhou area from Zhangjiajie but just be prepared with the humidity! \n\nOverall I think your trip is a bit crammed, if you want to save some time, i suggest overnight sleeper trains for any longer journeys or make sure to take advantage of China\u2019s high-speed rail system when you can. Be aware that you will come across giant crowds at popular tourist destinations and tourist traps! If you have any other questions regarding China in general feel free to PM me, I'm more then happy to help! \n\nSorry about the formatting, I'm on mobile.
