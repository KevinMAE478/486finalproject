If they tell you upfront they don't normally give visas to Iranian girls, you just say thank you and leave (and try in another country again).  If they tell you they see no problem with giving you a visa, you just apply right there, and they'll give it to you.\n\nUnfortunately, both Armenia and Georgia have just a few embassies, and only China and India in that list can interest you.  This limits your choice to China and India.  Turkey, however, has embassies of practically all countries, so you can try Thailand and such there.  My personal experience in Turkey is they ask too many questions there, too (because Turks, like Iranians, are not exactly backpackers and try to leave their country on tourist visas, thus more scrutiny), this is why I am saying that Armenia and Georgia can be a better bet.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_in_Turkey\n\nWhen you do this, remember that some countries give visas that are valid right now and for some period of time, and some countries give visas that become valid in future, for the dates you specify.\n\nFor example, China usually gives a visa that is valid for 30 days for stays of 30 days (meaning, you can cross the border in any of those 30 days, even on the last one, and still stay 30 days inside).  But they ask you about your travel days.  If you apply today and tell them you'll travel in July, they'll give you a visa that is valid in July.  You cannot travel before that, but on the other side, you don't waste your valid days.\n\nBut India, for example, gives a visa that is valid right now for three months.  This means if you apply today, the clock starts ticking immediately, and in three months the visa expires.  You have to use it within three months from today.\n\nThis is important if you plan to get your visas on this trip to Armenia/Georgia/Turkey and use them later on the second trip after coming back home and staying there for awhile.  You need to have a clear idea when you want to travel to China/India on your second trip.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have enough time and money to fly from, say, Armenia to China/India right there, this does not matter.\n\nSo, what I am saying is, you don't have to use these newly obtained visas on your first trip, you can save them for later, but do learn how they work in each specific case.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, you can apply for a visa for a specific country in any country (there are just a few that insist you should do it in your home country (US, Japan, etc)).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my idea is, since it&amp;#39;s difficult to get any visa in Tehran, you can go to Armenia and Georgia (and probably Turkey, although that should be your last choice, they are difficult there too) and apply there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, you don&amp;#39;t want to be rejected, because this will put a rejection stamp in your passport, this is bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore my idea is, you should come to the embassy and first politely ask them whether they feel like giving a visa to a person in your situation.

If they tell you they see no problem with giving you a visa, you just apply right there, and they&amp;#39;ll give it to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, both Armenia and Georgia have just a few embassies, and only China and India in that list can interest you.  This limits your choice to China and India.  Turkey, however, has embassies of practically all countries, so you can try Thailand and such there.  My personal experience in Turkey is they ask too many questions there, too (because Turks, like Iranians, are not exactly backpackers and try to leave their country on tourist visas, thus more scrutiny), this is why I am saying that Armenia and Georgia can be a better bet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_in_Turkey\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_in_Turkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you do this, remember that some countries give visas that are valid right now and for some period of time, and some countries give visas that become valid in future, for the dates you specify.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, China usually gives a visa that is valid for 30 days for stays of 30 days (meaning, you can cross the border in any of those 30 days, even on the last one, and still stay 30 days inside).  But they ask you about your travel days.  If you apply today and tell them you&amp;#39;ll travel in July, they&amp;#39;ll give you a visa that is valid in July.  You cannot travel before that, but on the other side, you don&amp;#39;t waste your valid days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But India, for example, gives a visa that is valid right now for three months.  This means if you apply today, the clock starts ticking immediately, and in three months the visa expires.  You have to use it within three months from today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is important if you plan to get your visas on this trip to Armenia/Georgia/Turkey and use them later on the second trip after coming back home and staying there for awhile.  You need to have a clear idea when you want to travel to China/India on your second trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you have enough time and money to fly from, say, Armenia to China/India right there, this does not matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what I am saying is, you don&amp;#39;t have to use these newly obtained visas on your first trip, you can save them for later, but do learn how they work in each specific case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "travel", "name": "t1_dgc2baa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492380683.0, "created_utc": 1492351883.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbyoqo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Yeamf93", "parent_id": "t1_dgbuvg6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/travel", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is a great tip, just one question : Do you mean apply for a visa while in another country? or just ask the question, \"will my application be rejected?\" and if the answer to that is no, then apply for the visa from Iran? \n\n I know people go to those countries (Armenia and Turkey especially) to apply for U.S visa, since there's no U.S embassy in Iran... but I didn't know this was an actual option for other countries as well.
