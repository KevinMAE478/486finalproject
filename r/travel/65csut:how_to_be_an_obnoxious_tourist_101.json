Found an empty gate because I had a 10 hour layover after an over night flight I couldn&amp;#39;t get an ounce of sleep on due to a kid screaming it&amp;#39;s head off and went to sleep.  Woke up a couple hours later and gate was full.  Got up, nice lady asked me if I slept well and I said I slept great.  Went to my gate and slept for another 3 hours, got up and eat breakfast and a couple hours later got on my flight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll excuse me if I don&amp;#39;t shit on this guy.  If there was an issue, someone from security or the airline would have woken him up.  There wasn&amp;#39;t.  This isn&amp;#39;t someone&amp;#39;s nasty feet on the top of the seat of arm rests of the seat in front of them.  This isn&amp;#39;t someone eating nasty food the stinks up the terminal.
