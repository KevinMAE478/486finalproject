The current (rough) plan is to fly from Heathrow to Kathmandu with an 8 hour overnight layover in New Delhi, then to switch over to the domestic terminal in Kathmandu and catch a flight to Pokhara (i don&amp;#39;t have unlimited time in Nepal and don&amp;#39;t really want to spend any of it in Kathmandu when that isn&amp;#39;t what I&amp;#39;m going for). The next day, the plan is to go paragliding from Sarangkot. The following day, I&amp;#39;d set off on a short 5 day trek (Walking Annapurna with Intrepid Travel). The day after the trek finishes I&amp;#39;d get a flight back to Kathmandhu and then back to Heathrow via Delhi again. So I&amp;#39;ve got a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is Delhi airport for sleeping? It seems they have sleep pods and a hotel in the terminal if we&amp;#39;re open to paying. If we wanted to leave the airport and stay in a hotel nearby, could we do that? And if so, how?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read that Kathmandhu airport, and the domestic terminal in particular, is terrible. Quite how bad is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a UK passport holder, i can get my visa on arrival, right? Would it be better to get it before leaving so that i can head over to catch the Pokhara flight as soon as possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve actually never flown domestic anywhere before, just international. Do i need to allow as much time to check-in, get through security etc as i would for an international flight or will it take less time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anybody have any recommendations for somewhere to stay in Pokhara? Since we&amp;#39;ll be staying in teahouses on the trek, we&amp;#39;re looking to stay somewhere a little more comfortable. Not necessarily anything luxurious, but somewhere clean, with our own bathroom, reasonably priced and near to the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has anybody been on the Walking Annapurna tour? Or on one of Intrepid&amp;#39;s other tours in the same area?

When I flew with Nepal airlines, I was supposed to fly in the afternoon flight, but this flight had been cancelled for a while and my seat was re-scheduled for the morning flight the day after. Nepal Airlines found and payed for the taxi ride and the overnight stay in a hotel nearby the airport (there are loads of them) and treated me really well. But if you go out of the airport, I guess you'll need to get a visa, since you'll be on Indian territory.\n\nIf I was you, I'd try asking in here /r/india , people are really nice and always willing to help.\n\nWhen in Kathmandu, make sure that you have some US dollars with you, they want them all the time, you can use them pretty much everywhere, and same for your visa on arrival which prices for 15/30/90 days were  US$25/40/100. Bring two id photos with you too for this.\n\nKathmandu is nice, I like this kind of busy, crowded and cosmopolitan city. And yeah, the \"international\" airport looks more like a messy bus station. I wouldn't trust its cash machines either. I had problems getting rupees there.\n\nFrom Kathmandu, I went with a friend to Pokhara by bus in one of the scariest journeys in my life, due to the poor condition of the winding roads and their lack of hesitation when overtaking. The sights were breathtaking, though. A trip (around 8 hours) to experience once in a lifetime for sure.\n\nIn Pokhara, go to Hotel Grand Holiday, good prices and fantastic breakfast. Nice staff too, ask for Bishnu, friendly guy. There's a really nice barber across the road where you can have a clean shave and a face and head massage for a very cheap price. My friend went to Annapurna but I didn't so I won't say anything about this. Instead, I headed south, to the jungle, for a safari at the Chitwan National Park and spent there 3 days, fantastic experience. I'm more of a jungle guy than a mountain trekker.\n\nLast tip. For food, try momos every time you have a chance, look for the street vendors that have long queues.

Somehow this didn&amp;#39;t get communicated clearly or got lost in translation and we almost missed our flight out of Kathmandu. Kathmandu is worth a day or two visit if you can afford the days and a guide. Checkout swayambhu, palace gardens, and different temples. The KTH airport is a shitshow.
