I was here last summer, and I would fully encourage any travelers who enjoy dramatic scenery, being active (day hikes), and isolated/off-the-beaten-path destinations to travel here at your earliest convenience.  The Faroe Islands are simply phenomenal, and I for one am slightly concerned that tourism will flock there before long (as Iceland becomes over-run).  In fact, even though tourism in the Faroe Islands is negligible now, I have seen articles complaining about the increase in tourism at the village in OP's photo....that tourists don't realize you're walking into someone's home village - it's so picturesque I guess tourists just assume it's all staged?  I don't know....anyway, there's a lot of gazing through windows into peoples' homes, and I guess it's starting to become a problem. However, to reiterate, tourism is near negligible in the grand scheme of things.  Go now!\n\nAtlantic Airways is the airline that flies in and out of the Faroe Islands. I'm American. I flew into the Faroe Islands from Iceland (Reykjavik city airport, not Keflavik, the int'l airport).  And I flew from the Faroe Islands to Edinburgh.\n\nThe price to fly in and out was probably a couple hundred USD total.  We booked well in advance.\n\nCost in the Faroe Islands themselves is expensive, yes. You're in a Scandinavian country that is an island nation.  Everything is expensive. That's true. We rented an apt on Airbnb and after two nights out for dinner paying through the nose for a mediocre hamburger and a couple beers, we just went to the grocery store and made our own breakfasts &amp; dinners from that point forward.  That was much, much, much more reasonable. \n\nWe spent about a week - I want to say 6 days/7 nights? - in the Faroe Islands. It was the perfect amount of time. We got to take day trips out to the further islands. We got to do all the hikes we wanted. We spent one day just driving around getting oriented, taking in the sights, and driving to some of the more beautiful villages.  We did the sea cliff boat tour one morning. I thought we planned it just right.\n\nAfter we left, we flew to Scotland and spent a week there driving the Scottish Highlands.  Overall, great trip.\n\nSince the Faroe Islands are part of Denmark, Atlantic Airways can fly you to Copenhagen, so that could be an option for you.  I believe they also fly to Bergen, Norway. So you could check out the Norwegian fjords.\n\nI'm happy to answer any other questions about the Faroe Islands. Like OP, I think of myself as someone who has done a decent amount of traveling, and I absolutely loved it there.\n\n\nEDIT - I'm not the world's best photographer, but I created an album a few months ago and posted it here after my trip.
