If not and if you have a few days to spare, you might want to do the three passes trek or do EBC via Gokyo and Cho La pass. Both of those include EBC. On the EBC trek you walk the same way to and from EBC. It's a nice trek, but it is pretty crowded especially in October. \n\nThe other treks take a different route from Namche Bazaar on. Those routes are a bit less crowded and offer great views of the Himalayas as well, especially the pass crossings. They are a bit more demanding though. \nGokyo and Cho La for example can be done clockwise or counter clockwise and one part of that trek will have you walk the complete one way route of the classic EBC trek. I've done that one last October clockwise. The way to Gokyo was not empty by any means, but it was way less traffic than on the way back from EBC to Namche.\n\nAs for general tips, the standard ones. Pack light, drink a lot, take it slow. If you get severe headaches decent immediately. If you can't live without your tech/internet buy a ncell sim card in Kathmandu with a few gigs of data for around $20. It works pretty well to about half way up to EBC, after that reception is spotty. All lodges have WIFI though. 100 MB for 15 hours is about 350 NR. \n\nEverything gets more expensive the closer you get to EBC. Water close to Lukla is 80 NR for 0.5l, close to EBC you pay 300-400 NR for the same bottle. Same with snacks like mars bars or pringles.\n\nFood is the same in all lodges. They all offer the same meals for the same price. \n\nMy number one tip is to take lots of tissues with you. Everyone in our group got a bit of a cold during the 3 weeks we were there and tissues were in high demand. The stuff they sell there are really bad single ply tissues that disintegrate in your hand once you sneeze into them.\n\nTake a few spare batteries with you for your camera and a powerbank for everything else you might need to recharge. You can charge your batteries for a few NR in lodges, but sometimes that didn't work right or took ages and as with everything else, the higher you got the pricier it was. It not much by western standards but it all adds up if you charge stuff, take a shower, get some snacks, maybe wifi every other day.", "edited": 1492064456.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you doing the EBC trek and if yes is it set in stone?

They are a bit more demanding though. \nGokyo and Cho La for example can be done clockwise or counter clockwise and one part of that trek will have you walk the complete one way route of the classic EBC trek. I&amp;#39;ve done that one last October clockwise. The way to Gokyo was not empty by any means, but it was way less traffic than on the way back from EBC to Namche.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for general tips, the standard ones. Pack light, drink a lot, take it slow. If you get severe headaches decent immediately. If you can&amp;#39;t live without your tech/internet buy a ncell sim card in Kathmandu with a few gigs of data for around $20. It works pretty well to about half way up to EBC, after that reception is spotty. All lodges have WIFI though. 100 MB for 15 hours is about 350 NR. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything gets more expensive the closer you get to EBC. Water close to Lukla is 80 NR for 0.5l, close to EBC you pay 300-400 NR for the same bottle. Same with snacks like mars bars or pringles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Food is the same in all lodges. They all offer the same meals for the same price. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My number one tip is to take lots of tissues with you. Everyone in our group got a bit of a cold during the 3 weeks we were there and tissues were in high demand. The stuff they sell there are really bad single ply tissues that disintegrate in your hand once you sneeze into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a few spare batteries with you for your camera and a powerbank for everything else you might need to recharge. You can charge your batteries for a few NR in lodges, but sometimes that didn&amp;#39;t work right or took ages and as with everything else, the higher you got the pricier it was. It not much by western standards but it all adds up if you charge stuff, take a shower, get some snacks, maybe wifi every other day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "travel", "name": "t1_dg78d10", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492092647.0, "created_utc": 1492063847.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7283r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WhiteRhinoKnight", "parent_id": "t3_64yn2d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/travel", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Doing this in October and can't wait!!
