Also some exits aren't signposted until you get closer to the exit so I use streetview to confirm what signs are available at the exit gate so I know I need to follow those signs before I see the exit sign that I want.\n\n**5) Stores and Restaurants**\nI like to take a lot of day trips so I usually leave really early in the morning and buy breakfast before I take the train so its helpful to find where I can buy a bento or sandwiches and eat it on the shinkansen.\n\n\nDo you have a list of stations that you are planning to cover next?
