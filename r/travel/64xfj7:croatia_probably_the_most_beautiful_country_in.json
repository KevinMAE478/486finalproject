Really appreciate it. \nI will break it down a bit for you! \n\n---\n\nJust to give you a bit more insight, might help you understand a bit more who I am! :) \n \nI am a 26 year old guy from the Netherlands who currently lives in Belgium.\nI am single for.. over 5 years now! I haven't been open for a relation.. long story!   \nI work as a HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) mechanic for the company of my father. I don't earn a fortune, but enough to come around. \nI do hope to work in a PC store in a few years, but that's for later.  \n\nI used to play video games a lot, this is where I met the two lovely girls that I'll meet in Zagreb. But right now, I don't make much time for it. \nI am very much still a PC nerd and love PC hardware. I help people over on /r/buildapcforme a lot. Sadly, because of being very busy, I don't have as much time. I still put out a few suggestions every week though! :)  \nI also love going on walks with my dogs in the \"small\" park that I live nearby. \n\nI've recently gain a lot of interest for photography. I plan to buy a \"good\" all round camera to take with me on my trip. \n\nI actually plan to make a YouTube video of my holiday. Because I will travel alone, I have all the time to make a lot of pictures. I also will try to record small parts with my action camera. I hope to get a very nice video together with short clips and a handful of still pictures. I have a cheap one that I bought for Malta. Which was my holiday in 2016!  \n\n^(The only reason why I want to make this is to reap all the karma in /r/Croatia &amp; /r/travel.)\n\nI love metal, classical &amp; any music with instruments. I also listen to chillstep &amp; trance every now and then, but often not very long. Currently listening to [Sorrows Passing - Sad Orchestral Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXov3vClscc&amp;feature=push-u&amp;attr_tag=ERX85eIJ2xE1f8mW-6) from Peter Gundry.  \nI would actually love to find some local music anywhere and record it to include in my holiday video! :) \n\n---\n---\n\n&gt;  Also you should visit Opera club in Zagreb if youre into that kind of stuff  (Im there right now, perfect for people in their 20ies)\n\nNot much my cup of tea! But thanks for the suggestion. I don't plan to go clubbing at all, won't have time for that! Also, I hardly ever do that here at home.. I don't have any friends! xD   \nSo going solo into a club, yeah.. won't happen easily!   \n\n&gt; what I do know is that there are some really good wineries in Vrbnik (a very cute town) which is on the island of Krk. Since Mali Lo\u0161inj is a top destination on Kvarner (northern part of our coastline just beneath Istra) and I highly recommend that you visit it, you should check out Vrbnik since it is on the way to Lo\u0161inj.\n\nThat's a little bit of the route that I currently have in my head. But I'll check it out.   \nI'll be in Zadar so I can probably grab a ferry to Mali Lo\u0161inj? \n\n&gt; Many people come to Croatia to eat fancy food at expensive restaurants, however I think that the cheaper food tastes even better and especially the one of Bosnian or Turkish origin.\n\nWell, I can't afford expensive restaurants anyway, so that's good!  \nI'll take my two friends from Zagreb out for dinner though, so hopefully I can find a good restaurant with not too expensive prices.  \n\nI am very much aware of the local food being amazing, so I certainly want to give it a try. I'll probably go out to a restaurant ~7/9 times or so during my 18 (20 if I include the plane days;p) day trip. So about half of the evenings.  \n\nI don't plan to actually go too often to restaurants. I'll buy my own food in supermarkets and try to make simple dishes in my hostels whenever possible.  \n\n&gt; In Zagreb you should visit Marenda (traditional Dalmatian food) or Magazinska Klet (barbecue) or, my favourite, Sofra (Bosnian cusine).\n\nAbsolutely perfect, thank you so much! I'll have to make a decision.. \u2665 I love BBQ food, but I might have to consider Sofra. Argh, I'll ask my friends as well. \n\n&gt;  As for eating in Dalmatia, do not listen to TripAdvisor since many people write fake reviews and also do not eat in old towns since those restaurants usually do not serve fresh food.\n\nCopy! I generally don't listen to reviews too much, I mostly look at the menus and a few pictures if possible. My brother and sister both studied to become chefs, they've given me tips for how to know if a restaurant is good. \"small menu, with simple food = very good!\" \n \nOf course, I have to find a reference somewhere. I am sure that most local, not very popular restaurants will serve me well.  \n\nI'll avoid old town restaurants, thank you! :) \n\n&gt; Now, I'm pretty sure that you are planning to rent a car and then head from Zagreb along the coastline down to Dubrovnik which is really smart, just make sure that you have a good GPS device since many people get lost in the Plitvice lakes area.\n\nI actually do not. I don't have a driver's license yet! :(  \nIt's also much cheaper to travel by bus. As said above, I don't have a huge budget..  \n\nI know that having a car is absolutely awesome so that you can just go to wherever you want. I will just have to do with public travel. \n\n&gt; The best thing you can do in Croatia is rent a boat and a person who knows the area really well who will take you to many beaches on our islands where you will be able to have absolute privacy and maximum comfort in the middle of nowhere. RENTING A SMALL BOAT IS A MUST.\n\nThis was the plan, at least for one day. I will see where I can find a place and people that want to join me on a day of \"relaxing\". I will hopefully meet some people in the hostels that I am staying.  \n\nI'll have a look for sure, any islands you recommend? I currently have Vis, Mljet, Hvar &amp; Long Island / Kornati on the planning. \n\n&gt; Our country is very small. but it provides many fun activities. I think that 18 days is totally enough for you to get to Dubrovnik or Mostar or wherever you're headed to; just make sure you don't waste your time in hotels.\n\nHah! It's not thaaat small. I really wish I could visit Pula and the amphitheater. That is something I've never seen in my life.  \nBut I like to not \"rush\" myself from place to place. \n\nI won't stay much in my hostels! But obviously will try to socialise a little bit. I am going to be on my own, so.. \n\nI am absolutely going to the parks. Plitvice and Krka are in the planning. Will probably visit a couple more if possible! \n\n&gt; The way to get around the crowd on Plitvice is to rent a small boat which is perfect for going under the waterfalls and overall having a little bit of privacy which is not that common over there lol.\n\nHah, I had no idea you could do that. I will actually have at least 2 days for Plitvice planned. One day with my friend from Zagreb and the next day for on my own. I am very much aware that it's going to be crowded. I just have to deal with it and make the best from it.  \n\nI had no idea that you could rent a boat. I'll have a look at this, thanks! \n\n&gt; Makarska is not very special and it's mostly for people who only come exclusively to Makarska and don't go anywhere else. If I were you, I would definitely skip it.\n\nThanks! I might skip it then. I'll be in Split for at least 4/5 days. So I could perhaps stay a bit longer than move from Split right to Mostar. \n\n&gt; You should also visit Trogir which is near Split, just due north. And there you should rent a boat and go to nearby islands like Bra\u010d, \u0160olta and Drvenik (this is the best way to experience my country).\n\nAbsolutely! I am certainly going to visit islands near Split. I'll again have to look at it :) \n\n&gt; Perhaps you also spot some dolphins.\n\nNO WAY!! If I would spot dolphins, I would go crazy.. That would be soo amazing.  \nDo you know any location where they are often seen? I certainly would spend a whole day to try and spot some dolphins. \n\n&gt; The other places you've mentioned here are all worth a visit. If you don't have any experience around horses then horseback riding will be quite boring and going kayaking and zip lining will be much more fun, however you should know that every tourist does that kind of activities and, because of that, the prices are high.\n\nI have 7 years of horse back riding experience under my belt. I am trying to find a place where we can go to a bit more challenging parkour. I love riding on a horse, especially in the nature. It's just extremely relaxing for me. \n\nI am very much aware of the high prices for kayaking and zip lines. I was actually surprised a lot. I didn't expect the prices to be this high, but well.. it is what it is and I just have to eat a bit more noodles for a couple of weeks so I can afford it all. \n\n&gt; I've tried explaining this the best I could fitting your character as you seem to be a much more chill-drink-eat people then the adventurous, get off the beaten track type.\n\nHah, well I indeed am a fairly chill person, I think? I do however like to be a bit adventurous during my holidays. Thus why I am planning to go kayaking, ziplining, horseback riding, etc.   \nI also enjoy some local food and beverages. But it's not extremely important, just nice to experience compared to my boring food that I eat at home! \n\nI will spend the next few weeks to try and plan everything as best as possible. \n\n#Thank you so much, I will certainly use all this information as best as possible. \n \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for your in depth reply! Really appreciate it. \nI will break it down a bit for you! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just to give you a bit more insight, might help you understand a bit more who I am! :) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a 26 year old guy from the Netherlands who currently lives in Belgium.\nI am single for.. over 5 years now! I haven&amp;#39;t been open for a relation.. long story!&lt;br/&gt;\nI work as a HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) mechanic for the company of my father. I don&amp;#39;t earn a fortune, but enough to come around. \nI do hope to work in a PC store in a few years, but that&amp;#39;s for later.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to play video games a lot, this is where I met the two lovely girls that I&amp;#39;ll meet in Zagreb. But right now, I don&amp;#39;t make much time for it. \nI am very much still a PC nerd and love PC hardware. I help people over on &lt;a href=\"/r/buildapcforme\"&gt;/r/buildapcforme&lt;/a&gt; a lot. Sadly, because of being very busy, I don&amp;#39;t have as much time. I still put out a few suggestions every week though! :)&lt;br/&gt;\nI also love going on walks with my dogs in the &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; park that I live nearby. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently gain a lot of interest for photography. I plan to buy a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; all round camera to take with me on my trip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually plan to make a YouTube video of my holiday. Because I will travel alone, I have all the time to make a lot of pictures. I also will try to record small parts with my action camera. I hope to get a very nice video together with short clips and a handful of still pictures. I have a cheap one that I bought for Malta. Which was my holiday in 2016!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;The only reason why I want to make this is to reap all the karma in &lt;a href=\"/r/Croatia\"&gt;/r/Croatia&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=\"/r/travel\"&gt;/r/travel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love metal, classical &amp;amp; any music with instruments. I also listen to chillstep &amp;amp; trance every now and then, but often not very long. Currently listening to &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXov3vClscc&amp;amp;feature=push-u&amp;amp;attr_tag=ERX85eIJ2xE1f8mW-6\"&gt;Sorrows Passing - Sad Orchestral Music&lt;/a&gt; from Peter Gundry.&lt;br/&gt;\nI would actually love to find some local music anywhere and record it to include in my holiday video! :) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also you should visit Opera club in Zagreb if youre into that kind of stuff  (Im there right now, perfect for people in their 20ies)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not much my cup of tea! But thanks for the suggestion. I don&amp;#39;t plan to go clubbing at all, won&amp;#39;t have time for that! Also, I hardly ever do that here at home.. I don&amp;#39;t have any friends! xD&lt;br/&gt;\nSo going solo into a club, yeah.. won&amp;#39;t happen easily!   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;what I do know is that there are some really good wineries in Vrbnik (a very cute town) which is on the island of Krk. Since Mali Lo\u0161inj is a top destination on Kvarner (northern part of our coastline just beneath Istra) and I highly recommend that you visit it, you should check out Vrbnik since it is on the way to Lo\u0161inj.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a little bit of the route that I currently have in my head.

I was only there a short time so I just hung out drinking with some locals in a park while waiting for my ferry.  Cheap beer and apparently no problems with drinking in public.  Maybe it is illegal but I usually take liberties as a tourist since generally you can avoid trouble if you aren't being an asshole.\n\nWhat I noticed was that everyone was super super nice everywhere I went.  It felt super weird because I know the history of the area and the atrocities in the recent wars there.
