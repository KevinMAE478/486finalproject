So you need bus tickets. Then, you need tickets. Don&amp;#39;t remember the site for them but make 100% sure it&amp;#39;s the official site of the event. That is where I messed up. They sell out because a lot of people go to it. \nKeep in mind. The Tomatina happens in a 4-5 blocks area in the town. You need the tickets to access that area for the festival. You can still go to the city and there are a lot of parties going on outside that area but you need tickets for the Tomatina.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "travel", "name": "t1_dg7r9pk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492128081.0, "created_utc": 1492099281.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7qs9m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DudeOnACouch2", "parent_id": "t1_dg7qg1t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/travel", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have a hostel reserved in Valencia, but I'm not sure how far it is from where the festivities happen.
