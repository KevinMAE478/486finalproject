The museum pass saves you a few \u20ac but not much and does restrict you to a 3, 5, or 7 day window.  I just bought individual tickets to the Louvre, Orangerie/Orsay (combo), Versailles.  Most long lines at museums and monuments are for buying tickets.\n- Buy Eiffel tower tickets online and print them before you go, you can buy tickets for a specific date and time, this makes it so when you get there you can go into the \"Reserved/Guests\" line which is MUCH shorter than the buy ticket line.  Also, you have a reserved time at which you are asked to go to the elevator so you can get there just 20ish minutes before your time slot.  Buy from the official Eiffel Tower site.  It's very cheap.\n- Cheapest way to travel is by metro, you can buy an unlimited pass for certain number of days, but in our experience, we found that the unlimited pass was more expensive than buying a book of 10 tickets at a time which costs \u20ac14.50.  That's each ride/transfer for \u20ac1.45.  We did maybe 4-5 metro rides per day.  You can buy these right at the metro station on the machine (You need a credit card with a chip), or you can buy the book of 10 tickets at the same visitor center at the airport.  I would suggest buying 2 books of 10.\n- Speaking of credit cards, if you don't have a credit card with a chip, you're going to have a bad day.\n- Cash, take maybe \u20ac200 from the US with you.  The rest, you can get from an ATM in Paris for minimal fees and best exchange rate.  Foreign exchange shops will rip you off.  FYI Bank of America is partners with BNP bank so your fees would be lower.  I withdrew \u20ac140 with a fee of about $10 (non partner bank) and \u20ac160 with a fee of about $5 (partner bank).\n- I bought, for \u20ac40, a SIM that was a French phone number from Orange.  There are tons of Orange Boutiques (that's what they call em) around Paris.  for the \u20ac40, you get a SIM with French phone number, 1000 texts to anywhere on the planet, 200 minutes of calls to anywhere on the planet, and 2 GB of 4G/LTE data.  The coverage for Orange is really good.  I used less than 1 GB of data a week, with high usage, looking up things, hours, maps, etc.  You DO need an unlocked phone, so check with your carrier before you leave.\n- Google maps is your friend, if you have data or wifi, you can ask for directions on how to get from here to there and use the train icon or the public transit icon to tell you what mode of transport you're using, it's excellent.  It will say something like 1) walk 2 mins to this station 2) take train #x to this station (every 2 mins) 3) Exit station from exit #x 4) Walk to destination 2 mins.  It is very detailed, it is very hard to get lost in Paris.\n- The French are VERY VERY nice people, the myth that they are rude is just that, a myth.  Here is a phrase you should remember when starting every conversation \"Mon Francais nes pas cest bon, parlevous anglaiz?\"  Sorry for the spelling, but you're essentially saying \"My French is not so good, do you speak English?\", the fact that you tried make the French very happy and are SUPER helpful and most of them are fluent in English.\n- Don't be loud in public, it's just rude, that rule applies everywhere, not just France, Americans are just loud, that needs to stop.\n- There is no culture of tipping, if you get such good service for which you would tip 20% or more in the US, then maybe leave a Euro or two.\n- Be prepared for smoke, most people smoke.  If your asthmatic, bring an inhaler.\n- Uber exists in Paris and is not super expensive but can get that way during rush hour, Metro is the way to go.\n- Beware of gypsy scammers and pickpockets, just use common sense.\n- While the Louvre has some iconic art, it is VERY big, you will NOT be able to see everything in a week.  Spend a few hour there and get the \"gotta see\" things out of the way and then spend some real time at he Musee d'Orsay, this is a must see for art lovers, if you love Monet, Manet, Renoir, Rodin, Cezan, Gaugin, and Van Gogh, you will see their masterpieces in every corner here.\n- Food is relatively cheap, eat crepes with Nutella or chicken/cheese, for \u20ac3-4 at the most touristy locations, eat \u20ac5 chicken or cheese sandwiches, buy baguettes and butter and jams at the local grocery store (monoprix) and carry with you, this is all MUCH cheaper than eating at restaurants.\n- When eating at restaurants, don't be embarrassed to ask for tap water when asked what to drink otherwise they WILL bring out bottled water at \u20ac3-4 per bottle.\n- Again, BUY THE RICK STEVES book, he has great write ups for each monument/museum and how long to spend there, what days times to go to avoid crowds.\n\nGood luck, have fun.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a quick tips sheet for Paris:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Buy the Rick Steve&amp;#39;s book on Paris, EXCELLENT tips in there.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can buy the museum pass right at the airport when you land, OR you can buy individual tickets to most museums at the same airport visitor center.  The museum pass saves you a few \u20ac but not much and does restrict you to a 3, 5, or 7 day window.  I just bought individual tickets to the Louvre, Orangerie/Orsay (combo), Versailles.  Most long lines at museums and monuments are for buying tickets.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Buy Eiffel tower tickets online and print them before you go, you can buy tickets for a specific date and time, this makes it so when you get there you can go into the &amp;quot;Reserved/Guests&amp;quot; line which is MUCH shorter than the buy ticket line.  Also, you have a reserved time at which you are asked to go to the elevator so you can get there just 20ish minutes before your time slot.  Buy from the official Eiffel Tower site.  It&amp;#39;s very cheap.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cheapest way to travel is by metro, you can buy an unlimited pass for certain number of days, but in our experience, we found that the unlimited pass was more expensive than buying a book of 10 tickets at a time which costs \u20ac14.50.  That&amp;#39;s each ride/transfer for \u20ac1.45.  We did maybe 4-5 metro rides per day.  You can buy these right at the metro station on the machine (You need a credit card with a chip), or you can buy the book of 10 tickets at the same visitor center at the airport.  I would suggest buying 2 books of 10.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Speaking of credit cards, if you don&amp;#39;t have a credit card with a chip, you&amp;#39;re going to have a bad day.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cash, take maybe \u20ac200 from the US with you.  The rest, you can get from an ATM in Paris for minimal fees and best exchange rate.  Foreign exchange shops will rip you off.  FYI Bank of America is partners with BNP bank so your fees would be lower.  I withdrew \u20ac140 with a fee of about $10 (non partner bank) and \u20ac160 with a fee of about $5 (partner bank).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I bought, for \u20ac40, a SIM that was a French phone number from Orange.  There are tons of Orange Boutiques (that&amp;#39;s what they call em) around Paris.  for the \u20ac40, you get a SIM with French phone number, 1000 texts to anywhere on the planet, 200 minutes of calls to anywhere on the planet, and 2 GB of 4G/LTE data.  The coverage for Orange is really good.  I used less than 1 GB of data a week, with high usage, looking up things, hours, maps, etc.  You DO need an unlocked phone, so check with your carrier before you leave.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Google maps is your friend, if you have data or wifi, you can ask for directions on how to get from here to there and use the train icon or the public transit icon to tell you what mode of transport you&amp;#39;re using, it&amp;#39;s excellent.  It will say something like 1) walk 2 mins to this station 2) take train #x to this station (every 2 mins) 3) Exit station from exit #x 4) Walk to destination 2 mins.  It is very detailed, it is very hard to get lost in Paris.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The French are VERY VERY nice people, the myth that they are rude is just that, a myth.
