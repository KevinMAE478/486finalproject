About $150 of that was the wire (copper is expensive). The other $100 was conduit parts, outlets, plugs and wire for my tablesaw and dust collector, etc. There was an additional $30 that doesn&amp;#39;t apply because I had to drill a new hole through my concrete stem wall. I borrowed a friends Rotohammer, and his bit broke, so I bought him a new one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit to add that I ran 200 feet of 10 gauge Romex cable, plus THHN cable through the conduit.
