Don&amp;#39;t Sand into your Glass after your put your epoxy on, it will only wet out clear ONCE. after that your screwed and sanding it all off on the floor.  Epoxy does not &amp;quot;Dry&amp;quot; it is a chemical reaction that makes it set and it happens in a predictable time interval based on your shop temp so learn to use it on some test pieces.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "woodworking", "name": "t1_dg7mxvq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123377.0, "created_utc": 1492094577.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7lr73", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Titus142", "parent_id": "t1_dg7l8fu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/woodworking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm doing a Paddleboard and am planning to do the same.

Sorry if its TLDR but its a long process.  \n\nI built this boat from scratch and when i say scratch i mean i cut the trees down a year before I started the project.  I also owned a Woodmizer LT40HD at the time and sawed the boards myself.  I paid an old timer down the road to dry the boards in his home made kiln. \n\nThe mold is  a wood working project in itself. I did not pay for someone to cut the stations on a CNC, i did it all with a jig saw and a spindle sander.  I rough cut the stations 1/8 inch oversize since Jig saws suck in terms of keeping the blade at a 90 degree angle.  I didnt own a band saw at time and didn't really want to spend the money on one.  So the spindle sander and I became good friends for a full 10 hours.  This made for good quality stations.  The Strong back (the beam its all mounted on) is 20 ft long and made from hard wood i had laying around. It is made out of 1 X 4 and 1x6.  This gave me the ability to keep it all straight.  If your strong back is not straight, neither will be your boat.  When i finished the strong back, stations and station supports i felt like I had really accomplished something.  At this point i has built two wood strip canoes, but this was entering a whole new league of boat building. \n\nI planed and cut strips for days and days and days.  I thought i was gonna kill my cheap table saw (a portable dewalt POS).  the strips area only 1/4\" thick and i cut them out of 3/4 inch planed material, so its a ton of ripping...... over and over and over.  Its a test of will power to not let your quality fall due to the monotony of this part of the job.  Some opt to buy the strips already machined (I would not blame you if you did), but i was glutton for punishment and wanted to do it all myself (My wife calls this stubborn, but whatever.  we have only been married 20 years, what does she know ;)).  At this point, you become friends with the router table, all those strips get a bead and cove the full length of each one.  The strips were not a full 18'6\" long but they were close to 16'.  Routering them was a lot like trying to cram a wet spaghetti noodle through your router table.  I built 3 different Jigs before i got something that was sort of functional.  I still ruined about 10% or more of the strips i had ripped on the table saw (frustrating!!!).  \n\nAt this point you get to start having fun again and start laying strips on the mold.  Things start to take shape quickly.  This is a lot like framing a house, you see a lot of progress happen fast but you know there is much work to come.  For the hull (bottom) i used the staple method.  You lay a bead of glue in the cove and place it on the cove from the previous strip. then place a single staple in the strip at each station.  you can do about a half dozen strips then switch sides and to another half dozen, then switch back.  The glue will have set enough on the other side that things are rigid enough to start working again and i used a dull chisel to remove the mess of glue left in my wake.  \n\nOn the deck i didnt want to see the staple holes at all so i PAINSTAKINGLY used a hot glue method to glue the strips down.  I used a conventional wood glue to glue from bead to cove (between strips) but used hot glue between the strip and the station. This was PAINFUL, literally and figuratively.  I blistered every finger, all parts of my hands and my forearms.  I'm making it sound terrible but it makes an absolutely beautiful and flawless finish. It made the stations a real Mother F'r to get out.\n\nOnce you have the boat stripped, you sand until your ready to burn the damn thing and forget you ever started it.  I mean it man you sand forever and you furniture makers out there will break every rule of mechanized sanding there is.  Remember, there is no flat surface on this thing at all, so laying a belt sander on it makes you want to puke, but a belt sander becomes an awesome shaping tool when you learn how.  Then you use an orbital for ever and viola your glassing.  I had no mentor on glassing so I learned the hard way. this is already TLDR so ill skip the glassing unless i get questions on it.  It is nothing like poly so approach with caution!!!!\n\nFree advice if you choose the hot glue method.  Pull all the staples from the bottom of the boat first then cut the cockpit and drive a screw with a washer through a dog chain into each station.  Drive is high and on one side of the station so it will twist and tilt the station as it comes out.  The glue has no strength for forces in this direction and it will come out.  DO NOT TRY TO PRY THE TOP OF THE BOAT OFF THE FORM.  You WILL separate the glass from the wood (delamination) and you will cry for days on end as you sand it all off on the floor and start over.\n\nSo.... you separate the deck from the mold as described above and remove the stem stations.  At this point you need to make sure you control your humidity.  The glass on the outside of the boat will forceably maintain the shape of that surface of the boar.  if humidity gets to the un-glassed side it will swell and the boat drastically changes shape.  if this happens, you can drop the humidity, wait a week or so and it will usually conform back, its amazing how much it will change shape.  As long as it doesn't crack or de-laminate your good.  So. now you sand again until you regret ever starting the damn thing (once again i mean it..... forever!!)  only now your sanding a large concave surface, just keep at it, it's worth it.  Then you glass the inside and seam it together.\n\nCombing is what is around the cockpit.  it has a structural component for the boat as well as allows you to attach a spray skirt to keep the water out.  This is tedious and you can build them in many ways.  I used about 60 1.5 inch long strips turned up, glassed an and hand shaped with a sander for mine and I could not be happier with it. \n\nAt this point its bulk heads for dry bays and a seat.  My seat is hickory and my bulkheads are made of strips as well.  They are glassed and epoxied in as well.  \n\nMan i skipped a lot, but if your interested in any details im happy to fill in any details.  I had no mentor about any of this and im not a furniture maker so i learned everything by trial and error, and there was a lot of Error......

Just remember the heavier the weave the less clear it will wet out.  \n\nI like to start with a seal coat of epoxy before i put the glass on the boat.  I didnt always do this but, it makes it easier to saturate the glass when you put the glass on the boat if the wood if the surface of the wood is already saturated.  then when the first coat is almost set (tacky but not sticky) lay the glass to the boat.  Then you start applying the epoxy to the glass.  what you will notice is that as the weave is filled with epoxy, it will turn clear.  This coat will be the largest volume of epoxy you will add to the boat.  It will easily take twice as much epoxy as any other coat.  after you have filled the weave and it is all clear you need to make sure the glass doesn't float off of the boat.  It is important that the glass lays down against the wood and is not floating to the top of the layer of epoxy that you just laid.  If its floating, use a 4 inch plastic trowel to push the glass down and remove the excess epoxy.  If its floating, you have too much epoxy on the boat.  You then wait until this layer is tack but not sticky again and apply your next layer.  Keep doing this over and over until you get the desired finish.  You need to do the first 3 layers in the same session so set aside a minimum of 6-7 hours once you start applying your seal coat.  As long as you have enough epoxy on the boat that you can get a uniform sand and not get into the fiberglass, you can let the epoxy completely cure between the next coat. I suggest doing this between your finish coat anyway because your gonna have some runs you want to  sand out before your finish coat.  Keep your shop very very warm, I even went as far as to put wet rags in a crock pot and place my epoxy bottles in the crock pot on the lowest setting.  This keeps it thin so it penetrates the weave easily and again, thin coats dont run as easily.

Keep your shop very very warm, I even went as far as to put wet rags in a crock pot and place my epoxy bottles in the crock pot on the lowest setting.  This keeps it thin so it penetrates the weave easily and again, thin coats dont run as easily.  I know this wasn&amp;#39;t real short but learning how to epoxy with no mentor was frustrating for me and I&amp;#39;m still a long was from being a master.  If others want to chime in with their pointers i would love to read them as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "woodworking", "name": "t1_dg80bos", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492137717.0, "created_utc": 1492108917.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlqp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65169s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg810hj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GisGuy1", "parent_id": "t1_dg7x0p1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/woodworking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[More Glassing Pics](http://imgur.com/gallery/lIt3v)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/lIt3v\"&gt;More Glassing Pics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "woodworking", "name": "t1_dg810hj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492138453.0, "created_utc": 1492109653.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7x0p1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "harob", "parent_id": "t3_65169s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/woodworking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Could you explain the glass process quickly.
