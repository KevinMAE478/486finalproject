I&amp;#39;ve always been paranoid about leaving my golf clubs in my car (I had a hatchback so you can see inside), but lately my wife had been complaining &amp;quot;really, you need to bring them back inside every time you go play?&amp;quot;  So, for the past couple weeks I just left them in there, putting a dark blanket over them as &amp;quot;cover.&amp;quot;  We lived in an apartment complex with carports.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday morning I went out to my car to drive to work and realized something was wrong...Why is my glove box open?  Why are there pens and papers all over my front seat? &lt;strong&gt;SHIT DON&amp;#39;T TELL ME...&lt;/strong&gt; Popped my hatch and they were gone.  Some thieves broke into my car and stole my golf clubs.  Golf is my sport, it&amp;#39;s my livelihood, I&amp;#39;ve invested so much time and money in the game and it makes me happy to play, and I find the golf course a great place to relax.  My set was pretty expensive to put together: Ping G25 driver, 915F fairway wood, 712U driving iron, Titleist 4-PW CB/MB, Vokey SM5 wedges, Odyssey putter, Ping bag, Bushnell V2 rangefinder, they even took my Sun Mountain push cart and &amp;quot;nice weather&amp;quot; shoes.  Luckily, (maybe not the best word to use but w/e) they left 2 pairs of FJ DryJoys (obviously the thieves weren&amp;#39;t golfers or would know DryJoys are expensive AF).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was distraught to say the least, couldn&amp;#39;t think, didn&amp;#39;t know what to do, just walked back inside, collapsed on my bed, and cried.  Picked myself back up and found a way to go into work after calling the police and filing a report.  Couldn&amp;#39;t get much done at work but I tried.  I scoured eBay and Craigslist for new postings.  My wife checked all the local pawn shops in case the thieves were stupid enough to show their IDs to cash them in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a golf tournament coming up the following weekend so needed to scrap together a set.  After work, I stopped by at a buddies house and he let me borrow his old set.  On the way home, I remember there being a &amp;quot;Cash America Pawn&amp;quot; shop right near my apartment complex, maybe 1/4 mile away.  It was 6:15pm and they closed at 7 so figured I would stop in to check just in case they had pawned them off earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked through the store, back to where I saw some golf clubs...and I saw some clubs that made my heart skip a beat for a second.  Titleist 735 CM irons, they weren&amp;#39;t mine, but they were my previous set.  Well, so much for that, I was about to leave when out of the corner of my eye I noticed someone up at the counter of the shop.  He was standing next to...my blue and white ping bag with blue push cart...&lt;strong&gt;MOTHERFUCKER I&amp;#39;M GONNA KILL THIS GUY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now my heart REALLY dropped I couldn&amp;#39;t think straight, what should I do?  The only thing I could think of was &amp;quot;I need cops, I NEED COPS SHIT&amp;quot;.  I called 911 in the store and tried talking as nonchalantly as I could.  They were taking too long, I needed cops there NOW.  I managed to snap a photo while not-so-sneakily walking by the thief whilst on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/myV7N\"&gt;The Thief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could hear the conversation the clerk was having with the guy, they agreed on $600 cash for my set...The clerk took my set and wheeled it behind the counter.  He then pulled out a wad of cash and started counting the bills.  FUCK THAT SHIT.  The 911 operator telling me &amp;quot;DO NOT ENGAGE WAIT FOR OFFICERS,&amp;quot; I was so enraged there was no way I was going to wait and let this fucker walk away with $600.
