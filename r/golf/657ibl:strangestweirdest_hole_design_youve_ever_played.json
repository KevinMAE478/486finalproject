The course by my uncle&amp;#39;s place has two holes that go across a local road. #10 the longer tees are on one side of the road and the fairway is on the other.#18 however, is a three shot par 5. Landing area is just short of the road, then you have to deal with that tree in the middle on your second shot, followed by an uphill third into the green. A really good tee shot can roll across the road, and I&amp;#39;ve hit the road on the fly after one of the greatest tee shots I&amp;#39;ve ever hit. Traffic is very light on that road though, so it&amp;#39;s not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Indian+Lake+Golf+Club/@40.0462634,-78.8575185,226m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89cae33ce78be047:0x9037db1bfc4892fa!8m2!3d40.0447447!4d-78.858636\"&gt;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Indian+Lake+Golf+Club/@40.0462634,-78.8575185,226m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89cae33ce78be047:0x9037db1bfc4892fa!8m2!3d40.0447447!4d-78.858636&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "golf", "name": "t1_dg91nlv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492200003.0, "created_utc": 1492171203.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657ibl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8wu2k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "UTexas18", "parent_id": "t1_dg8dprl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/golf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "i once played a course in scotland where there was a road coming through the fairway like this and there was an electric fence you had to step over, they used it to keep the sheep off the road", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i once played a course in scotland where there was a road coming through the fairway like this and there was an electric fence you had to step over, they used it to keep the sheep off the road&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "golf", "name": "t1_dg8wu2k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492185451.0, "created_utc": 1492156651.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8dprl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ZeiglerJaguar", "parent_id": "t1_dg8dfs6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/golf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's amazing.
