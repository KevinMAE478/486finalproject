I like shaganappi for a city course, not par 72 though.  Mapleridge is also a very popular city course.  If you just want to play nine, Confederation park is also very nice imo (city as well).  The city courses arent cheap but are atleast cheaper than mostly anything else in the city.  You'll likely find golf pretty expensive inside the city.  \n\nIf you're\u200b a lower handicap and are looking for some good golf and don't mind paying ~$100 a round, some good courses are The Winston is very nice, tight, makes you play well (formerly the Elks, had the Mackenzie tour a number of years ago) golf club (semi private, right in the middle of the city), Speargrass is a bit cheaper and is pretty nice, Darcy ranch in Okotoks is good for the price, sirrocco golf club is another nice semi private moderately expensive course.  Alot of people like blue devil as well, I'm not the biggest fan but it's a nice links course.\n\nSome of the best in or around the city that I've been able to play through interclub stuff that you should play if you get the chance are Glencoe club (has 45 holes, practice facility is unreal), priddis (hosts the lpga), Earl Grey is nice (they're getting screwed this year though).
