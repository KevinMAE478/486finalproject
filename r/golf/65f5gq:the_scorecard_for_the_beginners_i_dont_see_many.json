Other times my friend just forgets to take a penalty or forgets to count the tap in. And he always magically finds his tee shots 100 yards deep in the woods. I&amp;#39;ve actually caught him throwing the ball out of the bunker before.... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is I try so hard not to say anything during the round if he is not boasting or bragging and is just cheating to himself. But when I add up my score card at the end and he asks what I got and I say a score in the mid 80&amp;#39;s, his typical response is &amp;quot;oh I&amp;#39;ve been there once already  If I practiced as much as you have in your life I could get out of the 90&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; Some athlete types just can&amp;#39;t handle not being better at a sport than someone else. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "golf", "name": "t1_dgaohn6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492294264.0, "created_utc": 1492265464.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f5gq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f5gq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f5gq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgafc18", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "koung", "parent_id": "t1_dga6wzb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/golf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Personally took me a whole month to get to scratch.
