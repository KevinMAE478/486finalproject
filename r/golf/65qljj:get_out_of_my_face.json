As she is teeing up my ball (she like doing that) the cheap 250 bag for $3 Tee snaps in half so she runs back to get another one. Maybe like 20 second round trip. As she is getting another out of the bag the pair of older guys groan because &amp;quot;we are taking too long&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I blaze a little fade 280 meters that rolls onto the front edge of the green. And after my girl gives me a little clap and picks up the tee she goes and asks the two other guys (without any prompting from me) if they want to &amp;quot;bang up and we can drive the buggies together&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first old guy slices left hard into the parking lot, and the second fella hooks into the water. She says have a good game and jumps in the drivers seat and takes us down to the green. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We finished 11 holes (cheeky 8 and 9 repeat) and had the cart in the wash bay by 4:50. The other pair seemed to be playing the 8th hole as we drove out eating ice creams at 5:10.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "golf", "name": "t1_dgd3b9g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492431114.0, "created_utc": 1492402314.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qljj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd3acy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chimpomatic5000", "parent_id": "t3_65qljj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/golf", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was on a golf trip with couple friends, one of which was an assistant club pro, and a damn big hitter.
