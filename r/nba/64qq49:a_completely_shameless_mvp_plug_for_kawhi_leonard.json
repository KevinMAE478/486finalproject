So, for example, Harden Leads the league in Assists made this season at 894 so far this season. This means that Harden's value in the assists column is 1 (894/894), while Leonard only picks up .289 points because he's only has 28.9% as many assists as Harden this season. In theory, a player could score up to 10 points this way by leading the league in each of the 9 statistics I used. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer | STL% | BLK% | DRPM | DWS | PTs | TS% | ASTs | Ast-TOs | TRB% | Sandwich Score\n------|----|----|----|---|---|---|----|-------|----|--------------\nLeague Leader | 3.1(T. Allen) | 6.4(R. Gobert) | DRPM 6.03(R. Gobert) | 6.0(R. Gobert) | 2553(R. Westbrook) | 64.8%(K Durant) | 894(Harden) | 508(J. Wall) | 25.3%(A. Drummond) | 10\nR. Westbrook | 2.3(.742 Sandwich Points) | 0.9(.141) | -0.59(-.098) | 4.5(.750) | 2553(2.000) | 55.5%(.856) | 832(.931) | 398(.783) | 17.1(.676) | **6.781**\nJ. Harden | 1.9(.613) | 1.0(.156) | -1.81(-.300) | 3.5(.583) | 2329(1.825) | 61.2%(.944) | 894(1.000) | 434(.854) | 12.2(.482) | **6.158**\nL. James | 1.6(.516) | 1.3(.203) | 1.57(.260) | 3.0(.500) | 1954(1.531) | 61.9%(.955) | 646(.723) | 343(.675) | 12.6(.498) | **5.861**\nK. Leonard | 1.6(.516) | 1.8(.281) | 0.85(.141) | 4.7(.783) | 1874(1.468) | 61.2%(.944) | 258(.289) | 106(.209) | 9.8(.387) | **5.373**\n\n\nAs you can see, using this metric actually makes Leonard look like the weakest candidate of the four, which doesn't exactly bode well for Bonner's sandwich metaphor. Despite a negative score for DRPM, Westbrook comes out ahead of all the other MVP candidates. In fact, Leonard finishes dead last, thanks to some poor scoring and assist totals. \n\nI wanted to use this method (using a player's percent of the league leader's value in each stat) to level the playing field for big men like Gobert who may not be in the MVP conversation, but are putting up monster numbers nonetheless. If Bonner wants to make defense 40% of the MVP calculation, Kawhi isn't going to look as good in the box score as a bag man DPOY candidate. \n\nThere are some flaws with this method, of course, namely that it doesn't necessarily reinforce Bonner's argument that defense is (by his own admission) 40% of the game. I'm giving the Red Rocket the Benefit of the doubt here, in no small part because Leonard's defensive on/off stats [may not reflect his actual impact](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kawhi-leonard-is-so-great-at-defense-hes-actually-hurting-the-spurs/) on that side of the floor. I tried to negate this somewhat by including Defensive Win Share, but I would be extremely wary of any metric that suggests Harden is a better defender than Lebron (or 3/4ths as talented as Kawhi). \n\nSo I attempted to negate some of this by using the same methodology that Neil Paine at FiveThirtyEight used in his [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-kawhi-leonard-mvp/) from earlier today. Instead of using the percent of the league leader's numbers in each stat, he just used a player's percentile. So, using the example from above, since Harden leads the league in assists, he's in the 99th percentile for that category, while Westbrook is in the 98.9th percentile because he's second in the league for assists. \n\nI simply added up each players scores again, which in theory means that \n\nLet's take a look at what each player's MVP sandwich looks like using percentiles for each stat:\n\n\n\n\nPlayer | STL% | BLK% | DRPM | DWS | PTs | TS% | ASTs | Ast-TOs | TRB% | Sandwich Score\n------|----|----|----|---|---|---|----|-------|----|--------------\nL. James | 55th Percentile (.550 sandwich points) | .561 | .857 | .825 | .968 | .895 | .974 | .952 | .783 | **8.302**\nK. Leonard | .958 | .730 | .743 | .968 | .958 | .842 | .704 | .683 | .614 | **8.157**\nR. Westbrook | .852 | .381 | .360 | .952 | .995 | .316 | .989 | .968 | .894 | **7.702**\nJ. Harden | .735 | .423 | .099 | .905 | .989 | .816 | .995 | .984 | .746 | **7.681**\n\n\nAgain, Leonard falls short of Bonner's MVP Sandwich crown, this time to King James. Despite a better performance from the defensive stats, Kawhi still doesn't have the assist or rebounding numbers of his peers.\n\nNow, just like the love that always went into your mom's PB&amp;Js, all the ingredients aren't going to find their way into the stat sheet. Top tier wing defenders will never accumulate the same stats as the big men who patrol the paint. Kawhi also must defer rebounding duties to Dedmon, Gasol, or Aldridge, whereas the Thunder intentionally let Westbrook grab the boards, either to reach a triple double or to start a one man fast break locomotive. \n\n**TL;DR using advanced stats in tandem with Matt Bonner's own sandwich formula refutes the Red Rocket's claim that some excellent bread is enough to turn some mediocre fixings into the perfect MVP Sandwich.**\n\n*Determining which statistics to use came largely from today's [article on FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-kawhi-leonard-mvp/). Like the article, I only included players who have played at least 1500 minutes so far this season. Also, when calculating TS% I only included those players who have taken at least 1000 shots so far this season to exclude players like DeAndre Jordan, who are only asked to score in certain situations. (why even consider cheap bologna when you can have some Smoked Black Forest Ham instead?)\n\n**Bonner only mentioned that assists were like the lettuce, but totally neglects things like turnovers, just like he totally neglects mentioning the tomatoes in a sandwich. Well I'm not some wild animal and I don't want tomatoes in my sandwich, and I also don't want my MVP turning the ball over every possession. Assist to turnover ratio sounded good, but I'm not going to include any statistic that has Tyus Jones or Beno Udrih (who's apparently still in the league) in the league's top 5, so I went with assists minus turnovers to include in the fixings category. (But for real, tomatoes are gross and ruin any sandwich they're in)\n\n***With all due respect to [The Medium Fundamental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4810YXU-mjI#t=1m49s) we don't call them whole wheat or sourdough sandwiches \u2014 it's a ham sandwich, or a turkey sandwich, and if you're going to use this metaphor you've got to acknowledge that the point of the game is to get buckets.

Leonard&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1.6(.516)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1.8(.281)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;0.85(.141)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4.7(.783)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1874(1.468)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;61.2%(.944)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;258(.289)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;106(.209)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;9.8(.387)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.373&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, using this metric actually makes Leonard look like the weakest candidate of the four, which doesn&amp;#39;t exactly bode well for Bonner&amp;#39;s sandwich metaphor. Despite a negative score for DRPM, Westbrook comes out ahead of all the other MVP candidates. In fact, Leonard finishes dead last, thanks to some poor scoring and assist totals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use this method (using a player&amp;#39;s percent of the league leader&amp;#39;s value in each stat) to level the playing field for big men like Gobert who may not be in the MVP conversation, but are putting up monster numbers nonetheless. If Bonner wants to make defense 40% of the MVP calculation, Kawhi isn&amp;#39;t going to look as good in the box score as a bag man DPOY candidate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some flaws with this method, of course, namely that it doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily reinforce Bonner&amp;#39;s argument that defense is (by his own admission) 40% of the game. I&amp;#39;m giving the Red Rocket the Benefit of the doubt here, in no small part because Leonard&amp;#39;s defensive on/off stats &lt;a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kawhi-leonard-is-so-great-at-defense-hes-actually-hurting-the-spurs/\"&gt;may not reflect his actual impact&lt;/a&gt; on that side of the floor. I tried to negate this somewhat by including Defensive Win Share, but I would be extremely wary of any metric that suggests Harden is a better defender than Lebron (or 3/4ths as talented as Kawhi). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I attempted to negate some of this by using the same methodology that Neil Paine at FiveThirtyEight used in his &lt;a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-kawhi-leonard-mvp/\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from earlier today. Instead of using the percent of the league leader&amp;#39;s numbers in each stat, he just used a player&amp;#39;s percentile. So, using the example from above, since Harden leads the league in assists, he&amp;#39;s in the 99th percentile for that category, while Westbrook is in the 98.9th percentile because he&amp;#39;s second in the league for assists. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I simply added up each players scores again, which in theory means that &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a look at what each player&amp;#39;s MVP sandwich looks like using percentiles for each stat:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Player&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;STL%&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;BLK%&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;DRPM&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;DWS&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;PTs&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;TS%&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;ASTs&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Ast-TOs&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;TRB%&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Sandwich Score&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;L. James&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;55th Percentile (.550 sandwich points)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.561&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.857&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.825&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.968&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.895&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.974&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.952&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.783&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.302&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;K. Leonard&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.958&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.730&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.743&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.968&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.958&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.842&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.704&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.683&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.614&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.157&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;R. Westbrook&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.852&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.381&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.360&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.952&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.995&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.316&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.989&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.968&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.894&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.702&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;J. Harden&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.735&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.423&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.099&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.905&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.989&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.816&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.995&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.984&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;.746&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.681&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, Leonard falls short of Bonner&amp;#39;s MVP Sandwich crown, this time to King James. Despite a better performance from the defensive stats, Kawhi still doesn&amp;#39;t have the assist or rebounding numbers of his peers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, just like the love that always went into your mom&amp;#39;s PB&amp;amp;Js, all the ingredients aren&amp;#39;t going to find their way into the stat sheet. Top tier wing defenders will never accumulate the same stats as the big men who patrol the paint. Kawhi also must defer rebounding duties to Dedmon, Gasol, or Aldridge, whereas the Thunder intentionally let Westbrook grab the boards, either to reach a triple double or to start a one man fast break locomotive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR using advanced stats in tandem with Matt Bonner&amp;#39;s own sandwich formula refutes the Red Rocket&amp;#39;s claim that some excellent bread is enough to turn some mediocre fixings into the perfect MVP Sandwich.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Determining which statistics to use came largely from today&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-kawhi-leonard-mvp/\"&gt;article on FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt;. Like the article, I only included players who have played at least 1500 minutes so far this season. Also, when calculating TS% I only included those players who have taken at least 1000 shots so far this season to exclude players like DeAndre Jordan, who are only asked to score in certain situations. (why even consider cheap bologna when you can have some Smoked Black Forest Ham instead?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**Bonner only mentioned that assists were like the lettuce, but totally neglects things like turnovers, just like he totally neglects mentioning the tomatoes in a sandwich. Well I&amp;#39;m not some wild animal and I don&amp;#39;t want tomatoes in my sandwich, and I also don&amp;#39;t want my MVP turning the ball over every possession. Assist to turnover ratio sounded good, but I&amp;#39;m not going to include any statistic that has Tyus Jones or Beno Udrih (who&amp;#39;s apparently still in the league) in the league&amp;#39;s top 5, so I went with assists minus turnovers to include in the fixings category. (But for real, tomatoes are gross and ruin any sandwich they&amp;#39;re in)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***With all due respect to &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4810YXU-mjI#t=1m49s\"&gt;The Medium Fundamental&lt;/a&gt; we don&amp;#39;t call them whole wheat or sourdough sandwiches \u2014 it&amp;#39;s a ham sandwich, or a turkey sandwich, and if you&amp;#39;re going to use this metaphor you&amp;#39;ve got to acknowledge that the point of the game is to get buckets. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg4u2cn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491969925.0, "created_utc": 1491941125.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 46}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qq49", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4w3ft", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BeingAwesomeInstead", "parent_id": "t3_64qq49", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;He\u2019s the guy we want to take the big late-game shot \u2026 and the guy we ask to make the big late-game stop.\n\nSo true it hurts\u00a0", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s the guy we want to take the big late-game shot \u2026 and the guy we ask to make the big late-game stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So true it hurts\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg4w3ft", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491972195.0, "created_utc": 1491943395.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qq49", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qq49", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg54knj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Boxcar-Mike", "parent_id": "t1_dg4d2l5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "same.
