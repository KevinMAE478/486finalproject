You know CP3 won;t care about getting shots as long as they are winning, but the ball will be in his hands (read, not Boogies, AD's or Jrue's) the most.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would absolutely LOVE to see CP3 on the Pelicans.  And this from a Spurs fan with no love of Boogie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CP3 with Boogie, AD, and any two wings who can shoot at least league average from 3 would be freaking amazing.  If Jrue would be OK playing off the ball while CP3 is on the court, and then Jrue can be lead guard when CP3 rests, they&amp;#39;d really have something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could turn Solomon Hill into a 3-and-D guy who never needs to create (yeah, he may not be the best at the &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; part, but with two real creators on the court, Boogie and AD to draw teams away, he&amp;#39;d get quality looks all the time).  Or, you know, take and of the other guys who are close to being a 3 and put them in there.  Hell, draft a rookie and put HIM in there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could always have two of AD, Boogie, Jrue and CP3 on the court, with 3 or all 4 for important stretches of games.  That lineup would be extremely strong.  And none of those 4 is a &amp;quot;cannot create a shot, can only catch lobs&amp;quot; kind of guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, could they all coexist with 1 ball?
