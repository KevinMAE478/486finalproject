It&amp;#39;s tough being a Magic fan, we get honeydicked by our owners all the time, from mismanagement of shaq and the three first round picks we got from webber, inability to surround tmac with anything worth while, awful handling of Dwight (late night phone calls) and then churning away at a 30yr old GM who showed promise early into another puppet and firing him after public outcry. I&amp;#39;ve followed this team religiously but man it can suck utter balls being a Magic fan sometimes.
