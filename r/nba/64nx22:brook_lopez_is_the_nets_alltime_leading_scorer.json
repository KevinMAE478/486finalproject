I really think he is just a huge part of the fanbase and on the subreddit you can see how most fans can&amp;#39;t stand him leaving. I have never seen a player be so loved by a fanbase and I love him too. I admit I was keen with him being traded but now when I look at it, like I said unless it is a lotto pick we pull the trigger but still even some fans won&amp;#39;t want the deal as well. I just think Lopez is like a Haslem or Dirk to their teams. Lopez is like  a symbol and I am cool with him staying but I do believe you can build with him still.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg3o1m9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491904537.0, "created_utc": 1491875737.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64nx22", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3pc19", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cityforlife12", "parent_id": "t3_64nx22", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If this isn't on the sidebar I will kill the legend LaVar", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this isn&amp;#39;t on the sidebar I will kill the legend LaVar&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg3pc19", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491906058.0, "created_utc": 1491877258.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64nx22", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3nm5y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bronxbombers2", "parent_id": "t3_64nx22", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": ":')", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;:&amp;#39;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg3nm5y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491904000.0, "created_utc": 1491875200.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64nx22", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3nmxg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cameoiii", "parent_id": "t3_64nx22", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've always been a huge fan of Brook, glad he's up there in Nets history!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been a huge fan of Brook, glad he&amp;#39;s up there in Nets history!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg3nmxg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491904026.0, "created_utc": 1491875226.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64nx22", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3opyw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BrownGuyInNewEngland", "parent_id": "t3_64nx22", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's my center! :')", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my center! :&amp;#39;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg3opyw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491905321.0, "created_utc": 1491876521.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64nx22", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3smi3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ifuckinglovebball", "parent_id": "t3_64nx22", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't know if anyone has the video of it but his points to get the record were pretty awesome.
