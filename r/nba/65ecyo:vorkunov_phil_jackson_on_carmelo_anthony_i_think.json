Melo can play the bitter old man, but he will lose valuable years at trying to win a ring if he doesn&amp;#39;t suck it up and go to a contender, diminish his legacy and especially his NY legacy for not really doing shit in NY but keeping them basement dwellers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg9sfvq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492234440.0, "created_utc": 1492205640.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ecyo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9wcvu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fapstroknave", "parent_id": "t1_dg9rrrj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Knicks aren't google, they're the laughingstock of the league, and virtually any other team is a better basketball situation.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Knicks aren&amp;#39;t google, they&amp;#39;re the laughingstock of the league, and virtually any other team is a better basketball situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg9wcvu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492239613.0, "created_utc": 1492210813.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9rrrj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 30, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BrndyAlxndr", "parent_id": "t1_dg9kdaj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Don't give me that crap, think about this like it's any other job.
