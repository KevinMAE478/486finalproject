That's one of the potential downsides with letting your best player use all the offensive possessions in the regular season - it lowers a team's offensive ceiling and reduces the chances they'll be able to switch into another gear in the post season. In other words, Westbrook's offensive load is already so high that I don't see him being able to carry the Thunder even more in the playoffs. That indicates that they won't be able to outplay a better team. \n\nA better formula might be to sacrifice some regular season wins by letting other players take a greater offensive load in the hope that they can get into a rhythm and become legitimate offensive contributors (and to give Westbrook more rest for the playoffs, and to give him more energy to devote to the defensive end). That way, the Thunder have the option of increasing Westbrook's usage in the playoffs if his teammates aren't able to step it up. As currently stands, his teammates are unlikely to suddenly step it up in the playoffs and Westbrook's usage can't really get any higher, so they're not likely to improve their overall offense in the playoffs. \n", "edited": 1492021102.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not saying this is necessarily the case, but part of the reason they haven&amp;#39;t made the jump could be because Westbrook monopolizes the offense and doesn&amp;#39;t give them any opportunities to get into their rhythm.

The Thunder were built around defensive role players to fit around 2 guys that could score 75 points a night easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adams is a bruiser. Thats what he was good for. Anyone that expected him to become Shaq...lmao. The Thunder are still having to give playing time to Kyle fucking Singler.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one says they SUCK, they are good on the boards and usually good on defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Westbrook however has practically 0 help on the offensive side of the ball, no one else save for Oladipo can create and shoot. And Oladipo has been rather underwhelming tbh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roberson is a great defender but holy shit he looks worse than Tony Allen on offense sometimes. Thats not something you can say about Pat Beverly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trade they made was to give the 2 of them a little more depth to fit their talents, it made the team worse with no Ibaka without Durant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harden has a team 100% CRAFTED to his strengths. Westbrook doesn&amp;#39;t, not yet. They literally JUST lost a top 3 player in the league over the fucking summer.
