That low 67% from the free throw line is just as discouraging as his horrendous form.  His 29% hit rate in high school tells the same story.  If Lonzo even drops to a 35% three point shooter, he will be a very, questionable scorer at the PG position.  If he drops to low 30%, he will be a terrible scorer for a PG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lonzo Ball should be guarding SGs.  He&amp;#39;s too slow laterally to keep up with quick PGs.

I don&amp;#39;t really care about this one but I feel the need to mention it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Josh Jackson&lt;/strong&gt; SF, Kansas&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basic Stats: 16.3ppg, 7.4rpg, 3.0apg &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shooting: 51/38/57 splits.  56% True Shooting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Size: 6&amp;#39;8&amp;quot; in shoes, 6&amp;#39;10&amp;quot; wingspan, 203lbs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why he will be a bust:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name a player who shot 55% from the FT line at 20 years old that became even a passable shooter.  (Ignore that Bruce Bowen existed for the sake of my argument)  The hitch in his shot only makes me more confident that his college shooting was a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Jackson can&amp;#39;t shoot threes, is he really a positive offensive player?  Midrange is being phased out in the NBA, and it&amp;#39;s not like Jackson is some elite finisher at the rim.  Yes he can pass but he&amp;#39;s not a point forward / run your offense through him type.  Yes he can get garbage points like lobs / cuts but that&amp;#39;s an underwhelming offensive package for a top pick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there an elite wing defender who is as skinny as Josh Jackson, with as unimpressive a wingspan as Josh Jackson?  Guys like Iguodala, or Leonard who he&amp;#39;s often compared to, are pterodactyls with enough heft to avoid getting posted up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Josh Jackson is in that Andre Iguodala mold, is that really worth a top 3 pick in the draft?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple off the court incidents this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jayson Tatum&lt;/strong&gt; SF/PF, Duke&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basic Stats: 16.8ppg, 7.3rpg, 2.1apg &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shooting: 45/34/85 splits.  57% True Shooting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Size: 6&amp;#39;8&amp;quot; in shoes, 6&amp;#39;11&amp;quot; wingspan, 205lbs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why he will be a bust:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jab step, pump fake, jab step, contested 19 foot fadeaway.  You don&amp;#39;t want this in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a midrange oriented Jayson Tatum in 2017 is the wing equivalent of taking a post up oriented center like Jahlil Okafor in 2015.  Both are dinosaurs.  Both from Duke as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatum&amp;#39;s subpar finishing at the rim is indicative of his mediocre explosiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defensively, Jayson Tatum is a 3/4 tweener, with the athleticism of a 4 but the frame of a 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you really want to use your top pick on a less athletic, less skilled, worse shooting Carmelo Anthony?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malik Monk&lt;/strong&gt; PG/SG, Kentucky&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basic Stats: 19.8ppg, 2.5rpg, 2.3apg &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shooting: 45/40/82 splits. 58% True Shooting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Size: 6&amp;#39;3&amp;quot; in shoes, 6&amp;#39;6&amp;quot; wingspan, 195lbs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why he will be a bust:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His height/wingspan/weight make him an average sized point guard, but way undersized for a 2 guard.  I&amp;#39;m not sure if your team can take him without a Ben Simmons like point forward type, or a PG that can guard SGs, because Malik Monk will get bodied by NBA 2 guards on defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are we sure he&amp;#39;s an elite 3pt shooter?  He shot sub 40% from 3 on the year on good but not crazy attempts.  Considering it&amp;#39;s his main calling card it&amp;#39;s a tad underwhelming.  Compare his 3pt productivity with D&amp;#39;Angelo Russell and Jamal Murray, who people considered good but not elite shooters, and the only real difference is a few points of FT%.  If he&amp;#39;s just a very good shooter it becomes really hard to make a case for him in the top 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athleticism doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you don&amp;#39;t use it.  Monk didn&amp;#39;t get to the rim nearly enough and had a very low FT rate.  These numbers indicate that he&amp;#39;ll be coming off screens mostly in the NBA, is a perimeter oriented JJ Redick type worth a top 5 pick to you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defensively his size showed consistently, and refer to the Markelle Fultz section on defensive effort vs defensive tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, what does this guy do other than score?  If the shots aren&amp;#39;t falling how is he producing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;De&amp;#39;Aaron Fox&lt;/strong&gt; PG, Kentucky&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basic Stats: 16.7ppg, 3.9rpg, 4.6apg &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shooting: 48/25/74 splits.  55% True Shooting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Size: 6&amp;#39;3&amp;quot; in shoes, 6&amp;#39;5&amp;quot; wingspan, 173lbs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why he will be a bust:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you run an NBA offense when the defense can go under on every pick and roll?  Fox&amp;#39;s 24.6% from three and poor mid range shooting could kill his offensive effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like for real this guy can&amp;#39;t shoot at all.  I can&amp;#39;t emphasize it enough.  Ask Denver Nuggets / Orlando Magic fans about how it is to build around a PG who can&amp;#39;t shoot.  I watched enough MCW enough to know this problem well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a great playmaker.  Score first.  4.6 assists per game indicative of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very average wingspan and very skinny frame is discouraging for a guy advertised as a great defender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His defensive decision making is inconsistent.  There are real lapses in judgement at times, despite his motor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dennis Smith Jr.&lt;/strong&gt; PG, NC State&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basic Stats: 18.1ppg, 4.6rpg, 6.2apg &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shooting: 46/36/72 splits.  56% True Shooting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Size: 6&amp;#39;2&amp;quot; in shoes, 6&amp;#39;3&amp;quot; wingspan, 195lbs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why he will be a bust:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His shooting is a mirage.  Lowish FT% + bad high school production + only shot threes off the dribble + inconsistent form = inflated shooting numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where is the effort, ever?  Are you going to use a top pick on a guy who never tried?  You&amp;#39;re drafting a person as well as a player.  Is this a guy you want on your team for 10 years?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defensively he will be terrible.  Despite being listed at 6&amp;#39;3&amp;quot; (that&amp;#39;s a lie), he&amp;#39;s very undersized, and has a very bad wingspan.  Again his effort will be a huge problem on this end, as it was in college when he didn&amp;#39;t fight through screens, and lost his man frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had complete duds of games far too often.  Very inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He still has injury concerns.  His very explosive game could be taxing on the knees.  His body already betrayed him once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Isaac&lt;/strong&gt; SF/PF, Florida State&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basic Stats: 12.0ppg, 7.8rpg, 1.2apg&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shooting: 51/35/78 splits.  61% True Shooting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Size: 6&amp;#39;11&amp;quot; in shoes, 7&amp;#39;1&amp;quot; wingspan, 205lbs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why he will be a bust:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He can&amp;#39;t do anything off the dribble.  I mean it.  He can&amp;#39;t even attack a hard closeout.  This means he&amp;#39;s pretty much just spot up and garbage points only on offense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is a very bad passer, and generally has a bad feel for the game on offense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His three point shot is okay, but not a sure thing.  His 78% on free throws is very good but his 3pt attempts were low, his 35% from three is average, and it is just the college 3pt line.  This is a problem because...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he can&amp;#39;t shoot threes, he&amp;#39;s a complete negative on offense. Yeah he&amp;#39;ll be able to get lobs and cut to the rim, but he&amp;#39;s honestly too unskilled off the dribble to play SF in my opinion.  He&amp;#39;d be much better used at PF.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He needs to gain weight pretty badly.  This is especially true if you agree that he&amp;#39;ll be best used at PF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People love the idea of him because he&amp;#39;s already a role player, but NBA role players are generally still skilled enough to be &amp;quot;the guy&amp;quot; in college (Tony Allen averaged 16ppg).  He might just be totally out of place in the NBA offensive skillset wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My best player comparison for him is Robert Covington.  He&amp;#39;s bigger and can block more shots, but has worse hands defensively and is a much worse shooter in college.  Are you going to spend a top pick on that kind of player?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauri Markkanen&lt;/strong&gt; PF/C, Arizona&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basic Stats: 15.6ppg, 7.4rpg, 0.9apg &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shooting: 49/42/84 splits.  64% True Shooting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Size: 7&amp;#39;0&amp;quot; in shoes, N/A wingspan, 225lbs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why he will be a bust:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauri Markkanen is really slow.  Defensively, this will cause big problems and likely means that he&amp;#39;ll need to play center because he&amp;#39;ll be too slow to keep up with NBA PFs.  He might get played off the floor entirely against teams that can punish him in pick and roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;#39;t have a great post up game, and projects as an unremarkable rebounder.  Kind of has the skillset of a 7&amp;#39;0&amp;quot; wing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will struggle at center because he never blocks shots ever.  Seriously, it&amp;#39;s pretty impressive a 7&amp;#39;0&amp;quot; guy can be so bad at protecting the blocking shots / protecting the rim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t show much passing ability in college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When teams put athletic wings on him (like Oregon twice), he was completely shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you going to spend a top pick on a bigger, slower, Channing Frye?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frank Ntilikina&lt;/strong&gt; PG/SG, Strasbourg &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basic Stats: 4.8ppg, 2.0rpg, 1.0apg &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shooting: 50/46/56 splits &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Size: 6&amp;#39;5&amp;quot; in shoes, 6&amp;#39;11&amp;quot; wingspan (not confirmed), 170lbs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why he will be a bust:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only impressive stats Ntilikina put up this year were against euro high schoolers at the u18 tournament.  He can&amp;#39;t carve out a role on his professional team in Strasbourg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s too slow to guard NBA PGs, despite his impressive length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His handle is not NBA caliber.  I&amp;#39;m not convinced he can bring the ball down the court against heavy pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can he run an NBA offense?  If not, he&amp;#39;ll be relegated to an off ball role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he&amp;#39;s an off ball player who is best at guarding SGs, doesn&amp;#39;t that just make him a SG?  His profile isn&amp;#39;t all that impressive as a SG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s simply not proven enough to use a top pick on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**Read this first:** First of all, I think most of these players will be very good.

I don't really care about this one but I feel the need to mention it.\n\n**Josh Jackson** SF, Kansas\n\nBasic Stats: 16.3ppg, 7.4rpg, 3.0apg \n\nShooting: 51/38/57 splits.  56% True Shooting\n\nSize: 6'8\" in shoes, 6'10\" wingspan, 203lbs\n\n*Why he will be a bust:*\n\n* Name a player who shot 55% from the FT line at 20 years old that became even a passable shooter.  (Ignore that Bruce Bowen existed for the sake of my argument)  The hitch in his shot only makes me more confident that his college shooting was a mirage.\n\n* If Jackson can't shoot threes, is he really a positive offensive player?  Midrange is being phased out in the NBA, and it's not like Jackson is some elite finisher at the rim.  Yes he can pass but he's not a point forward / run your offense through him type.  Yes he can get garbage points like lobs / cuts but that's an underwhelming offensive package for a top pick.\n\n* Is there an elite wing defender who is as skinny as Josh Jackson, with as unimpressive a wingspan as Josh Jackson?  Guys like Iguodala, or Leonard who he's often compared to, are pterodactyls with enough heft to avoid getting posted up. \n\n* If Josh Jackson is in that Andre Iguodala mold, is that really worth a top 3 pick in the draft?\n\n* Multiple off the court incidents this season.\n\n**Jayson Tatum** SF/PF, Duke\n\nBasic Stats: 16.8ppg, 7.3rpg, 2.1apg \n\nShooting: 45/34/85 splits.  57% True Shooting\n\nSize: 6'8\" in shoes, 6'11\" wingspan, 205lbs\n\n*Why he will be a bust:*\n\n* Jab step, pump fake, jab step, contested 19 foot fadeaway.  You don't want this in your life.\n\n* Taking a midrange oriented Jayson Tatum in 2017 is the wing equivalent of taking a post up oriented center like Jahlil Okafor in 2015.  Both are dinosaurs.  Both from Duke as well.\n\n* Tatum's subpar finishing at the rim is indicative of his mediocre explosiveness.\n\n* Defensively, Jayson Tatum is a 3/4 tweener, with the athleticism of a 4 but the frame of a 3.\n\n* Do you really want to use your top pick on a less athletic, less skilled, worse shooting Carmelo Anthony?\n\n**Malik Monk** PG/SG, Kentucky\n\nBasic Stats: 19.8ppg, 2.5rpg, 2.3apg \n\nShooting: 45/40/82 splits. 58% True Shooting\n\nSize: 6'3\" in shoes, 6'6\" wingspan, 195lbs\n\n*Why he will be a bust:*\n\n* His height/wingspan/weight make him an average sized point guard, but way undersized for a 2 guard.  I'm not sure if your team can take him without a Ben Simmons like point forward type, or a PG that can guard SGs, because Malik Monk will get bodied by NBA 2 guards on defense.\n\n* Are we sure he's an elite 3pt shooter?  He shot sub 40% from 3 on the year on good but not crazy attempts.  Considering it's his main calling card it's a tad underwhelming.  Compare his 3pt productivity with D'Angelo Russell and Jamal Murray, who people considered good but not elite shooters, and the only real difference is a few points of FT%.  If he's just a very good shooter it becomes really hard to make a case for him in the top 5.\n\n* Athleticism doesn't matter if you don't use it.  Monk didn't get to the rim nearly enough and had a very low FT rate.  These numbers indicate that he'll be coming off screens mostly in the NBA, is a perimeter oriented JJ Redick type worth a top 5 pick to you?\n\n* Defensively his size showed consistently, and refer to the Markelle Fultz section on defensive effort vs defensive tools.\n\n* Overall, what does this guy do other than score?  If the shots aren't falling how is he producing?\n\n**De'Aaron Fox** PG, Kentucky\n\nBasic Stats: 16.7ppg, 3.9rpg, 4.6apg \n\nShooting: 48/25/74 splits.  55% True Shooting\n\nSize: 6'3\" in shoes, 6'5\" wingspan, 173lbs\n\n*Why he will be a bust:*\n\n* How do you run an NBA offense when the defense can go under on every pick and roll?  Fox's 24.6% from three and poor mid range shooting could kill his offensive effectiveness.\n\n* Like for real this guy can't shoot at all.  I can't emphasize it enough.  Ask Denver Nuggets / Orlando Magic fans about how it is to build around a PG who can't shoot.  I watched enough MCW enough to know this problem well.\n\n* Not a great playmaker.  Score first.  4.6 assists per game indicative of this.\n\n* Very average wingspan and very skinny frame is discouraging for a guy advertised as a great defender.\n\n* His defensive decision making is inconsistent.  There are real lapses in judgement at times, despite his motor.\n\n**Dennis Smith Jr.** PG, NC State\n\nBasic Stats: 18.1ppg, 4.6rpg, 6.2apg \n\nShooting: 46/36/72 splits.  56% True Shooting\n\nSize: 6'2\" in shoes, 6'3\" wingspan, 195lbs\n\n*Why he will be a bust:*\n\n* His shooting is a mirage.  Lowish FT% + bad high school production + only shot threes off the dribble + inconsistent form = inflated shooting numbers.\n\n* Where is the effort, ever?  Are you going to use a top pick on a guy who never tried?  You're drafting a person as well as a player.  Is this a guy you want on your team for 10 years?\n\n* Defensively he will be terrible.  Despite being listed at 6'3\" (that's a lie), he's very undersized, and has a very bad wingspan.  Again his effort will be a huge problem on this end, as it was in college when he didn't fight through screens, and lost his man frequently.\n\n* He had complete duds of games far too often.  Very inconsistent.\n\n* He still has injury concerns.  His very explosive game could be taxing on the knees.  His body already betrayed him once.\n\n**Jonathan Isaac** SF/PF, Florida State\n\nBasic Stats: 12.0ppg, 7.8rpg, 1.2apg\n\nShooting: 51/35/78 splits.  61% True Shooting\n\nSize: 6'11\" in shoes, 7'1\" wingspan, 205lbs\n\n*Why he will be a bust:*\n\n* He can't do anything off the dribble.  I mean it.  He can't even attack a hard closeout.  This means he's pretty much just spot up and garbage points only on offense.\n\n* He is a very bad passer, and generally has a bad feel for the game on offense.\n\n* His three point shot is okay, but not a sure thing.  His 78% on free throws is very good but his 3pt attempts were low, his 35% from three is average, and it is just the college 3pt line.  This is a problem because...\n\n* If he can't shoot threes, he's a complete negative on offense. Yeah he'll be able to get lobs and cut to the rim, but he's honestly too unskilled off the dribble to play SF in my opinion.  He'd be much better used at PF.  \n\n* He needs to gain weight pretty badly.  This is especially true if you agree that he'll be best used at PF.\n\n* People love the idea of him because he's already a role player, but NBA role players are generally still skilled enough to be \"the guy\" in college (Tony Allen averaged 16ppg).  He might just be totally out of place in the NBA offensive skillset wise.\n\n* My best player comparison for him is Robert Covington.  He's bigger and can block more shots, but has worse hands defensively and is a much worse shooter in college.  Are you going to spend a top pick on that kind of player?\n\n**Lauri Markkanen** PF/C, Arizona\n\nBasic Stats: 15.6ppg, 7.4rpg, 0.9apg \n\nShooting: 49/42/84 splits.  64% True Shooting\n\nSize: 7'0\" in shoes, N/A wingspan, 225lbs\n\n*Why he will be a bust:*\n\n* Lauri Markkanen is really slow.  Defensively, this will cause big problems and likely means that he'll need to play center because he'll be too slow to keep up with NBA PFs.  He might get played off the floor entirely against teams that can punish him in pick and roll.\n\n* He doesn't have a great post up game, and projects as an unremarkable rebounder.  Kind of has the skillset of a 7'0\" wing.\n\n* Will struggle at center because he never blocks shots ever.  Seriously, it's pretty impressive a 7'0\" guy can be so bad at protecting the blocking shots / protecting the rim.\n\n* He didn't show much passing ability in college.\n\n* When teams put athletic wings on him (like Oregon twice), he was completely shut down.\n\n* Are you going to spend a top pick on a bigger, slower, Channing Frye?\n\n**Frank Ntilikina** PG/SG, Strasbourg \n\nBasic Stats: 4.8ppg, 2.0rpg, 1.0apg \n\nShooting: 50/46/56 splits \n\nSize: 6'5\" in shoes, 6'11\" wingspan (not confirmed), 170lbs\n\n*Why he will be a bust:*\n\n* The only impressive stats Ntilikina put up this year were against euro high schoolers at the u18 tournament.  He can't carve out a role on his professional team in Strasbourg.\n\n* He's too slow to guard NBA PGs, despite his impressive length.\n\n* His handle is not NBA caliber.  I'm not convinced he can bring the ball down the court against heavy pressure.\n\n* Can he run an NBA offense?  If not, he'll be relegated to an off ball role.\n\n* If he's an off ball player who is best at guarding SGs, doesn't that just make him a SG?  His profile isn't all that impressive as a SG.\n\n* He's simply not proven enough to use a top pick on.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "65e6d2", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 1815, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JoelEmbeast", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65e6d2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.nba", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "edited": 1492234068.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "bwSixers", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/nba/comments/65e6d2/oc_why_every_prospect_in_the_2017_nba_draft_will/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492222348.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/65e6d2/oc_why_every_prospect_in_the_2017_nba_draft_will/", "author_flair_text": "Sixers Bandwagon", "quarantine": false, "title": "[OC] Why every prospect in the 2017 NBA draft will be a bust.", "created_utc": 1492193548.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 490, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1815}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e6d2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e6d2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e6d2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ooke", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 118, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JoelEmbeast", "parent_id": "t1_dg9onpd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes.

The only other team I think he fits better on is Milwaukee, with Giannis initiating, Brogdon handling 2s, and Monk splashing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to any counter-counterpoints!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg9pnwu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492230979.0, "created_utc": 1492202179.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e6d2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e6d2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e6d2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e6d2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga5ymf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Secondstrike23", "parent_id": "t1_dg9s5gq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Justice Winslow 2.0", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Winslow 2.0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dga5ymf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492252703.0, "created_utc": 1492223903.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9s5gq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dayanks1234", "parent_id": "t1_dg9j3q1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "idk, i think with the right team and culture, he should be fine. if he somehow fell to the Heat, i think that team's team style would be really good for him", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;idk, i think with the right team and culture, he should be fine. if he somehow fell to the Heat, i think that team&amp;#39;s team style would be really good for him&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg9s5gq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492234066.0, "created_utc": 1492205266.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9j3q1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 57, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JoelEmbeast", "parent_id": "t1_dg9iqld", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm not too worried about them but for the sake of the post you are right.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not too worried about them but for the sake of the post you are right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg9j3q1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492223082.0, "created_utc": 1492194282.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 57}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9iqld", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 66, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ronxpopeil", "parent_id": "t3_65e6d2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good post should also include Jacksons off court issues", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good post should also include Jacksons off court issues&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dg9iqld", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492222648.0, "created_utc": 1492193848.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 66}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e6d2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e6d2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9rp9m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "coffee_black_7", "parent_id": "t1_dg9l8he", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I like him.
