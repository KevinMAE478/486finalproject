We have Malone who is the predecessor to LeBron: every bit as big and strong, but no where near as fast, and lacking the court vision. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost like it took an unnatural love child from Magic, Drexler, and Malone in order for LeBron to exist. Malone was a unique physical specimen for the time, but only half of the equation, and more importantly the 2nd half of the legendary Jazz PNR....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other half of that PNR was Stockton, unquestionably a HOF&amp;#39;er and one of the 50 best players in NBA history, but if I&amp;#39;m making an &amp;quot;amazing athletes&amp;quot; list...I&amp;#39;m having a lot of trouble finding a place for Stockton in the top 100, let alone the top 10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Point being, the Jazz didn&amp;#39;t impose their very obvious and predictable offensive weapon over their opponents by having 2 physically dominant players with an athletic edge over their opponents. There were plenty of more athletic and defensively minded point guards in the west at the time that could/should have been able to shut down a less athletic John Stockton: Gary Peyton and Kevin Johnson immediately come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what made the Jazz&amp;#39;s success so crazy (if not boring), is that it was run ad nauseam, by a less than physical specimen (in Stockton) at the point. It&amp;#39;s unlikely that the Jazz would have had the same level of success if not for Malone, but it was also the not terribly athletic Stockton that was setting the table for Malone too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dgagdmh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492273395.0, "created_utc": 1492244595.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaffqr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Herculix", "parent_id": "t1_dgaehkv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sometimes when it comes to amazing athletes, you can know it's coming and it just doesn't matter", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when it comes to amazing athletes, you can know it&amp;#39;s coming and it just doesn&amp;#39;t matter&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nba", "name": "t1_dgaffqr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492270725.0, "created_utc": 1492241925.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaehkv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 21, "report_reasons": null, "author": "namblaotie", "parent_id": "t1_dga93mw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In fairness, the Jazz seemed to make it to the finals every year during the mid-late 90's only to be beat by the Bulls.
