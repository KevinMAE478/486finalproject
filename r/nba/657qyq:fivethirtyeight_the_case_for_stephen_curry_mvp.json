When you draw that coverage away from the paint, you&amp;#39;re historically good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rondo has never improved his teammates the way Steph Curry does, despite his assist totals. The historically best offensive players are the guys who consistently anchor the best offenses in the league, not the guys who can use nearly every possession to drag their team to &lt;a href=\"https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/offensive-efficiency\"&gt;16th overall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;16th overall might still be an impressive bump for this OKC team, but we still really overrate raw stats over being the best possible anchor for your team. Tim Duncan&amp;#39;s defensive value wasn&amp;#39;t captured in his block totals. It was the way he made everyone on that team a better defender. KG was the same.
