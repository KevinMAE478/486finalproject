The final area is a bit more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 : retro/arcade minigames are utter fucking trash. They&amp;#39;re not hard they&amp;#39;re just really bad and unfun. They should have left them completely out of the game they add nothing and make the game actively worse until you wisely decide to just ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4: the unexpanded world 2 was imo not fun at all and feels aimless, the expanded section with the floating castle/maze/puzzle theme worked pretty well, world 1 is ok , world 3 is way better, world 4 is pretty nice (haven&amp;#39;t seen world 5 yet). God forbid you also enter the gloomy grotto in world 2, I imagine quite a few people just decide to quit there as it comes during the point where the game has thrown all its flaws at you in a row for the last 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly there is a solid 8/10 platformer there, but they just made the experience SO much worse than it should have been during like hour 2 to 5-6.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they were to fix the bad camera spots in world 1, fix the feedback issues with the game (ice vs glass, edible buffs), make the 3rd and 4th path in the hub world more intuitive and simply remove the stupid stupid retro arcade games from the game then it would be a really solid game with 4 good worlds and one mediocre world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg6zh0j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492078587.0, "created_utc": 1492049787.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z4uk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z4uk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z4uk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6i0ig", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dark_Bean", "parent_id": "t1_dg6ht00", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Wait, that's not a trick that's an addiction\" is my new catchphrase", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait, that&amp;#39;s not a trick that&amp;#39;s an addiction&amp;quot; is my new catchphrase&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg6i0ig", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492057571.0, "created_utc": 1492028771.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ht00", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 26, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Racecarlock", "parent_id": "t1_dg69nxq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The trick is to binge watch 96 episodes a day, including the ones you've seen before, until you get used to it.\n\nWait, that's not a trick.
