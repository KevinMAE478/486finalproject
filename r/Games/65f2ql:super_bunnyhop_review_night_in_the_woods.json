I don't care about having kids, or a family, or a house, or car, or any of that.  But I want to have a daily routine that makes me happy, and I'm nowhere near that.  Every job I've had, except one, has left me dreading waking up in the morning, and that becomes exhausting very quickly.  I'm not content with waking up everyday just to \"survive\".  What the hell's the point of being alive for the sake of it?  I've known people working 2-3 jobs with like 3 free hours a night, and I don't even see the point of existing with a routine that depressing.  If you do it, and you're happy, more power to you, but I'd frankly rather end it than do that for more than a month.  \n \nEven when I find things I don't mind doing, there are other problems like workplace culture/management.  For example, I've done HR/resume writing/hiring work several times, despite having no education in it.  It was something I did a bit at a start-up after interning because we needed someone to do it, and I happened to do a few more times for other companies in addition to other responsibilities.    \n\nAt my last job, I had several people come up to me after a meeting and thank me for making it not feel like an interview.  They said I made it the whole process a lot more pleasant, and that it was easy for them to be open and honest with me because they didn't feel like we were playing some kind of stupid game.  People would come in ready to bullshit, and you'd see on their face over time that they realized I didn't want them to BS me.  I was fully aware of how stupid the usual interview process is.  \n\nThat all felt pretty good -- at least until someone ratted me out, and management came down hard on me for being too \"informal\" with applicants and made me restructure it to do it their way,  Surprise, surprise, that resulted in the process being far less enjoyable, and it becoming a lot harder for me to suss what kind of person they really were.  Plus, I felt like an asshole sitting there like a stiff asking these stupid questions with obvious answers.  I'm not even going to get in to all the other stupid shit that happened there.  We had an ad sales team that management would pretty much set up to fail and then chew out afterwards.  They were bright young guys too, and they were being sabotaged by people with big egos and no wisdom.  The whole setup was just fucked.  \n\nI don't want to spend my life working for assholes and idiots, and the arbitrary 9-5 thing drives me nuts.  The idea of spending 4+ hours sitting around \"pretending to work\" for a shitty wage kills me.  When I worked at a startup, hours were whatever we needed to get shit done.  If work was over in 2 hours, we left.  If we needed to stay overnight to finish a project, we did.  If one of us wasn't feeling well, or the weather was shit, or we all already had stuff we were working on, we'd just work from home over Skype and Gmail and maybe grab lunch or dinner and talk.  It was about the work, not about some stupid hierarchy or tradition or whatever else.  My boss and I treated each other like friends and he gave me great opportunities to learn without ever lording his position over me.  Plus, you got back what you put in to it.  If you made a big sale, or created a successful campaign, or created a big opportunity for the company, you received a large chunk of the reward.  It wasn't like so many other jobs where you can make 6 figures for the company, and they'll give you a watch or a pat on the back.  There are very few dream jobs like the one I'm describing.  The money wasn't even super great, and you sort of just went week to week trying to make things work, but it was the people and the whole setup of it that I would've been happy to stay with almost forever.  \n\nHell, I only even found that one due to a random lucky break, and I felt like an imposter the whole time because everyone was insanely smart, talented, good-looking and they all seemed so invested in what they were doing.  I mean, I loved working there, and I was very loyal to those people, but at the same time, I would've been perfectly happy loafing around at home selfishly pursuing my hobbies if I had the money.  I think work and building a business **was** their hobby, and it's just never been mine.      \n\nI find that so many people act as if you're spoiled for wanting to be happy, and that's just insane to me.  People hate and bitch about the \"expected\" routine of adult life, but nobody does anything to try and change it -- and if you even suggest that you're not satisfied with the status quo, they get upset at you for not wanting to suffer like them.  How are things supposed to get better if you can't stand the thought of anyone else having it better than you?  Working life  doesn't have to be the way it is.  The established routine of 8-8-8 (more like 11-6-6 for me) is completely arbitrary and has existed for less than a century.   Yet everybody acts like it's immutable, and it's been this way since the beginning of time.  \n\nI finally had enough at my last job when I found out my supervisor was literally making shit up about me and constantly shit talking me to the boss.  It was starting to cause problems, so I confronted them about it.  When I did, the boss basically called me a liar, so I just said fuck it and left.  Now I'm sitting here wondering what the hell I do next.  I don't want to just pick up and go work for another set of assholes with the same kind of routine that I hate again.  Most of the job postings I find look like the same bullshit, and the ones that do sound good are positions that I'm honestly not qualified for, or I apply and rarely hear back.  I'm not deluded.  I know that my skillset just really isn't valuable enough to make me a hot commodity for any of these forward-thinking businesses, so it's not like I feel I'm being done some big injustice here.  \n\nI know my friend/boss from the startup job could technically help me out, but I sort of let him down the last time he set up an opportunity for me (I was too young and wasn't ready), and I've been on sort of a dark path since then, so I'd really rather just leave him with the good impression he had of me.  He always thought I was this super bright lovable dude who would really go places, so I'd prefer not to disappoint him by telling him what a mess my life has been since.  \n\nI realize that the world owes me nothing, but I'm stuck here for the time being, and it's a struggle to try and find an existence that I can live with.  The last few jobs I had were turning me into someone I don't want to be.  I was becoming angry and miserable and starting to lash out at people around me.  I almost started several fights on the subway commuting back home because I just had all this pent up frustration.  I didn't even care that I still had my office clothes on.  It didn't help that I started having some significant physical health issues that just made matters worse by leaving me in pain everyday.  I'm not justifying my behavior either, but I'm just communicating the fact that I was *deeply* dissatisfied with my routine, and that no amount of someone going \"Well, other people have it worse\" is going to help.  Other people's misery isn't going to make me any happier.  Is it in my power to change all of that?  Yes, but it's going to be me swimming upstream all the way, and I'm just so tired at this point.

I&amp;#39;m not content with waking up everyday just to &amp;quot;survive&amp;quot;.  What the hell&amp;#39;s the point of being alive for the sake of it?  I&amp;#39;ve known people working 2-3 jobs with like 3 free hours a night, and I don&amp;#39;t even see the point of existing with a routine that depressing.  If you do it, and you&amp;#39;re happy, more power to you, but I&amp;#39;d frankly rather end it than do that for more than a month.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even when I find things I don&amp;#39;t mind doing, there are other problems like workplace culture/management.  For example, I&amp;#39;ve done HR/resume writing/hiring work several times, despite having no education in it.  It was something I did a bit at a start-up after interning because we needed someone to do it, and I happened to do a few more times for other companies in addition to other responsibilities.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At my last job, I had several people come up to me after a meeting and thank me for making it not feel like an interview.  They said I made it the whole process a lot more pleasant, and that it was easy for them to be open and honest with me because they didn&amp;#39;t feel like we were playing some kind of stupid game.  People would come in ready to bullshit, and you&amp;#39;d see on their face over time that they realized I didn&amp;#39;t want them to BS me.  I was fully aware of how stupid the usual interview process is.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That all felt pretty good -- at least until someone ratted me out, and management came down hard on me for being too &amp;quot;informal&amp;quot; with applicants and made me restructure it to do it their way,  Surprise, surprise, that resulted in the process being far less enjoyable, and it becoming a lot harder for me to suss what kind of person they really were.  Plus, I felt like an asshole sitting there like a stiff asking these stupid questions with obvious answers.  I&amp;#39;m not even going to get in to all the other stupid shit that happened there.  We had an ad sales team that management would pretty much set up to fail and then chew out afterwards.  They were bright young guys too, and they were being sabotaged by people with big egos and no wisdom.  The whole setup was just fucked.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to spend my life working for assholes and idiots, and the arbitrary 9-5 thing drives me nuts.  The idea of spending 4+ hours sitting around &amp;quot;pretending to work&amp;quot; for a shitty wage kills me.  When I worked at a startup, hours were whatever we needed to get shit done.  If work was over in 2 hours, we left.  If we needed to stay overnight to finish a project, we did.  If one of us wasn&amp;#39;t feeling well, or the weather was shit, or we all already had stuff we were working on, we&amp;#39;d just work from home over Skype and Gmail and maybe grab lunch or dinner and talk.  It was about the work, not about some stupid hierarchy or tradition or whatever else.  My boss and I treated each other like friends and he gave me great opportunities to learn without ever lording his position over me.  Plus, you got back what you put in to it.  If you made a big sale, or created a successful campaign, or created a big opportunity for the company, you received a large chunk of the reward.  It wasn&amp;#39;t like so many other jobs where you can make 6 figures for the company, and they&amp;#39;ll give you a watch or a pat on the back.  There are very few dream jobs like the one I&amp;#39;m describing.  The money wasn&amp;#39;t even super great, and you sort of just went week to week trying to make things work, but it was the people and the whole setup of it that I would&amp;#39;ve been happy to stay with almost forever.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hell, I only even found that one due to a random lucky break, and I felt like an imposter the whole time because everyone was insanely smart, talented, good-looking and they all seemed so invested in what they were doing.  I mean, I loved working there, and I was very loyal to those people, but at the same time, I would&amp;#39;ve been perfectly happy loafing around at home selfishly pursuing my hobbies if I had the money.  I think work and building a business &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; their hobby, and it&amp;#39;s just never been mine.      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find that so many people act as if you&amp;#39;re spoiled for wanting to be happy, and that&amp;#39;s just insane to me.  People hate and bitch about the &amp;quot;expected&amp;quot; routine of adult life, but nobody does anything to try and change it -- and if you even suggest that you&amp;#39;re not satisfied with the status quo, they get upset at you for not wanting to suffer like them.  How are things supposed to get better if you can&amp;#39;t stand the thought of anyone else having it better than you?  Working life  doesn&amp;#39;t have to be the way it is.  The established routine of 8-8-8 (more like 11-6-6 for me) is completely arbitrary and has existed for less than a century.   Yet everybody acts like it&amp;#39;s immutable, and it&amp;#39;s been this way since the beginning of time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally had enough at my last job when I found out my supervisor was literally making shit up about me and constantly shit talking me to the boss.  It was starting to cause problems, so I confronted them about it.  When I did, the boss basically called me a liar, so I just said fuck it and left.  Now I&amp;#39;m sitting here wondering what the hell I do next.  I don&amp;#39;t want to just pick up and go work for another set of assholes with the same kind of routine that I hate again.  Most of the job postings I find look like the same bullshit, and the ones that do sound good are positions that I&amp;#39;m honestly not qualified for, or I apply and rarely hear back.  I&amp;#39;m not deluded.  I know that my skillset just really isn&amp;#39;t valuable enough to make me a hot commodity for any of these forward-thinking businesses, so it&amp;#39;s not like I feel I&amp;#39;m being done some big injustice here.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know my friend/boss from the startup job could technically help me out, but I sort of let him down the last time he set up an opportunity for me (I was too young and wasn&amp;#39;t ready), and I&amp;#39;ve been on sort of a dark path since then, so I&amp;#39;d really rather just leave him with the good impression he had of me.  He always thought I was this super bright lovable dude who would really go places, so I&amp;#39;d prefer not to disappoint him by telling him what a mess my life has been since.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize that the world owes me nothing, but I&amp;#39;m stuck here for the time being, and it&amp;#39;s a struggle to try and find an existence that I can live with.  The last few jobs I had were turning me into someone I don&amp;#39;t want to be.  I was becoming angry and miserable and starting to lash out at people around me.  I almost started several fights on the subway commuting back home because I just had all this pent up frustration.  I didn&amp;#39;t even care that I still had my office clothes on.  It didn&amp;#39;t help that I started having some significant physical health issues that just made matters worse by leaving me in pain everyday.  I&amp;#39;m not justifying my behavior either, but I&amp;#39;m just communicating the fact that I was &lt;em&gt;deeply&lt;/em&gt; dissatisfied with my routine, and that no amount of someone going &amp;quot;Well, other people have it worse&amp;quot; is going to help.  Other people&amp;#39;s misery isn&amp;#39;t going to make me any happier.  Is it in my power to change all of that?  Yes, but it&amp;#39;s going to be me swimming upstream all the way, and I&amp;#39;m just so tired at this point. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dgcl3cu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492406038.0, "created_utc": 1492377238.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc76be", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HugoTap", "parent_id": "t1_dga8fpa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've been reading many of these posts and wondering how best to respond to some of the things people are struggling with.

It's easy to say it's a \"mental disorder\" issue; I don't think it's so much that, or that your fate is completely tied to your brain chemistry.

That is cliche, but it keeps things much more grounded, makes the decisions much more clear, makes the motivation for live that much more important.

Sometimes you realize that the destination isn't where you want to be, and so you mark another destination instead.\n\nThat's I think the ultimate difference.  You're not as hopeless or as misfit as you *think* you are.  You're learning that much of what you're told is just stupidly wrong.

I've met people like him, hell I live with someone who constantly berates me for being 'weak' and 'pathetic' as a human being because of my mental issues.\n\nWell, are you weak and pathetic?  And if you are, what are you doing to overcome it?\n\nThat's the crux of it.  I, as an individual, have my own difficulties, my own challenges, my own problems.  There's only so much to care for anyone else, and if they're coming off as... well, just generally fucking terrible, it's not going to bode well.\n\nImagine you're not Mae, but you're one of the other townsfolk.  Heck, imagine the game's protagonist is Bea, getting your life together when Mae, the pampered little girl that had the ticket out of the town comes back, miserable as ever while you've been fighting tooth and nail to survive.  Mae is a *horrible fucking person*.  Get yourself out of Mae's situation first and just look at what she does.  You might feel like her and sympathize and empathize (and again, I empathize with her situation), but it absolutely doesn't preclude that sort of shitty behavior.  \n\nYour worth to others is dependent on your actions not on your feelings and failings.  That regardless of *your* problems, *everyone else has problems as well*, in some cases far more detrimental.  And that ultimately, they don't have to be helping you at all.\n\nIt's annoying that Mae's mom keeps asking about her future.  Mae's response is one of defensiveness and being upset.  That's great, but it's a waste of time and ruining her relationship with her parents.\n\nYou know, because there's other options here.  Mae could very well ask her parents for help, and so forth.  And yes, sometimes it means swallowing your pride to get at the point of things.\n\n&gt;She did see a therapist. He told her to ignore things and push them down and out of her mind or to just write them down in a journal (the journal she's constantly updating throughout the game) and forget about them.\n\nWhich is generally good advice to be honest.  It *sucks and is hard*, nobody is denying that, but part of it all is to *just push things through*.\n\n&gt;A lot of her complaints are internal to my recollection. She makes self deprecating comments but it's far from constant in the game. Also this is... I guess this one of those things that, to me, I could understand and fully empathize with as a person suffering from depression.\n&gt;\n&gt;It's hard to ever feel you're worth anything. If you were to honestly ask me if I ever felt even an inkling of pride or concern about myself, I couldn't tell you. Most of my life has been spent constantly putting myself down and putting on a happy face for everyone else around me.\n&gt;\n&gt;Not to mention, the game is ultimately about her realizing that her pride is holding her back from ever getting help. She ultimately realizes that she can't just 'deal with' things on her own, as she was intending to do throughout the game.\n\nThe thing is, why should anyone else worry about you if you don't worry about yourself?  Why are you worth it?\n\nThat's a question you have to answer for yourself ultimately.\n\nI personally don't like being a burden, and part of my thinking is that I'm willing to put aside my pride to get things done and move on to the next stage.  You *make* your own self worth by doing so; I have no expectation for anyone else to care about me, especially for just existing.\n\nThe thing is, it's difficult to get that jump start if you're in your early 20s and just trying to get out of it.  But it doesn't take much to show some very big improvements.  Doesn't take a whole lot of checkpoints.\n\nI had a friend that would be classified in a similar manner, and just would not show up to work.  Yes, I get it that it's hard, but again, regardless of the problems, if it's *causing problems for everyone else and there's no chance of seeing a future of improvement, then it's very much a feeling of waste for people to be investing in such people*.  The sympathy of his boss actually cost *his boss* some very critical time at his job, and when my friend ultimately got fired, the only thing that was said was that his boss was terrible.  Forget about how he never showed up to work for the better part of 2 years.\n\nThat's a hard reality to life.  I personally feel that you have to ultimately be deserving of sympathy, not just get it because you get classified by the DSM on some level.  Your neural pathways may have a chemical imbalance, but it doesn't preclude you to altering those synapses with different experiences.\n\nWhich makes the \"force it\" strategy important.  It's *not* set in stone.\n\n&gt;And I'm not entirely sure if you're saying she does this, but she never does (at least to my recollection, I honestly can't remember a single time she's used her problems as an escape card). She never blames anything that she does on anything other than herself.\n\nAnd yet she *still* acts like a terrible person. \n\n*Feelings aren't enough*.

I don't think she's really supposed to be that likable, just understandable, because her friends have it way more together than she does.  \n\nI can relate to her supposed trauma though.  This is going to sound really silly, but for example, I always knew that I was going to die, and that we're all going to die.  I mean, everybody knows that.  Hell, I used to be one of those edgy teens who'd be like \"Everybody dies.  So what?\".  But one day during summer vacation in late high school, it just like hit me.

It actually made me so depressed that I became completely non-functional for like almost 2 months.  I stopped playing videogames, stopped doing anything physical, stopped going out, stopped going online or even turning my computer on.  Pretty much just sat in bed, tried to watch TV to distract myself and cried like a bitch.  Bear in mind, I wasn't a social outcast either.  I had lots of friends and hobbies that I actively pursued.  \n\nI can't even describe how horrible the feeling was.  I felt sick to my stomach every day, and everything was just *gray*.  Like all my hobbies, and everything felt completely meaningless.  Normally, people would become suicidal in that situation, but it was exactly the idea of a permanent death that I'd come to find incredibly sad and terrifying.  Killing myself was the last thing I wanted to do.  I think the word people use for it is despair, and it's completely different from being sad.  Despair is a total absence of hope that things will ever get better.  Every now and then, I would think \"I'm never going to get out of this pit.\" and then my stomach would sink like 10 feet lower than it already was, and I would start to panic.

Believing that there's a loving god, and a plan, and a place for all of us to go after we die is a very comforting one -- albeit one I decided I don't really want or need.  \n\nIt's a long, boring story about how I came out of it, but I was just as fucked up as Mae was at one point, and I can definitely relate to whatever she's feeling.  It's hard to explain an existential crisis to people who've never had one.  It's not exactly something that happens to everyone, or even something that people ever discuss.
