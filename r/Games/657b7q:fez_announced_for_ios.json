This is just a random outsider with too much knowledge on this topic responding to a Reddit comment.\n\n----\n\nThe main difference between 1.11 and 1.12, the \"engine overhaul\", is dropping the Microsoft XNA Framework and a custom version of MonoGame for macOS and Linux. Instead, FEZ 1.12 now uses an open-source \"rewrite\" of XNA called FNA.\n\nSimplified, the MonoGame version used in 1.11 and before was known to cause windowing issues, specific graphics compatibility issues and not the best performance. Luckily, MonoGame was and even is getting better, but FEZ still used that old version. And as XNA was already discontinued (not supported for Windows 8, 8.1, 10 and higher), the situation became... \"smelly.\"\n\n__Warning: Personal experience.__  \nWhen I modded FEZ, flibit and Renaud really supported me. My first interaction with flibit as far as the Twitter Archive remembers is [this tweet mentioning the effect (shader) binaries and what FEZ switching to FNA would provide for modders.](https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/586187918890381312)  \n__Personal experience ends here.__\n\nThat was in April 2015. The first combined mention of FEZ and FNA that I found was in regards of [how the MonoGame version used by FEZ doesn't support older Mac setups, and how FNA supports them... in 2014.](https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/451784450343714817)\n\nFrom what I can tell, there was an effort^(tm) to convince Renaud to move FEZ over to FNA, but Renaud was busy [working on another game at CAPY](http://www.whatliesbelow.com/), so that wasn't meant to happen.\n\nAs FNA matured and gained more features (f.e. controller hotplugging, macOS Spaces support), flibit tried to port over some features to \"FEZ-SDL2\" (how the MonoGame-SDL2 fork's branch was called). [Not everything was easily portable from FNA to FEZ-SDL2, though.](https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/480846140909174784)\n\nFast forward a few months, basically overnight (technically mid-day), out of nowhere, [hopefully I won't get my head cut off for this but this is public knowledge anyway.](http://i.imgur.com/HYYRX3c.png) Work on FEZ 1.12 began earlier, but it became a real thing at that point.\n\n__FEZ 1.12 started out as just that - moving from MonoGame and XNA to FNA.__ All other bugfixes came with the time and most, if not all of them are [documented on the public FEZ 1.12 beta issue tracker.](https://github.com/renaudbedard/fez-1.12-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)  \nThe FEZ speedrun community helped Renaud find a lot of bugs. \"Gyoo's softlock\" in the DM above? Gyoo being the world record holder at that time found a way to lock up the game by collecting a golden cube and triggering a DOT speech while jumping on a mushroom. __When possible, game breaking bugs were fixed.__\n\nI remember when the \"ETA\" was January. I received a message (excerpt from it, hopefully, again, not getting my head cut off):\n&gt; the patch will not ship before Christmas... There are a lot more gameplay issues than I expected, and with Xmas holidays coming up, I don't see myself completing it in time.\nIt will ship in late January, so if you have some time to test in January that would be greatly appreciated.\n\n__At this point,__ it seemed like FEZ 1.12 was going to include more polishing touches and bugfixes than expected while Renaud and flibitijibibo were already working at it.\n\nLuckily, there wasn't any announcement at this point, which means there weren't any time constraints. At all. It was just an effort to bring one last, huge update to FEZ.\n\nAs an outsider, it went something like this: FNA supports detecting the game controller? Let's use that to switch the icons in-game! While we're at it, let's throw in a better controller rebinding menu! Issues with how the game was cropped? Let's replace how the game handles fullscreen! FNA allows Hardware Instancing? Let's use it! The game does X when Y happens? Let's fix it! Speedrunners love our game? Let's add in a timer! The game uses inaccurate timing? Let's fix that while we're at it! Oh no, it uncovered another issue, let's fix that! et cetera.\n\n----\n\n&gt; and there are a lot of really deep engine rewrites that were done that don't really seem worth doing for a 5 year old game that works fine, but would be worth the time if it was engine prep for a sequel.\n\nAnalogical answer just because: My old tire for my bike worked just fine, too, but it works better when it's filled with air. It's just that after I began pumping new air into it that it has got some smaller holes from which air began leaking. I then began hunting down those holes and fixing them.\n\nWhat I want to say is, from an outsider's perspective with a little too much information, the update began as a maintenance update to (technically just update but practically) replace the software it's using underneath. All the polishing touches and fixes weren't planned from the beginning, but came as the work on the update went on... and on, and on, and on.\n\nThis point from the article on Renaud's blog you just linked TL;DR's it:\n&gt; **Make it the Last Update.** Since I shipped FEZ 1.11 I had little intention of making additional fixes or features to the game because I simply don\u2019t have the time with a kid and a fulltime job\u2026 and working on FEZ is getting old after 9 years. So I did want to address problems that people have with the game, but I don\u2019t want to do it for the rest of my life. I had spent enough time away from the game that I was somewhat enthusiastic about coming back to it, especially if it\u2019s at my pace, and that it\u2019s my last time doing so.\n\nRenaud and Phil are now going split ways. Renaud's working at Square Enix Montreal on \\~\\~secrets\\~\\~, whatever that may be. Phil worked with his old friends over at Kokoromi to bring a neat tech demo from a desk at an event to life with VR. Flibit is helping everywhere where he can.\n\nThere may be FEZ 2 coming, there may be no FEZ 2 coming. Who knows? After all, if FEZ 2 would actually be coming with the FEZ Engine, [the most important bug of them all would already be fixed!](https://github.com/renaudbedard/fez-1.12-issues/issues/51)\n\nPersonally, I don't think the FEZ Engine will be really reused, but hope it will. Working The FEZ Engine is a really interesting and fun construct to play with^(1), but it stems from a time where \"Unity 3D\" wasn't a thing and it survived multiple XNA updates that are incompatible to each other. Working with XNA 3.1 and 4.0 games, funnily enough the XNA 3.1 graphics state management reminds me of FEZ, although it's now on the level of XNA 4.0. And now that Unity easily supports the main rendering technique used in FEZ - instanced rendering - I don't see the need in a possible FEZ 2 reusing the FEZ Engine.\n\nAnd no, I don't know the solution to [a thing that required brute forcing to be solved](#s \"the black monolith\").  \nI for sure know that I spent too long writing this comment, though.\n\n^(1): The FEZ Engine is fun to play with, but take a too deep dive and the illusion of FEZ is broken for you forever. To this day, I wish I could erase my knowledge about how the FEZ Engine works just so I can peacefully replay it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and there are a lot of really deep engine rewrites that were done that don&amp;#39;t really seem worth doing for a 5 year old game that works fine, but would be worth the time if it was engine prep for a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;grab your chair while I take a deep breath&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;[Obsolete] public abstract class EngineStateManager : IEngineStateManager {&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As someone with some experience with the FEZ Engine (heavily modded the game, dropped it on my phone and it ran, wrote asset reader for HoloFEZ in Unity, gave back minor bug fixes, helped with the 1.12 beta), my two cents.&lt;br/&gt;\nI don&amp;#39;t have any experience from inside Polytron.

The first combined mention of FEZ and FNA that I found was in regards of &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/451784450343714817\"&gt;how the MonoGame version used by FEZ doesn&amp;#39;t support older Mac setups, and how FNA supports them... in 2014.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, there was an effort&lt;sup&gt;tm&lt;/sup&gt; to convince Renaud to move FEZ over to FNA, but Renaud was busy &lt;a href=\"http://www.whatliesbelow.com/\"&gt;working on another game at CAPY&lt;/a&gt;, so that wasn&amp;#39;t meant to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As FNA matured and gained more features (f.e. controller hotplugging, macOS Spaces support), flibit tried to port over some features to &amp;quot;FEZ-SDL2&amp;quot; (how the MonoGame-SDL2 fork&amp;#39;s branch was called). &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/480846140909174784\"&gt;Not everything was easily portable from FNA to FEZ-SDL2, though.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few months, basically overnight (technically mid-day), out of nowhere, &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/HYYRX3c.png\"&gt;hopefully I won&amp;#39;t get my head cut off for this but this is public knowledge anyway.&lt;/a&gt; Work on FEZ 1.12 began earlier, but it became a real thing at that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEZ 1.12 started out as just that - moving from MonoGame and XNA to FNA.&lt;/strong&gt; All other bugfixes came with the time and most, if not all of them are &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/renaudbedard/fez-1.12-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed\"&gt;documented on the public FEZ 1.12 beta issue tracker.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThe FEZ speedrun community helped Renaud find a lot of bugs. &amp;quot;Gyoo&amp;#39;s softlock&amp;quot; in the DM above? Gyoo being the world record holder at that time found a way to lock up the game by collecting a golden cube and triggering a DOT speech while jumping on a mushroom. &lt;strong&gt;When possible, game breaking bugs were fixed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember when the &amp;quot;ETA&amp;quot; was January. I received a message (excerpt from it, hopefully, again, not getting my head cut off):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the patch will not ship before Christmas... There are a lot more gameplay issues than I expected, and with Xmas holidays coming up, I don&amp;#39;t see myself completing it in time.\nIt will ship in late January, so if you have some time to test in January that would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At this point,&lt;/strong&gt; it seemed like FEZ 1.12 was going to include more polishing touches and bugfixes than expected while Renaud and flibitijibibo were already working at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there wasn&amp;#39;t any announcement at this point, which means there weren&amp;#39;t any time constraints. At all. It was just an effort to bring one last, huge update to FEZ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an outsider, it went something like this: FNA supports detecting the game controller? Let&amp;#39;s use that to switch the icons in-game! While we&amp;#39;re at it, let&amp;#39;s throw in a better controller rebinding menu! Issues with how the game was cropped? Let&amp;#39;s replace how the game handles fullscreen! FNA allows Hardware Instancing? Let&amp;#39;s use it! The game does X when Y happens? Let&amp;#39;s fix it! Speedrunners love our game? Let&amp;#39;s add in a timer! The game uses inaccurate timing? Let&amp;#39;s fix that while we&amp;#39;re at it! Oh no, it uncovered another issue, let&amp;#39;s fix that! et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and there are a lot of really deep engine rewrites that were done that don&amp;#39;t really seem worth doing for a 5 year old game that works fine, but would be worth the time if it was engine prep for a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Analogical answer just because: My old tire for my bike worked just fine, too, but it works better when it&amp;#39;s filled with air. It&amp;#39;s just that after I began pumping new air into it that it has got some smaller holes from which air began leaking. I then began hunting down those holes and fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I want to say is, from an outsider&amp;#39;s perspective with a little too much information, the update began as a maintenance update to (technically just update but practically) replace the software it&amp;#39;s using underneath. All the polishing touches and fixes weren&amp;#39;t planned from the beginning, but came as the work on the update went on... and on, and on, and on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This point from the article on Renaud&amp;#39;s blog you just linked TL;DR&amp;#39;s it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it the Last Update.&lt;/strong&gt; Since I shipped FEZ 1.11 I had little intention of making additional fixes or features to the game because I simply don\u2019t have the time with a kid and a fulltime job\u2026 and working on FEZ is getting old after 9 years. So I did want to address problems that people have with the game, but I don\u2019t want to do it for the rest of my life. I had spent enough time away from the game that I was somewhat enthusiastic about coming back to it, especially if it\u2019s at my pace, and that it\u2019s my last time doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Renaud and Phil are now going split ways. Renaud&amp;#39;s working at Square Enix Montreal on ~~secrets~~, whatever that may be. Phil worked with his old friends over at Kokoromi to bring a neat tech demo from a desk at an event to life with VR. Flibit is helping everywhere where he can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There may be FEZ 2 coming, there may be no FEZ 2 coming. Who knows? After all, if FEZ 2 would actually be coming with the FEZ Engine, &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/renaudbedard/fez-1.12-issues/issues/51\"&gt;the most important bug of them all would already be fixed!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don&amp;#39;t think the FEZ Engine will be really reused, but hope it will. Working The FEZ Engine is a really interesting and fun construct to play with&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, but it stems from a time where &amp;quot;Unity 3D&amp;quot; wasn&amp;#39;t a thing and it survived multiple XNA updates that are incompatible to each other. Working with XNA 3.1 and 4.0 games, funnily enough the XNA 3.1 graphics state management reminds me of FEZ, although it&amp;#39;s now on the level of XNA 4.0. And now that Unity easily supports the main rendering technique used in FEZ - instanced rendering - I don&amp;#39;t see the need in a possible FEZ 2 reusing the FEZ Engine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no, I don&amp;#39;t know the solution to &lt;a href=\"#s\" title=\"the black monolith\"&gt;a thing that required brute forcing to be solved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;\nI for sure know that I spent too long writing this comment, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: The FEZ Engine is fun to play with, but take a too deep dive and the illusion of FEZ is broken for you forever. To this day, I wish I could erase my knowledge about how the FEZ Engine works just so I can peacefully replay it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg97a1o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492209266.0, "created_utc": 1492180466.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_657b7q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8s3np", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MoreThanLuck", "parent_id": "t1_dg8fpgj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I also think that FEZ 2 will mysteriously one night with no more than a short notice if any, and take the world (mostly) by surprise.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also think that FEZ 2 will mysteriously one night with no more than a short notice if any, and take the world (mostly) by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg8s3np", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492174345.0, "created_utc": 1492145545.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8fpgj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 29, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jademalo", "parent_id": "t1_dg81z0s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ever since flibitijibibo and Renaud started working on FEZ 1.12, I've had a sneaking suspicion that he's actually been working on FEZ 2 without making a fuss about it.\n\nI read [a lot](http://theinstructionlimit.com/fez-1-12) of [the stuff](https://plus.google.com/+flibitijibibo/posts/PysMth9Y5kN) that was posted about that patch, and there are a lot of really deep engine rewrites that were done that don't really seem worth doing for a 5 year old game that works fine, but would be worth the time if it was engine prep for a sequel.\n\nFEZ is a masterpiece, and my favourite game of all time.
