In terms of 3rd-party support, remember that the Wii U started its life with Call of Duty, Watch Dogs, and Deus Ex ports. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at the Switch, without even getting into new games, it hasn&amp;#39;t even gotten ports of big Japanese titles like FFXV, RE7, or any of the new &lt;em&gt;Warriors&lt;/em&gt; games aside from Fire Emblem. It also didn&amp;#39;t get the sequels to ports that Nintendo secured for the WiiU (Infinite Warfare, Watch Dogs 2, Mankind Divided). Then when you start thinking about big 3rd-party games more generically, there was DOOM, Overwatch, Fallout 4, XCOM 2, Mass Effect, Battlefield 1, Guilty Gear, Sniper Elite 4, Wildlands, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bigger problem than just whether Nintendo is looking to get in on the 4K game or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg77a3p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492090263.0, "created_utc": 1492061463.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg75mud", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PL-QC", "parent_id": "t1_dg75ft3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, it starts the chain reaction anyway of the third-party publishers sensing enough enthusiasm to publish games on the console which will in turn make the Switch more attractive.
