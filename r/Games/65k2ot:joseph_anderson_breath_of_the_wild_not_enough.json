The exploration is really satisfying, as he says in the video, and at first the things you discover through exploration are really cool too. But eventually you realize that the things you're finding aren't unique and cool discoveries; exact copies of what you've found are littered across the world.\n\nKilling a Hinox, fighting that \"test of strength\" enemy, raiding that giant skull camp, picking the fruit off the trees for a Korok seed, picking up a lone rock for a Korok seed, following a flower for a Korok seed, dropping a fruit on a tray for a Korok seed, all of these things get old after a few times. It starts to feel no different from Ubisoft open-world games where you just have checklists for a few different types of optional content, and you know that any optional content will fall into one of those categories. No surprises.\n\nI distinctly remember finding my first Stalnox early on in a seemingly random corner of an area. I was amazed that I had found something so significant and fun by exploring. But after about 8 hours I had seen all the different world bosses already. If there had been more types of world bosses, more significant and unique content instead of some of the worst shrines (as Joseph mentions using one of the maze shrines as an example), and more interesting quests better hidden in the world (similar to how you find NPCs in the first Dark Souls), this game could have been a masterpiece.

But eventually you realize that the things you&amp;#39;re finding aren&amp;#39;t unique and cool discoveries; exact copies of what you&amp;#39;ve found are littered across the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Killing a Hinox, fighting that &amp;quot;test of strength&amp;quot; enemy, raiding that giant skull camp, picking the fruit off the trees for a Korok seed, picking up a lone rock for a Korok seed, following a flower for a Korok seed, dropping a fruit on a tray for a Korok seed, all of these things get old after a few times. It starts to feel no different from Ubisoft open-world games where you just have checklists for a few different types of optional content, and you know that any optional content will fall into one of those categories.

For that matter I don't begrudge anyone a right to have an opinion on game design. Everyone has unique insights to offer, you can disagree, but you're going to seem dismissively unless you give an argument for why Joseph isn't entitled to comment on game design. By that reason you must believe no video game critics or gaming journalists can comment on the efficacy or functionality of parts of a video game, which I don't think is fair. Also, Joseph admits he's not an expert but I seriously respect him for not just complaining, and offerings solutions so that others might agree. Why are you allowed to think that pausing the game and buffering death forever with cheap healing items (which many consider to be immersion breaking) is allowable, you're not a video game designer. Why does your opinion matter? I'm not trying to be hostile, but that's kind of what you sound like. \n\nI agree that shrines should reward a player's intelligence instead of just being a loading screen, a reward, and another loading screen. It's really disappointing when puzzles are bad, because nintendo has historically made engaging (not difficult, engaging) puzzles. \n\nThis is Nintendo's first foray into open world games, and they absolutely need to be criticised. The reason Joseph doesn't say \"this game is amazing, I love the graphics and the exploration and the Zelda the Gorons and the wind effects wowee zowee 10/10\" is because you can go to any mainstream review site and read those exact sentiments.

For that matter I don&amp;#39;t begrudge anyone a right to have an opinion on game design. Everyone has unique insights to offer, you can disagree, but you&amp;#39;re going to seem dismissively unless you give an argument for why Joseph isn&amp;#39;t entitled to comment on game design. By that reason you must believe no video game critics or gaming journalists can comment on the efficacy or functionality of parts of a video game, which I don&amp;#39;t think is fair. Also, Joseph admits he&amp;#39;s not an expert but I seriously respect him for not just complaining, and offerings solutions so that others might agree. Why are you allowed to think that pausing the game and buffering death forever with cheap healing items (which many consider to be immersion breaking) is allowable, you&amp;#39;re not a video game designer. Why does your opinion matter? I&amp;#39;m not trying to be hostile, but that&amp;#39;s kind of what you sound like. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree that shrines should reward a player&amp;#39;s intelligence instead of just being a loading screen, a reward, and another loading screen.
