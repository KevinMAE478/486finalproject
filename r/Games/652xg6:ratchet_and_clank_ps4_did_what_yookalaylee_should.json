Though to me, I disagree.  I feel like Open World games adapted elements from 3D platformers, including collecting items...Unlocking areas in a few cases, etc.  But what they've lost is the movement.  It doesn't feel good to move in many of these open-world games.\n\nOften times, it's the level design that lets you do cool things, like swing down a rope etc.  The quick movement is essential.  I'd even argue that Uncharted 4 is closer to a 3D platformer in this regard, and that's due to the rope-hook, but that's also a stretch, cause it's lost many of the 2D/3D platformer foundations.\n\nLet's compare it this way...Most 2D platformers are linear in objective/scope.  The better 3D platformers understood this, and acted accordingly.  It doesn't mean the feature set is limited, but if \"where do I go now?\" ever really occurs, then I think the dev is entering a different genre.  3D allows you to run around in a self-contained sandbox.  2D does as well, but the added extra depth of perspective allows more cool secrets.  2D platformers depended upon camera tricks, or hidden blocks to contain cool secrets.\n\nA few of my thoughts on the matter.  Tracing the path of 3D platformers, they for the most part died during the PS2/GCN era.  There are exceptions, such as Galaxy, but the Super Mario SunShines, Sly Coopers, Jak and Daxters, and Ratchet &amp; Clanks (Except for last years excellent re-make) of the video game genre, are near-extinct.\n\nYooka-Laylee tried to do Banjo, when it should have looked at Jak \n&amp; Daxter instead, and applied newer techniques from recent years to that.  The Spyro/Banjo type of 3D platformer, we're past that time.  And it's difficult to say what can be done tastefully to bring that back.  Idk...Maybe pulling elements from other genres into 3D Platformers.  Think Metroid Prime...And Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath.  Those are 3D platformers to some degree, but they wouldn't be defined as such.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s kind of what EasyAllies was saying recently.  Though to me, I disagree.  I feel like Open World games adapted elements from 3D platformers, including collecting items...Unlocking areas in a few cases, etc.  But what they&amp;#39;ve lost is the movement.  It doesn&amp;#39;t feel good to move in many of these open-world games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often times, it&amp;#39;s the level design that lets you do cool things, like swing down a rope etc.  The quick movement is essential.  I&amp;#39;d even argue that Uncharted 4 is closer to a 3D platformer in this regard, and that&amp;#39;s due to the rope-hook, but that&amp;#39;s also a stretch, cause it&amp;#39;s lost many of the 2D/3D platformer foundations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s compare it this way...Most 2D platformers are linear in objective/scope.  The better 3D platformers understood this, and acted accordingly.  It doesn&amp;#39;t mean the feature set is limited, but if &amp;quot;where do I go now?&amp;quot; ever really occurs, then I think the dev is entering a different genre.  3D allows you to run around in a self-contained sandbox.  2D does as well, but the added extra depth of perspective allows more cool secrets.  2D platformers depended upon camera tricks, or hidden blocks to contain cool secrets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few of my thoughts on the matter.  Tracing the path of 3D platformers, they for the most part died during the PS2/GCN era.  There are exceptions, such as Galaxy, but the Super Mario SunShines, Sly Coopers, Jak and Daxters, and Ratchet &amp;amp; Clanks (Except for last years excellent re-make) of the video game genre, are near-extinct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yooka-Laylee tried to do Banjo, when it should have looked at Jak \n&amp;amp; Daxter instead, and applied newer techniques from recent years to that.

Ratchet's like \"You blackmailing piece of shit. Fine.\"\n\n&gt;That's Act One.

Ratchet's like \"I fuckin' know, right? Hey, let's go push Drek's shit in\". Clank's like \"sick\".\n\n&gt;Turns out Drek is blowing up planets to make a Frankenstein Planet because he gets paid trillions for it, and Ratchet's home planet is his next target. Ratchet gets super pissed, and it's at this point you go \"finally, let's do some hero stuff\". And you do. And it's great.\n\n&gt;You have a giant mecha battle with Drek before he goes \"psyche!\" and turns you super small. You gotta fight him on foot, and it's great! Then you go all Death Star on his ass by flinging him into his own Frankenstein planet and blowing it up. Clank's like, \"oh, man, my arm's jacked\". Ratchet's like, \"eh, whatever, I'll patch it up. Hey, sorry about being an asshole to you.\"\n\n&gt;The movie (and the game-movie-game) turns Ratchet into the typical \"kid wants to be special but no one gives him a break\" character, complete with him having a really bad day, lying on his roof looking at the night sky and saying how much he wants to be a space ranger, instead of it being an implied thing in the games that gets resolved in the first ten minutes. Clank is also pretty much forgotten and shoved behind a desk while Ratchet saves the world. He doesn't even get that many lines in the game. Quark's more of a main character.\n\n&gt;On top of that, Quark is this \"established hero who is jealous of the main character who turns bad but regrets it so it's fine\" instead of \"ageing fake superhero celebrity who teams up with Drek to stay relevant\" in the first game. Then in the second game he's super butthurt at Ratchet and Clank for being beaten and arrested.

Clank&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;eh, that was pretty good, I guess&amp;quot;. Ratchet&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;I fuckin&amp;#39; know, right? Hey, let&amp;#39;s go push Drek&amp;#39;s shit in&amp;quot;. Clank&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;sick&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out Drek is blowing up planets to make a Frankenstein Planet because he gets paid trillions for it, and Ratchet&amp;#39;s home planet is his next target. Ratchet gets super pissed, and it&amp;#39;s at this point you go &amp;quot;finally, let&amp;#39;s do some hero stuff&amp;quot;. And you do. And it&amp;#39;s great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have a giant mecha battle with Drek before he goes &amp;quot;psyche!&amp;quot; and turns you super small. You gotta fight him on foot, and it&amp;#39;s great! Then you go all Death Star on his ass by flinging him into his own Frankenstein planet and blowing it up. Clank&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;oh, man, my arm&amp;#39;s jacked&amp;quot;. Ratchet&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;eh, whatever, I&amp;#39;ll patch it up. Hey, sorry about being an asshole to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movie (and the game-movie-game) turns Ratchet into the typical &amp;quot;kid wants to be special but no one gives him a break&amp;quot; character, complete with him having a really bad day, lying on his roof looking at the night sky and saying how much he wants to be a space ranger, instead of it being an implied thing in the games that gets resolved in the first ten minutes. Clank is also pretty much forgotten and shoved behind a desk while Ratchet saves the world. He doesn&amp;#39;t even get that many lines in the game. Quark&amp;#39;s more of a main character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, Quark is this &amp;quot;established hero who is jealous of the main character who turns bad but regrets it so it&amp;#39;s fine&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;ageing fake superhero celebrity who teams up with Drek to stay relevant&amp;quot; in the first game. Then in the second game he&amp;#39;s super butthurt at Ratchet and Clank for being beaten and arrested. In the third game he has a completely shattered reputation, but has a chance to actually be a cool guy and complete a damn good character arc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I just really like this series.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg7w8hi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492133369.0, "created_utc": 1492104569.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652xg6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ad56", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 21, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Alinosburns", "parent_id": "t1_dg78efw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you for this.\n\nRatchet and Clank on PS4 might be a solid game, but it is a huge stepbackwards for the series IMO.\n\nAs you mention the story has been butchered, mostly to tie in with the movie which will never see a sequel, so hopefully they go back to the original canon.\n\nThe weapon selection while reused wasn't their best of stuff and seemed like an odd mixture.\n\nThe hoverboard racing is literally the worst of the 90's genre.

That's not to say they're objectively bad games, but we as gamers tend to see past the flaws in our favorite games, especially depending on when we played them.  So when a company makes a spiritual successor to a now defunct/gone-astray franchise from our childhood, it's hard not to get excited about it and automatically assume it's going to meed those expectations.\n\nAs for it being a Kickstarter game, I am of the opinion that there is something about \"backing\" a game (or any crowdfunded project for that matter) that gives us a sense of entitlement that consumers just aren't used to, even though the concept has been around and popular for 5+ years now.  Sometimes the game really is fantastic (Shovel Knight), sometimes it's really just shit (Mighty No. 9).  But I feel that if something is just okay it's going to be looked at worse because it was crowdfunded over if it was released following the norms.\n\nSo I think that since Yooka Laylee was crowdfunded those Banjo Kazooie fans who hadn't played it in a decade who through money at their monitor when they heard about it are now upset because it isn't anything like the game that they remember, even if it's closer to the original than they realize.  Now I could be off on that because I haven't played either game, but I making a double ass out of myself and am assuming that it's safe to assume that Yooka Laylee is probably a fine and fun game but isn't being well received because it's not meeting expectations that are inflated higher than normal.

So when a company makes a spiritual successor to a now defunct/gone-astray franchise from our childhood, it&amp;#39;s hard not to get excited about it and automatically assume it&amp;#39;s going to meed those expectations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for it being a Kickstarter game, I am of the opinion that there is something about &amp;quot;backing&amp;quot; a game (or any crowdfunded project for that matter) that gives us a sense of entitlement that consumers just aren&amp;#39;t used to, even though the concept has been around and popular for 5+ years now.  Sometimes the game really is fantastic (Shovel Knight), sometimes it&amp;#39;s really just shit (Mighty No. 9).  But I feel that if something is just okay it&amp;#39;s going to be looked at worse because it was crowdfunded over if it was released following the norms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I think that since Yooka Laylee was crowdfunded those Banjo Kazooie fans who hadn&amp;#39;t played it in a decade who through money at their monitor when they heard about it are now upset because it isn&amp;#39;t anything like the game that they remember, even if it&amp;#39;s closer to the original than they realize.  Now I could be off on that because I haven&amp;#39;t played either game, but I making a double ass out of myself and am assuming that it&amp;#39;s safe to assume that Yooka Laylee is probably a fine and fun game but isn&amp;#39;t being well received because it&amp;#39;s not meeting expectations that are inflated higher than normal. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg8sodb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492175448.0, "created_utc": 1492146648.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652xg6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg85efa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Matsuyama-Takeshi", "parent_id": "t1_dg7sozg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Couldn't agree with this more.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couldn&amp;#39;t agree with this more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg85efa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143244.0, "created_utc": 1492114444.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7sozg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mequittingthenet", "parent_id": "t3_652xg6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "yooka-laylee is a game that's too good for the broader audience. \n\nwhen I say \"too good\", I mean, it does what it sets out to do, and does it great. but what it sets out to do isn't popular. \n\nit has mediocre reviews in the same way a rock album might: it's not pop music and doesn't have a big named attached to it. the fact that everyone calls it a failure, because it's not getting critical acclaim, makes me realize how much everyone should avoid the internet if they want to get honest opinions on a game.

For that they would need more money and time, but I think they have the skill to make a much better game given the proper resources. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg7bjyj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492101332.0, "created_utc": 1492072532.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652xg6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652xg6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652xg6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652xg6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8bax9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PettyWop", "parent_id": "t1_dg8aqsg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Amen brotha", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amen brotha&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg8bax9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492150250.0, "created_utc": 1492121450.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8aqsg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bigblackhotdog", "parent_id": "t1_dg7t357", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah...

They'd dismissed 3D platformers as a joke in their head for a long time, and they decided that the only reason somebody would enjoy one or want a new one is because they played them when they were a kid, and were blinded by nostalgia. There was a lot of hate for that reason.\n\nThat's not the only critique of the game, though. I'm a huge Banjo-Kazooie fan, and Yooka-Laylee, while I think it's pretty good, is not as good. There are some complaints about the camera and such, but for me the main flaw is the level design. The levels are too big, and too much great content gets lost in them.

They&amp;#39;d dismissed 3D platformers as a joke in their head for a long time, and they decided that the only reason somebody would enjoy one or want a new one is because they played them when they were a kid, and were blinded by nostalgia. There was a lot of hate for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not the only critique of the game, though. I&amp;#39;m a huge Banjo-Kazooie fan, and Yooka-Laylee, while I think it&amp;#39;s pretty good, is not as good. There are some complaints about the camera and such, but for me the main flaw is the level design. The levels are too big, and too much great content gets lost in them.
