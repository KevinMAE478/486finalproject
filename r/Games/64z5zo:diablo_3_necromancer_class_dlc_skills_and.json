If you hate trading this game is rewarding to play self found and is designed for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PoE has the greatest character development if you enjoy theory crafting and creating your own hero. Though realistically there are a few archetypes for builds but there is a wide variety of different skills to fit those archetypes. If you&amp;#39;re someone that is excited by the idea of complex characters that take a lot of research to min-max this is for you. Also, if you are someone that likes trading and playing economies this is the only real option for that aspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grim Dawn fits somewhere in the middle. It doesn&amp;#39;t have the best combat or the best character customization, but it is enjoyable and a spiritual successor to Titan&amp;#39;s Quest. If you wish to play solo off-line it is one of the best choices out there as both of the bigger games require online.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg67fml", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492046750.0, "created_utc": 1492017950.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 111}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z5zo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z5zo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6mkii", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "purple-whatevers", "parent_id": "t1_dg68014", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Loads of mods for it as well.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loads of mods for it as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg6mkii", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492062696.0, "created_utc": 1492033896.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg68014", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SwissQueso", "parent_id": "t1_dg66n43", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Torchlight is pretty decent and usually next to nothing on steam.\n\nedit, its actually on sale now, for 5$", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Torchlight is pretty decent and usually next to nothing on steam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit, its actually on sale now, for 5$&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg68014", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492047315.0, "created_utc": 1492018515.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z5zo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6fusl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SecureJobWorker", "parent_id": "t1_dg66n43", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I absolutely love Grim Dawn, it's the most fun ARPG I've played since D2 and I prefer it over D3.

I prefer ARPGs where you can play with your selected build and not have it become the endgame goal. Some really fun PoE builds require level 80+, but I just can&amp;#39;t stand having to play with a boring build for that long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I much prefer the way Diablo 3 does it, especially with its seasons, as it&amp;#39;ll only take you a few hours to reach max level and to unlock your season rewards. It also allows you to find your own gear, whereas I haven&amp;#39;t found a single build-required item in dozens of hours playtime in PoE.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg68r2o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492048067.0, "created_utc": 1492019267.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z5zo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z5zo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z5zo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z5zo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z5zo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg77nmp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bobyd", "parent_id": "t1_dg77h0w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I dont play that much d3, tbh, this is the first season i habe completed all the rewards, but I can see how it is more casual, it took me like 3 days to get decent gear", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont play that much d3, tbh, this is the first season i habe completed all the rewards, but I can see how it is more casual, it took me like 3 days to get decent gear&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg77nmp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492091067.0, "created_utc": 1492062267.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg77h0w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "x_TDeck_x", "parent_id": "t1_dg772x7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah you've definitely given it a chance.
