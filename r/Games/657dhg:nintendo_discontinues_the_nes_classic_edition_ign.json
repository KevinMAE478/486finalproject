If it shows &amp;quot;Limited Stock&amp;quot; I estimate that translates to &amp;quot;5 or less&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one I got on Sunday was actually for a coworker, I was able to get lucky and find mine at launch online using &lt;a href=\"http://www.nowinstock.net/videogaming/consoles/nintendoswitch/\"&gt;this stock tracker&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve been actively tracking them since launch, so this method seems really difficult because most of the time it&amp;#39;ll be Walmart selling them and they are only available for 3 minutes. You can see the history of which retailer listed them and how long they were listed though and sometimes you&amp;#39;ll get lucky and have a 30 minute window where you can snag one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an example of what the &amp;quot;In Stock&amp;quot; page should look like through the google search and filtering, &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/7797603160891987632?q=nintendo+switch+in+stock&amp;amp;biw=1440&amp;amp;bih=680&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.&amp;amp;bvm=bv.152180690,bs.1,d.cGc&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;tch=1&amp;amp;ech=1&amp;amp;psi=WQDwWK-nFJKAjwPkoqXICg.1492123744314.11&amp;amp;prds=hsec:local,local:1&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK3ea_wqLTAhXFsVQKHd4sDowQ2YIBCB8\"&gt;here&amp;#39;s a link listing Pro Controllers in the Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg8dngy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492153355.0, "created_utc": 1492124555.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg89kf2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 64, "report_reasons": null, "author": "atworkthre", "parent_id": "t1_dg88she", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Trust me I've tried lol, I've driven 20+miles to various walmarts and targets farther from the city and still sold out.
