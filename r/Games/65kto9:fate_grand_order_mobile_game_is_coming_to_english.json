Since FSN is broken up into three routes, it's a little hard to make an adaptation of it.  The first FSN anime really dropped the ball here; they adapted the Fate route, but they included a ton of shit from the other routes, which kinda fucked up the story. \n\nFate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works is the second adaptation of the visual novel.  This one was really good because it only focused on the 2nd route of the game, Unlimited Blade Works.  It didn't include things from the other routes, so it was a nice cohesive story.  \n\nFate/Zero is a prequel to the original VN.  It takes place about a decade or so earlier than FSN, and it focuses on a different Holy Grail War.  \n\nFate/Zero has a much more mature cast than UBW, since most of the characters aren't in high school.  You'll probably appreciate Fate/Zero more if you watch UBW first since you'll have a better understanding about what is going on, but you'll also be spoiled on a couple twists in FZ if you do it that way. \n\nIn the end though, it doesn't really matter which order you watch those two in, you'll get a good experience either way. \n\nAll of the other anime and material are just spin offs that for the most part don't affect the main story at all.

Each servant has a set of attack cards, \"Buster,\" \"Arts,\" and \"Quick.\" Buster cards deal more damage, Arts cards charge your Noble Phantasm (special ability) more, and do medium damage, and Quick cards generate more \"crit stars.\" On your turn, the game randomly selects 5 cards from your card list, and you choose three of those cards to activate that turn. If you use 3 of the same type of card you'll gain a bonus, and if you choose 3 from the same character, they'll follow up with an additional attack. Once your turn ends, the enemy monsters/servants will take their turn, using up to 3 attacks total. This process repeats, and as characters are defeated they're replaced by the back line. This new process repeats until somebody wins. \n\nCritical stars are generated when you attack and are \"attracted,\" to the cards that spawn on your next turn. Each class and certain characters within their class have a higher chance of attracting crit stars. One crit star gives the card it's attracted to a 10% chance to be a critical. Crits do more damage and generate more \"NP Gauge.\" Noble Phantasms come in all shapes and forms, from large buffs to your team, single target damage, multi-target damage, chance to instant kill etc. When you charge a NP it appears as an extra card on your turn list until you use it, or a special ability drops your NP gauge below 100%. NP's can also be charged above 100% effectiveness (in increments of 100%) in order to deal more damage, have higher chances to instant kill buff more etc. Using two NP's in one turn causes the second to automatically overcharge an additional 100%. The max gauge you can get is 300% (which requires fusing multiple copies of a servant together,) so you can charge an ability to 500% total for total annihilation on whatever you're fighting.\n\nThere's a \"rock paper scissors,\" system between two sets of 3 classes lancer, saber, archer, and Rider, assassin, caster. Attacking with advantage gives double damage, and attacking with disadvantage halves damage. Berserker takes 1.5x from all classes and deals 1.5x to all classes.\n\nOther systems: Servants all have a few active skills they can use on your turn, without taking up a card action. Some can heal themselves or others, most are simply damage or defense buffs that are either personal or teamwide. Additionally, the \"Master,\" (you,) has a set of three buffs available to support the team with. These are pretty much the same as servant buffs, but later on in the game's lifespan new outfits that give different abilities to the master will arrive, and some are rather different (one outfit provides a skill that lets you swap an active member for a backline member.)\n\nOf note is there are \"Craft essences,\" which are basically just equip cards to give to your servants. They have drastically varying effects and can allow you to create interesting strategies by letting a unit do something it wouldn't otherwise be able to do. Most are simple buffs however, but they're very important even when they're just flat boosts.\n\nGacha rates are god awful for the ultimate tiers. When you roll you have a 1% chance to obtain a 5 star servant, a 3% chance to obtain a 5 star craft essence. Most of the fan favorite servants are also locked behind 5 star status, instead of actually being about how powerful the servants are. Stingy for sure, but 4 star servants are powerful enough to carry you through the game for a *long* time and they're common enough. Delight Works was also extremely generous with how much premium currency they gave away when I played, and issued huge numbers of extra gems as apologies for server instability etc. Additionally one of the 6 members of your team isn't your unit. You get to choose from among your friends list, or a list of random people's leader unit. This means if you just add people with 5 star units to your friends list you can always bring a 5 star with you, and you'll generally be able to pick a class good for a mission. \n\nA final mitigating factor in the rarity disparity will come much later when \"Grail ascension,\" is unlocked. This allows you to exceed the maximum level cap on your units. The normal max level for a unit is 90 for a 5 star, 80 for a 4 star, etc. Once Grail Ascension is added to the game, the max level for every unit reaches 100, it just costs more of a very limited resource to get lower ranked units to 100.\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard &amp;quot;you can only play if you have action points,&amp;quot; type game, as well as having a fairly standard mobile game leveling system for your units &amp;quot;give exp items to your guys to get them leveled up,&amp;quot; but I assume you want some of the meat of the actual battle system, so here you go:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have 3 Servants (with up to 3 more backup servants in your back line,) and you fight against AI servants or monsters (up to 3 at once.)

This new process repeats until somebody wins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Critical stars are generated when you attack and are &amp;quot;attracted,&amp;quot; to the cards that spawn on your next turn. Each class and certain characters within their class have a higher chance of attracting crit stars. One crit star gives the card it&amp;#39;s attracted to a 10% chance to be a critical. Crits do more damage and generate more &amp;quot;NP Gauge.&amp;quot; Noble Phantasms come in all shapes and forms, from large buffs to your team, single target damage, multi-target damage, chance to instant kill etc. When you charge a NP it appears as an extra card on your turn list until you use it, or a special ability drops your NP gauge below 100%. NP&amp;#39;s can also be charged above 100% effectiveness (in increments of 100%) in order to deal more damage, have higher chances to instant kill buff more etc. Using two NP&amp;#39;s in one turn causes the second to automatically overcharge an additional 100%. The max gauge you can get is 300% (which requires fusing multiple copies of a servant together,) so you can charge an ability to 500% total for total annihilation on whatever you&amp;#39;re fighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;rock paper scissors,&amp;quot; system between two sets of 3 classes lancer, saber, archer, and Rider, assassin, caster. Attacking with advantage gives double damage, and attacking with disadvantage halves damage. Berserker takes 1.5x from all classes and deals 1.5x to all classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other systems: Servants all have a few active skills they can use on your turn, without taking up a card action. Some can heal themselves or others, most are simply damage or defense buffs that are either personal or teamwide. Additionally, the &amp;quot;Master,&amp;quot; (you,) has a set of three buffs available to support the team with. These are pretty much the same as servant buffs, but later on in the game&amp;#39;s lifespan new outfits that give different abilities to the master will arrive, and some are rather different (one outfit provides a skill that lets you swap an active member for a backline member.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of note is there are &amp;quot;Craft essences,&amp;quot; which are basically just equip cards to give to your servants. They have drastically varying effects and can allow you to create interesting strategies by letting a unit do something it wouldn&amp;#39;t otherwise be able to do. Most are simple buffs however, but they&amp;#39;re very important even when they&amp;#39;re just flat boosts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gacha rates are god awful for the ultimate tiers. When you roll you have a 1% chance to obtain a 5 star servant, a 3% chance to obtain a 5 star craft essence. Most of the fan favorite servants are also locked behind 5 star status, instead of actually being about how powerful the servants are. Stingy for sure, but 4 star servants are powerful enough to carry you through the game for a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time and they&amp;#39;re common enough. Delight Works was also extremely generous with how much premium currency they gave away when I played, and issued huge numbers of extra gems as apologies for server instability etc. Additionally one of the 6 members of your team isn&amp;#39;t your unit. You get to choose from among your friends list, or a list of random people&amp;#39;s leader unit. This means if you just add people with 5 star units to your friends list you can always bring a 5 star with you, and you&amp;#39;ll generally be able to pick a class good for a mission. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A final mitigating factor in the rarity disparity will come much later when &amp;quot;Grail ascension,&amp;quot; is unlocked. This allows you to exceed the maximum level cap on your units. The normal max level for a unit is 90 for a 5 star, 80 for a 4 star, etc. Once Grail Ascension is added to the game, the max level for every unit reaches 100, it just costs more of a very limited resource to get lower ranked units to 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dgbcpxv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492328254.0, "created_utc": 1492299454.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbarqp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dooder39", "parent_id": "t3_65kto9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Never heard of this game, what's the gameplay like?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never heard of this game, what&amp;#39;s the gameplay like?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dgbarqp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492325430.0, "created_utc": 1492296630.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kto9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc7mzg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zero1343", "parent_id": "t3_65kto9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've been super tempted to start playing the JPN version of this just for some Fate.
