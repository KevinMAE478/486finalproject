I didn't like how I'd constantly have to focus on making sure I get the right item for the right build at the right time. I didn't like that the games seemed to focus more on opportunity killings than straight up brawls as the game type seemed it should be focusing on. I didn't like feeling that a lot of the focus was buffing up one or two characters in a match so they could perform said opportunity killings. And I didn't like knowing each game is going to play just like the last one.\n\nAnd then I tried HotS, because hey its a Blizzard game and I get to play my bae Sylvanas. And it has now been one of the few games I have been able to consistently play for over a year and still not get bored of it.\n\nAbove anything is the support this game gets from Blizzard. They are always up for trying something new, and fresh, and breaking the mold. They like to have fun, but they still take it seriously. They listen to the community, and are not afraid of admitting when something doesn't work and work on fixing it.\n\nGone are the 20 minute grinds and last hits. With the objectives you are always working (with your whole team) to make a play and take an advantage. You share XP so each member is vastly important to each fight. Sure, you still get ganking, but the team fights are where the magic happens. Each map is different, so it doesn't get stale trying to play one game to the next feeling like it'll be just the same as the one before it. And I don't have to try to find some opportune time to have to leave the fight and run back to base just to grab an item that gives a slight edge.\n\nIn short, other MOBAs feel like work.

I didn&amp;#39;t like how I&amp;#39;d constantly have to focus on making sure I get the right item for the right build at the right time. I didn&amp;#39;t like that the games seemed to focus more on opportunity killings than straight up brawls as the game type seemed it should be focusing on. I didn&amp;#39;t like feeling that a lot of the focus was buffing up one or two characters in a match so they could perform said opportunity killings. And I didn&amp;#39;t like knowing each game is going to play just like the last one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I tried HotS, because hey its a Blizzard game and I get to play my bae Sylvanas. And it has now been one of the few games I have been able to consistently play for over a year and still not get bored of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Above anything is the support this game gets from Blizzard. They are always up for trying something new, and fresh, and breaking the mold. They like to have fun, but they still take it seriously. They listen to the community, and are not afraid of admitting when something doesn&amp;#39;t work and work on fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gone are the 20 minute grinds and last hits. With the objectives you are always working (with your whole team) to make a play and take an advantage. You share XP so each member is vastly important to each fight. Sure, you still get ganking, but the team fights are where the magic happens. Each map is different, so it doesn&amp;#39;t get stale trying to play one game to the next feeling like it&amp;#39;ll be just the same as the one before it. And I don&amp;#39;t have to try to find some opportune time to have to leave the fight and run back to base just to grab an item that gives a slight edge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, other MOBAs feel like work.
