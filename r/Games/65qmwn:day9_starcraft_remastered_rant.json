He mentioned Rock Band, but really any game that forces repetitive tasks holds the same weight. Doing actions over and over until they are perfected to muscle memory has a deep psychological reward for a lot of gamers. The problem with this repetitiveness is that for other gamers it's baffling. They don't enjoy doing the same tasks multiple times. That to them isn't where the reward is. They play instead for the moment to moment gameplay and epic moments or for other reasons. Even things as simple as build queues in an RTS; researching, learning, memorizing, and executing them can take a toll. Some posts by these gamers asking for auto-building or build-scripts even to automate tasks so they can focus at a higher level are seen as clever jokes by people that have spent time fine tuning their skills. Like most games there will be people that are part of the targeted demographic and those that aren't. Some people just aren't part of it and realize it immediately and leave. Others stick around and try to make suggestions not realizing they aren't part of it. This is where some confusion forms. Basically these people asking for easier controls view repetitiveness as a flaw while others view it as skill. One thing game developers need to do in RTS, RPG, FPS, and other games is to be very clear which demographic they're targeting and not waver.

In MMO games, UI based skill is probably one of the oldest and longest discussions since it features some very complex and heavy macro usage over the years to remove layers of clicking. It's interesting in many respects because through the tolerance of macros many MMO games have brought in players that might normally tire of the repetitiveness. It's also created debates that macros ruin skill-caps which is to be expected because of the two mindsets. Essentially one views the actions as creating meaningful delays that are part of the game and add decisions/skill and others asking themselves \"if there's supposed to be a delay, then why not use a timer?\".\n\nThere are so many niche games where this problem came up in. I remember specifically back in Planetside 1 that to access an item in one's inventory, that wasn't bound to a slot, one had to open the inventory, drag the item to a slot, then press the equip button to use it. This was a very common operation. People used to argue endlessly that performing this action, which many people macroed, added skill to the game. There were actually exploits if done rapidly enough allowed almost double damage with some weapons. People argued that these UI actions were where the skill was and shouldn't have been fixed. The developers failed to clearly address this definitively so people argued among themselves for a long time on if the skill was worth having such repetitive actions.\n\nI think one of the most recent game discussions I saw this in was H1Z1 or KOTK where many view hotkey based inventory and other such discussion as ruining the skill-cap. It's such a black and white topic for some simply because there are two very distinct mindsets as described that make up really two or more sets of gamers.\n\nTo reiterate I think developers would save so much time if they told people who their game was made for and that features exist for specific reasons. (Even if it's just to add a delay they need to be very clear it's a design decision). It's understandable that they don't want to outright tell people that certain gamers might not enjoy a game, but it's far better than creating a toxic environment between new players and long-time players.\n\nOne side-note I find interesting is that offering alternative official rule-sets, while development heavy, would probably solve a number of these discussions.
