Secondly, the music is fine. Maybe he's spoiled because they seemed to use one of the better bits for the very first level, but all the songs I've heard so far have been excellent. They fit the setting, they have that famous Kirkhope sound, and they're just really well done (and I love that they added that bit in Banjo Kazooie where the music changes slightly when you're underwater). It's a solid experience and I'm having a ton of fun, mixed with the frustration of trying to get the bosses and collectibles down. But you know what? That was the point of those games.
