One perfect example of a QoL improvement we could see completely unrelated to piracy (if it&amp;#39;s even possible with the Switch hardware). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg48q9j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491945905.0, "created_utc": 1491917105.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q48c", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q48c", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q48c", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q48c", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q48c", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg49ttv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zcen", "parent_id": "t1_dg48lnz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The publisher is the one that signs contracts and gives money to studios to develop games so I don't see where it wouldn't support developers.
