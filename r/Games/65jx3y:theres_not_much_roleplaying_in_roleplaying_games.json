You&amp;#39;re meant to attach yourself to the world and feel like you&amp;#39;re apart of it. That&amp;#39;s why I think a focus on developing the main character and their allies rather than massive decisions works better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, and this is a big however, ARPGs are doing a pretty poor job of making these choices of personality matter. You&amp;#39;re given a lot of options to say something a certain way, and it&amp;#39;s nice that these choices feel consistent, but the choice will last for 1-2 lines of conversation before it disappears. DA2 is a good example of how to do it correctly. As you start to lean towards a personality type your character begins to act like that, and other characters react differently to that personality type. It could be improved on quite a bit, but imo it has the correct groundwork setup. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dgaxuia", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492307650.0, "created_utc": 1492278850.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jx3y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jx3y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jx3y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jx3y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbqdq4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cyronscript", "parent_id": "t1_dgb8qa0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Imho, game devs should just accept that fact and make the best single narrative storyline they can.

There's basically no such thing as an independent agent that operates in the narrative of those games, unless you really want to bend the words to mean a scripted character who shows up here and there, and alters the storyline in a scripted fashion. The systems of those three games the player has the most control over are their inventories and equipment, which are not so much what I imagine when I think of role-playing a fantasy hero saving the world. However, those same systems make more sense for the role-playing experience in those other games I mention, but they'd still be empty if that's all there was. It's the interplay in those games between the player, their forces, and the forces of the independent agents that makes them compelling.\n\nA game that's more \"on-rails\" narratively in the same vein as DA:I and ME, but still has that agent driven interplay, is the games in the STALKER series. The monsters and NPCs in the game are fairly independent- going hunting, scavenging, looking for loot- on their own accord. You have situations in the game where you can tag along a group of raiders investigating some run-down ruins, where it isn't a single scripted moment. Stuff like that happens all over in the game all the time, and it's never very predictable.\n\nI guess my point is role-playing is more compelling in the kind of games with interplay between the player character and independent agents.

And the gameplay of those types of games supports that kind of narrative, because most of what happens is driven by the player, or independent agents. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Games that are more or less on rails (story/ narrative wise) like DA:I and ME, and the Witcher 3 to a lesser extent, are not so great for role-playing in that way. There&amp;#39;s basically no such thing as an independent agent that operates in the narrative of those games, unless you really want to bend the words to mean a scripted character who shows up here and there, and alters the storyline in a scripted fashion. The systems of those three games the player has the most control over are their inventories and equipment, which are not so much what I imagine when I think of role-playing a fantasy hero saving the world. However, those same systems make more sense for the role-playing experience in those other games I mention, but they&amp;#39;d still be empty if that&amp;#39;s all there was. It&amp;#39;s the interplay in those games between the player, their forces, and the forces of the independent agents that makes them compelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A game that&amp;#39;s more &amp;quot;on-rails&amp;quot; narratively in the same vein as DA:I and ME, but still has that agent driven interplay, is the games in the STALKER series. The monsters and NPCs in the game are fairly independent- going hunting, scavenging, looking for loot- on their own accord. You have situations in the game where you can tag along a group of raiders investigating some run-down ruins, where it isn&amp;#39;t a single scripted moment. Stuff like that happens all over in the game all the time, and it&amp;#39;s never very predictable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my point is role-playing is more compelling in the kind of games with interplay between the player character and independent agents. I want to play a game, not read a book. Although I still like the &amp;quot;book-reading&amp;quot; games, the emergent agent-driven kind of role-playing is more my thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dgb679h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492318984.0, "created_utc": 1492290184.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jx3y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbfela", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mequittingthenet", "parent_id": "t3_65jx3y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I feel like the only way to \"Create\" a character through dialog is make dialog choices level dialog \"stats\".
