Or worse, you&amp;#39;ve now got two objects stuck inside each other and you need to move them apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, getting back - this big ol&amp;#39; barrier is designed to push you back with &amp;quot;infinite knockback&amp;quot; (whatever that means) so you can never pass through it. However, it seems that by making link move fast enough (as far as the game is concerned) and getting the angle just right, it might be making the game think he&amp;#39;s further inside the barrier than he looks so when the physics kicks in, it &amp;quot;knocks him back&amp;quot; but in the wrong direction - to the other side of the barrier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, just a complete guess. Game physics going wonky is usually because something&amp;#39;s moving too fast or the &amp;quot;step&amp;quot; time isn&amp;#39;t small enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg472so", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491943377.0, "created_utc": 1491914577.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 66}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pk7d", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4hbmh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "-Mantis", "parent_id": "t1_dg44zu6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A very precise angle and a lot of speed.
