She probably is in the top ten for the most memorable character designs to have come out in the PS3/360 generation of games.\n\nI'm really glad this game has come to PC. It means a much wider range of people can play it. And it deserves to be played, over and over again. You may end your first playthrough with getting all Bronze or Stone trophies at the end of each mission. But don't be discouraged! If you practice, learn from your mistakes and put in the effort in general, the game will reward you in ways that few games can.\n\nThe rewarding feeling that comes from the replayability is a conscious design decision from director Hideki Kamiya himself. As he says in the video: \n\n&gt; \"One of my goals with it was to create a game that players could replay over and over and enjoy more the better they get at it. \n\nWho knows, if you keep at the game, eventually you'll get as good as [this player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj0W1uJJKo)!\n\nMore importantly, Bayonetta on PC also means that there is finally hardware that can play the game at the flawless 60fps it deserves, because even on the Xbox 360 version widely considered to be the best version, the framerate is still often quite terrible. For example, as early as Chapter II, during the part right after you first encounter the Enchants, you enter into this circular plaza-like area where you will fight several more of these Enchants and, later on, two Beloved enemies. As soon as you enter into this circular area, the game slows down like crazy. It runs in like slow motion, even before the Enchants have spawned in. This happens every single fucking time. The next chapter is even worse. The Xbox 360 just can't handle all those burning effects in the entire level.\n\nBut, really, most important of all is that a PC version also means that there is still a way to play the game even in the future. So if there comes a day when the PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U consoles are either no longer sold or are only available at exorbitant collector's prices, there is still a way for people to play this wonderful, wonderful game.
