I&amp;#39;m running a FX-6300 with a GTX 1060 in it. The FX-6300 is an old CPU several generations old I scrounged up from one of my old systems that is currently priced a third of what I paid for my GTX 1060 (a current gen graphics card that is considered the Nvidia 1080p king), and yet when I load up Mass Effect Andromeda or Tomb Raider my GPU sits at 95-99% usage while my CPU stays at 70% load. A shitty, several-generations old CPU with an extremely low IPC is keeping up just fine with a current-gen GPU that is triple its price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and isn&amp;#39;t getting a huge upgrade&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There has been zero news on what architecture it&amp;#39;ll be using, which will be the majority of the deciding factor of how it performs. It&amp;#39;s impossible to claim &amp;quot;isn&amp;#39;t getting a huge upgrade&amp;quot; when we have no idea what architecture it&amp;#39;ll use. Frankly even if it doesn&amp;#39;t get one the GPU is still the deciding factor. Again, more BS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: CPUs don&amp;#39;t decide FPS 95%+ of the time in gaming, please actually look up facts before you spew BS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg8k7wn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492162292.0, "created_utc": 1492133492.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6579d2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ng2k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BlessedBack", "parent_id": "t1_dg8jb9x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You have no idea what you're talking about kind sir ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have no idea what you&amp;#39;re talking about kind sir &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg9ng2k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492228311.0, "created_utc": 1492199511.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8jb9x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Delta_Assault", "parent_id": "t1_dg8j7fe", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Except that framerate is more dependent on the CPU, which isn't getting a huge upgrade.
