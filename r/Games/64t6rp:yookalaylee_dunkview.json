Also, looking upwards is difficult, which is especially frustrating since one ability requires you to look at a grapple point to use it. \n\nManually aiming projectiles forces you to stand still, something that most developers stopped doing once we got a second stick. It should've worked like Darksiders: click the right stick to go into aiming mode, then move and aim like a third-person shooter and shoot with R2. Oddly you click left stick to enter aim mode, while the right stick centers the camera, but centering the camera is also mapped to R1. \n\nAnd the levels are just really big and confusing. They should have maps. The Banjo games didn't have maps, sure, and I guess they wanted to stay true to that, but honestly it's something that always annoyed me. Or at least they could've used warp points like Tooie. \n\nBUT, like I said, I'm still loving it. The world is fun to explore, with things that constantly grab your attention. I'll frequently see something interesting a little ways away, but on my way to it see something else interesting, and on my way to that I'll see something else interesting, and by the time I arrive at my first destination, I've collected like 5 Pagies. It's kinda like what I experienced in Breath of the Wild, albeit on a smaller scale. \n\nAnd part of the reason the world is fun to explore is because Yooka is fun to control. He's very quick, way quicker than any other 3D platformer hero I've played as, (well, minus Sonic and co.). The massive distance you can get from Laylee's glide gives you a lot of freedom of movement. And the controls are mostly very responsive (I honestly thought almost too much so when I started, but quickly got used to it), except when they're intentionally clumsy, like when rolling. \n\nTying in to both previous points, I love the Metroidvania elements, where you'll get a new power and remember earlier areas where you could use them, then go back and find new areas, or collectibles, or shortcuts that make it easier to get around. \n\nAlso, I've seen several reviews complain about the story and dialogue, which I totally don't get. I think they nailed the Banjo style and sense of humor, and it frequently makes me laugh. I never get tired of Laylee saying mean and sarcastic things and everyone just failing to register it as an insult. \n\nOverall, I feel like they delivered on exactly what they advertised, and exactly what I expected: Banjo-Kazooie but with different characters. Maybe they could have modernized a few aspects, but I think the game is still plenty of fun despite that.\n\nPeople keep comparing it to Mighty No. 9, which is just insane.
