Put it in!\n\nDriverless cars/buses are a technology that's coming right around the corner. Put em in! Even if it's just as an unlockable after 'x' number of years, so be it.\n\n4) Include a more diverse modding toolkit, that uses optimized modules.\n\nThis was one of the things that Planet Coaster did right. Having optimized modules allows creators to have freedom without creating wildly inconsistent poly counts and visuals for the models. Base the modules off of modern architectural concepts. If players want extra detail/depth on the models such as paint jobs or custom signs, let em use a bump map under the texture, don't make it a mesh.\n\n5) Options for larger land parcels.\n\nThis is something where they would benefit heavily from using Unreal over Unity. Having to use mods to artificially expand the workable land area is silly. Optimize how the cities load and allow players to optimize elements such as draw distance for larger cities to help offload some of the computational workload to the simulation.\n\n6) Build on the district concepts.\n\nDistricts are a great idea, but they need to build on this concept. You should be able to take a low-income/industrialized district and mark it for gentrification and watch it slowly transform into a hipster hangout. Having elements like a 'Downtown' district that marks that area for the growth of only certain types of businesses like clubs would be fantastic. It would also be nice to see them embrace reality a little more and be able to set 'red light' districts where strip clubs and the like would pop up.

A beach district where boardwalks and surf shops pop up would also be phenomenally cool. A rural district would be incredible as well where only farmhouses and the like pop up. Basically, just turn districts into a tool that can impose higher levels of customization to zones.\n\n7) Fix the water and waterlines.\n\nWe don't need realistic water simulation. I mean christ. Just have it be a fucking texture for all I care. Just don't make land customization and earth moving a herculean challenge to my patience as a player. This would also help fix the problem with waterlines. They behave wildly inconsistently because the water doesn't behave in a way that makes the game fun. Realism should never be adhered to at the sacrifice of fun in-game. If I want to create a beach, I shouldn't have to worry about it being overtaken by a suddenly rising sea.
