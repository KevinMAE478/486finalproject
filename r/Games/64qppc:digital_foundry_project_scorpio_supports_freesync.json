That resulted in a profit of $542 million for the quarter, more than double the $261 million profit from the previous quarter and up 120 percent from what it collect a year ago.\nThose are obscene numbers and newly released data from market research firm Jon Peddie Research only adds to them. The tracking firm notes that NVIDIA&amp;#39;s overall GPU shipments jumped an impressive 39 percent last quarter, eclipsing shipment gains by AMD (20 percent) and Intel (18 percent) combined.\n&amp;quot;If anyone doubted that the PC was the platform of choice for gaming, this quarter\u2019s results will correct that misconception. The gaming market is lifting the entire PC market and has over whelmed the console market,&amp;quot; JPR said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goes back to my original point, this idea that the market is going to teach Nvidia a lesson is absurd. Revenue driven by discrete gaming GPUs will soon be eclipsed by what they are doing on the datacenter and deep learning (AI, self driving cars etc) side within a few short years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, I can see the argument that not embracing an open standard can be viewed as anti-consumer, anti-choice. But that was never the argument I was making. My whole point is given how big Nvidia has become in the past few years, and just how big they will continue to get, I don&amp;#39;t think they Jen Sen Huang or anyone in their Boardroom meetings are necessarily concerned with losing market share over this whole open standards thing, especially since open standards aren&amp;#39;t necessarily translating into increased revenue for AMD and/or their hardware partners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg4l61a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491960289.0, "created_utc": 1491931489.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4izdt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Magyman", "parent_id": "t1_dg4fa0u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;benchmarks and sales figures\n\nWhich of you provide none of.

Consoles are basically just plug and play. Plus, even when you get the PC setup, it still isn&amp;#39;t nearly as couch gaming friendly as a console which is how most console gamers play. I feel like more and more often I see fewer people with dedicated desk setups, it&amp;#39;s mainly laptop use on the couch/dining room table. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some other points: From what I&amp;#39;ve heard, many of the Xbox One games that are available on PC have low online populations so if you want to play ranked multiplayer, you&amp;#39;re going to have a bad time on PC. On the subject of costs, if you&amp;#39;re paying $60 for Xbox Live, you&amp;#39;re doing it wrong. You can regularly find year cards for $35. Plus consoles have the added benefit of being able to resell games (assuming you don&amp;#39;t buy digitally) once you&amp;#39;re finished with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, my point is there are pros and cons to PC and console gaming.

And I&amp;#39;m not saying this to bash consoles at all (I have a PS4 Pro and PC). What I mean is if more XB1 titles are coming to the Windows 10 store, can&amp;#39;t I just make my PC an XB1 machine without having to pay the XBL sub fee?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The initial cost of Scorpio might be cheaper, but in the long term you&amp;#39;ll be dumping 60 bucks into XBL annually. You&amp;#39;ll still have to trade the system in every 3 or so years to get the latest model, whereas on a PC you can just upgrade the CPU/GPU. Scorpio can&amp;#39;t play PC games, whereas PCs can play (some) XB1 games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t wrap my head around what the purpose of this thing is anymore if it&amp;#39;s taking up more PC features, when I could just buy a PC. It&amp;#39;s almost like Microsoft has ragequit the console wars and has simply decided to merge the Xbox brand into becoming a PC Steam Machine of its own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg4fq6a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491954339.0, "created_utc": 1491925539.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qppc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qppc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qppc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qppc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qppc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4u1s8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tiny_Danson_Man", "parent_id": "t1_dg4tnnj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Right.
