On TV they avoid the downtime by cutting out the boring parts of travel and research.  Star Citizen can&amp;#39;t do that.  It has to take real time to get from Starbase 1 to Ceti Alpha 5, because the rest of the universe has to take that time too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only way I can think of to make crewing a Starship interesting is by having minigames like the hacking in Bioshock.  As Geordi I would see on my screen &amp;quot;Power lost on Holodeck 3, please reroute&amp;quot; and it would bring up a minigame.
