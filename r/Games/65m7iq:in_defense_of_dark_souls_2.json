But that, in my opinion, is missing an important part of what makes great level design into great level design. It's missing an important part of what makes exploration and discovery fun in games. What you can *see* IS important. Really, really important actually. I'm going to be lazy and copypaste something I wrote about it recently.    \n\nHow the visuals and layout of a level are framed is, imo, probably one of the greatest and most underrated factors involved in all this. You can see examples of it in pretty much all the best Souls levels - they do a great job capturing your attention quickly by framing the level in such a way that you can see, or suspect, what lies inside it. It gets your imagination going right away. It primes you for the exploratory experience ahead and the payoff just keeps happening if the level continues to take it into account.       \n\nTo exemplify with one of the few truly great examples of this from DS2, just think about Brume Tower's opening moment. Think about how exquisitely the gigantic tower is framed against the orange sky, with the giant chain leading up to it and all these exterior paths, whole other towers and various bits and pieces sticking out of it. With that moment alone the level design has already taken a huge step toward success. Then you cross the chain, and once inside you can look down to see a dizzying amount of paths and hallways spiraling deep, deep down. Shulva does something similar with its opening moments where you can see how the city and temple fit together and snake throughout the giant cave, and even see down all the way to the shallow water where the Imperfect roam. Just from that visual alone I was hooked in an instant, more hooked than anything in the entire other game of DS2.   \n\nI really can't emphasize enough how important I think this is, even if you don't consciously think about it. The DS2 DLC work well as examples here because they're such a sharp contrast to the base game. Take Lost Bastille, which is even one of the better levels - it almost completely lacks this great \"framing\". It's too enclosed to see anything properly and most of it looks identical anyway. The place you arrive can't be seen. The boss room can't be seen. It fails to develop a \"sense of place\", so it just feels like going through a bunch of random rooms and corridors. They are pretty well put together rooms and corridors don't get me wrong, but it's still only a good close to great, not truly excellent level.    \n\nYou can contrast this with virtually anything, even the otherwise not so great levels, of DS1 and DS3. They virtually always let you see one place from another, see how a level fit together. They foreshadow upcoming areas (example: seeing the giant crystal cluster when you exit the prison tower in Duke's Archives). I think this is pretty fucking great level design, and it's largely missing in DS2. I think this is actually a very important part of why DS2's level design is decried so much compared with the others. The game's overarching world design (which is still level design, just on a macro scale) also totally lacked this great sense of place. It only has a few examples of showing upcoming areas in the distance and they're always \"fakes\", that is, they don't actually match how you then go on to travel there. And people *do* notice that sort of thing, it harms your sense of place and scale even if you don't sit and consciously think about it on a moment to moment basis.     \n\nBut, as I mentioned, in the DLC all this is totally different. The areas are huge and you can see so much from so many vantage points. These vantage points also perfectly match the way you actually move throughout the levels. It adds so much to the thrill of exploration when things work like this. It really can't be praised enough.     \n\nIn short, what may be dismissed as simply visuals can actually have a huge impact on how you experience the game - even in such a mechanics-oriented experience as Dark Souls. I absolutely think this is a core component of high quality level design for a Souls game. Perhaps even more than the mechanical layouts and features of the levels it's a key part of why Dark Souls 2's level design feels so lackluster. You can see it in other parts of the series too. The Demon Ruins in DS3, for example, is by all accounts a decently put together level but a lot of people *hate* this area because it's so visually bland - it's all samey-looking undergrounded tunnels, with the sole highlight being when you go out into the open space and can see a bunch of stuff.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely one of the most fundamental differences between DS2 and the other games.

The biggest offender is the transition from Earthen Peak to Iron Keep, of course; you take an elevator up from a mountain peak in the desert, and wind up in a fiery fortress surrounded by a wasteland of lava, as far as the eye can see.

[Here we have the dev Yui Tanimura talking to IGN about features that were supposed to surpass DS1, but was also silently removed from the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_JFDPCtXFY), and these were the things that Bloodborne did without even promoting it.\n\nI try every now and then to play DS2 and get through the DLC, but I personally still hate playing it because it has such a different feel from DS1, BB, and DS3 that it feels like a knockoff game that didn't get it right with things done with such blunt laziness (knee-high obstructions, Earthen Peak to Iron Keep, etc.)\n\nI used to think that the B Team didn't even play DS1 because it didn't advance the things that made DS1 great. The lore, the way healing works with Estus Flask in that you have X amount of charges to get as far as you can towards the next bonfire, the tension in that run, the interconnectivity of the world, illusory walls and secret worlds, etc. But then DS3 came. It was much closer to DS1 then DS2, but it also didn't build on those pillars. And now the final DLC which released polarized the fanbase, half absolutely loving it and the other half thinking its bullshit. The problem doesn't stem from the B-team if Miyazaki himself directed it and didn't steer it the way the DS1 players remember DS1 fondly for.

I always forgot to equip lifegems so I think I ended up buying around 10 of the small ones from a merchant, then only using them in later ngs... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get why people focus so much on the lifegems but imo they&amp;#39;re really not that important. If you want to use them, fair. If you don&amp;#39;t want to use them, thats&amp;#39; fair too.

Imagine if you only started with say, 2-3 Estus Flasks, and the only way you could get more was to successfully fight enemies. Each point of damage you do corresponds to a certain % of a charge filled.

Landing successful hits on a boss without getting hit yourself would let you slowly but surely claw your way back into a decent position even if you start out on a bad note (a game I've been playing recently, Hollow Knight, works like this, and it's pretty cool). In bosses with multiple enemies you'd gain bigger chunks back by killing the mooks.

He mentions that it's frustrating to be part way through a section and run out of Estus, meaning you know you're fucking and are going to lose your progress. However, I think this ignores both the feeling of tension gained when you're frantically trying to find a new bonfire while on low health, wondering if each new corner would either bring a checkpoint of bring an encounter with an enemy. I think that's an important feeling which Life Gems remove.\n\nAlso, I think he overemphasises the slowness. It only take ~10 seconds to go from barely any to full health with a Life Gem, especially if you're using the more expensive ones. This, combined with the fact that they're quicker to consume, means they're much more feasible to use in bosses, making it much more realistic just to trade hits with a boss and come out fine. \n\nOn my first DS2 run, I didn't use any Life Gems (I have an aversion to consumables in games in general), and I feel like it led to a much better experience. \n\n2) Humanoids in Armour\n\nYeah, I agree with his point 100% here. I think there's a reason why Artorias is generally seen as the best boss in DS1, and Fume Knight and Sir Alonne in DS2.  Dark Souls' mechanics are best suited to 1v1 fights with similarly sized enemies. \n\n3) Groups of Enemies\n\nfirst of all don't you dare insult my boy matthew\n\nSecondly, sure, crowd control is a skill, but I think the mechanics of the game actively hinder that attempt. Especially with weapons that have thrust rather than stab attacks, it's difficult to hit enemies without locking on. He brings up the Prowling Magnus fight, but I think the crawling enemies especially prove this. The inability to move the camera while being locked on to an enemy *is* a mechanical issue which makes group fights awkward. There are also plenty of examples which (iirc) Matthew brings up \n\nI also think it's a bit dickish insulting Matthew over his use of the shield, especially when all the games promotional information showed a dude using a shield, and especially when the core mechanics of the game (through Agility effecting your iFrames) disincentives the 'pro' way of playing by making rolling through attacks much more difficult and obtuse. The game also does a poor job of communicating that shields aren't needed. I thought 'git gud' was only used as an ironic argument...\n\n4) Tracking\n\nCircle strafing may have been a bit cheese, but the solution was to make the enemies have animations which actually make sense, not make them rotate like a spinning top so they can hit you. The Turtle Knights, which Matthew brings up in his review, are a perfect example of removing backstab cheese, but they *still* have horrible tracking. Again, this just seems like a 'git gud' argument rather than dealing with the flaw. \n\n5) Interconnected levels and linearity. \n\nI don't really care either way, I think there's arguments for both DS1's and DS2's level design. However, it seems a bit of an awkward argument to criticise the runs to bosses in DS1 when runs to bosses in DS2 (such as Vendrick, The Rotten, etc.) are also pretty horrible. DS1 also has plenty of well designed levels that can lead you through in both directions (like Sens' Fortress, Painted World). He brings up Blight Town as an example, but I seem to remember loads of people criticising that level design at the time. \n\n6) Linearity in individual fights. \n\nI feel this argument is a bit cherry picked. There are loads of examples in DS1 where you can bait individual enemies away from a group, or pull them away from the view of archers. For example, in the Berg with the open area just after the drake, you can either run into the middle and dodge the arrows, or run past the enemies and kill the archer first, or pull the enemies either into the corridor before the drake or the wall near the archer. \n\nAnd no, there are no arguments that make the Shrine of Amana good. 'Snipe enemies with your bow' doesn't make it any better, just shows how tedious it is. And you can't argue 'git gud' in an earlier argument than criticise purists who don't want to summon. \n\n7) Shields\n\nYeah, I can see where he's coming from, but I still don't think they do a good job of it. The game barely gave you any new items in the first few encounters (as someone who started my first run with a Bandit Knife learnt to their dismay...). In Majula, the only shop at the start only sells shields and armour too. Furthermore, the agility skill completely disincentives using dodges unless you actually know the background mechanics quite well.\n\n8) Plot\n\nYeah, I don't really disagree. I think the plot of DS2 is a bit unfairly criticised. However, I still think Hbomb unfairly criticises Matthew's critique in this regard. Hbomb calls DS2's plot 'an unsolvable puzzle', but that implies there was, at some point, a solution. As Matthew says, the issue was that while DS1 felt like there was something comprehensive hidden from us that we'll never really no, DS2 feels like they like just attempted to emulate that *without* having this underlying structure. And again, as Matthew says in his review (which apparently Hbomb missed?), sure, they might be trying to go for a mysterious 'you'll never really know what happened' plot line, but that's still a bit of a lazy plotline. \n", "edited": 1492327545.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Life Gems&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I disagree with this point.

Life regen system just feels lazy. They artificially increased difficulty in the game by making you fight multiple fast foes regularly. So they've tried to balance it with infinite health regen items. It's heavily diminished value of estus flasks which use animation is slower and which effect can't stack (you could easily pop 2-3 gems in most situations). Doesn't help that heal from estus was made over time, which is also decreased it's value. In DS1 and 3 you're happy when you find estus upgrades, in DS2 you don't care because you can always buy more gems. \n\n2. I agree that technical fights with humanoids is more interesting than with with some giant enemies. But i think problem of DS2 is that their moveset is very similar from fight to fight. Encounters like Lost Sinner was interesting because how agile this enemy is. But most bosses use heavy armor with sword and shield which makes their moveset very similar. Also fuck mirror warrior or how the fuck he's called. Horrible design of boss mechanic. \n\n3. Camera. Let's be honest, camera in souls games was always garbage if you're in free camera mode. Game clearly is not designed for free camera use like in many slasher games. DS1 mostly used philosophy of duel encounters and it's camera and fighting mechanics adapted for this philosophy. DS2 doesn't changed or adapted anything for a new philosophy of multiple enemies at once, and therefore it feels like game is cheating. \n\n4. Enemy's lock on system. It's just bad. It wasn't perfect in DS1 because it was way to easy to cheese many enemies and backstab them. But in DS2 it's just pure lazy game design. You can see why after you play DS3 where this problem is correctly fixed. You can't cheese most of the enemies because they're to fast. Their attack consists of 2-5 hits combos where they could change direction in mid-combo. When they attack, they don't spin on a place like in DS2, they do what normal human would do on their place. How the hell you can defend this is beyond my understanding. \n\n\nI'm not sure that i want to watch more.

Dks2 has infinite heals, mostly because of the high number of multiple enemies encounters which means that you&amp;#39;re most likely to get hit. Not a real bad change though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;combat: though in my opinion mechanically great, the combat feels bad. It&amp;#39;s floaty, hits have no impact and the way your character moves feels weird at first. I like this combat for PvP, but for PvE it&amp;#39;s worse than the two other games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for me. PvE is mostly worse than other Souls, but it does have high replayability and a great PvP system which make it the one I played the most. The dlcs are cool though and I like replaying through them sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dgbujwa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492359776.0, "created_utc": 1492330976.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m7iq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m7iq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m7iq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbyd86", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sugioh", "parent_id": "t1_dgby9xq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's normal for any solid sequel that nevertheless strays from player expectations significantly.
