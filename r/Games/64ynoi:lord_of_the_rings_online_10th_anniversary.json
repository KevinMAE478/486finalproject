The watcher is debatable depending on which version you fought. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think Shadows of Angmar really nailed it. There was such a strong focus on radiance, but it came from hope tokens, the captain, the special item from Helegrod, etc. Not from your gear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conjunctions were also crazy important at critical moments in raid fights. The teamwork in SoA was, I think perfect. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think moria kind of ruined the balance that SoA had. Legendary Weapons had atrocious RNG and the glowy stuff on them was so over the top it didn&amp;#39;t look like something out of middle Earth. Legendary Weapons and the way the gear grind worked wrecked the games economy. Entire crafting professions became worthless overnight. And I wish the gear did not use radiance as a gate. It was way too obvious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other then that, moria was gorgeous. Turbine really killed it in creating the atmosphere, and top notch story telling, and the game was still fun. After moria I kind of dropped off. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dg6yhwv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492077372.0, "created_utc": 1492048572.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6pi90", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nan0machines", "parent_id": "t1_dg68ine", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Watcher and Dar Nargubud were incredible raids.

You had to team up with others for a lot of quests but they were arranged on the map in a way you always ran into other people who needed the same things. I also loved its player driven economy (at least in the early days). How high level crafting depended on materials from many different professions, from raids, from world bosses, etc. so you needed to trade and make deals with other players. And how crafting low to mid level gear was balanced in a way that low-mid level players could afford it and the crafters could actually make money from crafting them. Getting help from other players to get your book pages and class quest items. LotRO really did feel like Lord of the Rings in the way you were encouraged to help other players accomplish daunting objectives.

The game world is remarkable, combat is still remarkably responsive, it's still receiving plenty of updates with plans to overhaul the player character models -again-, and it has managed to secure development from an independent studio as opposed to being wrangled by Turbine (Who was starting to go under, and start shifting focus to mobile games).\n\nTo this day, the Shire remains my favourite zone in any MMO. Yeah you spend 75% of it doing mundane stuff like chasing animals, delivering post and preparing for a festival. But throughout all the quest text, there are some subtle hints that something isn't quite right in the Shire, not since the Black Rider visited looking for Baggins. Sure enough, you discover Goblins have begin to creep across the borders, but nobody believes you, and it's not until you finally leave the Shire that you realise that the shadows of Mordor have extended much further than the quaint Hobbits would have liked.\n\nLOTRO to me is unique in that it's one of the few MMOs around that treats leveling as a core experience, rather than an obligatory chore you have to zip through ASAP just to get to the \"real\" game at the end of it. Patches regularly just add entire new zones and quest hubs, often even increasing the level cap, with the odd dungeon and -very- occasionally a raid. Admittedly this does cause a problem towards the end, where the speed of leveling becomes abysmally slow, but the game is clearly about the journey, not the destination. I've poured dozens of hours into the game, and have yet to even reach Moria (I'm an altoholic).\n\nThe free to play model isn't perfect, however, if you're willing to throw up cash for all the expansions plus a month of VIP, you can:\n\n* Get enough premium currency to just buy all the quest packs when they're on sale, which is often. Just with what you get from buying the expansions.\n* Unlock all the F2P limitations by making a character and rushing them to level 7, takes less than an hour each. This removest he gold and trait restrictions entirely and persists even aftery our VIP expires.\n* Mounts and other helpful items galore\n* And more besides\n\nI won't lie, especially the latest expansion tends to be a bit stiff on the price, but if it's a one time payment to basically remove every limit on the game, I'm up for it. it's not unlike the lifetime subscription they offered ages ago, which one of my friends had (And to this day he's still a VIP, and has more currency than he knows what to do with).\n\nI strongly encourage people at least give this game a try, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
