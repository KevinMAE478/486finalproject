So far i know 2 games that explicitly support it (Dying light and now Soma). There might be some hacks for it? (like how you could play any game with VR). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it really cool, but since the support is currently lacking, i find it hard to shell out 160\u20ac for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Ok, slightly mistaken, &lt;a href=\"https://tobiigaming.com/games/\"&gt;there are more then 2 games&lt;/a&gt;.
