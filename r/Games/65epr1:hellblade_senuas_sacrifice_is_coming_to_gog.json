The developers prioritized all the wrong things about Enslaved. They put all their efforts into making the *context* the draw for the game without actually doing something interesting with the game.\n\nGames like Metal Gear Solid may have a large amount of cutscenes, but they're still fundamentally games. Kojima did not forget to design a fully-fleshed out game with depth to its mechanics, and as a result the Metal Gear games work well as games. The cutscenes are long and there is extensive story content, but this isn't a problem and overall adds to the experience because the game is mechanically well-designed.\n\nEnslaved's problem is that its developers were not thoughtful enough to achieve what they were trying to do. They half-assed the game mechanics because they were trying to tell a story, but forgot that in a game, the most important thing is the *game*.\n\nNinja Theory didn't do something as radical as simply making Enslaved a \"software film\" that took advantage of its medium to allow you to, for example, pan the camera as you watched it. They didn't do something as intelligent as simply taking out the combat and climbing entirely. My problem with Enslaved is that as a narrative experience, the gameplay is purely detractive from it, and as a game, it's just mediocre. They didn't do something as radical as try to take the David Cage approach (though I have a lot of very major problems with that approach as well).\n\nI don't see why every piece of interactive software has to be labeled as a game. What exactly is wrong with criticizing a game purely on the basis of the its mechanics? After all, if it labels itself as a \"game\", it needs to be judged as one. I'm tired of these people who seem to have the idea that games are an artistic medium that have somehow evolved beyond being \"games\", even though they still call themselves that. If a product that calls itself a game is bad as a game, then it is a bad product.\n\nI do think narrative can add to a game. Persona 5 (or most visual novels) is a good example of this. They have narratives that are affected by the player's choice, and therefore fully benefit from the fact that they are games. Persona would lose a lot from dropping its mechanics and becoming an anime (as we saw with 4). Telltale's games and Life is Strange are basically choose-your-own-adventure and therefore fully benefit from being games and having the mechanics that they do, because something as simple as allowing the player to make choices is gameplay.

Persona 5 (or most visual novels) is a good example of this. They have narratives that are affected by the player&amp;#39;s choice, and therefore fully benefit from the fact that they are games. Persona would lose a lot from dropping its mechanics and becoming an anime (as we saw with 4). Telltale&amp;#39;s games and Life is Strange are basically choose-your-own-adventure and therefore fully benefit from being games and having the mechanics that they do, because something as simple as allowing the player to make choices is gameplay. Again, this is the main thing that rubbed me the wrong way about Enslaved - if it wanted to be a narrative experience so bad, why even have the game sections that were so poorly designed and purely detracted from the experience?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dgb3lj1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492315422.0, "created_utc": 1492286622.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb1rc1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JJBYACH", "parent_id": "t1_dgaxnsd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think gameplay can detract from the narrative expession if done wrong.
