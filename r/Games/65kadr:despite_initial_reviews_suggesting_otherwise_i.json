Being able to get better angles on the enemy is just one of the benefits, but a massive one... yet sadly grabbing onto ledges seems to be a concept that escapes your character every other attempt.

Take your pick as to how you&amp;#39;d like to view this issue, to me they&amp;#39;re both two sides of the same coin. As evidenced by the community&amp;#39;s testing, even the heaviest hitting pistols like the Carnifex, what amounts to Mass Effect&amp;#39;s version of a Desert Eagle, can take &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; headshots just to kill the most basic of enemies. &lt;em&gt;Three&lt;/em&gt;. That&amp;#39;s absolutely pitiful, and the problem obviously gets worse as you move up the enemy&amp;#39;s tiers (as it should, but given the problem this only comes across as a negative in the gameplay&amp;#39;s context). This means that despite your added agility in this game, combat eventually becomes an overbearing chore because you almost have to mag dump most guns just to secure a kill on an average shielded enemy. You spend an overly large amount of time just running away, and trying your hardest to let your character reload.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following are problems that unfortunately combine with the above, or others down below, to result in what is just an amazingly unsatisfying experience when compared to the first iteration of multiplayer in the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech and Biotic powers have been nerfed into near oblivion. Indeed they&amp;#39;ve also been &amp;quot;generalized&amp;quot; in the gameplay&amp;#39;s context to such a point that they don&amp;#39;t even feel like added variety anymore. Very rarely will you actually be playing differently because of them outside of body effects like Cloak, or Charge.  Nearly all primers can be detonated by all detonators. Yet tech abilities are only moderately better than most biotics when it comes to attacking shielded enemies. Combined with the far tankier enemies, you&amp;#39;re almost forced to make weapons based classes out of classes that should otherwise be dedicated to their powers. Biotics no longer play like biotics, they just play like a &amp;quot;Weapons Platform&amp;quot; that just happens to have space magic... Terribly underpowered space magic, unless you&amp;#39;re playing either the Krogan Vanguard (which we&amp;#39;ll touch on later,) or the Asari Adept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melee, and Sniping are the unequivocal kings of multiplayer. Remember the Krogan Vanguard from like two seconds ago? Yeah, good thing he&amp;#39;s a Krogan or else he&amp;#39;d be damn near useless. Melee attacks hold benefits over most guns in that they can kill deal comparatively absurd amounts of damage whilst stunning most of their targets. The only time you&amp;#39;re not going to wanting to do this with nearly any class that has it as an option is when fighting boss enemies that have the dreaded sync kill abilities. Sniping once again returns to its former glory by being the only gun class in the game that can actually deal decent damage alongside the burst boons like Cloaking, which increases damage whilst active. The &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; assault rifle in the game is ironically the Raptor &lt;em&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/em&gt;. Don&amp;#39;t even bother bringing 9/10 AR&amp;#39;s into multiplayer, because they&amp;#39;re weaker than a dry pool noodle. Yeah, they don&amp;#39;t even qualify for a wet pool noodle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polish is almost non-existent in multiplayer. Like dang, you thought the campaign issues were bad? Ask me how many times my character&amp;#39;s body has simply flew across the map on death, almost giving the team a mission failure because nobody could get to the body in time to revive me. Double digits, easily. How about the constant crashes for the host just having a terrible connection? Dying before you&amp;#39;ve even spawn in? Shotgun wielding enemies acting as snipers? Yeah, we&amp;#39;ve got it all, baby. Speaking of polish, how about the Menu UI? Yeah, I think it&amp;#39;s awful too, bud. ME3&amp;#39;s multiplayer UI wasn&amp;#39;t a godsend, but it sure as hell should be considered one when compared to this.

You also have offensive powers that restore your shields, give you damage resistance, etc etc. \n\nYou also can't kill 5 top-difficulty mooks per clip anymore and can't kill a boss on the highest difficulty with a single clip of the Reegar or a single Flamer. Is that really a problem? I remember being able to spam double throw every 1.8 seconds or double chain overload to stunlock 3 enemies every 3.6 seconds. Very fun at first, but the lack of difficulty got boring quick.\n\nPower creep, the addition of gear, level IV consumables and the last weapon mods meant that Gold difficulty in ME3 was extremely easy. If they'd taken a similar combination of OP weapons and weak enemies and just added jetpacks, you'd just get a boringly easy game.\n\nI find Andromeda engaging on more levels than ME3 was. Smarter enemies, more diversity, better maps and cross-class combos promote teamwork.\n\nAlso, it's technically much better. You can play Vanguard off-host!

You also have offensive powers that restore your shields, give you damage resistance, etc etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also can&amp;#39;t kill 5 top-difficulty mooks per clip anymore and can&amp;#39;t kill a boss on the highest difficulty with a single clip of the Reegar or a single Flamer.
