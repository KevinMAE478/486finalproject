This is similar to one other expansion, Whispers of the old Gods, which was built around the **four** old god legendary cards. What Blizzard did in that expansion was to give all players one of the old gods for free, Cthun, which had synergy cards of low rarity which you were almost guaranteed to get a decent amount of with fairly low amount of packs. You may not have gotten the pinnacle of decks this way, but you got a good taste of the focus of the expansion with moderate spending (or even just gold if you saved up a chunk).\n\nIn Ungoro you have one quest legendary per class, 9 in total, and while they wont necessarily all be in high tier decks if you get a quest card and have an okay collection already before the expansion you will have cards to toy around with that quest since they mostly revolve around general mechanics (like deathrattle or returning minions to your hand). While there are 9 legendaries that are the main focus of the expansion, meaning more likely to get one from a legendary drop in a pack than in the Old Gods, Blizzard didn't give players any of these cards for free this time around. On average you get 1 legendary per 20 pack, with a guaranteed 1 per 40 packs, but you still easily can open $50 worth of packs without getting one.\n\nIt's also important to note that Ungoro probably has the most playable cards of high rarity (legendary and epic) than any expansion before it, not including adventures that came at a fixed reasonable price. In past expansions a lot of legendaries and epics were simply unplayable for various reasons, drastically reducing the cost to get the cards you needed to do various things. A little too early to say for certain, but Ungoro also seems to be one of the best designed expansions so far with a lot of interesting cards and very little \"filler cards\" (cards designed with no intent of being good or interesting. Typically a minion with weird stat distribution and no card text). In other words there are a lot of cards that is desirable either for competitive play/testing or simply for being interesting/fun, and many are rare/expensive.\n\nSo in conclusion the card designers really seemed to knock it out of the park this time, but the people who decides on how to distribute the content to players to ensure the cost of the expansion being on par with previous ones dropped the ball in a big way. Blizzard really needs to get on this and put at least a band aid on it as there's a lot of disappointed players who spent $40-$60 on the expansion and feel like they got nothing for it (compared to previous expansions especially). This also is terribly timed as it's not long ago Blizzard (obviously a completely different department) bumped up regional prices outside of the US due to currency fluctuation, which obviously still is fresh in people's minds. Someone in charge at Blizzard needs to take a step back and look at the bigger picture of customer satisfaction and make a hard decision that could decrease profits short term (like giving out more free rewards) for the benefit of the long term health of the game/player base.
