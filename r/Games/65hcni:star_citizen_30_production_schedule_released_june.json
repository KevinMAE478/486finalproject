And because most game developers wouldn&amp;#39;t put a product out there so early.. because they&amp;#39;re modules part of a bigger picture..  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;despite getting ridiculously overfunded  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overfunded? You mean the classic &amp;#39;they have enough money&amp;#39; type of thing?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and still begging for money in exchange for limited offer IAPs  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not as much &amp;#39;begging&amp;#39; as giving people who are willing to support the game with a larger than average amount of money the option in exchange for a specific ship that someone else might have to earn.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and 5 years of development time.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I build a car in 5 years.. the first year i build it with 3 people.. the next 2 years i build it with 100 people. It&amp;#39;s 5 years.. but it&amp;#39;s much less time of full up and running development not to mention they&amp;#39;re building 2 full games equivalent of a AAA game.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But i sort of understand, there are rabid fanboys.. but there is a equally as large group of uninformed idiots willing to set everything aside just to spout the same crap on everything related to star citizen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dgaiwue", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492281451.0, "created_utc": 1492252651.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgahcts", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fakeddit", "parent_id": "t1_dgah44d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 1, "body": "No, i mean people who defend a game that looks nothing like what was promised, despite getting ridiculously overfunded (and still begging for money in exchange for limited offer IAPs) and 5 years of development time.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, i mean people who defend a game that looks nothing like what was promised, despite getting ridiculously overfunded (and still begging for money in exchange for limited offer IAPs) and 5 years of development time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dgahcts", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492276455.0, "created_utc": 1492247655.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgah44d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PewPew95", "parent_id": "t1_dgaf1ay", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Support.. you mean people encased in their own little bubble unwilling to listen or research anything smashing it into the ground?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support.. you mean people encased in their own little bubble unwilling to listen or research anything smashing it into the ground?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Games", "name": "t1_dgah44d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492275694.0, "created_utc": 1492246894.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaf1ay", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fakeddit", "parent_id": "t3_65hcni", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "controversiality": 1, "body": "I just don't understand how this game is getting so much support on reddit.
