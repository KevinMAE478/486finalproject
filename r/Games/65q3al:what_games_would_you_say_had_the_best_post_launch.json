Sorry.\n\nBut I will give a ~~short(ish)~~ long explanation of what I'm talking about in regards to Rocket League (you should probably read the linked comment first).  Essentially, the only types of anti-aliasing Rocket League offers in the menu are post-process anti-aliasing methods.  This means that they take the final image, then look for high-contrast edges, and blur them.  Post-process anti-aliasing is really low-cost, meaning it doesn't take much power to do, but it's also not that great, and many people prefer not to use it.\n\nFortunately, with a PC, we can force different graphical options through the drivers.  For example, I can force MSAA or SSAA for Rocket League through my graphics card drivers.  \n\nMSAA, multi-sample anti-aliasing, is an efficient way of gathering extra data to smooth out the image, but in Rocket League it causes graphical artifacts in certain areas.  Specifically, the white lines on the sides of certain stages will get distracting black borders.  So MSAA for Rocket League is right out, in my opinion.\n\nSSAA, super-sampling anti-aliasing, is essentially just rendering a higher-resolution image, then scaling it down to fit your display.  This is the highest-quality anti-aliasing method, but it's also expensive.  For example, if I have a 1080p display, 4x SSAA is the equivalent of rendering in 4K!  And while Rocket League does run very well, rendering at a higher resolution inevitably drops the frame rate below what I'm aiming for, even at its lowest setting.\n\nHere are the final terms: checkerboard rendering and temporal anti-aliasing.  Checkerboard rendering is a method of upscaling used by many games on the PS4 Pro.  The PS4 Pro doesn't have the power to do 4K for most modern games, but checkerboard rendering is a method that utilizes data from previous frames, combined with the latest frame, to construct a higher-resolution, near-4K image.  Rocket League on the PS4 Pro does this.\n\nTemporal anti-aliasing is a somewhat similar method.  It uses data from previous frames to smooth out the current one.  This method has come about fairly recently for video games, and can be seen in Uncharted 4, DOOM 2016, and a good few other titles.  It is very low-cost since it just reuses data from previous frames, but it can produce a very high-quality result.  It's something of a miracle, in my opinion.\n\nNow, temporal anti-aliasing and checkerboard rendering both require the game to provide \"pixel-velocity data\" to extrapolate where pixels from the previous frames ended up in the newest one.  They use this data to smooth out or sharpen the current frame.  \n\nSince checkerboard rendering uses this data on the PS4 Pro, it's not entirely unreasonable to think that the PC version of Rocket League could be patched to use this data as well, for temporal anti-aliasing.  This would be a godsend for me, eliminating the jaggies in Rocket League without causing distracting artifacts or reducing performance too much.\n\nI'm sorry this ended up so long.  If I was a better writer, it might be shorter.  But if you took the time to read it, congrats - now you know.", "edited": 1492406109.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, would you believe it, I created this beautiful, simple, long explanation of the different anti-aliasing types... and then my app crashed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m just gonna link you to &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2ovroc/eli5what_is_anti_aliasing/cmr53zt/\"&gt;this reddit comment&lt;/a&gt;.  Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I will give a &lt;del&gt;short(ish)&lt;/del&gt; long explanation of what I&amp;#39;m talking about in regards to Rocket League (you should probably read the linked comment first).  Essentially, the only types of anti-aliasing Rocket League offers in the menu are post-process anti-aliasing methods.  This means that they take the final image, then look for high-contrast edges, and blur them.  Post-process anti-aliasing is really low-cost, meaning it doesn&amp;#39;t take much power to do, but it&amp;#39;s also not that great, and many people prefer not to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, with a PC, we can force different graphical options through the drivers.  For example, I can force MSAA or SSAA for Rocket League through my graphics card drivers.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MSAA, multi-sample anti-aliasing, is an efficient way of gathering extra data to smooth out the image, but in Rocket League it causes graphical artifacts in certain areas.  Specifically, the white lines on the sides of certain stages will get distracting black borders.  So MSAA for Rocket League is right out, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SSAA, super-sampling anti-aliasing, is essentially just rendering a higher-resolution image, then scaling it down to fit your display.  This is the highest-quality anti-aliasing method, but it&amp;#39;s also expensive.  For example, if I have a 1080p display, 4x SSAA is the equivalent of rendering in 4K!  And while Rocket League does run very well, rendering at a higher resolution inevitably drops the frame rate below what I&amp;#39;m aiming for, even at its lowest setting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are the final terms: checkerboard rendering and temporal anti-aliasing.  Checkerboard rendering is a method of upscaling used by many games on the PS4 Pro.  The PS4 Pro doesn&amp;#39;t have the power to do 4K for most modern games, but checkerboard rendering is a method that utilizes data from previous frames, combined with the latest frame, to construct a higher-resolution, near-4K image.  Rocket League on the PS4 Pro does this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Temporal anti-aliasing is a somewhat similar method.  It uses data from previous frames to smooth out the current one.  This method has come about fairly recently for video games, and can be seen in Uncharted 4, DOOM 2016, and a good few other titles.  It is very low-cost since it just reuses data from previous frames, but it can produce a very high-quality result.  It&amp;#39;s something of a miracle, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, temporal anti-aliasing and checkerboard rendering both require the game to provide &amp;quot;pixel-velocity data&amp;quot; to extrapolate where pixels from the previous frames ended up in the newest one.  They use this data to smooth out or sharpen the current frame.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since checkerboard rendering uses this data on the PS4 Pro, it&amp;#39;s not entirely unreasonable to think that the PC version of Rocket League could be patched to use this data as well, for temporal anti-aliasing.  This would be a godsend for me, eliminating the jaggies in Rocket League without causing distracting artifacts or reducing performance too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry this ended up so long.  If I was a better writer, it might be shorter.

I've lost count) the amount of content to play through by this point. Entire new categories of weapons introduced post-launch, enabling new playstyles. New characters with a new and interesting skill tree. Old systems revamped, new systems introduced. Much of it for free, and the rest at a very reasonable price, and often only your group's host would need to buy it.\n\nWorst: **Payday 2.** The first two years were a bona fide golden age of co-op gaming. Then things started heading downhill. Microtransactions were shoehorned in, with pay-to-unlock crates containing stat-boosting weapon mods that significantly unbalanced the game. That turned off a lot of people entirely, and (although they did fix it, months later) caused a lot of hesitation toward the updates since then. Coupled with a few more odd choices with the later DLC, and the fact that the game is now so overloaded with characters and crossovers that it's easy to forget the original spirit of bank robbery that it began as... a lot of people, myself included, are just waiting until Payday 3 at this point, rather than try to keep up with the ever-mutating game that Payday 2 is now.\n\nI think the good parts of it strongly outweigh the bad, though.
