Solid answers except for this one. It's tricky to nail down when the game will actually be considered more than proof of concept as everyone's standards are different, personally I think that once people start to fear dying it is highly indicative of a product that's more than just a proof of concept. This will likely happen with one of the 3.0 patches, or even 3.0 itself. So perhaps sometime between mid-2017 and mid-2018 for something that looks more like a beta than an alpha.\n\n2. While the kickstarter ended a long time ago, it's important to realize that they only had about 10 developers at the beginning of 2013, and a very limited budget, as well as no established studios. Over time, they've slowly built up their dev count and studio count, now at about 400 developers and 4 large studios that have been largely built from scratch during that development time. Yes, now they have a lot of employees and studios and money, but they've only had that for about a year, with each previous year having fewer and fewer. So development speed is far from constant, especially for a game of this scale, and 5 years is not very long at all with all of that considered. \n\n3. The game's development is, I would say, nearing max speed. The reason it doesn't feel that way is because most of their resources are going into the single player campaign portion of the game, which hasn't been revealed yet. The bits we have seen are from the PU, which makes the game look like it's progressing slowly, when really a majority of the progress has not been revealed yet largely in an effort to avoid spoilers and to make as a big a first impression as they can with their first final product (the singleplayer campaign is mostly considered a separate game entirely and will release far before the PU, which is the mmo portion of the game). And to add to this, progress is happening very quickly right now but almost all of it hinges on other features, so a lot of the PU progress is still not released due to a reliance on other features that aren't released yet for the same reasons. All of these features should come online with 3.0, where you should see a massive leap in visible progress.\n\n4. I would check back in 2-3 months for 3.0, then again at the end of the year for a much improved and less buggy version of 3.0 (probably 3.2 or 3 at that point). Then again every few months as you can expect to see 4.0 and the Singleplayer campaign released sometime relatively shortly after the end of this year.\n\n5. Yes definitely actual players.

It&amp;#39;s tricky to nail down when the game will actually be considered more than proof of concept as everyone&amp;#39;s standards are different, personally I think that once people start to fear dying it is highly indicative of a product that&amp;#39;s more than just a proof of concept. This will likely happen with one of the 3.0 patches, or even 3.0 itself. So perhaps sometime between mid-2017 and mid-2018 for something that looks more like a beta than an alpha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the kickstarter ended a long time ago, it&amp;#39;s important to realize that they only had about 10 developers at the beginning of 2013, and a very limited budget, as well as no established studios. Over time, they&amp;#39;ve slowly built up their dev count and studio count, now at about 400 developers and 4 large studios that have been largely built from scratch during that development time. Yes, now they have a lot of employees and studios and money, but they&amp;#39;ve only had that for about a year, with each previous year having fewer and fewer. So development speed is far from constant, especially for a game of this scale, and 5 years is not very long at all with all of that considered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game&amp;#39;s development is, I would say, nearing max speed.

The 3.0 update is when other professions will start coming into play.\n\n- Ship Combat is *much* faster than Elite, when fighting enemies you want to think less like a plane and use strafe to circle around targets. The SuperHornet is a top tier superiority fighter and has two turrets which aim well with a mouse.\n\n- In Arena commander it is highly advised you try out Vanduul Swarm or Pirate Swarm in singleplayer to get used to how the game plays. \n\n- Racing is also a good way to learn how ships fly. Though the SuperHornet is on the slow side, control of your ship is more important than raw speed.\n\n- Star Marine is a slow paced arena FPS. Check corners and keep an eye on the minimap. You can jump out into space and fight in Zero G, use it to attack from places people won't expect. There is a bleed mechanic so make sure to press V to heal if your status indicator is red anywhere. Hip fire is reasonably accurate so don't be afraid to use it.\n\n- In the PU ask in chat if anybody is willing to let you aboard a larger ship. Or if you're feeling brave try to sneak aboard one. You'll get a much better idea of the scope this game offers and the emergent gameplay it can provide.\n\nIf you like what you see and decide to back the game, remember that development is slow as fuck and delays are common. You can get a package with both the MMO and SP campaign (Named Squadron 42) but it's cheaper if you just want the MMO for now. \n\nBoth starter ships (Aurora and Mustang) are bad at fighting players because the current weapon balance is pretty bad. Not to mention they are ironically some of the buggiest ships. The community generally agrees that the Aegis Avenger Titan is the best \"starter\" as it's only a bit more expensive but decent at combat and much more versatile for future non-combat roles (it has good cargo space).\n\nIf you have any other questions, go to r/starcitizen where people actively discuss the game and its development.
