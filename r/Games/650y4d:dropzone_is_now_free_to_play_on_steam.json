I'm the Community Manager for Sparkypants Studios, a small studio based in Baltimore, founded by some of the people behind Rise of Nations and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. Our studio's first game, Dropzone, is now [free to play on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/572520)! \n\nI saw a previous thread during our Early Access phase where people had a lot of questions about Dropzone, so I wanted to give a little introduction to the game.\n\n\n**So what IS Dropzone?**\n\nDropzone is an action strategy game where you control up to 3 customizable giant robots in 15 minute matches. Equip your robots (we call them Rigs) with different weapons, body types, and specialized gear that determine what abilities you bring into a match.\n\nThe goal of the game is to fight against your opponents in a race to destroy neutral AI-controlled aliens called the Kavash, and deposit the resources they drop into a capture point at the center of the map. Whoever has the most points at the end of 15 minutes wins!\n\n\n**Is it multiplayer or PvP only?**\n\nNope! For players who want more of a singleplayer or co-op 'comp stomp' experience, we have modes like Infestation, where you need to defend a reactor against swarms of Kavash with up to 4 players; and solo story-focused content called Contracts that allow players to earn rewards while learning about the Dropzone universe. We'll be expanding on these modes in the future. (We eventually want to have a branching narrative with Contracts, where players will gain favor with different factions in the story.) \n\n\n**Is this a MOBA or a RTS?**\n\nWe took a ton of inspiration from both, but the answer is probably \"somewhere in between.\" If you've played either genre, there are elements that will feel familiar to you, like the controls and abilities. There are also some things that aren't there: there's no base building, there are no lanes, no tower defense. \"Tech tree research\" became giving players meaningful choices in how they customize their units. To us, the biggest resource in a RTS game is the player's attention span, which comes into play with having units you need to be aware of and weigh the tactical advantages of moving them together or splitting them apart to accomplish multiple map objectives.\n\nAnd of course, the 15-minute time limit and point-based scoring system are something new, and games often end in really intense \"buzzer beater\" moments. :)\n\n\n**Does that mean the game is micro-intensive?**\n\nAt Sparkypants, we're really involved with our community, and one of the things we often heard was that controlling 3 rigs at the same time was difficult for some players. Last week, we added in Team 3v3 mode, where each player takes control of 1 rig in their squad of 3. 3v3 can be played with friends against human or AI opponents, or it can be played solo with AI teammates. \n\nFor players who want more of a challenge, there's 1v1 and 2v2 modes, where players each take control of 3 rigs.
