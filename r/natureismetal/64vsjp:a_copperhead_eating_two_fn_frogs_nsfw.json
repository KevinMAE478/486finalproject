We get out to the first tee box and bc I still had to put my golf shoes/spikes on I let my buddy tee off first. While he was teeing off I stepped to the side of the tee box to get out of his way, and also to put on my shoes. I put one on while the other laid in the grass for a second. Once my buddy teed off he absolutely BOMBED his drive, to the point where, with one shoe only, I hopped up to the tee box to see just how far his drive went. After seeing that, I went back to put my other shoe on and take my drive.\n\nSo, I get my shoes on and go to drive. I immediately noticed that, in my rush to get my other shoe on, I must have curled my sock under itself (like a fold in my sock) in between my foot and the inside of the shoe. It was super uncomfortable so I stepped down with my foot as hard as I could and tried to get the 'roll' in my sock out, to no avail! By this time, some members of the course came out to tee off, so I just had to tough it out and tee off, which I did.\n\nBy the time we got to my ball, which was further away, the roll in my sock was bugging the shit out of me, so i took my shoe off to mess with it, and the scariest thing in my entire life happened once I did. When I took my shoe off there was a GODDAMNED BABY WATER MOCCASIN HANGING FROM MY FUCKING SOCK!!! I had actually crushed its head when I was trying to get the 'roll' out of my sock. In crushing its head, I displaced it's jaws and one of it's fucking bones was stuck to my sock, so I had to like fucking ninja kick this motherfucker till it came off bc I was just absolutely FREAKING OUT.\n\nThe hilarious part (bc I didn't die, you see) is that when I finally kicked it off it flew through the air and almost hit my buddy in the fucking face. Hid reaction, again bc no one died, is the stuff of legend.\n\nTL;DR - Went golfing, left one of my shoes in the grass for a minute unattended, baby water moccasin crawled in, got crushed by my foot, and then scared the fuck out of me afterwards.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;FUN STORY TIME&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worked at a golf course in NC for about 5 years in the early 2000s, and one of the perks is that we play for free when we&amp;#39;re off and the schedule permits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day, immediately after work, me and my coworker ran to see if we could play a round and sure enough we could.

When I took my shoe off there was a GODDAMNED BABY WATER MOCCASIN HANGING FROM MY FUCKING SOCK!!! I had actually crushed its head when I was trying to get the &amp;#39;roll&amp;#39; out of my sock. In crushing its head, I displaced it&amp;#39;s jaws and one of it&amp;#39;s fucking bones was stuck to my sock, so I had to like fucking ninja kick this motherfucker till it came off bc I was just absolutely FREAKING OUT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hilarious part (bc I didn&amp;#39;t die, you see) is that when I finally kicked it off it flew through the air and almost hit my buddy in the fucking face. Hid reaction, again bc no one died, is the stuff of legend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Went golfing, left one of my shoes in the grass for a minute unattended, baby water moccasin crawled in, got crushed by my foot, and then scared the fuck out of me afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "natureismetal", "name": "t1_dg5w026", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492034182.0, "created_utc": 1492005382.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5eu3k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cuzitFits", "parent_id": "t3_64vsjp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/natureismetal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Also, my name is finally relevant.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, my name is finally relevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "natureismetal", "name": "t1_dg5eu3k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491996720.0, "created_utc": 1491967920.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_324zi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vsjp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg665a0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Meme_Faggot", "parent_id": "t3_64vsjp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/natureismetal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is that a brain", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that a brain&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "natureismetal", "name": "t1_dg665a0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492045450.0, "created_utc": 1492016650.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_324zi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vsjp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6lsxu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dogwood63", "parent_id": "t3_64vsjp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/natureismetal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Awesome and Yummy\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awesome and Yummy&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "natureismetal", "name": "t1_dg6lsxu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061778.0, "created_utc": 1492032978.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_324zi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vsjp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgebvx3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jamct97", "parent_id": "t3_64vsjp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/natureismetal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Those look like American bullfrogs", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those look like American bullfrogs&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "natureismetal", "name": "t1_dgebvx3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492501403.0, "created_utc": 1492472603.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_324zi", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vsjp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg60mi4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BallsackMessiah", "parent_id": "t3_64vsjp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/natureismetal", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ewww the toad looks like vomit.
