Maybe a custom kodo with war drums you can ACTUALLY use.\n* *Goblin:* Go on a heist where you have to use your rocket belt to avoid state of the art security systems, bribe guards and things of the sort. Rewards a cool utility belt and money bags for transmogging. \n* *Orc:* Return to draenor to complete trials of their ancestors? Maybe get a special non-combat non-pet-battle frostwolf that they can name, feed etc and eventually maybe become a new orc-only mount with special features such as /track for the wolf to sniff the ground, /hug etc. I think having a mount that you care for would be cool.\n* *Undead:* Visit pieces of old Lordaeron before the plague to help the bronze dragonflight, since their souls are connected there. It will be a painful experience reliving the past, but you have the will of the forsaken to press on. Not sure what the reward could be. \n* *Blood Elf:* A new arcane threat has arisen, but your arcane affinity and torrent will help you persevere. Gain an arcane tint to their spells? Maybe an animation like in the BC trailer where they siphon a mana wyrm.\n* *Troll:* Complete the trials of the loa. Unlock additional tusk styles, maybe an ability where your character reads bones or something.\n\n\n* *Human:* Probably the biggest issue since all humans are so diverse. Something related to diplomacy and working together maybe?\n* *Worgen:* A quest where you have to use both forms of worgens, as well as chase down prey, utilizing both darkflight and running wild. Maybe infiltrating something? As a reward they could finally get a tail or a model update :(\n* *Dwarf:* If anyone's seen the movie Grabbers, a similar premise. A new threat has arisen and you have to get as drunk as only a dwarf can to stop it. I mean, when you get drunk you see enemies as lower level, what if that wasn't just a visual thing for these enemies, and they ACTUALLY drop in level. They have the level scaling combat in Legion already so... Reward could be additional beard styles and a drinking horn \"shirt\" that slings over your shoulder.\n* *Night elf:* A darkness has burrowed into Teldrassil. You have to make your way in there and have to use shadowmeld (or other stealth abilities) to get past a deadly guardian. Reward could be some cosmetic nature abilities, such as causing plans to grow around you.\n* *Gnome:* Dr Boom's cousin is out for revenge. You have to use your skills as an escape artist to bypass his traps. Rewards fun mechanical toy items.\n* *Draenei:* A naaru has gone shadow form again, and you have to go full WoD Velen to restore the light, except maybe not die. Additional horn styles, maybe custom forehead glow things?\n\n* *Pandaren:* Go on a similar journey as Emperor Shaohao. Reward could be the ability to challenge other players to martial arts spars. Using a hotbar like the one Chen has during the brewery quest. Something simple like \"punch, kick, block punch, block kick\".
