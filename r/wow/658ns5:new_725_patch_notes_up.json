I hated it.  Everyone did, because of how it made warlocks fight over the \"high value\" buff targets... That is, if your raid composition *even had any high value targets.*\n\nSo rightfully, with Pandaria release they redesigned it to a plain raid buff.  At the same time, warlocks briefly entered a sort of golden age... At least, as golden as *warlocks* can get.  For them it was relatively golden, but if you'd given it to mages they'd have called it bronze-coated feces at best.  Oh well, take your victories where you can get them.\n\nAnyway, with Pandaria they took Dark Intent's old guild-imploding function away... and at the same time gave a skill called Symbiosis to druids.  It was a buff the ~~warlock~~ druid could give to one person.  For both players, ~~hot and dot crits~~ symbiosis would give a ~~stacking temporary haste buff~~ skill from their spec to the other.

(/s)\n\nIf you ever feel like Blizzard has forgotten about your spec, well, there's probably a good reason for you to feel that way...  But also, don't forget the time that Blizzard *immediately* (And I mean literally immediately) forgot about the lesson they learned from an entire class.  \nWe get you. We're with you.

But if you don&amp;#39;t, in Cataclysm it was a buff that a warlock could give to one person.  For both players, hot and dot crits would give a stacking temporary haste buff to the other.  It was awful.  I hated it.  Everyone did, because of how it made warlocks fight over the &amp;quot;high value&amp;quot; buff targets... That is, if your raid composition &lt;em&gt;even had any high value targets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So rightfully, with Pandaria release they redesigned it to a plain raid buff.  At the same time, warlocks briefly entered a sort of golden age... At least, as golden as &lt;em&gt;warlocks&lt;/em&gt; can get.  For them it was relatively golden, but if you&amp;#39;d given it to mages they&amp;#39;d have called it bronze-coated feces at best.  Oh well, take your victories where you can get them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, with Pandaria they took Dark Intent&amp;#39;s old guild-imploding function away... and at the same time gave a skill called Symbiosis to druids.  It was a buff the &lt;del&gt;warlock&lt;/del&gt; druid could give to one person.  For both players, &lt;del&gt;hot and dot crits&lt;/del&gt; symbiosis would give a &lt;del&gt;stacking temporary haste buff&lt;/del&gt; skill from their spec to the other.  If this sounds like it might have been confusing... or complicated.... Oh, yes.  &lt;a href=\"https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-38b3fcc4ce98d9ac51ffaff8d50d1c85\"&gt;It&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dd20ac35f754a90cbc321485abbe9b6e\"&gt;was.&lt;/a&gt;  (That&amp;#39;s two separate links, by the way.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After an expansion full of suffering and in-fighting about who should get the Symbiosis this time, it was cut with WoD&amp;#39;s release.\n&lt;em&gt;Absolutely nobody&lt;/em&gt; saw that one coming. (/s)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you ever feel like Blizzard has forgotten about your spec, well, there&amp;#39;s probably a good reason for you to feel that way...  But also, don&amp;#39;t forget the time that Blizzard &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; (And I mean literally immediately) forgot about the lesson they learned from an entire class.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe get you.

I swear some of the balance changes are motivated by just calming irrational riots, Fire Mage was a prime victim of this - nerfing ST to the ground for a legendary that most of us didn&amp;#39;t have instead of actually addressing the legendary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know none of this balancing bullshit would be a problem, if it weren&amp;#39;t for the fact that I don&amp;#39;t know, we had BOTH AP grind AND Legendary grind. I only recently managed to get some decent Frost leggos to work with, and now I basically have to worry whether Frost itself is gonna get screwed over and now I&amp;#39;m thinking of investing in Arcane now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not just about actively balancing, the patch notes are a message. They said in this interview that Fire Mage needs some balancing, but their first instinct in the first patch note was nuke Frost Mage. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wow", "name": "t1_dg8esd5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492154876.0, "created_utc": 1492126076.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658ns5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658ns5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658ns5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8nd9s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kamguh", "parent_id": "t1_dg8icnt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wow", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just bringing everyone in line with feral now", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just bringing everyone in line with feral now&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wow", "name": "t1_dg8nd9s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492166728.0, "created_utc": 1492137928.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8icnt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "matt-jl", "parent_id": "t1_dg8dx2g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wow", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Judging by what they did to every other class, be happy.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judging by what they did to every other class, be happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wow", "name": "t1_dg8icnt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492159728.0, "created_utc": 1492130928.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8dx2g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheTwistedTeddy", "parent_id": "t3_658ns5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wow", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Looking at all of these class changes, I don't know if I should be angry they didn't even touch Feral, or be happy that they didn't.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at all of these class changes, I don&amp;#39;t know if I should be angry they didn&amp;#39;t even touch Feral, or be happy that they didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wow", "name": "t1_dg8dx2g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492153714.0, "created_utc": 1492124914.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658ns5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658ns5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8h5qn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kellbyb", "parent_id": "t1_dg8f2cg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wow", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's almost certainly Ra-Den, btw.
