Legion isn&amp;#39;t grind, it&amp;#39;s chores. The chores are aimed at the one aspect of Legion that can be considered a grind: The Artifact Weapon. The majority of people I play with already have their weapons at 46-47. Everything past that is some bonuses to damage/healing/utility, and the eventual goal of concordance, which is the last major upgrade you&amp;#39;ll get for Legion (pending another update which is unlikely). None of that is required, unless your goal is to be a &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot; player. AK50 in July (provided you &amp;quot;grind&amp;quot; the resources and click your AK button) will give you a more AP in a single LFR raid than you&amp;#39;ve grinded since the day 7.2 dropped. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rep grinds and gear acquisition in Legion are laughable compared to the things of the past. You want to see a more recent grind? Go do Emperor Shaohao. That&amp;#39;s probably the closest thing I remember to getting Cenarion Circle rep to exalted out in Silithus. Honestly, I think Shaohao is worse. At least Silithus had events you could get groups for, rather than just mindlessly grinding pages. God, that was brutal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Legion has been out almost 8 months now. In that time, we have risen almost 200 item levels from where Warlords ended. Even within the expansion itself, a player in Mythic Emerald Nightmare gear would be utterly useless next to a player in even Normal Nighthold gear. 7.2 compounded that even moreso. In no other expansion have we seen a power curve so drastically increase, nor the ease in which you can ascend that curve. The game is easier to jump into now than it has ever been. The only deciding factor now is this expansion&amp;#39;s greatest shortfall: Legendary items.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Legion is a lot of fun, but to anyone who thinks this &amp;quot;level of grind&amp;quot; is anything compared to what once was, you&amp;#39;re sorely mistaken. Ease of access has never been higher, and is directly proportional to the amount of time you&amp;#39;re willing to invest on a single-player basis, in a way that&amp;#39;s never occurred in this game. You don&amp;#39;t even need a friends list/guild to get anywhere in this game anymore, if you so choose. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not disappointed with Legion in the slightest. In fact, I find it quite enjoyable. WoW is different and refreshing, which is something I welcome after spending roughly 12 years playing this wonderful game.

Once you have best dps traits 4/4 then it&amp;#39;s absolutely not needed to farm any more traits. You have some 0.2% dps increase traits left or defensive traits.

After that stage is was just a long quest chain, mostly involving raiding and defeating specific bosses.\n\n&gt; Do you remember how long it originally took to get to level 60? 15 days /played was pretty good. Anything below that was a dedicated person/poop-socker/carried by 60s.\n\nQuesting != grinding.\n\n&gt; Were you attuned for Onyxia?\n\nYep. Not a grind, most of it was doing 5 mans or fed-ex quests. \n\n&gt; Did you max out Hydraxian Waterlords rep?\n\nAs this rep could only be attained from Molten Core, which had a lockout like all raids, no one was grinding for this. The rep came as you raided. The run out to Azshara every week was a pain though. I still remember the day those eternal vials were added.\n\n&gt; Did you max out Cenarian Circle rep?\n\nYep, but again, this was only a thing once AQ opened up and the raids did give quite a lot of rep. If you mean the badge grinding in Silithus for those trinkets, yeah that was a grind. \n\n&gt; Did you max out Zandalar Tribe rep?\n\nYep, but again..... rep was gained through normal raiding which had a lockout. No one was grinding this hardcore. If it was really important X person get rep, bijous and coins were also an option.\n\n&gt; Did you have an UBRS key?\n\nLong quest chains are not grinds. The same quest over and over again is a grind. \n\n&gt; Did you have a Stratholme key?\n\nSee above.\n\n&gt; Sulfuras? Thunderfury?\n\nNo as I played a Hunter, but I was around for many tanks getting them. I'm assuming the grind you're referring to here is the materials needed to craft it, no one ever did this solo, it was a guild effort. For a single given player it was hardly a grind.\n\n&gt; Did you even step foot into Naxx?\n\nYep. Not really sure how raiding is a grind or are you referring to the materials that were needed for attunement?(which weren't even close to a grind).\n\n\nIn my opinion only 1 (maybe 2) of these was actually a grind. Don't get me wrong, I don't think Legion is *too* grindy. (It certainly is in some aspects but that's just the nature of MMOs) \n\nI also don't think Classic was *too* grindy either (that's not to say it didn't have grinds at all, it did, like the High Farmlord / Grind Marshal or if you played a Warlock and wanted to raid...).\n\nI think the thing with Classic is the difficulty floor (the point at which the game became hard) was just a lot lower than todays game.

Had alts at dragons, quick 3 mins and you checked them all, then wait an hour, not really a grind. NR gear wasnt only from the dragons so not sure what the complaint here is.\n* 3. Yep had FR gear, was easy to get. Plus with MCing the LBRS mob you didn't need a whole lot except on the tanks. Wasn't a grind.\n* 4. I did the AQ40 opening quests, ALL of that stuff you obtained throughout the course of play and turned in. You could grind it if you really wanted it to open faster but that was a choice and not forced\n* 5. Guess I was awesome with my 10d played with no lvl 60 help. This wasn't a grind though. \n* 6. Ony attuned, helped many get ony attuned. This was not a grind. Hardest part was finding rexxar in desolace sometimes.\n* 7. Maxed out hydraxian rep, did it through just doing MC runs. You could not grind this and it was completely unnecessary passed honored for the water, which if you did the quests was only a few boss kills away.\n* 8-9 again you get these reps through doing some quests outside the raids, but mostly from killing stuff in the raid. These weren't hard reps to get to the level you NEEDED, pluis CC was more about getting your crafters to exalted for NR stuff, which was an easy if your guild helped. \n* 10. Had the UBRS key, this wasn't really grindy since you ended up doing LBRS multiple times for quests/attunement. Or you just had a guildy open the door...\n* 11. Strat key now...yes. Almost everyone had this. I cannot ever remember being at a loss due to not having this key. Still wasn't a grind, it was luck.\n* 12. You're comparing a legendary drop you couldn't grind to legion grinding? These legendaries were not neccessary to progress, in fact most guilds never got them.

Did Naxx up to a certain point and quit since raiding was just getting too toxic for me, surprised you didn't bring up Argent dawn rep. Of course that was entirely unneccessary until Nax and you still probably had it honored/revered just through Scholo/Strath drops.\n\n\nHere is the thing about vanilla, most of the stuff that was grindy wasn't required and more often than not didn't make you more powerful(ie required). That's coming from someone that would camp the demons in Winterspring and solo them for the priest epic quest item. I did not have to grind those demons, it was a choice.\n\nYou talk about grinding the tier 0 and tier .5 set, but you didn't need those. I know that for a fact because when I was raiding it was in blues and greens and very few of them were Tier 0 and Tier .5 wasn't even a thing. The reason I didn' t have tier 0 you ask? Because the freaking mage stuff had some agility on it...that's right agility on mage gear. I had the full set except postmasters boots, but other gear(some crafted) was better. If you farmed that stuff to have the full set that's purely on your shoulders.\n\n\n\nIn Legion, the grind is basically required. Want all your artifact traits? Grind. Want high iLvl gear? Grind and pray for Titanforge. Want that certain legendary? Grind and then pray for good RNG. Flying? Grind. How much gear have you DE'ed or vendored in Legion because it didn't titanforge or have the right stats? It's astronomical and each time it kills a piece of my soul because back in Vanilla if you were running a dungeon for an item and it dropped, you were happy. Now if that happens it better be a titanforge or tossed in the garbage.\n\n\n\nLet's also talk about moving goalposts. Because at least in Vanilla WoW once you had the rep you were done. In Legion that hasn't been the case. Oh you maxed your artifact? PSYCHE! Grind more! Oh you got pathfinder? GO GRIND SOME MORE REP!\n\n\nGiven the two versions of the game, I'd take Vanilla over legion.

HWL was the only real grind on your list since it was determined vs other players. It wasn&amp;#39;t neccessary and it&amp;#39;s gear wasn&amp;#39;t great if you were clearing BWL. It wasn&amp;#39;t required&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2. Had alts at dragons, quick 3 mins and you checked them all, then wait an hour, not really a grind. NR gear wasnt only from the dragons so not sure what the complaint here is.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3. Yep had FR gear, was easy to get. Plus with MCing the LBRS mob you didn&amp;#39;t need a whole lot except on the tanks. Wasn&amp;#39;t a grind.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4. I did the AQ40 opening quests, ALL of that stuff you obtained throughout the course of play and turned in. You could grind it if you really wanted it to open faster but that was a choice and not forced&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5. Guess I was awesome with my 10d played with no lvl 60 help. This wasn&amp;#39;t a grind though. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6. Ony attuned, helped many get ony attuned. This was not a grind. Hardest part was finding rexxar in desolace sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;7. Maxed out hydraxian rep, did it through just doing MC runs. You could not grind this and it was completely unnecessary passed honored for the water, which if you did the quests was only a few boss kills away.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;8-9 again you get these reps through doing some quests outside the raids, but mostly from killing stuff in the raid. These weren&amp;#39;t hard reps to get to the level you NEEDED, pluis CC was more about getting your crafters to exalted for NR stuff, which was an easy if your guild helped. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10. Had the UBRS key, this wasn&amp;#39;t really grindy since you ended up doing LBRS multiple times for quests/attunement. Or you just had a guildy open the door...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;11. Strat key now...yes. Almost everyone had this. I cannot ever remember being at a loss due to not having this key. Still wasn&amp;#39;t a grind, it was luck.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;12. You&amp;#39;re comparing a legendary drop you couldn&amp;#39;t grind to legion grinding? These legendaries were not neccessary to progress, in fact most guilds never got them. My guild got thunderfury and had like 4 other tanks with 1/2 the bindings. Never saw Eye of Sulfuras.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;13.

You list a bunch of random crap that isn't needed to succeed in vanilla raiding or PvP. \n\n* Did you spend months PvPing in BGs non-stop for Warlord/HWL ranks? \nNo, why would you? Raiding gave better gear. It's well known you had to account share to even get that high of a rank. Don't even list this as if this was something common people did. \n\n* Did you have alts logged out and checking Nightmare Dragon spawns 24/7 with a raid on stand-by to kill them for NR gear for AQ40? How about Mara?\nNo, because I was on a large server with active PvP and they weren't worth it? Good luck having the servers stay up too. \n\n* Did you have Fire Resist gear for Molten Core trash and Rag? \nYes? So? \n\n*  Did you participate in the quest-lines and lead-up to AQ40?\nYes? I even did the entire 10 hour event when the gates opened. Those 10 hours to get some easy bronze dragonflight rep were less grindy than Legions artifact system. \n\n* Do you remember how long it originally took to get to level 60? 15 days /played was pretty good. Anything below that was a dedicated person/poop-socker/carried by 60s.\nYes? I remember when World of Warcraft was about the world.\n\n* Were you attuned for Onyxia? \nYes\n\n* Did you max out Hydraxian Waterlords rep?\nYes, but what does that matter? The rep gives nothing important.\n* Did you max out Cenarian Circle rep?\nNo, gave nothing important. I never ran AQ20 since the gear wasn't worth it anyway, and that was the main source of CC rep. \n* Did you max out Zandalar Tribe rep?\nNo, the hit gear didn't need exalted. Getting exalted was not needed to succeed in vanilla. I'm forever 3k off exalted. \n* Did you have an UBRS key?\nYes\n* Did you have a Stratholme key?\nYes\n* Sulfuras? Thunderfury?\nNo, those weren't for every class.\n* Did you even step foot into Naxx?\nYes. Only beat one boss but still stepped into it. \n\nStop just stop. The artifact grind IS a grind, which does increase your power with every level. I do like the system of having a weapon that increases in power, but I think the artifact knowledge stuff is terrible. I basically feel like I need to wait weeks until I get a higher AK percentage, or else I'm wasting my time doing any content that gives AK.
