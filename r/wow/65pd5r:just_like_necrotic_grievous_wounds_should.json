You just have to accept that you only atonement heal during bossfights when there is downtime or AOE damage needs to be recovered otherwise use Shadowmend. (It&amp;#39;s somewhat similar to healing in raids.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My gear is just average (barely 900 with crafted shoulders and belt as legendaries and stat sticks as trinkets). I&amp;#39;m running Castigation, Masochism (which actually makes a big difference in my opinion), Mindbender, Power Infusion (because if people get low enough to trigger Twist of Faith, you should be using big cooldowns anyway to get them up and those don&amp;#39;t need a 20% buff), Halo or Clarity and Grace. (Clarity can be great to prepare for big AOE damage like focused lightning in EOA especially if you atonement first, pop PI and throw 2 clarities at everybody there will be no damage going out.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Downvote me for my unpopular opinion but people saying grevious should drop when OOC don&amp;#39;t realise there is a big difference to necrotic. With nectoric there was absolutely nothing you could do (you simply had to wait for the debuff to fade while doing nothing), on grevious people can eat food or use their offheals to top the group. You also get rewarded for handling damage during trash well and not letting people drop or avoiding the damage in general (which means you performance as a healer on trash packs impacts the timer which is great. Usually only damage has an impact here). Because you will be ready faster to pull the next pack. I actually think Blizzard did a great job with this one. It feels challenging and fair at the same time and is way more interactive than other affixes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wow", "name": "t1_dgck5nx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492404794.0, "created_utc": 1492375994.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pd5r", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pd5r", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pd5r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcq7he", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Spanky2k", "parent_id": "t1_dgclyk2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wow", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The key I believe is for melee dps and tanks to not even try to kill the adds and just let ranged do it.
