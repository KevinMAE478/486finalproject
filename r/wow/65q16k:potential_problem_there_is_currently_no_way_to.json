Do they pick back up where it was in the rotation? Go to the next one? \n\nI think another soultion, though probably not necessary, would be to let players continue contributing to the buildings even when they're up. Or at least when all 3 are up / destroyed. It would simply be a 'reserve cache' that once a building is destroyed and then becomes available to contribute to it would immediately grant those resources to the building.\n\nIf this were implemented you wouldn't have to worry about the buffs because the buildings would still go down and come back up with the same timers, it would prevent people from capping when they couldn't contribute otherwise, and it would smooth out the up / down rates on buildings. \n\nPersonally I would lean toward the idea that you can only do the stockpiled contributions when all 3 buildings are up. That way the less popular buildings would still come up. \n\nI know personally I have little reason to contribute to the nether disruptor because the unstable portals aren't worth it for solo play and the world bosses all drop trash gear for my class, but I understand that others get use out of it.

The world bosses are tied to the command center so you would either have the same world boss up until people let it go or they would go on a 3-4 day rotation but what happens if the command center goes down mid-way through a boss timer? Do they pick back up where it was in the rotation? Go to the next one? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think another soultion, though probably not necessary, would be to let players continue contributing to the buildings even when they&amp;#39;re up. Or at least when all 3 are up / destroyed. It would simply be a &amp;#39;reserve cache&amp;#39; that once a building is destroyed and then becomes available to contribute to it would immediately grant those resources to the building.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this were implemented you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to worry about the buffs because the buildings would still go down and come back up with the same timers, it would prevent people from capping when they couldn&amp;#39;t contribute otherwise, and it would smooth out the up / down rates on buildings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally I would lean toward the idea that you can only do the stockpiled contributions when all 3 buildings are up. That way the less popular buildings would still come up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know personally I have little reason to contribute to the nether disruptor because the unstable portals aren&amp;#39;t worth it for solo play and the world bosses all drop trash gear for my class, but I understand that others get use out of it. And I&amp;#39;m sure there are others that feel the same for the other two buildings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wow", "name": "t1_dgd4vvc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492433898.0, "created_utc": 1492405098.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcqxio", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 23, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JordanTH", "parent_id": "t3_65q16k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wow", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Would be neat if you could put supplies towards buildings that are under attack to increase how long until they are destroyed", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would be neat if you could put supplies towards buildings that are under attack to increase how long until they are destroyed&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wow", "name": "t1_dgcqxio", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492413897.0, "created_utc": 1492385097.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q16k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q16k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q16k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q16k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q16k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q16k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdgt90", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DRLAR", "parent_id": "t1_dgdbsjo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wow", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And you can do it on every alt!!! try to choose a different type of pet with different counters (silly me I didn't choose any vs humanoid one grr)\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you can do it on every alt!!! try to choose a different type of pet with different counters (silly me I didn&amp;#39;t choose any vs humanoid one grr)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wow", "name": "t1_dgdgt90", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492464080.0, "created_utc": 1492435280.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdbsjo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FourteenFour", "parent_id": "t1_dgcgbvd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wow", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I always thought you had to have a pet at 25 already to buy one at 25.
