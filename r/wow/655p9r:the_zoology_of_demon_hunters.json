It usually populates the open world or the LFR running or flying around in one place without any purpose, just like pigeons. This species is recognisable through its common title \u2018Illidari\u2019 or \u2018Slayer\u2019, followed by any abbreviation of the name Illidan. \n\nThough being the most common sub species, it never really developed any kind of niche so most beings just get to the iLvl of 855 and then die.\n\n**Daemonium Venandi Cookiecutterus**\n\nThe more developed kind of the Demon Hunter. Mostly remaining silent at day, it usually comes out every two minutes when its CD on Chaos Blades and Nemesis is ready which also results in an outcry of mating calls (usually via Recount reports in the chat).\n\nThe Cookiecutterus is very territorial, which means he doesn\u2019t accept any other spec than his own to be around in a raid, forum or Dischord. Especially one competitor, which leads us to \u2026\n\n**Daemonium Venandi Eyebeamus**\n\nThe direct competitor in the habitat of the Cookiecutterus. It is a more specialised endemic version, usually roaming the lower valley of LFD and the high mountains of M+ burning everything in sight to ashes. \n\nIt is mostly peaceful in its own niche but tends to get into fights with the Cookiecutterus when trapped in the same forum. It\u2019s not advised to hold both sub species in one raid.\n\n**Daemonium Venandi Momentum (Extinct)**\n\nAn early predecessor of the actual species that went extinct at the end of C\u00e6nozoic of 7.1. Fossils suggest this variant was using Fel Rush und Retreat to wreak havoc on its prey.\n\nThere are some living fossils in form of alts or players unwilling to read guides. But these are very rare.\n\n**Daemonium Venandi Vengeanci**\n\nA rare breed amongst the Demon Hunters, shy beings which are only observed in instanced regions like dungeons and raids. Whilst growing up they face an extremely hostile environment of sneering players, so just a few of them survive and mature in raids and higher M+.\n\nSometimes, an experienced observer can hear them howling at night, when most of them are declined entering pugs.\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "655p9r", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 500, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SongofWolves", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_655p9r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wow", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.wow", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/qym-FdeSD2gdCFPrxV36oOdHeBjqlQJLZhROq6AGxbY.jpg?s=b62558b0e789de76b57352493e59f144", "width": 128, "height": 128}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/qym-FdeSD2gdCFPrxV36oOdHeBjqlQJLZhROq6AGxbY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=ff0ff4b55b9e19f1e09c34d16fe916a6", "width": 108, "height": 108}], "variants": {}, "id": "BNKr6XdlZmr_ZiVTD4LStL2C0KmHngP7KIoc7ODJUDw"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "edited": 1492268355.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/wow/comments/655p9r/the_zoology_of_demon_hunters/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492121463.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/655p9r/the_zoology_of_demon_hunters/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "The Zoology of Demon Hunters", "created_utc": 1492092663.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 64, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 500}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655p9r", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655p9r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7q0f8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 42, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SongofWolves", "parent_id": "t1_dg7pkpr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wow", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Edit: \n\nYet the curiosity seems to be rhetoric since a general entitlement of having 'sacrificed everything' is present throughout all sub species.\n\nSome studies suggest that this is part of an engagement ritual which is often combined with flying in circles.\n\n", "edited": 1492103418.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet the curiosity seems to be rhetoric since a general entitlement of having &amp;#39;sacrificed everything&amp;#39;
