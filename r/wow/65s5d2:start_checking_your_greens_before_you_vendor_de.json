For the dethhamma to really be worth it for an int class it'd have to be about an 860 one or higher and there aren't any BoE ones for other classes besides tankards o terror (810 mace BoE commonly used on enhance but only if it's your OS. MS doomhammer is a lotttt better). With these relics on an artifact weapon for an intellect class it'd make it a lot better than the dethhamma (moonkin, holy pal, etc). Haven't heard many classes outside of boomie using it though because it'll take your artifact ability away and for some classes that's just too damn strong to lose.
