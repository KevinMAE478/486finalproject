But for sake of argument, you should just be able to dodge solar collapse without needing leap in the first place, like the majority of the rest of your raid has to do. Taking shoulders is only a good idea if you are bad at dodging solar collapse, otherwise you should just be stuck on the boss. I don&amp;#39;t know how your raid positions the boss, but my raid has the boss on top of one of the plasma spheres anywayse, so you don&amp;#39;t need any mobility to get to it, and leaping over to kill the other spheres is actually usually a detriment to your raid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, for auger, the example you outlined is hedging against an rng mechanic that you can already deal with just by prepositioning yourself to minimize the movement necessary for fel injection. Also, the hard part about auger is meeting the dps check in p3, which shoulders does not help you with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of raiding is about maximizing you own class for the beterment of the raid, yes, but that is a two way street. Most of the mechanics you outlined either could have been delt with by better play on your part or are just done better by ranged dps in the first place. 1-2% dps is a huge amount, especially on progression. There would be some whispers going around if someone in my raid was sacrificing dps just so they didn&amp;#39;t have to think about a mechanic as hard as they normally would.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wow", "name": "t1_dg9wvtg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492240317.0, "created_utc": 1492211517.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9uahz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "skazord", "parent_id": "t1_dg9ty4h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wow", "controversiality": 0, "body": "All in Mythic fights:\n\nChronomatic: Able to go to the side add, kill it, and leap back into boss instantly, faster than any other class.
