I might only have the glass cloth on the corners and the tops, not the whole sheet for cost savings, and polyester resin for the same reason.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 part paints, like a deck sealer might be your friend too, it&amp;#39;s similar to the fiberglass.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coat the edges of the sheets before assembly.  The trick is to keep water out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m picturing like a 2x3 with a groove routed in the bottom to fit on the plywood as a top rail to give it more rigidity along with  some way to latch it to the tailgate to keep the back from moving too much.    The top rail would also serve to keep the water out of the edge of the plywood.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DIY", "name": "t1_dgdligt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492470647.0, "created_utc": 1492441847.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
