They are like my second parents and I have been over to their house many times before. Recently my wife and I were visiting and they gave us a piano. We were so shocked we decided we had to do something nice for them back. So naturally for putting up with me through all my shenanigans in high school with their son, and their generosity, I figured I could do something nice for a change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are the pictures that we remembered to take as we were installing the steps.
