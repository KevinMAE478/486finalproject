The great thing about OpenHAB is how open and flexible it is. Look at the incredible [Supported Technologies](http://www.openhab.org/technologies.html) list.\n\nZ-wave is the main protocol I'm using. I really like my [Aeon Labs/Aeotec Z-Stick Gen5](http://aeotec.com/z-wave-usb-stick) interface.\n\n**Lighting:**\n\n* [GE 12722 on-off](https://byjasco.com/products/ge-z-wave-wireless-lighting-control-onoff-switch)\n* [GE 12724 dimming](https://byjasco.com/products/ge-z-wave-wall-smart-dimmer)\n* [GE 12730 fan control](https://byjasco.com/products/ge-z-wave-wall-smart-fan-control)\n* [GE 12723 add-on switch](https://byjasco.com/products/ge-z-wave-wall-add-switch)\n\nPictures from [lighting install round 1](http://imgur.com/a/1xCsx) (includes Cat Tax).\n\n**Thermostat:**\nI have 2 [2gig CT100 Z-Wave Programmable Thermostat (White)](http://2gig.com/products/z-wave-automation-accessories/smart-thermostats/), one for upstairs, one for main level. Installation was super lucky, there was an unused wire I was able to hook up as the C wire so it isn't dependent on batteries.\n\n**Garage:**\nThis came about because I had a problem. I'd find the garage door open at random times. Not cool. My wife and I have iPhones, and OpenHAB supports [Prowl](https://www.prowlapp.com/) for alerting. \n\nI didn't like the garage door tilt sensors. I'm sure they're fine, but I wanted something more sensitive. I ended up getting a [GoControl/Linear/Nortek Controls WADWAZ-1](http://www.gocontrol.com/detail.php?productId=14) z-wave door/window sensor.\n\nAccording to my wife, it SUCKS to get half way to work and get an alert the garage door is open. I got a [Hikvision DS-2CD2332-I-4MM](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1123106-REG/hikvision_ds_2cd2332_i_4mm_ds_2cd2332_i_3mp_day.html) for inside the garage, and a [FortrezZ MIMOlite](http://www.fortrezz.com/shop/mimo-lite). They have a great [diagram for wiring garage door control with MIMOlite](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57363221555986b60e62f0f0/t/57d6f49f6b8f5b6cdf6cbefb/1473705120160/fortrezz_mimolite_wiring_diagram_to_control_garage_door_2.15.2013-1-2.pdf).\n\nHere's a link to my [garage door control album](http://imgur.com/a/db2tQ)\n\n**Front Porch:**\nI have a Hikvision XC-2142FWDI on my front porch([album here](http://imgur.com/a/qufyW)). The XC-2142FWDI looks good, but sometimes grabbing a jpg from the camera takes waaaayyy longer than it should. I regret getting that as a grey market camera. No official support or english firmware upgrades.\n\nI wanted the in-camera motion detection to trigger home automation alerts, so I ended up writing a quick node.js daemon that listened to events from the camera and pushed them into OpenHAB. Here's a link to my blog post [Hikvision Motion Detection in OpenHAB using node.js](http://www.ragingcomputer.com/2016/06/hikvision-motion-detection-in-openhab-using-node-js)\n\n**Doorbell:**\nMy wife works overnight, so she sleeps during the day. The doorbell gets a lot more action than I wish it would.  Using another MIMOlite, I can disable the upstairs doorbell while she's sleeping, and using a [RIBU1C](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Devices-Ribu1C-Relay-Enclosed/dp/B01LYKPNW1), trigger the input on the MIMOlite to push an alert to my phone, and image from the camera to my phone.\n\nHere's a link to the [doorbell control album](https://imgur.com/a/fzUE3)\n\n**Power Meter:**\nOPPD in Omaha uses Itron ERT meters that constantly broadcast the usage in both IDM and SCM. Using [RTLSDR](https://osmocom.org/projects/sdr/wiki/rtl-sdr) with a RTL2832U radio receiver and [RTLAMR](https://github.com/bemasher/rtlamr), it's possible to listen to and decode broadcasted usage.  I boogered together a Perl daemon to process the output from RTLAMR and push it into OpenHAB. Here's my blog post on [RTLAMR Power Meter Data in OpenHAB](http://www.ragingcomputer.com/2016/06/rtlamr-power-meter-data-in-openhab).\n\n**Alarm:**\nI have an ADT Safewatch Pro 3000 (which is very close to a Honeywell/Ademco Vista 20p). After some research, I bought an [AlarmDecoder AD2USB](http://www.alarmdecoder.com/catalog/product_info.php/cPath/1/products_id/29) interface. Here's my blog post on [Taking over an ADT Alarm and integrating it with OpenHAB](http://www.ragingcomputer.com/2015/11/taking-over-an-adt-alarm-and-integrating-it-with-openhab).\n\n**Irrigation Controls:**\nI installed a Raspberry Pi 3 based TIAO Smart Sprinkler Pi V2 running OpenSprinkler Pi. Here's a link to my [Raspberry Pi Sprinkler Controller album](http://imgur.com/a/U3afk)\n\nI think that covers most of what's pulled into the tablet control.\n\n**Bonus:**\nNot included in the tablet control, I'm also a big fan of [WAPIRZ-1: Z-Wave PIR Motion Detector](https://www.nortekcontrol.com/product_detail.php?productId=1738), [Elk ELK-70 Echo Speaker](http://www.elkproducts.com/product-catalog/elk-70-echo-series-speaker-20-watt-8-ohms) as a [low visibility speaker for text to speech status](https://youtu.be/K-TlaezSncs),  [Aeotec Minimote](http://aeotec.com/small-z-wave-remote-control), DIY arduino sensors using [MySensors](https://www.mysensors.org/), ESP8266, Amazon Alexa.\n\nThere's actually a LOT more, but this comment is already approaching [War and Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace).

After some research, I bought an &lt;a href=\"http://www.alarmdecoder.com/catalog/product_info.php/cPath/1/products_id/29\"&gt;AlarmDecoder AD2USB&lt;/a&gt; interface. Here&amp;#39;s my blog post on &lt;a href=\"http://www.ragingcomputer.com/2015/11/taking-over-an-adt-alarm-and-integrating-it-with-openhab\"&gt;Taking over an ADT Alarm and integrating it with OpenHAB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irrigation Controls:&lt;/strong&gt;\nI installed a Raspberry Pi 3 based TIAO Smart Sprinkler Pi V2 running OpenSprinkler Pi. Here&amp;#39;s a link to my &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/U3afk\"&gt;Raspberry Pi Sprinkler Controller album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that covers most of what&amp;#39;s pulled into the tablet control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt;\nNot included in the tablet control, I&amp;#39;m also a big fan of &lt;a href=\"https://www.nortekcontrol.com/product_detail.php?productId=1738\"&gt;WAPIRZ-1: Z-Wave PIR Motion Detector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.elkproducts.com/product-catalog/elk-70-echo-series-speaker-20-watt-8-ohms\"&gt;Elk ELK-70 Echo Speaker&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/K-TlaezSncs\"&gt;low visibility speaker for text to speech status&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=\"http://aeotec.com/small-z-wave-remote-control\"&gt;Aeotec Minimote&lt;/a&gt;, DIY arduino sensors using &lt;a href=\"https://www.mysensors.org/\"&gt;MySensors&lt;/a&gt;, ESP8266, Amazon Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s actually a LOT more, but this comment is already approaching &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace\"&gt;War and Peace&lt;/a&gt;.
