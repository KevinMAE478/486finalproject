I&amp;#39;m a proud owner of dry, dehydrated, acne-prone, PIE prone skin. Anyway, I had an important wedding to attend on Sunday. And of course, 2 ugly looking headless bumps decided to appear on my right cheek on Monday. By Tuesday night they were already red, swollen and painful. Usually I dab my Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion many times a day when I get one of these. But it&amp;#39;s a hit or miss for me. Sometimes, it works and the cyst just disappears. Sometimes, there&amp;#39;s no stopping the zit even if I&amp;#39;m bathing it in the buffering lotion. This time it was the latter. The buffering lotion didn&amp;#39;t seem to have any effect on the 2 cysts. To add insult to injury, my left cheek also decided to sprout an under-the-skin bump on Wednesday morning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was getting desperate at this point because makeup would look terrible because 1) The bumps would be very prominent in daylight 2) They were so red that no green concealer would cancel them out. I decided I needed to combine a bunch of topical anti-inflammatories and anti-bacterials if I had any chance of making them flat by Sunday. Going through my stash, I picked some products to put on the cysts on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I did:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.bravuralondon.com/products/salicylic-acid\"&gt;Salicylic Acid 2%&lt;/a&gt; after washing my face. I left it on for about 15 minutes. This was supposed to be my anti-inflammatory topical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sephora.com/super-eye-serum-P382017?skuId=1561083&amp;amp;icid2=products%20grid:p382017\"&gt;Retinol&lt;/a&gt;. This is my eye serum. I don&amp;#39;t even know why I decided to put it on my cysts but it seemed like a good idea at that time. Wait for 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.ulta.com/buffering-lotion?productId=xlsImpprod6200677\"&gt;Mario Badescu Buffering lotion&lt;/a&gt;. I think this is both anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory. Wait for 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aczone/Dapsone gel 5% - This is a prescription only topical. It&amp;#39;s both anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory. Wait for half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.laroche-posay.us/cicaplast-baume-b5-3606000437449.html\"&gt;La Roche Posay Cicaplast&lt;/a&gt;. I luuuurve this to put on my just popped zits since it heals the hole left over miraculously fast with minimal scarring and no scabbing. Since I was putting so many drying topicals, I decided to put a thick blob of this at the very end to minimize peeling/flaking the next day. After wasting half my life putting on all these and waiting for them to dry, I went to bed not expecting anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I had 3 different stages of zits on my face at this point. One which was pointy and had a teeny tiny amount of pus showing through, but nowhere near ready to be popped. Second one, still red and swollen but no sign of pus. Third one, still under the skin, but the area around it was already quite red. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By Thursday morning, the first one was way less painful and quite flat. It still had some pus showing through. The second one was quite flat as well, it looked like it was going back in. The third one was a tiny red dot, I could still feel a small bump underneath, but there was no pain and I knew this one was going back in as well. Because of the Cicaplast, the flaking wasn&amp;#39;t as bad as it would have been. Makeup looked fine over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did the same thing on Thursday morning and night, and Friday morning. The pus just came off the first one on Friday morning when I was washing my face. I didn&amp;#39;t even have to squeeze! As I sit here typing this on Friday night with the same spot treatment combo on my face, the first 2 are pretty flat. The third one on my left cheek has disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. Sorry for the super long post! This is my first post on SCA after lurking for years.
