It creates a controlled release of ingredients to help repair the skin\u2019s barrier. Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Ceramides, Fatty Acid Esters, Dimethicone, and Water are slowly delivered into the skin. MVE delivers its ingredients in what is called a &amp;quot;controlled release,&amp;quot; versus the traditional &amp;quot;quick burst release&amp;quot; method used in most other cleansers and moisturisers. MVE achieves this controlled release by depositing ingredients into the skin in concentric layers released over time. Stage one delivers immediate moisturisation provided by the humectancy of glycerin and the  emollient  nature of  dimethicone  and petrolatum. Stage two creates sustained moisturisation as the ceramides  and other ingredients are slowly released from the MVE vesicles and work their way to the stratum corneum to elicit repair. The effect of the two stages means that ingredients last longer with fewer applications.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MVE technology is based on the use of an emulsifier that produces droplets which exhibit an unusual morphology. Under light microscopy one sees ringed structures consisting of multiple concentric layers, resembling the structure of an onion. It is this structure that gives MVE technology several advantages over traditional liposome-based drug delivery systems. Instead of delivering all of the ingredients in one release, MVE spheres shed their layers one after the other. The net effect of MVE technology is that the ingredients within these multi-vesicular spheres contribute to the vital functions of skin hydration, and lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;September 2008: Coria Laboratories Ltd., and by default CeraVe, is acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The acquisition later results in CeraVe being able to launch more products, like the PM and AM face lotions, as well as their Zinc sunscreens, throughout 2009-10.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward almost a decade later:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;January 2017: Valeant Pharamceuticals goes bankrupt and sells CeraVe to L&amp;#39;oreal France (along with two other brands, AcneFree and Ambi) for 1.3 billion US dollars, cash.
