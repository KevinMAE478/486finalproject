Slowly over time I started to realize how stupid all of this was. I shouldn't be any less valued in my own damn community just because I happen to have dark skin. Colorism is related to the institutions that celebrate whiteness and equate being white with power, privilege and beauty. And British colonialism just reinforced this more. Learning about this cultural/historical stuff definitely gave me a new perspective on my skin.

The beauty standards in India are totally messed up - in the media, magazines, Bollywood movies, etc you hardly see ANY representation of darker skinned Indians. I still remember the time when I was 16 or 17, I was visiting India for a relatives wedding and my aunt took me to get my skin bleached at a very reputable, very fancy spa. My whole face, neck, shoulders, arms.  IT WAS HORRIBLE....it burned like hell and when I told the esthetician that it was burning she was like &amp;quot;oh yeah thats normal&amp;quot;.  A part of me felt sad and hurt, like wow, &amp;quot;my natural skin isn&amp;#39;t good enough&amp;quot;. But another part of me continued to buy in to it because light skin is the ideal. I would go to Sephora and look for skin lightening ingredients because I thought my dark skin was ugly. Ironically none of the products worked. I was burning my skin for nothing! Slowly over time I started to realize how stupid all of this was. I shouldn&amp;#39;t be any less valued in my own damn community just because I happen to have dark skin. Colorism is related to the institutions that celebrate whiteness and equate being white with power, privilege and beauty. And British colonialism just reinforced this more. Learning about this cultural/historical stuff definitely gave me a new perspective on my skin. Nowadays it&amp;#39;s a little better...people are starting to celebrate a little more diversity in India (i.e. some darker skinned celebrities landing big movie roles/magazine covers). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SkincareAddiction", "name": "t1_dga0va1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492245604.0, "created_utc": 1492216804.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
