Every time I moisturize it feels like I&amp;#39;m putting acid on my face.   Now I&amp;#39;m just using it on my jaw and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to irritate that area.  I would repurchase it despite me nuking my face accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The zinc and nainimicide didn&amp;#39;t irritate at all and definitely helps my skin heal faster and spots do seem less red on my outrageously pale skin.    I&amp;#39;ve also noticed reduced pore size however Differin might have a hand in that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SkincareAddiction", "name": "t1_dgcpgdc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492411854.0, "created_utc": 1492383054.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ox19", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcg2qg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Merelka", "parent_id": "t3_65ox19", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SkincareAddiction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would use niacinamide.
