(Also, a makeup junkie). Thanks to this subreddit, I was introduced to The Ordinary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to give my mini review on the four The Ordinary products I have purchased. It&amp;#39;s been about 6 weeks since I started using these products. I am proud to say that I&amp;#39;ve finally been able to exercise restraint on overusing skincare products. The old me would have just overdone it and then quit using these lol. In the brackets below by the name of the product, I have mentioned how often I use them. I started off in my first week only using the Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% and then slowly introduced the other two serums so I can tell what product is doing what. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My skin type: Combination and very acne prone. More on the sensitive side but not overly sensitive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (everyday)\nThis is my favourite product out of all of them only because the results come quick! I&amp;#39;ve been using this everyday. My skin has been &amp;quot;unclogging&amp;quot; thanks to this one. I have hyperpigmentation and I notice a mild difference there. Nothing significant. It&amp;#39;s my acne it&amp;#39;s helping out with so much. I apply to my whole face and then use it as a spot treatment on breakouts and potential breakouts. In the first week, I had breakouts where I already had clogged pores. It was clearly getting everything out. Now my skin is just so much more clear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Ordinary Advanced Retinoid 2% (twice a week)\nHighly recommend this for acne prone skin. I know it&amp;#39;s early to comment about the retinoid but I have fine lines that it seems to be helping out with. Loving the benefits this has for acne prone skin. I can tell this is working for my very uneven skin tone. I use this twice a week only because I use the Lactic Acid on some nights too and don&amp;#39;t want to mix it up. Not irritating! I use about 4 drops for my whole face. I don&amp;#39;t know what &amp;quot;few drops&amp;quot; means in the instructions. So &amp;quot;few&amp;quot; meant four to me. The nights I use this, I do not use anything else except a hyaluronic acid serum I purchased from Amazon and a moisturizer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2% (twice a week)\nThere is a glow that&amp;#39;s coming forth with the use of this. This has been the best for my hyperpigmentation. It&amp;#39;s no overnight success but I can tell, I&amp;#39;m getting somewhere with my stubborn hyperpigmentation. I use a hyaluronic acid serum first, then the Lactic Acid, followed by the Niacinimide serum. I believe that&amp;#39;s the order it should be done but a little unsure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA\nThis one does what it&amp;#39;s supposed to. It hydrates the skin. But I wouldn&amp;#39;t think this work on drier skin types. At least it didn&amp;#39;t break me out. I am grateful for that. I would repurchase this one just for the price and add a hydrating oil to it on days I need more hydration. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "My first post had to be skincare as I'm a total junkie.
