I can understand why your doctor prescribed it - PD is a bacterial infection and requires antibiotics to heal it. Hydrocortisone is an anti-inflammatory agent that would, in theory, help with the flare up. \n\nSo I understand the rationale but this is not a suitable treatment for PD because the hydrocortisone is exacerbating your ailment. \n\nFirstly, I suggest you see a different doctor, because (at least in my experience) doctors don't like being told they gave the wrong prescription. \n\nWhen you see another doctor, ask them about **Benzaclin**.  I'm not sure what it's called in the UK but that's what it's called here in Canada. Benzaclin is part *benzoyl peroxide* and part *clindamycin*. Benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial agent with deep-cleaning effects, which can sometimes make your skin dry but this is easily fixable with moisturizer; clindamycin is an antibiotic that prevents the growth of bacteria. Together, these two agents work to kill existing bacteria that's causing PD and prevent regrowth of said bacteria. Like all antibiotic meds, you take it for a prescribed period of time and then stop. \n\nIt is not recommended you use it if you have a sensitivity to antibiotics. Weirdly, my sister tried it (on her face) and it gave her yeast infections... lol. She's prone to those though. I have a similar skin type to yours and did not experience side effects. Also, wear SPF before going outside if you're using Benzaclin. \n\n\n**ANYWAY**. I used this stuff for my PD and it cleared up COMPLETELY before I even finished the full course. It also comes in a huge pump bottle so I had lots left over and if I was ever having a breakout, I'd pop some on. As with all antibiotics, it's not for constant, daily use.
