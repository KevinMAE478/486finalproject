My first order included the VitC 23% suspension, Buffet, Hyaluronic Acid, and the Retinoid 2%.

I have freckles and spots of larger pigmentation. I have normal/combination skin, with some dryness on my nose and an oily T zone. Only get the occasional hormonal pimple and not many wrinkles yet, but starting to notice some fine lines around my eyes and crepeyness around my mouth).\n\nI LOVE: The Buffet and the Niacinamide.  \nI didn't realise how much of a positive of an effect either of these had on my skin until after I ran out of both of them!  The Buffet takes at least a month of regular use to have a noticeable effect I think. I really do notice a difference in the fine wrinkles around my eyes, and my forehead looks a lot smoother. My skin just looks better when this is a regular part of my routine, and I missed it when I couldn't get hold of it for two months. The texture is nice and absorbs quickly, with no sticky feeling.\nThe Niacinamide is another one that I didn't realise how much it improved my complexion until I ran out. I've never had particularly enlarged pores, but this makes my skin look more refined. I don't get as greasy on my T zone throughout the day and I hardly ever get any pimples when I use this. When I ran out and couldn't repurchase for a few weeks I noticed an increase in oiliness and had a few breakouts. It also seems to make my foundation lay better. Dries down a bit tacky but that disappears once I put my moisturiser on.\n\nI LIKE: The VitC 23% Suspension, Retinoid 2% and the Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5. \nI love the VitC suspension but like most people I'm less of a fan of the texture. The graininess isn't that much of a problem; you can get past the powdery feeling and the pilling depending on how you put it on and what you layer it with, I'd just prefer to wear it in the morning and it makes my skin too greasy to do that. It does make my skin look glowy, and it has had a significantly noticeable effect on my pigmentation, so I will repurchase, possibly with another of their VitC derivatives to compare.\nI only use the Retinoid 2-3 times a week. My skin looks plump and clear the following morning with a noticeable improvement in texture. I've been using my AHA and BHA a lot less since adding this to my routine as I find my skin doesn't need them as much. I will repurchase.\nI really love their Hyaluronic Acid. It was the first HA serum that I've ever used and out of everything it is definitely the product that had the most immediately positive and noticeable effect. My skin looked plumped and hydrated straight after application. Some people find the texture to be thick and sticky; I guess it is, but I found it disappeared pretty quickly once layered with other products. I've never had any pilling with this. I've repurchased this a few times now, but recently switched to the Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium HA lotion, which I like more and works out cheaper for the volume you get.\n\nUNSURE: Alpha Arbutin 2% and Argirline Solution 10%. \nI've only had these for about 3 weeks so the jury is still out on these. The only thing I have noticed so far is a few cystic pimples in places where these have both been applied, so I might be having a bad reaction to one of them. I never get cystic pimples, and to get three since introducing these two products makes me suspicious. I'll do an elimination test and see if I have any more reactions.\n\nHATE: The Lactic Acid 10%. I will definitely not be repurchasing and I'm reluctant to try any of their other acids. I've been using the Bravura London LA10%, BHA 2% about once a week, and the Pixi Glow Tonic once daily, and have been really happy with that routine. The TO Lactic stinks. It makes me want to heave. It smells like rotting pawpaw and I can't keep it on my face for more than a couple of minutes before I have to wash it off. I couldn't really say how well it works because I don't use it often enough. I won't be repurchasing and it will probably go in the bin.\n\nOverall I'm pretty happy with what I've purchased from The Ordinary. My complexion has definitely improved. I'm looking forward to trying some of their foundations and oils. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started using TO products in early September 2016.

Only get the occasional hormonal pimple and not many wrinkles yet, but starting to notice some fine lines around my eyes and crepeyness around my mouth).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I LOVE: The Buffet and the Niacinamide.&lt;br/&gt;\nI didn&amp;#39;t realise how much of a positive of an effect either of these had on my skin until after I ran out of both of them!  The Buffet takes at least a month of regular use to have a noticeable effect I think. I really do notice a difference in the fine wrinkles around my eyes, and my forehead looks a lot smoother. My skin just looks better when this is a regular part of my routine, and I missed it when I couldn&amp;#39;t get hold of it for two months. The texture is nice and absorbs quickly, with no sticky feeling.\nThe Niacinamide is another one that I didn&amp;#39;t realise how much it improved my complexion until I ran out. I&amp;#39;ve never had particularly enlarged pores, but this makes my skin look more refined. I don&amp;#39;t get as greasy on my T zone throughout the day and I hardly ever get any pimples when I use this. When I ran out and couldn&amp;#39;t repurchase for a few weeks I noticed an increase in oiliness and had a few breakouts. It also seems to make my foundation lay better. Dries down a bit tacky but that disappears once I put my moisturiser on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I LIKE: The VitC 23% Suspension, Retinoid 2% and the Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5. \nI love the VitC suspension but like most people I&amp;#39;m less of a fan of the texture. The graininess isn&amp;#39;t that much of a problem; you can get past the powdery feeling and the pilling depending on how you put it on and what you layer it with, I&amp;#39;d just prefer to wear it in the morning and it makes my skin too greasy to do that. It does make my skin look glowy, and it has had a significantly noticeable effect on my pigmentation, so I will repurchase, possibly with another of their VitC derivatives to compare.\nI only use the Retinoid 2-3 times a week. My skin looks plump and clear the following morning with a noticeable improvement in texture. I&amp;#39;ve been using my AHA and BHA a lot less since adding this to my routine as I find my skin doesn&amp;#39;t need them as much. I will repurchase.\nI really love their Hyaluronic Acid. It was the first HA serum that I&amp;#39;ve ever used and out of everything it is definitely the product that had the most immediately positive and noticeable effect. My skin looked plumped and hydrated straight after application. Some people find the texture to be thick and sticky; I guess it is, but I found it disappeared pretty quickly once layered with other products. I&amp;#39;ve never had any pilling with this. I&amp;#39;ve repurchased this a few times now, but recently switched to the Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium HA lotion, which I like more and works out cheaper for the volume you get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UNSURE: Alpha Arbutin 2% and Argirline Solution 10%. \nI&amp;#39;ve only had these for about 3 weeks so the jury is still out on these. The only thing I have noticed so far is a few cystic pimples in places where these have both been applied, so I might be having a bad reaction to one of them. I never get cystic pimples, and to get three since introducing these two products makes me suspicious. I&amp;#39;ll do an elimination test and see if I have any more reactions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HATE: The Lactic Acid 10%. I will definitely not be repurchasing and I&amp;#39;m reluctant to try any of their other acids. I&amp;#39;ve been using the Bravura London LA10%, BHA 2% about once a week, and the Pixi Glow Tonic once daily, and have been really happy with that routine. The TO Lactic stinks. It makes me want to heave. It smells like rotting pawpaw and I can&amp;#39;t keep it on my face for more than a couple of minutes before I have to wash it off. I couldn&amp;#39;t really say how well it works because I don&amp;#39;t use it often enough. I won&amp;#39;t be repurchasing and it will probably go in the bin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall I&amp;#39;m pretty happy with what I&amp;#39;ve purchased from The Ordinary. My complexion has definitely improved. I&amp;#39;m looking forward to trying some of their foundations and oils. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SkincareAddiction", "name": "t1_dgdamvr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492448306.0, "created_utc": 1492419506.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jq3z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb67hz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SexyBleuBox", "parent_id": "t3_65jq3z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SkincareAddiction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My favorite makeup artist actually just did a video review after trying out the products for a few months. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5lYrRH-W-Q\n\nI am planning on buying a few of their products when it comes to replace my current ones based on their pricepoint and her review but I had never heard of them before her mention of them.
