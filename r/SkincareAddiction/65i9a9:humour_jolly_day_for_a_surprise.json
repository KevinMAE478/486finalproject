Thanks to this sub my skin has cleared up wonderfully (olive toned combination but mostly dry) so I haven&amp;#39;t been wearing my usual heavy foundation for a few weeks, and it&amp;#39;s been great! I really love this sub, and for someone who never paid much attention to her skin before, I now actually know what it&amp;#39;s habits are and how to properly care for it. Seriously, thank you. I love makeup, but I&amp;#39;m also lazy, so being able to feel confident enough in my skin to not have to deal with full face makeup every day feels like I&amp;#39;ve hit the jackpot. Anywho, I learned today it&amp;#39;s not all rosy in skincare land...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;ve always had cystic acne, I assume it&amp;#39;s hormonal, and I&amp;#39;ve had one particular bump on the right side of my face just on the edge of my jaw not far from my ear. It&amp;#39;s annoying, but it was mostly just a bump so was easy to hide with my hair. I try my best not to touch it to avoid irritation, and I&amp;#39;ve mostly just been patiently waiting for it to run its course. Well, I got on my train early, and was bored, so pulled out my mirror to fix my lipstick. It was then that I noticed my long-time friend the bump was more raised than usual, like it finally woke up and decided to be annoying, and it was a bit darker as well. Thinking maybe I accidentally got a smudge of something on my face, I gently rubbed my finger over it (seriously, so gently). DEAR GOD THAT WAS A MISTAKE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My old pal the bump EXPLODED with more pus than I have ever seen come out of anywhere on my body, let alone my face. I was astounded, this thing hasn&amp;#39;t even been painful, it was barely noticeable, how in the heck did it get so bad? When?! I panicked for a quick second, then grabbed a makeup remover wipes out of my bag (I literally just bought the pack before boarding so I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to stop later, I&amp;#39;m so glad I did!) And tried to clean myself up as quickly and quietly as possible. I should note that while this was all happening, I had my headphones in and Tchaikovsky&amp;#39;s 1812 Overture was blasting. Of course I was at the end with the cannons and everything blasting off, just like my face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;m sitting here, on the train to work with a hole in the side of my face that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to want to stop bleeding, with no makeup or Band-Aids or anything to cover it up with, trying to clandestinely blot it with a wipe occasionally without the chap across from me noticing how much of a disgusting hot mess I am. I&amp;#39;m still a bit in disbelief, I&amp;#39;ve never experienced something like this before, and just my luck it&amp;#39;s while I&amp;#39;m out of the house the whole day. So I guess I&amp;#39;m keeping my hair down today, and lesson learned, I&amp;#39;ll just never touch anything weird on my face again apparently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anywho, I felt like I just had to vent and my husband&amp;#39;s probably still asleep/wouldn&amp;#39;t be amused, so hopefully you guys can join me in laughing at myself\u200b. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy Saturday everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I've never posted before, on just about any sub because I'm a lurker through and through, but today I felt I just had to.
