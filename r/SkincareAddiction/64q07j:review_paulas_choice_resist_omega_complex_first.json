I work some products from other brands in to my routine, but I have many staple products from Paula.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was really excited to try this new release because the list of ingredients impressed me.  It has of nice non-fragrant oils, antioxidants, and ceramides.  It sounded really nice for normal-dry skin folks like myself.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It came yesterday, so naturally as soon as I got home from work, I launched into skin care mode!  I put it on the first time at about 6:30 p.m.  I was very surprised to see it came out as a white lotion-y texture.  But it felt really nice and soothing.  You can tell it has some nutty oils in it by the smell, which I don&amp;#39;t mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided because if the texture to skip a regular moisturizer.  By about 8:30 my skin felt like it could use a little extra TLC, so I applied a second layer of the Serum with a couple drops of my favorite squalane.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My skin looks and feels really nice this morning,  I can&amp;#39;t wait to see how this product works long term.  I think for the warmer months I will be able to skip on a moisturizer and use just the oil and Serum.  But once it gets cold again I think I&amp;#39;ll need a moisturizer.  Oilier skin types could probably use this as a stand alone moisturizer/Serum combo if they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[RESIST Omega+ Complex](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/collections/Resist-Anti-Aging/_/RESIST-Omega-Complex/)\n\nSo let's start by saying that I've been using Paula's Choice products for 3 years because they work really well for me and have saved my skin.
