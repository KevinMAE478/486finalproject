It just takes a lot longer and is really only a secondary line of treatment and doesn&amp;#39;t replace Treatment 1. These include the common ingredients we all know about:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arbutin, Azelaic Acid, Koji Acid, Niacinamide, N-acetyl glucosamine, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Among these, Azelaic Acid at 20-30% has been shown to be effective. Also, a newer ingredient has also been shown to be effective called: 4-n-butylresorcinol. You can find this in Eucerin Even brighter line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Treatment 3 involves acid peels and the links I&amp;#39;ve listed above show that Glycolic acid has been shown to lessen dark spots in people of color more so than other acids like Mandelic, Lactic, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the studies show that the concentration needs to be 20% or more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Salicylic acid in 20-30% has been shown to also lessen hyperpigmentation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TCA 10-25%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jessner&amp;#39;s solution&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, acids can easily be misused and anyone using these higher concentrations needs to be extremely cautious and careful when using them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fourth treatment mentioned, which I know less about, is laser treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this has helped some people and looking to see if anyone has had any success treating their hyperpigmentation/skin discoloration in darker skin. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello, SCA:\n\nFirst, the links to the studies: \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4142815/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5029232/\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nWhat these studies show is what treatments have worked best for people of color with discoloration and/or hyperpigmentation issues. \n\nBasically it comes down to 4 possible treatments, but really only 1 of them has had solid, verifiable results.

However, TCA peels are very strong and should be undergone with extreme caution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TCA peels are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for beginners or even those with intermediate peel experience. In fact, a TCA peel is usually unnecessary for most people as they see significant results at beginner or intermediate levels of peels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TCA peels should be done by a dermatologist or plastic surgeon&lt;/strong&gt; as they have the most knowledge and experience with this procedure. If you choose to do an at-home TCA peel, you risk &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SEVERE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; complications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The possible complications are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Severe itching, burning and irritation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Persistent redness and swelling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Eye damage or injuries&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Damaged skin barrier: &lt;em&gt;bacterial, herpes and candida infections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Impaired wound healing: &lt;em&gt;delayed healing, scarring,  changes in texture and milia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pigmentation changes: &lt;em&gt;hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation (loss of pigment), line of demarcation between treated and nontreated skin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad reactions to peel: &lt;em&gt;breakouts, allergic reaction and toxicity&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severe complications are more likely if\u2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You\u2019re dark-skinned&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You tend to get PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You\u2019re sensitive to the sun&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have sensitive skin, or a history of atopic dermatitis (eczema)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You\u2019re using drugs or skincare that make you more sensitive to the sun&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have recently taken isotretinoin &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You\u2019re outdoors a lot&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have a history of herpes infection, keloids or poor wound healing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You tend to have unrealistic expectations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047741/\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because of these risks, ScA does NOT recommend doing at-home TCA peels. Please be careful with your skin and your health!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you see that I\u2019m replying to something out of context (eg. listed in a routine), please report this comment so my handlers can remove it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
