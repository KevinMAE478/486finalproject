Just use any moisturiser that is non irritating and you enjoy using. Something like Cerave cream will work great. Expect some flaking and peeling. Don't expect to control of *all* the dryness with products - it's a very powerful drug and what you put on your skin will have a limited effect. Just stay calm and wait for it to do it's thing. The dryness will go away quite quickly after you finish. I tried loads of different moisturizers as you get through them fast and I took it for about 11 months, and probably lots worked well - I used Eucerin 5% urea, freederm with niacinamide, Olay with niacinamide, different ceraves... Using a gentle cleanser is also extremely important when taking care of dry skin. It took me a while to figure this out. Cerave hydrating is the best IMO! Other good ones I tried were Clinique take the day off balm, and a UK brand called Good Things. Cetaphil was weirdly drying for me. \n\nYou might also want to start taking care of your body skin to prevent eczema patches. Have quick showers that aren't too hot, and use a non drying wash like a shower cream or oil. Sometimes I used the Nivea in shower moisturiser as a wash for my scaly limbs. Use a body lotion as soon as you towel dry yourself. Again cerave probably works fine, but my personal favorite is aveeno with almond oil. Get something you enjoy using! I had a Yes To coconut spray lotion, which smelt divine. Mmm.\n\nIt's also very common to get eczema patches on your hands. I'd recommend moisturizing them every time you moisturise your face. A pump of cerave works for all occasions! I also carried a hand cream around. Just use anything. I had a small tune of aveeno cream I carried round for a while, which I kept applying to my very itchy hands and arms. Sometimes I used Eucerin hand cream. Sometimes I put Aquaphor on the backs of my hands. \n\nI'm sure you already know you will need sun protection and lip balm. Personally I found lots of lip balms irritating (carmex, burts bees), but Aquaphor worked well and I also liked the lip balm tubes from Holland and Barrett (uk store). Aquaphor is probably the best and it's also multi purpose e.g. You can use it anywhere when you're really dry and sad. Once I was working are a site about 3.5 hours away from my house in the middle of winter with a terrible cold. I kept blowing my nose and the skin on my face was basically raw after a few hours. All I had in my bag was Aquaphor, so I rubbed that shit all over my poor face. It's also good for putting in your nose when your nostrils get bloody and sore - a strange and uncomfortable sensation I have never experienced before or since I was on the drug! \n\nJust keep it simple, be genle, don't keep hunting for the holy grail products like I did at the beginning, and don't Google it too much like I did - It made me really anxious (/r/accutane was the worst).    \n\nEdit - also take care of your eyes. I didn't, and I had really dry and painful eyes by the end because the oil glands became full of hard plugs. I've been doing regular hot compresses, eyelid massage, cleaning, and drops for *months* and I'm still unable to wear my contact lenses anymore.
