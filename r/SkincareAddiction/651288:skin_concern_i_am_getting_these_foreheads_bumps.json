It's basically a closed comedone that has become inflamed and turned into [a papule](http://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/inflammatory-lesions-in-acne/) \n\nEvery single product can potentially trigger acne so you have to test everything out. Since your routine is so minimal it's actually an easier place to start than most people (who would have to stop everything they are doing and re-test all their old stuff). \n\nFirst step would be to get your basics in order, which looks like you've already taken care of. Just be sure to check out the post in the side bar 'how to patch test' and give every new product a couple weeks to evaluate how it effects your skin. If anything worsens your acne or irritates your skin you will know it's not right for you. In that case you'd have to toss it/return it and try something else. \n\nFor a cleanser you ideally want something gentle with a low ph (below 6). I have no idea where the ole hendriksen stands so you'd want to look that up. Gentle and low ph is so avoid any dryness/irritation. If you can use the one you have now without it drying your skin or triggering acne then it's probably safe.\n\nFor moisturizer you again want something gentle and pretty bare bones. As long as it moisturizes enough and doesn't trigger adverse reactions you're good to go. If you are happy with your moisturizer for the most part but sometimes need something heavier you can try topping it with a thin layer of vaseline at night. \n\nNext look for a sunscreen since you'll want to treat acne (and acne treatments often increase uv sensitivity) and you want to treat aging (uv damage is terrible for aging). You want something above spf30, broad spectrum (so UVA and UVB coverage). You apply this every day under your makeup; 1/4 tsp for your face, 1/4 tsp for your neck. If you aren't a fan of US sunscreens due to greasiness/heaviness then look into recommendations over at /r/asianbeauty. \n\nSince you want to treat acne and aging a [retinoid](http://www.skinacea.com/retinoids/types-of-retinoids.html) is a great choice. Follow [these instructions](http://www.skinacea.com/retinoids/use-retinoids-right-part-one.html) if you go that route. Differin is the most potent over the counter option in the US. Otherwise I'd get a prescription if possible of adapalene or tretinoin. If neither of those are options then look into deciem: the ordinary 1% retinol or 2% retinoid which are both pretty affordable. \n\nYou don't necessary need a toner, serum or eye cream specifically. You want to focus on ingredients to treat specific issues and get the corresponding products. The eye area can just be treated the same as the rest of the face but with a bit more caution since the skin is thinner and more sensitive (so go slowly with active ingredients like retinoids and possible use a heavier moisturizer/vaseline).
