All of these have super different ingredients so I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s any particular ingredient that my skin doesn&amp;#39;t like or if it just doesn&amp;#39;t like moisturizers. Edit: basically my skin problems went away when I stopped using moisturizers and started just using oils (mostly jojoba, olive, and seabuckthorn). Everything was fine until my skin recently became dehydrated and now I&amp;#39;m having a hell of a time fixing it without moisturizers, so I&amp;#39;m stuck in a bit of a catch-22.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SkincareAddiction", "name": "t1_dg6sk8z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492070108.0, "created_utc": 1492041308.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6s5xi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SuspiciousUnicorn", "parent_id": "t3_6517y9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SkincareAddiction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You say you break out \"from literally every moisturizer.\" Which ones have you used?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You say you break out &amp;quot;from literally every moisturizer.&amp;quot; Which ones have you used?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SkincareAddiction", "name": "t1_dg6s5xi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492069611.0, "created_utc": 1492040811.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6517y9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6517y9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6517y9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6517y9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6517y9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6517y9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6517y9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6517y9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg73jid", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "goldentipyunnan", "parent_id": "t1_dg73i2s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SkincareAddiction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, true true.
