I can answer this! So, when I took nutrition class I learned the answer to your question while studying (my answer isn't likely to be in a nutrition book explicitly, but implicitly it is), but allow me to give you a full justification as opposed to telling you what the answer is by itself. Maybe you'll conclude the same thing as me.\n\n I learned that 'good nutrition' is based on multiple variables per meal that can easily be remembered as ABCDM: Adequacy, Balance, Calories, nutrient Density, and Moderation.  A) is the food adequately going to satisfy you or will you be snacking in an hour? B) does your meal balance the nutrient groups well or are you eating only one or two? C) pretty basic, there are Android apps for counting calories. D) nutrient Density would be like the difference between eating 1000 calories across a portion of bacon, a portion of eggs, a portion of toast, a portion of orange juice versus eating 1000 calories across one donut and a cup of coffee.  M) are you sticking to serving size?  \n\nAnother thing to consider, before I blatantly answer your question, is serving size. When you look at, for example, a bag of chips, you might chuckle at the serving size because you could personally eat way more than one serving. Why is a serving a serving? Well, servings are meant to accompany servings of other things (balance and moderation). For example, a serving a meat is roughly equivalent to the size of your palm.  A serving of milk is roughly the size of your closed fist. Alone, a serving is likely too little for you to meet the adequacy requirement.  But combining one serving of meat, a serving of carbs, a serving of veggies and a serving of your favorite beverage will allow you to have more adequacy as well as balance. \n\nMy answer:\nSo let's look at your question: most nutrition with least complexity? It would appear that a *fully loaded sandwich* has excellent nutrition potential and it's among the simplest things I believe you'll be recommended!\n\nTo keep with maintaining variety, maybe you can feel inspiration from r/eatsandwiches.\n\nCheers!
