Recently, I&amp;#39;ve increased my exercise quite a bit so I have been trying to increase my protein intake.

However, I have found that I would rather have two small breakfasts then one big one on a 1200 calorie diet. Egg whites have become my main squeeze, with yogurt as my side chick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For lunch, I made my mom&amp;#39;s classic white chicken chili which is loosely based on this &lt;a href=\"http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/white-chicken-chili\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt; (but also not because if you follow that recipe exactly your white chicken chili is going to be bland). I then topped it with homemade tomatillo salsa verde. (Fun fact: tomatillos are mildly toxic and it freaks my husband out to no end that I eat them, but I&amp;#39;ve never had an issue). This chili is delicious with heaps of cheese and tortilla chips, but I was out of both.

These zucchinis (and one yellow squash) were the last ones at the Farmer&amp;#39;s Market, so they tasted like victory. My husband made this fantastic tomato sauce that was loaded with a pound of shrimp.
