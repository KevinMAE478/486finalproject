How could it be when I would log three meals no snacks and already be over??\nAnd then today I realized: you&amp;#39;re eating the wrong things. \n1. Breakfast. If you&amp;#39;re hungry, it&amp;#39;s great and eat it! But most mornings I waste 300-400 calories when I am totally full and am not even planning on doing anything simply because I want a big bowl oats and bananas for the taste. \n2. Coffee! Yeah fat free half and half is low cal, but drink coffee as much as I do and it&amp;#39;s an extra 100 calories a day. I drank mine black this morning and it was honestly just as good.... \n3. Carbs with everything! I love carbs, and don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re evil, but I can have massive amounts of all the roasted veggies for the 200 calories pasta gives me, that usually doesn&amp;#39;t fill me up. \n4. And more carbs... oh my god granola. 90 cal per 1/4 cup. Which usually turns into a half cup because it&amp;#39;s so good! And why is it? I was horrified when I actually looked at the ingredients. The second one-sugar! I was putting a crunched up candy bar on my yogurt- no shit I was still hungry and irritable after eating it! \n4. Useless snacks. I think our culture has instilled into us that a snack must be a quick and easy pre-packaged thing. I&amp;#39;ve been eating 100 cal granola bars that again, do nothing for me. Why not have a slightly higher cal mini meal and feel fuller longer? ( I.E 4 oz of chicken and some roasted broccoli could easily be right around 150 calories...) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are just my observations. If you wanna do CICO eating nothing for granulated sugar you can and you&amp;#39;ll lose weight. But I like food, lots of it, and being full. And I&amp;#39;m learning that these go-to &amp;quot;weight loss&amp;quot; foods I have burned in my brain really aren&amp;#39;t all that great. Eating clean and doing CICO aren&amp;#39;t mutually exclusive.
