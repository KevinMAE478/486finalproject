I have a large history of ED behavior, I&amp;#39;m not sure what your gf&amp;#39;s past is but something like this could definitely turn into anorexic type behaviors. Best thing is to not force her to eat (it would piss me off so much if my husband would complain to me constantly to eat eat eat and make me not want to even more), but just slowly encourage expanding her food choices and adding a bit here and there and &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; if she gains weight, then do it again. Or slowly every  week encourage her to hit 50 cals above her &amp;quot;600&amp;quot; cals until she teaches her 1200 diet, so she&amp;#39;s still losing but isn&amp;#39;t doing it super unhealthily. Once I hit 99 lbs I know I realized I was still &amp;quot;skinny fat&amp;quot; and I couldn&amp;#39;t get any leaner without putting on weight and muscle- that was my personal realization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to pm me!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "1200isplenty", "name": "t1_dgc4spn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492384480.0, "created_utc": 1492355680.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 34}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xk5e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p98g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xk5e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p98g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xk5e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p98g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcfwn0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AugustaG", "parent_id": "t1_dgcduyt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/1200isplenty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ha.
