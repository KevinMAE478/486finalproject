That was the foundation for Trump being soft on Assad all throughout 2016. \n\nRussians are claiming the recent Chem. Weapons reports to be a hoax, but a hoax by who? If it's a hoax, it could only be perpetrated by the Trump administration to justify 'going hard' on Assad's regime. If this were true it would throw the 'Trump playing too nicely with Russia' rhetoric out the window, especially considering Tillerson's stance that Assad will be removed by means of war crime charges once the civil war is over. Assuming the Syrian people can replace Assad with someone less problematic, it would mean the US could boot Russia out of Syria without firing a shot. That would certainly be worth a fake chemical weapons attack, at least from Trump's perspective. \n\nThe only way Russia would agree to this happening would be is Trump proposed to drop sanctions on their oil exports and the means to drill for oil in the North Russian sea. Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon, is the most qualified person in the world to make that happen. \n\nAs for China, it seems like Trump has canned his campaign promise to label China a currency manipulator. Could Trump have offered to *not* have China labeled a currency manipulator in exchange for getting North Korea under control?
