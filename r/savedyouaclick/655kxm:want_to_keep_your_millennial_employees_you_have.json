I feel like everyone has no idea what they want, but they know what they don&amp;#39;t want. And it&amp;#39;s like they are afraid of making hard statements because then they&amp;#39;re responsible. And they revere their designers like artists who just do what they want because they want to and not because it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s best for any reason in particular, but that&amp;#39;s poor strategy and I&amp;#39;m pressing them to do more to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m excited because there is a lot to be done, problems that I know how to solve but still very challenging. And I think I&amp;#39;m going to make a difference at this company.
