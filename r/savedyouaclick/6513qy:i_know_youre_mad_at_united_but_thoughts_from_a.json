I\u2019m taking my business to Southwest!\u201d Ummmm, okay. But just be sure you understand that every\u00a0major airline, Southwest included, has a similar policy for involuntary bumping in a \u2018must ride\u2019 scenario. Don\u2019t believe me? It\u2019s called the contract of carriage. If you\u2019re really bored, you can read Southwest\u2019s here. Or Delta\u2019s here. Believe me, it\u2019s in there. \u00a0This could have been any airline. In fact, it happens all the time. Most people just don\u2019t wrestle the feds in the aisle.\n\n\tIt doesn\u2019t matter if the contract terms are the same. That isn\u2019t the point. One of the reasons people want to leave United and go elsewhere is because, so far, the other airlines haven\u2019t had the police drag a customer of the plane because they found him inconvenient. The other reason is to show discontent with the status quo: If I take my business elsewhere, it shows that I will exercise what little power I have to protest the rules as they are, in the hopes that the other airlines will understand that the current contracts are poorly thought-out.\n\n3: \u201cSo what\u2019s this \u2018must ride\u2019 nonsense anyway? They shouldn\u2019t bump a paying customer for a free employee ride!\u201d I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to take this up with the federal government, not United. And it\u2019s actually pretty important to you as an airline traveler anyway. They were not \u2018freeloading home\u2019. That\u2019s called non-rev\u00a0and they have to wait in line behind your checkbook and often don\u2019t make it home to their families if flights are booked (believe me, I know). No, this was a must fly, a positive space situation. In layman terms, it means that a crew must be flown to an airport to man a flight in order to avoid cancellation of said flight due to crew unavailability. This is a federal DOT regulation, not an airline one. The airlines are required to do so to avoid disruption of air traffic. In other words, if there are no willing volunteers and they need seats to get a crew somewhere to avoid disruption of aviation flow, they can, will, must by federal regulation\u00a0bump people for the better good of the 1000\u2019s. Why? Because one cancelled flight has a serious domino affect in the delicate, complicated world of connections and aviation law.\n\n\tThis is just poor planning on the part of United, and has nothing to do with the passengers on the plane. They could have hired a car, could have booked passage on another flight, could have arranged their schedules so that this did not happen in the first place. \u201cLack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part\u201d is an old saw for a good reason.\n\n4:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the airline\u2019s fault for not planning better!\u201d You obviously have no clue about the complexities of aviation travel and should do some research. There are about a million and one things that can cause a crew shortage including but not limited to weather, maintenance, weather, connecting fight delays, weather, FAA timeout regs, and did I mention weather? I wish I could control Mother Nature because I would be one filthy rich person. But I can\u2019t. And neither can United. So they inconvenience one, or four, to keep hundreds on track. Do the math. And of course, if we were on the other end of this thing, we\u2019d be tirading and blowing up the internet because United didn\u2019t bump a passenger to make sure our flight didn\u2019t get cancelled and left hundreds stranded. Damned if you do; damned if you don\u2019t. We\u2019re a fickle crowd, we social media folks.\n\n\tSee above. This is not the fault of the customer. If you are not able to perform your service without screwups, writing remedies for yourself into monopoly contracts is the wrong way to go about solving that problem. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated! It\u2019s hard!\u201d is no argument at all.\n\n5: They shouldn\u2019t have picked the minority Chinese doctor! It\u2019s racist.\u201d That\u2019s just silly. Though federal regulation demands they involuntarily bump to prevent interruption of flights when necessary, each airline does have the leniency to determine how they choose the bumped passengers. They did not play spin the bottle or walk down the aisle looking for the Asian guy. Use your heads, people! There is a computerized algorithm that takes into account price of ticket, how long ago it was purchased, whether or not they can get the passenger to their destination in a timely manner, etc. It wasn\u2019t an \u2018Asian thing.\u2019 Stop, people. Just stop.\n\n6: \u201cUnited should go under for assaulting that passenger! Fire the entire crew!\u201d Read the facts. United neeeever touched the passenger. In fact, by all witness accounts, the United flight crew remained calm and pleasant throughout the entire event, never laying hands on the passenger. They followed protocol as required by law. \n\n\tNo. They absolutely did not. They had the option to raise the offering price, and the option to move on to another customer. There is no law that says they have to call the police if a customer declines the offer.\n\nOnce law enforcement became involved (also as required by federal protocol), United stepped out of the decision-making process. They had nothing to do with the rest. The passenger was forcibly removed by federal aviation security (the disturbing clip that everyone is talking about) after running back into the secured area after being escorted out once. Once he did that, like it or not, they (law enforcement) were under full discretion of the law to apply necessary force to remove the threat. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s pretty, but the only one who actually broke a law was the passenger. \n\n\tThis is also wrong. The police have rules about how to handle the public and they may have broken them. The officers involved have been suspended, which suggests that there is a question about whether  those rules were  followed.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for these laws\u2013it\u2019s called 9/11. We can\u2019t have it both ways. But by all means, let\u2019s berate and punish an entire flight crew\u2013in fact thousands of pilots, FA\u2019s, gate attendents, ground crew, etc.\u2013because it makes us all feel a little better.\n\n\tThe flight crew involved made bad decisions based on bad corporate policy. People are angry because the situation didn\u2019t need to unfold the way it did, and we blame everyone present because we\u2019re not able to tell exactly who made the decisions that led to the police action. The public are angry at a corporation which abuses them, and, if you work for that corporation, you are guilty by association.\n\n7: \u201cYou piece of **it!\u201d I get that the passengers were upset, angry, maybe even confused. I get that you are too. After all, media is tossing you out chunks of bloody meat like you\u2019re a pack of starving wolves. But I\u2019m seriously disgusted that the poor must ride\u00a0crew that had to take those seats after the unfortunate mess that unraveled were verbally abused and threatened. Can you imagine the very uncomfortable position they were in? Then they\u00a0were demeaned, belittled, threatened. Along with many others all over the internet and airports today. They were and are men and women doing their jobs to feed their families. Just. Like. You. \u00a0They didn\u2019t have a choice. They didn\u2019t ask for this. They didn\u2019t assault anyone. They are not a corporation; they are individuals who need a job. They are my friends and maybe even my husband. There\u2019s a very fine line between what you despise and becoming\u00a0what you despise. \n\n\tIndeed. The \u201cmust ride\u201d crew has choices to make; work for a corporation which treats people with zero respect or work somewhere else. Refuse to climb aboard a flight on which room was made by the violent removal of a passenger. They chose neither of these, so they get the wrath of the other passengers. You make your bed, you lie in it.\n\nMany of the comments and actions I have seen perpetrated against United employees cross it. Don\u2019t become what you hate.\nLike I said, I know you\u2019re mad at United, but there\u2019s much more to the story than hits the media fan.\n\n\tWe\u2019re not just mad at United. We\u2019re mad at the people who make up United. As you say, they are individuals. We hold them accountable because they should be accountable. The corporation could not exist without them.\n\nI truly hope that this gives you something to chew on and gives you a smidgen more insight into the complexities of aviation. I\u2019m not making excuses. I think there were bad decisions made on both sides. However, I am saying there are always two sides to every story. Make sure you consider them both.\nTailwinds.\n\n\tThere are many sides to this issue. You're on the wrong side of most of them, lady.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) \u201cKicking a paying customer off an airplane!? I\u2019m taking my business to Southwest!\u201d Ummmm, okay. But just be sure you understand that every\u00a0major airline, Southwest included, has a similar policy for involuntary bumping in a \u2018must ride\u2019 scenario. Don\u2019t believe me? It\u2019s called the contract of carriage. If you\u2019re really bored, you can read Southwest\u2019s here. Or Delta\u2019s here. Believe me, it\u2019s in there. \u00a0This could have been any airline. In fact, it happens all the time. Most people just don\u2019t wrestle the feds in the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;It doesn\u2019t matter if the contract terms are the same. That isn\u2019t the point. One of the reasons people want to leave United and go elsewhere is because, so far, the other airlines haven\u2019t had the police drag a customer of the plane because they found him inconvenient. The other reason is to show discontent with the status quo: If I take my business elsewhere, it shows that I will exercise what little power I have to protest the rules as they are, in the hopes that the other airlines will understand that the current contracts are poorly thought-out.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3: \u201cSo what\u2019s this \u2018must ride\u2019 nonsense anyway? They shouldn\u2019t bump a paying customer for a free employee ride!\u201d I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to take this up with the federal government, not United. And it\u2019s actually pretty important to you as an airline traveler anyway. They were not \u2018freeloading home\u2019. That\u2019s called non-rev\u00a0and they have to wait in line behind your checkbook and often don\u2019t make it home to their families if flights are booked (believe me, I know). No, this was a must fly, a positive space situation. In layman terms, it means that a crew must be flown to an airport to man a flight in order to avoid cancellation of said flight due to crew unavailability. This is a federal DOT regulation, not an airline one. The airlines are required to do so to avoid disruption of air traffic.

Griffin\u2019s post.\n\n1. The TSA is security theater and has not been shown to be effective. They fail to perform every time they are tested. They are not a legitimate law enforcement agency. They are a force of low-skilled, poorly-trained, poorly-paid workers who have been handed a ridiculous mount of power in a bid to control the American populace and to give politicians an excuse when some bad actor actually does manage to do something awful. \u201cHe somehow slipped through the massive security apparatus that we set up for you.\u201d \n2.  Blindly following laws, rules and regulations is stupid. They are there to guide us, not to keep us from acting humanely. If the choice is \u201cfollow the law and cause harm\u201d or \u201cdisobey the law and cause no harm\u201d, it\u2019s clear what the choice should be.\n3. The arguments Griffin makes are the wrong ones. This is not about security, airline ticket contracts, or following rules. It\u2019s about treating people with decency and respect.  \n\n\nAPRIL 11, 2017\nANGELIAJGRIFFIN\nIf there\u2019s one thing I have learned over the years, it\u2019s that there are\u00a0always two sides to every story.\nOn April 9th, a very unfortunate incident played out on United Flight 3411, the video of which has since gone viral causing a mass social media uprising with an \u2018off-with-their-heads\u2019 mentality. I mean, across the board. Fire \u2019em all and let the gods sort it out later.\nLook, I get it. When I first saw the video I was appalled too. To say that it was inflammatory would be putting it mildly. But it was also a situation that was escalated far beyond the boundaries of necessity.\n\n\tExactly. Escalated first by the airline, and then by the police.\n\nIf a federal law enforcement officer asks me to exit a plane, no matter how royally pissed off I am, I\u2019m going to do it and then seek other means of legal reimbursement. True story.\nKnowing what I know about airport security, I\u2019m certainly not going to run back into a secured, federally restricted area at an airport flailing my arms and screaming like a banshee\u2026because, you know, that just happens to be breaking a major federal Homeland Security law.\nBut that\u2019s just me. Obviously.  \n\n\tYou don\u2019t actually know how this went down. If the LEOs got him off the plane, they quite possibly let him back on, unless you\u2019re suggesting that he somehow overpowered three of them and managed to make it back onto the plane without recapture. Demeaning the guy by using the phrase \u201cflailing my arms and screaming like a banshee\u201d is dismissive and rude.\n\nThe moment I made that particular ill-advised choice, I would become an immediate and imminent threat to the aircraft\u2019s security. \n\n\tNo, you wouldn\u2019t. He had no weapon and there was no evidence that he was going to hurt anyone.\n\nThat\u2019s kind of a big deal. I mean, come on, I once actually had to remove my infant son\u2019s socks because they mimicked little baby sneakers. These guys mean business.\n\n\tThat\u2019s evidence of stupidity, not \u201cmeaning business\u201d. Any fool can tell socks from shoes, the whole shoes-off thing was a sham (which is why it\u2019s not a rule any longer), and it goes to my point that the TSA is a waste of everyone\u2019s time and money.\n\nI didn\u2019t like it. I thought it was just plain stupid, honestly. But instead of pitching a massive fit, refusing to comply, and bolting through the TSA checkpoint like an out-of-control toddler, I did the big girl thing\u2013sucked it up, removed the offensive socks, and went on with my happy life, sans being tackled and dragged through the airport in handcuffs by a bunch of big men with guns.\n\n\tIf everyone refuses to protest, nothing changes. You played the part of the good little sheep, just as most of us do, most of the time. That doesn\u2019t make you a good person.\n\nBecause if you choose to take advantage of the services the airport provides, you play by their rules.\nI know you\u2019re all out there screaming that the \u2018rules\u2019 are unfair, but I am a pilot wife. I remember 9/11. Do you? I want my husband, the father of my children, to come home. I want you to get home.\u00a0That law exists to protect my husband. And your wife. And your grandmother. And your child. And you. I, for one, am glad for the law.\n\n\tThe rules are unfair. Invoking 911 is silly and a cheap trick. The rules are not there to protect us, they are there to convince us that something is being done to protect us. Not at all the same thing. 911 was a fluke; it succeeded because it was relatively well-planned and the American intelligence apparatus was overloaded with information to the point of paralysis. There has been nothing even remotely like it since, but that is not due to any of the rules that you embrace in this case. \n\nI\u2019m not here to dispute the facts of 3411 with you. I am not interested in getting into an argument of opinion with anyone. We\u2019re all entitled to our own. I\u2019m not arguing that what happened wasn\u2019t completely terrible\u2013it was, on multiple levels. But I am suggesting that the general public take another look at the situation, ask a few more questions, gather a few more facts, and then create a less hostile and more intellectually wrought opinion about what happened.\nBecause the media is giving you just enough information to keep you enraged\u2013enough to keep their ratings up.\n\n\tOh, I see. We\u2019re all incapable of considerate, rational thought because we disagree with you. \n\nThings to consider:\n1) \u201cYou can\u2019t just kick a paying customer off the plane!\u201d Psssst! It\u2019s in the fine print. They can, indeed, do just that. And it\u2019s not an airline specific rule, it\u2019s a commercial aviation rule. Every ticket you purchase comes with a plethora of fine print\u2013you know, the stuff we just click \u2018next\u2019 on without actually reading what we are agreeing to. Yeah, that. Well, it\u2019s in there, and you checked the \u2018I agree\u2019 box when you purchased your ticket. You can read about it and oh-so-much-more here. Kind of makes you want to read all those tiny words on your next phone update before you click \u2018I agree\u2019, huh? You should. United did not break any law, and he agreed to the policy and possibility of involuntary bump when he bought his ticket. And so do you.\n\n\tCan \u2260 Should. The agreements we are forced into by a monopoly company in a situation where we have no real choice are abusive and designed to maximize profit and control over human decency. They are written to confuse and to empower the airlines at the expense of the customer. The airline has the ability to choose whether to enforce those rules or not. They chose to abuse the passenger by calling the police instead of either offering more money or moving on to another \u201cvolunteer\u201d. The customers have no army to call upon; if we think that the contract is being violated by the airline, our recourse is to wait until we get to our destination (we\u2019re not allowed to leave the airplane when we want to), and sue in court. If the airline thinks that the contract is being violated, they can call the police and have you removed.
