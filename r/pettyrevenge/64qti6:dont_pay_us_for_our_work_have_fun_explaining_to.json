Meanwhile they had built and opened a restaurant onsite and ran a front desk check in for the rental homes from the office in the foyer.  Soon the checks started being late. A few times we had to put money on our credit cards to pay our nine employees because the Rental company was so far behind in payments. We set up a loan for them and closed out all old invoices and started over some scratch.  Soon they were another 30k behind in bills. Thats when we decided to quit.  Not only did we quit, we also informed all the home owners why we were quitting. And invited them to switch to our new company that not only did the cleaning and maintenance, but would also rent out houses. IT was scary and slow going. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we were getting our footing and had a few switch overs, all while running the business from our home.
