We have so long to build a robot to meet specific criteria and perform certain tasks. After &amp;#39;build season&amp;#39; is over, you go to three-day competitions. Well, because I was part of the team, my dad was a volunteer mentor for us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we go to the competition, each team gets a 10&amp;#39;x10&amp;#39;x10&amp;#39; space for us to work. This is called our pit area. My team only allowed 5 students, and the mentors needed, to be in the pit at one time, or else it would get too crowded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the pit, you can go to a table and ask for parts needed and someone will announce to the rest of the pit that, &amp;quot;Team so and so would greatly appreciate a spare battery&amp;quot; or whatever they needed. This is important. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Story: \nSo, we&amp;#39;re at a competition and there are four of us students actually being productive with the robot, changing out some tubing that got busted, and one guy that&amp;#39;s just bullshitting around. Being a typical stupid freshman. This kid is yelling stupid things, not handing us things we ask for (his designated job), etc.... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad is REALLY starting to get pissed off. This kid has been nothing but a pain in the rear the entire season and the head mentor hasn&amp;#39;t really done anything about it because he doesn&amp;#39;t care that much. So dad takes things into his own hands. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dad pulls this kid aside and asks him to go to the front table and ask for a specific tool we &amp;#39;needed&amp;#39;. A few minutes later, we hear this gem...&amp;quot;Team so and so would appreciate it if another team could lend them a left-handed crescent wrench.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the laugher that erupted through the pit, that kid didn&amp;#39;t show his face the rest of the day and was actually really helpful for the rest of the competition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bonus!: \nThe poor girl that announced that didn&amp;#39;t realize anything was amiss until the laughter started either.
