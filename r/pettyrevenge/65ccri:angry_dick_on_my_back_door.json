I shockingly decide that I need in the right lane so I can do the posted speed limit. A short time later a dick in a black pickup truck comes running up on my bumper. He gets as close as he can to intimidate me moving out of his way despite having room enough to get into the left lane and around me. This behavior continues long enough that we catch up to a semi truck hauling pine straw bales. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get sick of him drifting back and forth then thrusting quickly in the right lane to run up on my back end super close - I hatch my plan.
