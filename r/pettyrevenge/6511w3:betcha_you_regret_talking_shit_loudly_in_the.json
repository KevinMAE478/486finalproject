It&amp;#39;s so annoying!&amp;quot; This makes no sense considering I&amp;#39;m the only person who cleans bathrooms and I&amp;#39;m socially awkward enough that, if I knock and someone is in the bathroom, I leave and come back to it hours later. I don&amp;#39;t even announce myself. If that wasn&amp;#39;t bad enough, she then went on to say that we do a bad job and several other inaccurate things. I was a little peeved, to say the least.

Apparently these brown ones aren&amp;#39;t as good and they&amp;#39;re having a hard time using them. About this time, a nurse from the other station comes up and pleads for the exact same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I closed my closet door, on my way out for the night and hit them with, &amp;quot;Sorry ladies.
