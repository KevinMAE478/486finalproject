So, bit of context. I&amp;#39;m french in origin but I moved to Australia when I was ten. So about half of my education was at a french school in Paris. This school was a tiny one, with less than 20 students per class. We typically start the equivalent of kindergarten when we turn 3-4. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The teachers at this school had an awful way of punishing students. Not detention, not lines to write, not even a letter to parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What they did was lock the kids in the toilet and turn the lights off. You&amp;#39;d be in there for 10 minutes max then let out and refused a break time. This happened to little kids barely older than 4 who had no idea why they were even punished. I was once locked in the toilets for eating my friends cookie by accident (I thought it was mine. I gave him my own to make up for it, but the mistake was made and the punishment handed out.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was punished for yelling at a kid who was flipping up my skirt (he didn&amp;#39;t get punished).\nI was punished for forgetting to flush the toilet.\nI was punished for not using very formal French to ask to go to the bathroom. I was 6.\nEventually you pick it up and make sure not to get in the teachers way and keep your head down.

Bitch extraordinaire, hellish arsewipe with a moustache and the appeal of a dying moose. She was mean, vindictive and thoroughly cruel with an evil in her that I haven&amp;#39;t seen in anyone since. The only thing she loved was authority and this crappy furry coat she wore everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She apparently always picked one kid per year to become her punching bag. Guess who it was? Yours truly.\nShe hated me because who knows.\nTo be honest I&amp;#39;m not the smartest or most attentive of students. But I&amp;#39;m polite and respectful with teachers, and I stay quietly in my corner not bothering anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time I was learning 2 languages at the same time, both english and french. My dad is Australian and wanted to be able to talk to his kids (his french is hilarious). So he gave us lessons and only spoke to us in english,  read us harry potter in english once in a while when he could and made us do spelling tests every weekend or so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t had the opportunity to learn to read and write two languages at the same time, it&amp;#39;s hard as fuck.

She would berate me and get others to call me an idiot too. I once started crying because she was going on and on about me being a moron so she made me stand at the front of the class. For hours. I needed to pee desperately but she wouldn&amp;#39;t let me go. So I accidentally peed my pants. It was embarrassing and more fodder for her cannon of hate. I had to clean it up and stay in soaked pants for ages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times i was locked into that toilet. And not for ten minutes. I was in there for up to an hour in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember if I told my mum and dad, but nothing was done so either they didn&amp;#39;t know or didn&amp;#39;t care that she bullied me so badly. I was mostly raised by my nanny who was this tiny Phillipino lady who was both lovely and scary. I told her everything that happened but there wasn&amp;#39;t much she could do for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was close to the end of your that my petty revenge came into play. I was moving to a new school and i knew I&amp;#39;d be out of her grasp soon enough. \nThe day came, the last day of the year.
