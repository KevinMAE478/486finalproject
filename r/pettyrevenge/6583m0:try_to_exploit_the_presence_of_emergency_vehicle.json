This happened yesterday afternoon in Waltham, MA (outskirts of Boston). Let me preface my comments by saying that I&amp;#39;m generally a pretty calm driver, but seeing people exploit emergency vehicles for their own gain fills me with rage. There&amp;#39;s a special place in hell for these scumbags.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, quick back-story: I was in a car not my own yesterday (rental car --- Chevy Impala) and, while driving into Boston in the morning on I-95, I had noticed that the windshield sprayer was unusually strong. This will factor in later on in the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, yesterday evening, I am in Waltham. Decide to pick up a sandwich for the road at a local restaurant on Prospect Street before driving 100+ miles to my next destination. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The restaurant is on the &amp;quot;even&amp;quot; side of the street, and there is not really any street parking there. So what I will typically do is make a left turn into a gas station on the &amp;quot;odd&amp;quot; side of the street, fill my gas tank, get a coffee and then leave my car parked there for the 2-3 minutes that it takes to get my sandwich from across the street. (And before anyone asks, I&amp;#39;m not one of those jerks who leaves his car at the gas pump itself before walking away from it. I always finish filling my tank first, then pull into a parking spot in the gas station parking lot.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gas station has two entrances, about 50 feet apart from one another. On this particular day, with the gas pumps closest to the first entrance being occupied, I need to drive to the 2nd entrance where I can access the unoccupied pumps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m nearing the 2nd entrance of the gas station and have my left-turn signal on when I spot an ambulance coming my way in the oncoming (westbound?) lane. While traffic in my (eastbound) lane is fairly light\u2014its me and like 3 vehicles behind me\u2014the oncoming lane is stacked up pretty bad at the light --- probably 15-18 vehicles total. And with the &amp;quot;odd&amp;quot; street parking spaces also occupied, the only way this ambulance is getting through this jumbled mess is for the cars in my lane to pull over to make room for the driver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, the &amp;quot;even&amp;quot; side of the street doesn&amp;#39;t have parking spaces. So there&amp;#39;s very little room available. But as it happens, I&amp;#39;m right next to a store of some type (I think it was auto glass repair or something) and I can kind of tuck myself a few feet into their parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as I&amp;#39;m about to do so, the driver of a black SUV behind me\u2014evidently spotting the ambulance a split second before I did\u2014hits the gas and drives into the spot I&amp;#39;m about to take. Now this all happens very, very quickly (with the ambulance rapidly approaching our position) but he&amp;#39;s got his window down and as I look over at him, he&amp;#39;s got this smirk on his face as if to say &amp;quot;tough luck, man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m screwed. The ambulance is bearing down on us fast. I don&amp;#39;t have any room on my right side now because of SUV guy and I can&amp;#39;t make a quick left turn into the gas station parking lot because the lane is clogged with traffic. There&amp;#39;s a telephone pole right at the end of the auto glass repair (?) lot so I can&amp;#39;t even just drive a couple of feet forward and scooch over. So I&amp;#39;m forced to drive a good 20-25 feet forward (well beyond the 2nd entrance for the gas station) where the curb is shallow enough that I can drive the car up over it, just in time for the ambulance to get by safely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So all&amp;#39;s well that ends well... except that now, the jerk in the SUV who has already made me miss my turn, thinks he&amp;#39;s going to gun his engine and drive around me (to my left this time) before I can pull back onto the street. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope. I&amp;#39;m not having it. I slam my car into reverse and back out into the street just enough that he can&amp;#39;t get around me (now the crowded lane to our left is working to my advantage). I&amp;#39;m briefly tempted leave it at that, but then Mr. King of the Road decides to lay on his horn, earning himself a further delay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So instead of driving around the block as originally planned, or even just up the street to where I can safely and legally make a U-turn, I decide that I&amp;#39;m going to just get my car turned around right then and there in the street. There&amp;#39;s enough room that I could make a 3-point turn pretty easily, but I summon my inner Austin Powers and decide to drag this out as long as I possibly can. I proceed to spend the next minute inching my car forward, putting it in reverse, inching backward, etc...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SUV guy is now furious and laying on his horn. But I&amp;#39;m in no hurry. As I complete my 3-point (really more of a 15 point turn) and am now parallel with him (but facing opposite directions) I can see that he&amp;#39;s hanging out his window and swearing up a storm. And that&amp;#39;s when I remember the windshield wiper. I hit the &amp;quot;sprayer&amp;quot; button and laugh hysterically as Mr. Tough guy retreats away from his open window before speeding off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#39;m in the westbound lane, I pull into the gas station, fill up my tank, park the car, grab a coffee, walk across the street to the restaurant and proceed to pick-up the best sandwich I&amp;#39;ve had in years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Throwaway account here.
