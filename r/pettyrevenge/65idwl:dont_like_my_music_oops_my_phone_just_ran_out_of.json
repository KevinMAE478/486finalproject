Friends, maybe the odd song here or there, but not an hour and a half of wall to wall new stuff.\n\nYou've missed the point with my highlighting of that song. OP has refused to mention what other music was played, but has a) posted a link to a song that categorically is not what 99% of people would class as indie and b) stated that they used \"indie\" to mean \"non-mainstream\". Therefore, the chances are that the \"indie\" songs chosen by OP, weren't, in fact, indie songs, and were most likely more in line with the non-mainstream \"freak folk\" of CocoRosie.\n\nOP has also stated that the \"adults\" did not care for music because they were talking, and the two that wanted to play music were OP and one of the girls. OP aligned the girls together, that makes it 2 to 1 for pop. OP has stated nothing but their own dislike for pop, but mentioned that their mother does not care for it so much, which at best makes it 2 for 2, but assuming she's not got the attitude of a 16 year old with a subscription to NME, she could probably tolerate pop music. That leaves the mother of the two girls, who by OP's own biased account, only liked a few of their songs out of the many played over the hour and a half period, and is very likely to have a taste, or at least tolerance for her own daughters' tastes.
