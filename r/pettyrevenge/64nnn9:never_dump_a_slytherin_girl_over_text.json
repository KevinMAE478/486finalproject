This took place just over two years ago in March 2015; I was 16 and my then-boyfriend, henceforth Ex, was 18. At this point we had been together in an LDR (lived an hour away from each other) for two and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some obligatory backstory: this took place during Ex&amp;#39;s senior year in high school and during my sophomore year. At the start of the year he was really busy preparing for college; he had an audition to his dream school, an esteemed music program, and took on a host of AP classes and extracurricular activities in a senior blitz to make him more appealing. Combined with our respective marching bands (easily takes up six days a week in our home state) and my own AP classes, we went from seeing each other at least twice a month to once every couple months, if we were lucky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of this should have cleared up by December of that year, but immediately after Ex&amp;#39;s audition and marching season came to a close, he took up the romantic lead in his school&amp;#39;s highly-competitive varsity theater group. This took up even more of his time, even getting to the point where he&amp;#39;d cancel dates last minute for &amp;quot;highly encouraged bonding time&amp;quot; with the rest of the cast. I felt unimportant and told him as such, recognizing that if he made time for me before he could damn well do it again. Unsurprisingly, nothing changed on his end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One Saturday in March, after another cancelled date, I was fed up. I called him and attempted to break up with him. I say &amp;quot;attempted&amp;quot; because immediately after the words left my mouth he broke down, begging me to give him another chance and reassuring me that the last of his theater competitions would conclude by month&amp;#39;s end. I agreed to give him one more chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then Monday morning rolls around. That week was slated to be incredibly stressful for me; midterms in honors classes, a band competition under a drill sergeant director, an AP history test that morning, and my learner&amp;#39;s permit test that afternoon. Right before my history test, I got a text from him: &amp;quot;I think we should just be friends.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cue all the rage my 16 year-old self could muster. He I knew I had this shit coming up yet dumped me, like this, not even 48 hours after I tried to dump him. After everything, I couldn&amp;#39;t let him by unharmed.So, I did some quick thinking. One major point of contention in our relationship was his attachment to his mother; she&amp;#39;s a nice woman, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, but she infantilized him at every turn and he was okay with it. It wasn&amp;#39;t quite an Oedipus/Jocasta dynamic, but damn was it too close for comfort. That being said, for all her faults, Ex&amp;#39;s mother had long since accepted me as the daughter she never had and treated me as such.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So right before my test, I pulled out my phone and shot her a quick text detailing the events of that Saturday night to this morning before turning off my phone. When I turned it on again, I had an apology text from Ex&amp;#39;s mother, several angry texts, missed calls, and voicemails from Ex himself, and a hilarious text from my own mother saying how proud of me she was because apparently Ex&amp;#39;s mother texted her as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to think that act finalized my transition from Ravenclaw to Slytherin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Selfish boyfriend dumped me over text at a bad time, I told his mother, he apparently got grounded and I got a justice boner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Alright y'all, time for a story of petty proportions.
