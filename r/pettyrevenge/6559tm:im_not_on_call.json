I&amp;#39;m a pharm tech at a well known pharmacy. I have a very full life but make it work with a hectic schedule. My avilabiltiy is 6am to 7pm m-th. I calculated it out and it came to around 53hours of availability during business hours. This is because my mother has copd and I help her with things she can&amp;#39;t do for herself. Grocery shopping, laundry and whatever she needs. Everything was fine until we get a new pharmacy manager. He has no idea how to do anything. The team is shocked at what he does. Misses ordering medications we need to fill orders multiple days in a row, jumping ship on the minute when his shift is over even when we are swamped and when it bleeds all the way into the weekend and Monday because we are trying to catch up gets mad. Just not a effective leader. \nNow on to what happened. My friend who was the closer 2pm-10pm took a way better offer with another company and left. No two week notice nothing. Its fine because she was getting crapped on with closing duties and all. I am asked by the pharm manager to work her shifts. Now I have always been a slave to my job in past circumstances but I&amp;#39;m trying to have a work life balance and not burn myself out. I notice after declining that instead of my 32-40 average hours I am only getting 8. Okkkk. Straight up retaliation but you know how retail is and as long as they can cover their butts with a reason I have no action. They say wellll their are no hours which is slightly true. Ok I&amp;#39;ll ride it out. Two weeks pass and the hours go back up. Eight hours still. I ask the manager why? &amp;quot;I only have hours for people who can close&amp;quot; which is complete bull because everyone else is a student and doesn&amp;#39;t close so I&amp;#39;m being punished. That&amp;#39;s ok because I&amp;#39;m Scandinavian and can hold a grudge for a looooong time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for the next puzzle piece, I run a cake business on the side. Its a hobby that I love but I don&amp;#39;t push it to make me insane money because it&amp;#39;s not what I want my career to be but I can stack up orders if I want. A key team member who is not great calls in last night. It&amp;#39;s ok were a good team we can hold it together until our time is up. As more and more people go home the pharmacy falls more and more behind. The pharmacy manager has nowhere to go. He&amp;#39;s the only one on duty and now has to fill AND approve because the closing tech has to handle counter and phone. This is where mistakes are made because a pharmacist should not be doing both. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;End of my shift comes and I say seeeee ya and leave. If he had been any other pharmacist I would have stayed and helped until they were less busy but nope you lost my loyalty. They were three hours till close with just the two of them. That brings us to 730 this morning. I get a text from pharmacy manager asking if I can come in for my regular shift I wasn&amp;#39;t scheduled for because same co-worker called in again 2nd day in a row. Hellllll noooooo. I&amp;#39;m not on call. You don&amp;#39;t schedule me as punishment or to force me into a closing shift availability fuck off. &amp;quot;No, you caught me on a day I have cake orders due.

But when it comes to grudges, Iceland for is where they act in stead of talking, historically. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have an uncle who&amp;#39;s the sweetest guy and has lived all his life here in Denmark. Sometimes, when he&amp;#39;s drunk, his Icelandic genes emerge. I remember him telling me when I was a teenager that if anyone ever really hurt or threatened me (I think physically was implied), he knew some people that could take care of them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My uncle&amp;#39;s a dentist and I guess he was talking about biker-related clients. It doesn&amp;#39;t seem likely that he would be able to put a hit on anyone but because he has Icelandic roots, I never doubted that he could and would do it for me if need be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone should have an uncle like that. Shit, I may not be Icelandic but I think I&amp;#39;ll tell my nieces and nephews the same thing - and figure out the practicalities after, if the situation should arise. With my kids, I guess, they know it&amp;#39;s understood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pettyrevenge", "name": "t1_dg895df", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492147546.0, "created_utc": 1492118746.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg83ygo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "muffinopolist", "parent_id": "t1_dg809c3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pettyrevenge", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Jesus I thought you guys were all happy and shit.
