She also loved picking on me and my best friend, Danny, at the bus stop. The one instance of her bullying I can remember most vividly was her chansing me around the Deer Head Tree (it&amp;#39;s a damn tree with a damn decaying deer head shoved into the large damn crack where the main two branches forked), and she was screaming &amp;quot;Danny and Synodicc sitting in a tree...&amp;quot;, until I was crying so badly that snot was sliding down my throat from my consistent sniffling as I ran away from her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we all eventually went to bed and Brittney made a comment about how I might piss myself in my sleep, so they all scootched away from me.
