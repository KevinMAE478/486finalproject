So we got a lot of spam at that job.  I came to work one morning to find my boss glaring at the monitor of the only computer in the office and clicking away.  He told me that he&amp;#39;d been trying to open an attachment to a very important message and had clicked it umpteen times.  He knew it was a very important message, although he had never seen the sender&amp;#39;s name before, because the header was &amp;quot;Very Important!  Please Open Soonest!&amp;quot;  The attachment was named &amp;quot;Vital Documents.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So anybody who knows anything about strange email attachments knows that what he was clicking on was probably really named &amp;quot;MineMyPersonalInfoAndMakeMySpeakersScreamLikeDavidLeeRoth.exe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh dear,&amp;quot; I said, and explained what he&amp;#39;d done.  Then I told him that because he&amp;#39;d clicked on the attachment umpteen times, I would have to use the special super deluxe version of our anti-virus software.  And it would take a while.  &amp;quot;How long?&amp;quot; he asked apprehensively.  &amp;quot;Oh...quite a while,&amp;quot; I said sadly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to the anti-virus software company&amp;#39;s website and started their free virus search-and-destroy service, which involved hooking the office PC up to their server.  Via dialup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, since the only computer in the office would be out of commission for most of the day...I went home.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that my salary at that job was a flat fee, regardless of unforeseen absences?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(He never did that again.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part the Second: Things got bad at that job.  Nonstop yelling, his only employee expected to perform the duties of two and a half employees on the pay and hours of one, the boss let assorted relatives and guests basically come in and sit around all day bothering me (it was a home office), his own wife and child actually had a conversation &lt;em&gt;directly behind me&lt;/em&gt; about how bad he was getting...so I left.  Knowing that after four years(!) of trying to train this guy in the basics he was still a compu-twit, I made a sweet little employee handbook for the next person, in which I explained the duties and expectations of the job in language my boss wanted me to use.  I separated every section of the handbook with lines of pretty Wingdings.  This is a font, for those who don&amp;#39;t know, that produces flowers and stars and ickle birdies, all the size of a letter.  A font, mind you.  Meaning, you push the letter A and get one picture, push B and get another, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are hired to do a job that requires a hell of a lot of typing, and you notice that the Wingdings typographical ornaments don&amp;#39;t follow a regular pattern, sooner or later you&amp;#39;ll idly open the copy of the employee handbook that&amp;#39;s in the computer and change the font to something in which pushing A gets you a letter A and so forth, to see if anything appears.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Liiiiike a line-by-line summary of what it was really like to work in that office.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Part the First: This was back in the dinosaur days when Hotmail was da bomb and email filtering was...not super duper.
