Most IBC based aquaponics only run once an hour for 15 minutes to treat a fully stocked 220g tank. It would filter your tank in ten minutes on a normal full stock (if my math is correct). If you ran the pump the whole hour, you could filter an 880g fully stocked tank. No retail canister filter can match that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The swirl filter would be a massive amount of physical waste removal, but wouldn&amp;#39;t work with a sand bottom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And i thought you were breeding, so I thought a utility build would be fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: an IBC isn&amp;#39;t double the size of your fish tank btw. Parents grow bed is about 36x48x6 inches, so ~10,000 cubic inches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re right, it&amp;#39;s ugly. But if you&amp;#39;re breeding, you&amp;#39;d need capacity without water changes.
