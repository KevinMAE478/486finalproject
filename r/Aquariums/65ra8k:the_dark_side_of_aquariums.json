I've been tracking her diatribe for a decade now.  She relies on appealing to emotions (still clinging to the \"found bag incident\" and PetCo photos) to convince the public that marine aquariums are evil/wrong/bad.\n\nThe fact is Hawaiian fisheries are highly regulated and data shows that aquarium collection is sustainable. Dozens of scientists have provided Hawaii's DNLR (the governing body for their fisheries) with ample evidence that the aquarium hobby is sustainable, and they have continually ruled as such year after year. \n\nThere are multiple contributors and stakeholders to Hawaii's fisheries, and the marine ornamental hobby is dwarfed by such anthropogenic pressures as climate change, commercial fishery, and tourism (which Rene and her Hawaiian compatriot, \"Snorkel Bob\" support). But instead of addressing any of these factors, Rene has persisted with her campaign of misinformation to turn people specifically against the aquarium hobby. \n\nTo end on a positive and constructive note, Rising Tide Conservation has made tremendous progress with marine fish aquaculture (e.g. commercially viable captive-bred yellow tangs!). Their efforts are made possible by a collaboration between universities, public aquariums, aquarists, and aquarium companies.
