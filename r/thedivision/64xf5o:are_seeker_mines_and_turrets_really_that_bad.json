As long as it is not a glitch, nothing is ever &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; or against the rule in this game&amp;#39;s PVP. That is how the game is designed. However, that is not to say that teams running 3 seekers/3 turrets are not annoying. What&amp;#39;s worse is those teams typically talk trash and play the most cancerous way. They get a lvl 1 or 2 timer, then run and drop turrets and go all the way to DZ 9.  Or they camp DZ 2 ladder.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like the BFB era. Personally, when I was starting out in this game it was the BFB era and for the longest time I was against it. Then I went from 75 to 99 in like a week of abusing BFB with a team of 4 BFBs. It took very little skill, and it was not very satisfying to get kills.
