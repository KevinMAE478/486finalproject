What i don&amp;#39;t have i try to buy from the vendors and if the vendors don&amp;#39;t have i go out and grind for it until i have it. I think that&amp;#39;s a nice grind-circle as it is thus far.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thedivision", "name": "t1_dg5xqdk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492036311.0, "created_utc": 1492007511.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xiqd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ydqw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ycbl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Coilspun", "parent_id": "t3_64ydqw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thedivision", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nice idea, but I just don't think we'll ever see it, or it'll be feasible.\n  \nI swear in the alpha stages, something like this was mentioned - the black market specifically.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice idea, but I just don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;ll ever see it, or it&amp;#39;ll be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I swear in the alpha stages, something like this was mentioned - the black market specifically.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thedivision", "name": "t1_dg5ycbl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492037022.0, "created_utc": 1492008222.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xiqd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ydqw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6djni", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Deadlyknights79", "parent_id": "t3_64ydqw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thedivision", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Blizzard tried something like this in Diablo 3 with the RMAH and it was a bad idea from the start\n\nGranted, I made $250(cdn) selling crap greens between level 30-40 in the first two months", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blizzard tried something like this in Diablo 3 with the RMAH and it was a bad idea from the start&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Granted, I made $250(cdn) selling crap greens between level 30-40 in the first two months&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thedivision", "name": "t1_dg6djni", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492052998.0, "created_utc": 1492024198.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xiqd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ydqw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ura8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lonertastic", "parent_id": "t3_64ydqw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thedivision", "controversiality": 0, "body": "ye its not like loot is raining...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ye its not like loot is raining...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thedivision", "name": "t1_dg6ura8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492072788.0, "created_utc": 1492043988.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xiqd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ydqw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg759ew", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SenorGooseHogg", "parent_id": "t3_64ydqw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thedivision", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I just hate the feeling of throwing or getting rid of gear that's just a small difference in numbers.
