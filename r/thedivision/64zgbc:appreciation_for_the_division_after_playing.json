The relics also brought another level of building. Even without exotics though, in TD, I felt the division had more for me to mess around with.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Destiny&amp;#39;s infusion system and fewer layers of RNG made looting a far less punishing experience than looting in TD. 95% of what we get now is sold or deconstructed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still thoroughly enjoyed the game and pushed to 400LL, but fell off after all the content I had yet to experience required 5 other friends or players. It just wasn&amp;#39;t convenient for me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Destiny is old enough to the point where they pass exotics out like hot cakes so players can experiment with all the different styles of play. TD is still a carrot on a stick since exotics are new, but we&amp;#39;ll get there. Building itself is a skill and experience of its own in looters, and after a few months I felt like I wasn&amp;#39;t behind in Destiny and got to experience the extent of what was available to me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end though comparing them only goes so far. There are many things that each of them excel at in terms of RPG design over the other. One is third person and the other is first person. PvE and PvP are totally different experiences in both. They&amp;#39;re both looters but are played and set up totally differently.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite things about destiny are the social spaces, bounties, patrol, and the fact there&amp;#39;s a PvE playlist. It also scratched that halo itch I&amp;#39;ve had since 5th grade without actually being halo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thedivision", "name": "t1_dg69xw3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492049284.0, "created_utc": 1492020484.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 37}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xiqd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zgbc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xiqd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zgbc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7az6m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DrBamBam420", "parent_id": "t1_dg69csn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thedivision", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The pvp works in destiny compared to the 1 dimensional division pvp or chicken dance explosions.
