In optimal situations the MDR can headshot for over 300k, but that is so limited situationally that it&amp;#39;s not constantly viable. Is it a fun gun to use in those situations? Absolutely. Do those situations arise consistently often? No. M4 and M700 still rule the day, especially in Legendary missions where the ads deal so much burst damage and you need to stay in cover. I&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s worth grinding to add the MDR to your collection, it&amp;#39;s a nice tool to have in the kit, but by no means will it make or break your success or enjoyment of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thedivision", "name": "t1_dg9249t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492201027.0, "created_utc": 1492172227.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xiqd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6597bt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg93h91", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "strizzl", "parent_id": "t3_6597bt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thedivision", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This was always the thing that provoked so much anxiety in MMOs... fighting for that 1% status.
