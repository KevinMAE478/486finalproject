Made it to the third, where some solo decided he deserved teh box.  My buddy yells in voip &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t&amp;quot; but he kept going.  80 second rogue because people are stupid.  oh well. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thedivision", "name": "t1_dge05le", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492487156.0, "created_utc": 1492458356.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xiqd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wi5b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdtm2p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Skull_Trust", "parent_id": "t3_65wi5b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thedivision", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Typical PVE player in the DZ...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typical PVE player in the DZ...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thedivision", "name": "t1_dgdtm2p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492479800.0, "created_utc": 1492451000.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xiqd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wi5b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xiqd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wi5b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeaq84", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Scyoboon", "parent_id": "t1_dge7tmk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thedivision", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They don't call him The M'Edge for nothing.
