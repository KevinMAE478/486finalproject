I don't think any Incursion is fun all the way through so I don't play them and nothing I say can be applied to Heroic difficulty setting.\n\n* Solo or Group Hard and lower... this is totally doable.  Enemies may be overly accurate but these are not difficult missions and even 100% enemy accuracy doesn't make them difficult.  All game mechanics can be ignored and you still have success.\n\n* Solo Challenging... is challenging imo but not overly difficult.  It requires above average (they don't call it \"normal\" for a reason) skills and an understanding of the game to complete.  In this stage, I can see enemy accuracy making things extra difficult.\n\n* Group Challenging... is only marginally harder than Hard or lower.  Enemy accuracy is not an issue here.  You need to know something about the game but nobody needs to be an expert.  These will only be hard if everybody knows nothing.  If there are some people at least trying to use the cover system and trying to play smart (not even succeeding, just the attempt at playing smart will keep you in safe scenarios and make these very doable) then you can do these with like 80% run and gun tactics.\n\n* Solo Legendary... Massive said these were made solely for groups but that they wouldn't require 4 person matchmaking for those who were a glutton for punishment or seeking a skill challenge that is unbalanced.  It's not fair for any configuration other than a 4 man group to complain about difficulty in this mode imo given what Massive said their intention was.\n\n* Group Legendary... this was supposed to be for well coordinated players in teams of 4.  Enemies don't really feel overly accurate imo but I have a LMG and I try to suppress people.  Suppression is the answer to this.  It makes enemies sit in cover and not attack your group for multiple seconds.  It can take snipers completely out of a fight.  \n\nI believe there are many different builds and approaches people can take in this game but when it comes to using the built in mechanics vs ignoring them, I think there is an undeniable right way and a wrong way.  For everything but Legendary, you can play the wrong way and not really have issues.  Legendary requires you to play the right way.\n\nEnemies may be overly accurate but that's because when they made the game they built in a system to negate it and integrated it into the game in a very core and functional way.  It takes nothing fancy to pull off, no special equipment or special builds.  You just have to recognize situations where you need it and then act on that need.\n\nOutside of solo challenging, there's no situation imo where enemy accuracy is something that can't be dealt with and makes the game unfairly difficult as a result.", "edited": 1492342729.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s my thoughts.
