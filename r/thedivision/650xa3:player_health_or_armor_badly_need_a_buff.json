But you can't spec into all 3. You have to pick only 2 to be most effective.\n\nSo you pick DPS+HEALTH, but your skills suffer and you have to rely on team mates to heal you.\n\nOr you pick DPS + SKILLS and you have to spec your skills into skill haste so you can spam skills and help heal your limited health.\n\nOr go with HEALTH + SKILLS and have to use cover + distance to deal damage and suffer being able to have VERY fast encounters since you're dependent on skill recharge rates.\n\nEither way, you can pick whatever type of gameplay you want. And the fact that it's all gear based you can switch from one to the other as quickly as equipping gear and changing out talents. There's no penalty for going one route like in other RPG games.\n\nSo we're in a good place. We just can't be 100% amazing at all 3 since the 1.6 update and that's actually a good thing. But for players just getting into 1.6, I admit, it's a bit of a shock the amount of damage you take now.
