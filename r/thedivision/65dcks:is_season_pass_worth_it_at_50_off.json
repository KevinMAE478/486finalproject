It isn't a true PVP-only mode, and it is entirely possible for one to four people to play entirely PVE-only in Last Stand if they just tackle a landmark and kill AI and no players from the other team come near them... Anyway, it's a sort of domination game type---three bases to hold to gain points towards the victory, two teams vying for supremacy and some AI to keep things chaotic...

You can join the game mode alone or as a group; either way, once the game starts, you'll find yourself in a group, and at the end of the game, if you exit the mode, you'll be removed from whatever group you were in, whether you all exitted at the same time or not, so it may be necessary for you to reorganize and regroup if you intend to go on/resume playing with friends.\n\n\nSurvival is another game mode that some people swear by. You get sent in with garbage gear, have to scavenge for supplies and gear in terrible conditions (weather, freezing cold, sickness) to try and complete a mission... If you make it out alive and achieve the objective, you get rewarded pretty well. It can take some getting used to, but, like I said, some folks love it. You can start this game mode up alone or in a group, of whatever size; at the start, the group will be split up and can either wander the map separately, or can decide on a rally point and regroup to carry on the compromised mission together...it can be easier to scavenge if everyone wanders alone, but if you and your group share effectively, communicate well, and work together, it is entirely possible to play as a coordinated team. At the end, you will face some tough enemies, so you may find it easier to work together there, at least---or not; that's for you and your friends to decide.\n\n\nThe Underground is a bit more niche...

The areas you'll pass through are somewhat randomly generated, from a selection of different cells with some additional variation in the form of scenery items that can be changed out...there are lots of place-holder items that can be identified, or their spots could be populated by resource items like backpacks and toolboxes, instead. If you intend to try and play this any other way than solo, it will be hugely beneficial for you to be aware of a few things... Matchmaking is unreliable and spotty at best, so forget that; your best bet will be to take things into your hands, and do things manually... What I mean by that is, either put together a group of friends, or use a third-party matchmaking/looking-for-group system to find people, or wander around the pre-mission area and invite players you see there---or, better yet, send them messages, see if they have a group, if they need a group, if they're looking for people to play Underground with...those sorts of \"hands-on, my-own-doing\" measures. The Underground is good for team-play, especially teams of different builds... Having someone with pulse, someone with a turret, someone with a support station---you get the idea.
