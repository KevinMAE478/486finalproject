I'd like to see a series of interactive ebooks focused around the great theorems and their proofs.\n\nThe way these would work is that when you first open them, they present the theorem and its proof in the form that it would be presented in a treatise written by an expert in the relevant field that is targeted at other professional mathematicians working in that field.\n\nAt any step in the presentation, the reader could ask to expand that step. There would be two different kinds of expansion available for each step.\n\nThe first kind gives more detail. When you do a \"more detail\" expansion on a step in the proof, it would fill in intermediate steps that had been omitted. For example, if a step said to pick some value x such that some function f(x) = 0, and you asked for more detail it might tell you that we know that f has a zero by the intermediate value theorem. If you ask for more detail again, it might explicitly show you a point where f &lt; 0 and a point where f &gt; 0, and tell you that f is continuous so that the intermediate value theorem applies. Asking for more detail again might show you a proof that f is continuous in the relevant interval.\n\nThe \"more detail\" expansion is for when you know everything being used in a step of the proof (concepts, definitions, theorems) but just aren't seeing the reasoning that gets from A to B at that place, and so need it to be more explicit.\n\nThe second kind of expansion is for when you need help with the concepts, definitions, or theorems that are being used. A \"explain prerequisite\" expansion goes over the things that this step of the proof is using. For example, suppose a step of the proof requires choosing an x that maximizes f(x) on a particular interval. You've expanded detail and been told to choose x so that f'(x) = 0. Further detail expansion there would go over the requirements for that to work. But suppose you haven't had differential calculus. You don't know about derivatives.\n\nAn \"explain prerequisites\" expansion at that point would teach you about derivatives and their use in finding extreme values of functions.\n\nBoth \"more detail\" and \"explain prerequisites\" should work both at the top level and within things that are revealed by applying either type of expansion, even after multiple applications.\n\nIt should be possible to \"explain prerequisites\" all the way down to high school mathematics.\n\nEach ebook is, in a sense, a complete course in mathematics from high school to working mathematician level except it omits everything that you do not need if all you need to do is prove that one theorem.\n\nIt would be really interesting to do a series of such ebooks, choosing the theorems so that the combined expanded prerequisites spans most of what is covered in a normal bachelor's or master's degree program.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discussion reminds me of something I&amp;#39;ve long wanted in mathematics eduction. I&amp;#39;d like to see a series of interactive ebooks focused around the great theorems and their proofs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way these would work is that when you first open them, they present the theorem and its proof in the form that it would be presented in a treatise written by an expert in the relevant field that is targeted at other professional mathematicians working in that field.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At any step in the presentation, the reader could ask to expand that step. There would be two different kinds of expansion available for each step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first kind gives more detail. When you do a &amp;quot;more detail&amp;quot; expansion on a step in the proof, it would fill in intermediate steps that had been omitted. For example, if a step said to pick some value x such that some function f(x) = 0, and you asked for more detail it might tell you that we know that f has a zero by the intermediate value theorem. If you ask for more detail again, it might explicitly show you a point where f &amp;lt; 0 and a point where f &amp;gt; 0, and tell you that f is continuous so that the intermediate value theorem applies. Asking for more detail again might show you a proof that f is continuous in the relevant interval.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;more detail&amp;quot; expansion is for when you know everything being used in a step of the proof (concepts, definitions, theorems) but just aren&amp;#39;t seeing the reasoning that gets from A to B at that place, and so need it to be more explicit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second kind of expansion is for when you need help with the concepts, definitions, or theorems that are being used. A &amp;quot;explain prerequisite&amp;quot; expansion goes over the things that this step of the proof is using. For example, suppose a step of the proof requires choosing an x that maximizes f(x) on a particular interval. You&amp;#39;ve expanded detail and been told to choose x so that f&amp;#39;(x) = 0. Further detail expansion there would go over the requirements for that to work. But suppose you haven&amp;#39;t had differential calculus.
