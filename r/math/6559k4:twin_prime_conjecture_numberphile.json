How does it not contradict the prime number theorem? If the nth prime is approximately nlog(n), then the limit to infinity of p(n+1)-p(n) is equal to the limit to infinity of (n+1)log(n+1)-nlog(n) which is unbounded, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean I understand what it is the guy proved... it&amp;#39;s just that the statement shown seems to be saying something completely different.
