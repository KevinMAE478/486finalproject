Okay, so you have to check and see all the people Bobby blames, and then send an Andy arrow towards all them as well. But maybe after blaming some folk, Bobby says \"I trust Carol.\" Now, the people that Bobby blames depends on Carol's list of blames, but also Andy's blames also depend on Carol. You can imagine with the trust feature, keeping track of the blame relations you have already put in is massively helpful. One way you could deal with this is as follows: whenever U trusts V, put a grey arrow from U to V. Also put in all the deterministic arrows (\"Sam blames Jan\") in as you go. At the end, after you have all the deterministic arrows, you'll also have a gray arrow subgraph. You want to take the *transitive closure* of this subgraph. That is, for each X, Y, and Z, if X trusts Y and Y trusts Z, then X trusts Z. There are easy algorithms for computing the transitive closure. Now we look at a person, say Andy again, and make sure that they blame every person who is being  blamed by someone in their grey neighborhood (greyborhood?). You should only have to do this once, because let's say Andy blames someone new from his trust network, and Sasha  trusts Andy, then the people in Andy's trust network are also in Sasha's trust network.
