The second semester has been almost completely measure theory, which I actually really enjoy.). But my professor knows he&amp;#39;s brutal (one of those who always covers those &amp;quot;additional topics&amp;quot; that other professors would likely skip), so he&amp;#39;s very lenient and rewarding if you perform well on homework sets. I have NEVER covered so much material in one course though---I can&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;ve ever &amp;quot;successfully&amp;quot; studied for any of his exams because there is just too much to know, but I do feel that I am capable of writing great analytical proofs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my experience, both classes have taught me to never be afraid of a math course even if you have no idea what is going on in lectures. If you spend time outside of class to learn the material, you will eventually get it, or at least get &amp;quot;enough&amp;quot; of it to grow and learn the subject. Thousands of people have learned it before, so why can&amp;#39;t you?

But I've since learned a lot more about it and I'm planning on making it my research area.\n\nIt's in some sense one of the most basic types of math. You're asking questions about the integers, often positive integers, which are the numbers all of us learned about back in grade school. So you have all these questions which are relatable and understandable even if you told them to a third grader. But the answers oftentimes involve really powerful and difficult machinery. And all of these questions really arise naturally through the \"obvious\" questions you might ask about the objects involved.\n\nHere's an example: Back around middle school or so you probably learned about the Pythagorean Theorem (and its converse). If a, b, c are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, c the longest side, then a^2 + b^2 = c^2 if and only if it's a right triangle. Then as an example your teacher probably pointed out that you can build a right triangle with sides length 3, 4, and 5. Because 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^(2).\n\nOkay, that seems pretty special. They're all whole numbers. We call integer solutions to this equation Pythagorean Triples. Are there more like that? Sure, if you multiply all three of them by two, you'll find that 6^2 + 8^2 = 10^(2). And in fact it shouldn't be hard to convince yourself that whenever x^2 + y^2 = z^(2), we also have (kx)^2 + (ky)^2 = (kz)^2 for integers k.\n\nBut this feels like cheating. This isn't a \"real\" new solution. You just used the old solution to make it. So this brings up the new question: if we assume all three numbers aren't divisible by any of the three numbers, are there more integer solutions to x^2 + y^2 = z^2? Solutions without common factors like this are called primitive Pythagorean triples.\n\nWell you can check a few more numbers and the next one you'll find is probably 5, 12, 13. And if you keep checking numbers you'll find more. But then, if you're really inquisitive, you'll probably wonder whether you can find all of them.\n\nThere's two was in which you could \"find\" all of them. Maybe there are only finitely many of them. Then you could point out what all of them are, prove there are no more of them, and you really would have found all of them. Alternatively, you could prove there are infinitely many of them, but find a description or formula that describes all of them. We've done the latter.\n\nIt turns out all of the primitive Pythagorean triples can be found by taking two integers m, n, with no common factors, and only one of them even, and setting x = m^2 - n^2, y = 2mn, and z = m^2 + n^2.\n\nYou can check yourself that this is a solution, and with a little work you can show that it's a primitive solution. It takes a little more work to show that these are the only solutions.\n\nIt was proven a long time ago, by Euler I think, that these are the only solutions. But I think the most natural way to prove it involves passing over to the complex plane. You might notice that in the formula, the numbers involved look an awful lot like real and imaginary parts of numbers multiplied and that's not a coincidence.\n\nSo this was a bit of a ramble, but basically number theory has really understandable questions that have difficult solutions which almost always prompts further natural questions, and it connects a whole lot of math together in really magical ways.
