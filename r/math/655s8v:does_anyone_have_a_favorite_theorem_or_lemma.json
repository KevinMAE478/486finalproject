Rather than taking a geometric object and associating to it an algebraic object, as in classical algebraic geometry, he turned this paradigm on its head.  Given a commutative ring R, Grothendieck defined a geometric object (an affine scheme) Spec(R).  The points of the space Spec(R) are exactly the prime ideals of R, similar to the correspondence in the Nullstellensatz.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "math", "name": "t1_dg8isol", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492160330.0, "created_utc": 1492131530.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655s8v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655s8v", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg91xup", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TezlaKoil", "parent_id": "t1_dg8q7ua", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/math", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You may enjoy reading [The Blind Spot](http://www.ems-ph.org/books/book.php?proj_nr=136).", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may enjoy reading &lt;a href=\"http://www.ems-ph.org/books/book.php?proj_nr=136\"&gt;The Blind Spot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "math", "name": "t1_dg91xup", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492200640.0, "created_utc": 1492171840.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8q7ua", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danisson", "parent_id": "t3_655s8v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/math", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The [Hauptsatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-elimination_theorem) aka Cut-elimination for First-order logic.\n\nEverytime I see this theorem being discussed, I feel like there's a new/different insight I can get about proof theory, intuitionistic and classical logic.\n\nI wish I could have a great understanding of it, both formal (as in, the actual proof) and informal (on its relation to the rest of proof theory, computation and other logics).", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-elimination_theorem\"&gt;Hauptsatz&lt;/a&gt; aka Cut-elimination for First-order logic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everytime I see this theorem being discussed, I feel like there&amp;#39;s a new/different insight I can get about proof theory, intuitionistic and classical logic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could have a great understanding of it, both formal (as in, the actual proof) and informal (on its relation to the rest of proof theory, computation and other logics).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "math", "name": "t1_dg8q7ua", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492171125.0, "created_utc": 1492142325.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655s8v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655s8v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655s8v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655s8v", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7t7qf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sleeps_with_crazy", "parent_id": "t1_dg7rq5j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/math", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There are certainly divergent alternating series, though you are correct that if the terms are decreasing then alternating series converge.
