The constructivist school seems to object to taking things like LEM and Choice as given, but at least we know those are independent of the rest.  It seems to me that appealing to not being worried about impractically long proofs is potentially asking for a lot of trouble since we don't actually know whether impractically long is genuinely longer than other things.\n\n&gt;In any case, the philosophical position where you declare yourself committed to explicit construction, assert an antinomy in classical mathematics, and then don't produce aforementioned antinomy is a bit fishy. When you also do math with what's effectively lazy Cauchy sequences and then sneer at people for using theories with infinite models, though, you've just failed.

I was probably the only one to dabble in this, but then again nobody else from other theoretical orientations works on that much either - HOD is almost as protean as V and guards its secrets closely.\n\nNow you're venturing pretty far away from what I know much about, but isn't it consistent with the usual formulations that V=HOD?

If someone comes along and proves e.g. P \u2260 NP then this whole notion would be on much firmer ground, at least in my opinion.  The constructivist school seems to object to taking things like LEM and Choice as given, but at least we know those are independent of the rest.

He rants and raves but doesn&amp;#39;t actually produce anything to back up his claims, but instead makes absurd claims about e.g. resolving Goldbach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should take this point with the person who I initially responded to, seeing as I immediately pointed out that if we want to discuss ultrafinitism then Zeilberger would be a far better person to link than Wildberger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I did a trifle of research on nontrivial elementary embeddings j:HOD-&amp;gt;HOD from an ultrafinist perspective, by the way.
