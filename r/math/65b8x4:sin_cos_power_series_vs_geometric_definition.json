You might note that Prof. Gowers made an addendum to the article with a simpler argument, so I'll explain the simpler approach. (I've been wanting to work this out anyway.) \n\nGEOMETRIC DEFINITION OF COSINE FROM POWER SERIES DEFINITION    \n\nLet's say we've defined cosine via its power series, and we want to show that this implies the usual geometric interpretation, namely that cos(theta) is the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle that corresponds to an angle theta in standard position.\n\nTo bridge the gap between the analytical and geometric interpretations, we'll use two ideas: an analytical definition of angle measure and the Pythagorean identity cos^2 (x) + sin^2 (x)=1. Here's how.\n\nI. Recall that the radian measure of an angle is defined to be the length of the arc in the unit circle subtended by that angle (for example, the reason there are 2pi radians in the circle is that this is the circumference of the unit circle).\n\nII. So, an angle can be calculated as an arclength, and fortunately, arclength can be defined analytically via the usual integral formula learned in calculus (much of Gowers's post is a justification of this formula). \n\nIII. To calculate an angle measure theta as an arclength, we'll start by parametrizing the corresponding arc along the unit circle. Prof. Gower's explains two ways to do this, but here is the simpler way. Choose a point on the unit circle, say P(x,y), and suppose it's on the top half of the circle for simplicity. Parametrize the arc starting at (1,0) and going around counterclockwise to P in the usual way, i.e. using f(t)=(cos(t),sin(t)), where t ranges from 0 to arccos(x). A few explanatory points are in order here.\n\n* It can be shown from the power series that cos(x) is decreases from 1 to -1 on [0,pi], so it's one-to-one and has a well-defined inverse arccos(x).\n\n* It might appear at first glance that the parametrization makes use of the geometric interpretation of the trig functions, thus making our reasoning circular, but we can sidestep this issue with the Pythagorean identity cos^2 (x) + sin^2 (x) = 1, which can be verified analytically from the power series definitions (see the footnote), and it tells us geometrically that the point (cos(x),sin(x)) lies on the unit circle, which is what we need.\n\nIV. We can now apply the standard integral formula for the arclength of a parametric curve, namely the integral from a to b of sqrt(x'(t)^2 +y'(t)^2 ) with respect to t. A very short calculation shows that this works out to equal arccos(x).\n\nV. Finally, having shown that the angle theta equals arccos(x), we can conclude that cos(theta)=x, as desired. Boom!\n\nFOOTNOTE (verification of the Pythagorean identity): this can be verified directly from the power series definitions, or, since the derivative formulas are easily obtained from the power series definitions, we can differentiate cos^2 (x)+sin^2 (x) to get 0, conclude cos^2 (x)+sin^2 (x) must be constant, and then plug in 0 to the power series definitions to determine that this constant is 1. **EDIT:** formatting, wording, typo", "edited": 1492241943.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;AN ANSWER TO YOUR LAST QUESTION&lt;br/&gt;\nTimothy Gowers (a Fields Medalist) wrote up an &lt;a href=\"https://gowers.wordpress.com/2014/03/02/how-do-the-power-series-definitions-of-sin-and-cos-relate-to-their-geometrical-interpretations/\"&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; to your last question (&amp;quot;How can you derive the geometric interpretation from the power series ?&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to read his article myself, actually.
