Decks of cards provide plenty of examples. Stud poker especially.  Alice is showing a pair of queens. Bob has a queen in the hole. Carl hasn&amp;#39;t got any queens. Alice&amp;#39;s probability that she has three of a kind is (approximately, given that she could be in error) 0 or 1, depending; Bob&amp;#39;s probability of Alice having three of a kind is lower than Carl&amp;#39;s probability of Alice having three of a kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "math", "name": "t1_dg6oy28", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492065641.0, "created_utc": 1492036841.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg682lm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bowtochris", "parent_id": "t1_dg63j2q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/math", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;

Students are less likely to rely on guessing, both in in their studies and on their assessments.  Further, they have greater incentive to actually delve into concepts rather than just memorizing a surface level algoriththm, since any effort they put in to doing so gives a clear, tangible payoff.  Finally, it forces them to evaluate their level of knowledge on each topic, something that a large number of underperforming maths students otherwise just don&amp;#39;t do. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "math", "name": "t1_dg726si", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492082111.0, "created_utc": 1492053311.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5yvcu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anonemouse2010", "parent_id": "t3_64y8uq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/math", "controversiality": 1, "body": "What was left out from the list is that it is also assessing your confidence level.
