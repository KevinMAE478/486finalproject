It says, more or less, that whenever there is a discrete (noncontinuous) group of symmetries of a nice metric space (which is &amp;quot;roughly transitive&amp;quot;), that metric space has a geometric structure roughly similar to that of the group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, the group Z (of integers) acts on the real line by having 1 (from Z) shift everything one unit right. We conclude Z,R are &amp;quot;roughly similar&amp;quot;. There are some very nice applications once you know a little topology and large-scale geometry: we can approximate complicated but symmetric spaces by their symmetries, in a sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, mostly it simplifies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "math", "name": "t1_dgec1yj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492501618.0, "created_utc": 1492472818.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x7h7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgehggc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "intronert", "parent_id": "t3_65x7h7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/math", "controversiality": 0, "body": "For a very basic, but pleasing, discussion, I will say that I enjoyed this 24 min video: [3Blue1Brown - \"Euler's formula with introductory group theory\"] (https://youtu.be/mvmuCPvRoWQ)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a very basic, but pleasing, discussion, I will say that I enjoyed this 24 min video: &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/mvmuCPvRoWQ\"&gt;3Blue1Brown - &amp;quot;Euler&amp;#39;s formula with introductory group theory&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "math", "name": "t1_dgehggc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492508406.0, "created_utc": 1492479606.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x7h7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgej1fn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GelfandFomin", "parent_id": "t3_65x7h7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/math", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We used group theory in dynamical systems when discussing flows", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used group theory in dynamical systems when discussing flows&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "math", "name": "t1_dgej1fn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492510274.0, "created_utc": 1492481474.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
