I have already modelled my SEM and I am analyzing the results with AMOS 21. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To validate my results I would like to use different fit indices such as SRMR, RMSEA, CFI, AGFI, CMIN/DF etc, but I have some troubles here. Let me try to explain it with my limited english skills:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) I have 3 different groups (App1, App2 and App3), so if I calculate my estimates, I will get different fit indices for each group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) I could also make a multiple-group analysis with AMOS and calculate some fit indices here aswell.

If I am planning to use &amp;quot;modification indices&amp;quot;, I have to look at the estimates, pick the highest etc. etc., but they are different in each group. I am not sure which one to pick here. In Group A they might be very high, but in Group B they are very low. I don&amp;#39;t want to screw up the results here, but it is also neccesary to improve my fit indices (CFI is a little bit too low with 0,84 and AGFI with 0,7 :/ )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI have already tried out /r/mathhelp but they couldn't really help me out.
