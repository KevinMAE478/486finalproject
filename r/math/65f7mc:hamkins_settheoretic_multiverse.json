I think it's not hard to motivate the idea that there isn't an absolute notion of set. Even if we ultimately think that view fails, it's still a natural thing to think about and it has a lot of attractive features. But giving up an absolute notion of finiteness means giving up a lot. For instance, it seems to undermine the idea that there is an absolute notion of proof, as models with different \u03c9s can disagree about provability; one might think ZFC proves 0 = 1 while another thinks it doesn't.
