[Linear recurrence relations can be solved in a manner very similar to Linear DE's](https://math.berkeley.edu/~arash/55/8_2.pdf).  Unfortunately you do not have a linear recurrence relation but you are correct to notice a connection to DE.  Recurrence relations are basically DE's for sequences.  \n\nE.g. suppose you have a sequence f(n), i.e. a function f:N--&gt;R where N is the natural numbers and R is the real numbers numbers.  Let Seq(R) denote all such functions.  Just as you have differential operator on certain classes of functions, you have a \"differential\" (sort of, it doesn't satisfy Liepniz so probably doesn't deserve to be called differential) operator  D:Seq(R)--&gt;Seq(R) given by D(f)(n):=f(n+1).  (AKA the \"shift\" operator on sequences).  You can check that D is linear (ala the derivative).  \n\nNow it turns out that if you form the [exponential generating function associated to f(n)](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall04/cos341/exponential_generating_functions4.pdf), let's call it Exp(f,x) then f is a solution to a RR iff Exp(f,x) is a solution to the corresponding DE. (EDIT: I know this works in linear case, not sure for non-linear)\n\nFor example, if you have the RR a(n+2)=a(n+1)+a(n) (Fibonacci) think of this as \n\nD^2 (f) = D(f) + f\n\nThis has as a DE version \n\ny''=y'+y\n\nSuppose you solve the latter with a power series of the form \n\ny(t) = Sum a_n/n! x^n \n\nthen the a_n = f(n).  So you can get a solution to your RR by solving a DE. Perhaps this is where you solution comes from.  \n\nAnyway this and more is probably in the bible of generating functions Wilf's [generatingfunctionology](https://www.math.upenn.edu/%7Ewilf/DownldGF.html)\n\nEDIT: your RR gives the DE y' = 1/2*(y-P/y), maple solves this as y(t) = +- sqrt(C*exp(t) - p), you might try looking at the Taylor series of this and seeing if it matches what you've got.
