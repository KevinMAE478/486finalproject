If we can show that R=T, then the modularity of elliptic curves follows (after doing some tricks to ensure that we can apply this to elliptic curves), and so Fermat's Last Theorem follows from Ribet's Theorem.\n\nThere is a natural map R-&gt;T that is a surjection, so we just need to show that it is an injection. We want to do this via a counting argument, showing there isn't enough room in R for it to *not* be a injection. The issue is that R and T are huge. R is isomorphic to power series rings in many variables over complete local rings, so pretty big. So to prove this using a counting argument, we break up R and T into a filter of smaller rings R*_S_* and T*_S_*, where S is a finite set of primes. R*_S_* parameterizes representations that behave nice at primes outside S, and T*_S_* parameterizes modular forms whose conductor divides a number created from the primes in S. Since every representation is only bad at finitely many primes, and every modular form has conductor that divides one of these numbers, it follows that R*_S_* and T*_S_* filter the whole of R and T respectively. So we just need to show that R*_S_*=T*_S_*, for every finite set of primes S.
