Repeat and Use several times through the day.\n* Word Association Exercises.  Have a stack of words available.  pick one out of the stack.  Write down the first 5 or 10 words that come to mind when you see that card.  **Bicycle**.  skinny tires, white stripes, the hill, hairspray, garage sale, train tracks, swarms, Tour de France. \n* I'm not sure what's really on the other end of this search, but I'd also [google around for comparable searches](https://www.google.com/search?q=vocabulary+expansion+exercises&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8).  I'm sure folks have come up with plans/ideas about this.\n*  And there's always your [classic Vocabulary Flashcards](https://www.google.com/#q=College+vocabulary+flashcards).\n*  And I bet those crazy [Spelling Bee kids have a few tricks,](https://www.google.com/#q=advanced+spelling+bee+practice+games) up their sleeve, too.\n\nAnother thing no one has suggested is *Writing* over reading.
