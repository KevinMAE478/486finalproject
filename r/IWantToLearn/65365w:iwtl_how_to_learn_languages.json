There are a lot of textbooks out there, good and bad, but every language community has a few preferred resources. Find out what your target language's best textbooks are, then study daily. Even if it's just a page or two, sit down and make some forward progress. Momentum is key. \n\nOnce you have a grasp on basic grammar, start using it. Books (novels and the like) are great for expanding vocabulary and encountering new grammatical situations. TV's the same, with extra challenges (you have to use your ears and piece it together in real time) and rewards (tuning the ear to the pronunciation, developing a connection between the sound and its significance). It's usually best to watch TV with target-language subtitles. Video games are also good for this, and in this international age,  it's not incredibly tough to find games with good language options. Steam actually has search tools to find games that are subbed and/or dubbed in your chosen language. \n\nThroughout this process, you're going to be learning a lot of words. You're going to need flash cards to study and remember them. I highly recommend using spaced repetition software, like Anki. If you can't remember a card, Anki makes you review it more often; if you remember it quickly, Anki makes you review it less. This keeps the \"problem\" words to the fore while still occasionally checking and refreshing old vocabulary. It streamlines the learning/reviewing process *considerably,* especially when used daily. \n\nThe best way to improve is to interact in your target language with native speakers. It usually requires a baseline of competence - you don't have to be \"good,\" but if talking to you is painfully hard, you won't be able to find willing partners. If you have native speakers in your area, TALK TO THEM!! They are the best resource at your disposal!! If you don't have anyone in your area to talk to (shout-out to rural learners), I recommend HelloTalk. If you speak English and want to learn Spanish, it puts you in a sort of social network with native Spanish speakers who want to learn English. You can text each other and send each other voice messages. If things go well, you can move it over to WhatsApp and have phone calls. \n\nThen there's the nuclear option: true immersion. It's basically just the last paragraph, but on crack. If you can stay in a target country for an extended period of time, you're going to make major advances. You're not going to learn by osmosis, per se - you still have to understand grammar, and you have to get out and interact with natives as opposed to chilling at home or chatting in English with expats/tourists - but being constantly bombarded with your target language is a very, very powerful tool for development. \n\nLanguage learning is a slow thing that takes effort and a whole lot of patience. Pace yourself and try to enjoy the process rather than just the results. Try to find fun ways to study, and if you're an introvert like me, resist the temptation of excessive \"book learning.\" Be brave and seek out opportunities for live practice.

As you keep learning new words, you should focus on things that are always immediate and part of your every day life.\n\n- As you learn new words and phrases, you should start getting the gist of two things: the phonology and the grammar. How hard either will be to learn depends on any other languages you already know, and how different your target language is from these. In general I would recommend focusing on getting the phonology down first.\n\n- As you learn, you will start wondering how to say different expressions and conjugations in your target language, or coming into word constructions you don't understand, and that's mainly the way you learn grammar.\n\n- Find native speakers!! Either a teacher in Italki that costs $5 an hour, or a language exchange partner. You can also find subreddits for your target language in particular and it's best if they have something like a Discord server or alike where there are regular talk sessions monitored by native speakers.\n\n- As soon as you can, try finding podcasts or anything similar to listen to during dead time. While going to work, for example. You don't have to understand everything, rather listen to the intonation patterns and how the language sounds. I think listening and speaking are the most important abilities at first, rather than reading and writing.\n\n- Be consistent!! It's the most important thing! You will NOT learn any language to at least an intermediate level in less than 4 months, unless you dedicate like 12 hours a day to studying, which is ridiculous. If you break down a long term plan into milestones every one or two months, you will see significant progress, I assure you, but don't set your expectations to any high level, at all!\n\n- Finally, I can also recommend you watch Langfocus' \"Lang Learning Edges\" YouTube series ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPoIr_LFCsw) is a link to the first video) and practice for at least 15 minutes, every single day, no exceptions!! Find something that motivates you to study even when you don't feel like it, which will probably be a lot of the times.\n\nI'm currently living in Germany for a semester, and I can assure you that, after studying for months by myself, living among natives is the best resource ever! I think to me it's been even more amazing that this 'thing' that only existed in my computer, through Duolingo and people in Discord I had never seen face to face, suddenly became a rich and living cultural experience that has definitely been one of the best things I've committed to doing in my life. Trust me, it's worth all the damn grinding and sometimes boring exercises.\n\nI hope some of this helped :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who&amp;#39;s been learning German for almost a year now, I can give you the following advice:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn basic phrases first (greetings and common courtesies), then learn how to describe yourself very briefly, and then go to basic vocab like numbers and colors.
