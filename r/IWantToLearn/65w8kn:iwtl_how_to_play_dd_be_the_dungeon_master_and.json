Go ahead and pick up the 5th edition beginner box (as much as I love 3.5, it really isn&amp;#39;t the best starting point) and maybe one of the campaigns, I&amp;#39;ve heard Princes of The Apocalypse is relatively easy and flexible. I also SERIOUSLY recommend you check out Matt Colville&amp;#39;s YouTube channel. The man is a gift to aspiring DMs everywhere. One last piece of advice, the answer is always yes. &lt;em&gt;Always&lt;/em&gt; yes. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you spent hours writing an adventure that they completely bypassed (which is likely to happen at some point) it&amp;#39;s a collaborative experience and the players always have the option to avoid danger by being clever. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "name": "t1_dgdt6gg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492479326.0, "created_utc": 1492450526.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65w8kn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65w8kn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeaw2n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "backfatt", "parent_id": "t1_dge8ckq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IWantToLearn", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Don't leave out u/mattcolville his videos are amazing", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t leave out &lt;a href=\"/u/mattcolville\"&gt;u/mattcolville&lt;/a&gt; his videos are amazing&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "name": "t1_dgeaw2n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492500132.0, "created_utc": 1492471332.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge8ckq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Takaian", "parent_id": "t3_65w8kn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IWantToLearn", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I went from never playing the game to DMing a weekly session that my players (apparently) really enjoy for over a year now. Here are a few tips:\n\n1. Prepare, prepare, prepare. Read the PHB. Read the DMG. Read the subreddit (/r/DnD). Read forum posts. Read the wiki. There are so many amazing (and free) resources available to you. Read them, memorize them as much as possible, and have a good understanding on where to look something up should you not know an answer. You are not only the entire world, everyone the players meet, but you are the end all, be all, final decision in the game, rules-wise. Make sure you are knowledgeable in order to do that as fairly as possible.\n\n1. Speaking of resources, there are many online. Look up orcpub, kobold, and donjon on google (and many more). In our digital age these can be a huge benefit to generating things for you automatically, and saving you time.\n\n3. In contrast to tip 1, don't overprepare your content. Think of some cool places and experiences. Really put time into them. Details, the lot. Then think up some subpar/average ones that are easy but bland. A common mistake is front loading good content, and then things get boring as it goes on, or players (very often) will just not go to the amazing place you created and it gets \"wasted\". Keep things as generic as possible so you can pull out a cool experience at a regular interval to keep things interesting. You can really get a lot of bang for preparation buck if you are worried about the time commitment. As long as you have the high level details figured out (name of city/place, notable npcs, government, city layout, etc) throwing cool things for the players to do in organically can be done easily.\n\n4. Talk to your players! Make sure you know each player's experience, likes, dislikes (in terms of D&amp;D), RP-comfort, etc. If you have a team full of minmaxers, they may not care as much for the fancy dinner party with a mystery to solve as an all out battle with just a few too many orcs to handle. This can really help you be successful. I like to ask after each/a few sessions if people have suggestions for me/things they don't like. That way I can keep people happy while not having to argue about things during a session.\n\nI have way more than is pertinent to write out here, but I also recommend \"GM Tips w/ Matt Mercer\" on youtube, as well as any tips by Chris Perkins (another great DM).
