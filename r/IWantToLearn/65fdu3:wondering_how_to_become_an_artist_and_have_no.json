I&amp;#39;m completely new to reddit so I didn&amp;#39;t know exactly where to post this question but it seemed like this would be the best place. Let me start off by saying that I am a nineteen year old community college student who wants very badly to become an artist. Over the past year I have fallen in love with art and all different kinds of visual expression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I only last year got into art. Prior to this I would rarely ever draw or practice at all. I used to draw a lot back in elementary and middle school but stopped almost completely when I got into high school. And even when I would draw it was mainly just to pass the time. I was never truly dedicated to it. As I said though over the past year I have fallen in love with art and would love to learn how to be able to do all the amazing stuff artists do. And there are so many forms of art I&amp;#39;m interested in. I really want to get into drawing, painting, comic/manga writing and illustrating, and I&amp;#39;ve even become interested in learning how to do computer art and 3D graphic simulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem again though is that I&amp;#39;m a complete beginner and I&amp;#39;m kind of at a loss of what to do. I feel like I&amp;#39;m at the start of climbing Mount Everest learning how to do all of this. I&amp;#39;m wondering if I should take a few art classes at my community college and I&amp;#39;m wondering about majoring in art. The trouble though is that I always thought that to get into a real art school you had to already have some talent and I have none. I only recently got back into drawing/creating again earlier this year. I am at level 0 right now but there are so many different visuals I want to create and have no idea how. I&amp;#39;m considering meeting up with a career counselor and then going to maybe talk with an art teacher at my school to get some ideas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion I&amp;#39;m just worried that it&amp;#39;s too late for me. All of the people I know who were really into art have been into it since they were young children and that is not me at all. I worry that being 19 and still a beginner has ruined my chances and that I have already wasted too much time. Sorry for such a long post it&amp;#39;s just that all of this has been on my mind for a long time and I really need some advice. Where do I get started? Should I take art classes and major in art?

Drawing classes get you skills at representing accurate images - and that's one of the secrets of good abstract artists.  They might just lines and blotches, but 98% of really excellent abstract artists have the technical capability to draw really well.  So even if realism isn't \"your style\", it is still fundamentally important to the portfolio/life.  There are a lot of functional \"technical\" aspects to a good painting - an artist knows how to focus teh viewer on a given thing, and even then keep his eye moving around the canvas.  They know about visual balances, and why you can match A big dark square with a few little orange squiggly lines.  Shit, humanity itself didn't start drawing with perspective till what, a couple hundred measly years ago?  You've got some basics to learn.\n\nBefore, during, and after that class, just carry around a notebook with you and practice drawing.  Boring bus-ride?  draw the lady's hat in front of you.  Wasting time in the parking lot waiting on a friend who's late?  practice drawing that Corolla over there.  Set up still-life's at the house to draw.  Skill and ability is a direct correlation to time spent practicing.  Yeas, yeas, when we were all in the 4th grade, there was always that one guy or gal who drew amazing pictures - But if you look at that person now, and the kid who started at 19 and dedicates himself for a chunk a day to drawing, at the age of 30 they're spitting out the same quality of stuff (all other things being equal).\n\n\nI would also start investing in a few art books - not how-to's, but coffee table books that focus on one or another theme/style/broad genre.  Art is only positively influenced by other art, in my humble opinion, and as a young kid, you want to see a wide variety to open up that perspective.\n\nTo answer your direct questions from the end of the post:\n\n(C)  dont worry about age.  19 is a grand old time to be a young artist.  Your mind will be regularly blown away by the shit you see for years  to come.\n\n(D)  Get started at your CC.  that and the rest of your normal life.  if you normally take the dog to the dog park, bring your notepad next time.  hiker?  go hiking with the pad.  Video-gamer with roommates?  start drawing them and the bong on the table.  whatever.  \n\n(D.2)  definitely take art classes - you gotta learn that shit somewhere.   Majoring in art - if you end up wanting to go to a proper art school, go for it, but you've got a lot of research to do on what they're looking for in admissions.  I don't know that answer, so i don't want to go to far into the unknown.\n\nI'd focus on what's in front of you for now.  Get yourself drawing, then take it from there.\n\non an aside - I also *highly* recommend sculpture and pottery classes.  some form of 3d art.  really rounds out some skill-sets, and is just plain fun to 'build' things.
