[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "FIFA", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defending - Continued.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team-mate Contain (the basics).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for those who don&amp;#39;t know, this command brigs over an AI player to apply pressure on the ball holder (R1/RB).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What most players don&amp;#39;t think about is where this player is coming from. For example the Opponent breaks and it is your back line against his attack. You are containing with a full back and you decide to use the team-mate contain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now what this will do is pull the closest player across to help out, in this situation it will be your CB. In theory fantastic you now have double the pressure! In reality you have a massive hole in which you have invited an attacker to make use of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While we are using this we have to consider how it will effect the structure of the team, while making one area stronger you will always be making another weaker. The question you need to ask is whether this change benefits or hinders you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team-mate Contain (when to use).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s flash back to the same scenario, you have your back line against his attack. You place your full back in between the goal and the ball, the attacker isn&amp;#39;t getting through. So the logical option is for him to pass around, probably backwards and then central. So not only do we have him cornered, but we know the most likely escape route, but what do we do about this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your fullback is where want him to be so let&amp;#39;s change to a midfielder. Now when we start tracking back with the midfielder we also want to be using the team-mate contain, we placed this player there so we have no risk of destroying our structure here. Using the midfielder now we close down passing lanes and end up with the ball (well ideally)!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other option is when you are playing high pressure. You are in the opponents half and have just lost the call. By calling over a second player you aren&amp;#39;t ruining the structure, you can afford a player to be out of position slightly here, but what you are doing is ensuring that the opponent has next to time to dither or decide on the best route, a quick decision has to be made - which often ends in mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most efficient way to use this is either when higher up the pitch, where you want to win the ball back and are playing high pressure or after you have manually placed the team-mate, ready for the contain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Standing Tackles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this is stupidly simply when written down, a lot harder when attempting to implement. As a rule, a standing tackle should only be made when you are 99% sure it will win you the ball. The logic behind this is simple, when preforming a standing tackle your player undertakes an animation that roots him to that spot for about a second. If used incorrectly it allows for an attacker to breeze past with ease, putting you in a world of danger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason people speak so highly of the jockey command (L2/LT), is because a lot of the time you will simply gain possession without physically making a tackle. Whether it&amp;#39;s a pass you intercept, or overcommitment from the attacker, it&amp;#39;s a lot safer than risking a tackle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever played against someone who shield the ball a lot? You know that moment when you close in on him, lunge for the ball, and he simply turns and runs? Well this is incorrect use of a tackle! Jockey and close in at an angle that covers his most dangerous path/pass, Don&amp;#39;t over commit!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m not saying we shouldn&amp;#39;t be tackling! Sometimes it&amp;#39;s our only option! However there are safer situations to use this, and they all revolve around combing this with another defending technique. If you have a successful teammate contain up, and your second player closes in far enough, there is little risk here, the attacker isn&amp;#39;t going anywhere as it is!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sliding Tackles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t really need to spend long here. A slide tackle can be used in 3 situations, if used outside of these you put yourself in huge danger and a player is ruled out of play for around 3-5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first occasion is when you are coming in at an angle, you already know where the attacker plans to run and hence can use this to intercept the path. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second occasion is when an attacker over commits, the ball is loose in this situation and if your pace won&amp;#39;t carry you there, a boost from a slide tackle might!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third occasion, and one that I don&amp;#39;t approve of, is a professional foul. Sometimes it is the correct option, we see it happen in real matches all the time, we have the same option on this game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where to run.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you are chasing an attacker down the wing, the word chasing implies you are behind them (which is usually the case). Now if you attempt to tackle, push, shirt pull or anything from behind, there are only two options; a missed challenge and your defender immobilised in the animation or a foul.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of chasing this player, think ahead. If the attacker is running down the wing, you most likely aren&amp;#39;t going to catch them. Instead make your run towards the box, getting your player between the ball and the goal. From this position you control his movements! He either has to get around you, or pass backwards, both of which we are prepared for. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are chasing too close to him, a simple skill move or shoulder barge send you to the floor and there is no coming back from there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cutting Passing Lanes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is extremely important as it narrows down an opponents options, however you have to remember you cannot cover every single option and doing this alone isn&amp;#39;t enough (something I struggled to learn for a long period).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s use a real example, attacker has the ball and you use a player to cut off a passing lane. The opponent dribbles into a gap and chooses a different pass. Let&amp;#39;s assume you are better at multi tasking, you cover one passing lane, then move a second player to cover another. Again the attacker dribbles and then abuses the space you created by moving these players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, we need to have pressure on the ball holder, it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be too aggressive but enough to make them think about their next move. Now while the pressure is applied, move a midfielder into a position to cut THE MOST DANGEROUS passing lane. Do we care if the attacker plays the ball back to a CB? Does that put us in any danger? Of course not.....going backwards gives us a chance to regroup and become stronger!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using Strength/Shirt Pulling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Short and sweet here boys, if you pull someone&amp;#39;s shirt from behind, chances are you give away a foul, especially in the box! The same goes for trying to out muscle them, if behind, it becomes easy for them to send you to the ground!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead wait until you are alongside them (remember not running in their path, run alongside), you then have the inner ground and hold all the cards!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possession in your final third.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress this enough. Do. Not. Fuck. Around. The amount of goals people score from a weak pass or a failed skill move is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember the old saying &amp;#39;if in doubt, get it out!&amp;#39; This still applies, losing possession from a long clearance is a million times better than losing a goal!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changing Players.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People really underestimate the importance of this, and I saved it until last as it ties in with everything we discussed!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have a player in position and want to team mate contain, change player!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are chasing an attacker and he passes it across. Don&amp;#39;t keep chasing, the ball is miles away now! Not only do you have no hope in reaching it, but you are also destroying the foundations by moving players out of position. Change player!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You attempt a tackle and miss allowing the attacker to run past, change player!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think you are changing enough, you are wrong. There is almost always a player in a better/worse position you should be controlling!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right guys I&amp;#39;ll wrap part 2 up here, that finishes off defending for us! If people want more, we can move into the midfield, attack, mindset, formations, tactics, everything basically!
