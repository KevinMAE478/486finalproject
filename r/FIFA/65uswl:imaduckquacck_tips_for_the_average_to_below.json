In theory this is correct, but we have to analyse the situation here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the attacker is through one on one with the keeper, by leaving the keeper where he stands you force the opponent to aim for a corner, most likely a finesse/driven shot depending on the angle. By bringing the keeper out you force the opponent to make a faster decision, but you leave a bigger gap, allowing for chip shots as well. So which is correct?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both have their merits, but the key here is to close down and limit choices to the highest degree possible. Now sometimes the above choices are correct, but most of the time advancing your keeper a little gives the opponent a smaller target.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the keeper starts to charge, you can force the opponent into believing a chip shot is correct. By stopping him going to far you allow the keeper a chance to easily catch this type of shot. The same goes for low driven or finesse shots. By bringing  the keeper out you reduce the target size for the attacker, a finesse shot now red to bend around the keeper before it hits the net and a driven shot has to be to the side of a keeper who is a lot closer, hence the tighter angle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goal Kicks / Throws.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one is stupidly simple, yet a mistake I constantly find myself making due to attempting to rush.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you ever watch a pro player play, you will see that every single free kick, goalkick or set piece has been thought out. They are passing to a player that they know is in space, under no risk of losing the ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bring a player close, play a lobbed ball out to the wing, a driven pass, just ensure you don&amp;#39;t rush this and hence lose possession from a simple set piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defending.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where do we even start here? The amount of conflicting information we receive on this is baffling! Let&amp;#39;s break it down to basics and just look at each tiny aspect of defending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One On One - Face On.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the counter attack is on, it&amp;#39;s just your one defender against his attacker(s). All we want to do here is close down the angle and direct him to an area where we feel more confident. Now it&amp;#39;s going to be extremely difficult for the attacker to get past you face on here, unless we overcommit, we never want to overcommit! Use L2/LT and always face the ball, slowly move backwards as he progresses, this ensures you cover and quick movements they attempt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we will eventually find here is that the Opponent either overcommits and dribbles to close to our defender, allowing a quick steal, or that the opponent is left with no decision but to hold up the ball and await other options. While the Opponent waits for other options however, we also receive other options as or players begin making their way home. The more players we begin to get behind the ball, the easier it is to defend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One On One - Breaking Down The Wing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if the Opponent is breaking down the wing, it&amp;#39;s likely that their pace is greater than our defenders and that they will easily win the race. What many of us tend to think here is; the closer I get to this player, the best chance I have at winning the ball. This couldn&amp;#39;t be more wrong, as you are chasing you are inevitably sprinting. As you approach the attacker you have momentum, while he is usually in a position to overcome this. A simple body feint, cut inside, or scoop turn leaves you in a world of trouble as your defender needs to lose the momentum before he can turn around and apply pressure again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, we want to narrow the angle again, come in alongside the attacker, but with enough space to react if they attempt to cut inside. Follow the same logic here, back towards the goal, facing the ball and using the L2/LT. if your opponent moves forward, take a small step back, eventually they will need to pass around you or overcommit allowing a simple tackle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Defend with your midfield, not your defenders.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How often do we see this phrase thrown around, people swear by this, but what does it exactly mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly it doesn&amp;#39;t mean don&amp;#39;t use your defenders, this isn&amp;#39;t a 6-a-side game of football, we have the full 10 outfield players to control, and we need to ensure we do this. What it suggests however is that the majority of the time it is a safer option to bring an extra player back while keeping your shape in defence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When people refer to the AI defence as overpowered, they don&amp;#39;t mean they will do it all for you, it simply refers to how well they keep their shape and hold positions. A player with average dribbling skills can still easily bypass this backline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So by bringing back a midfielder, your defence keep their shape, limiting the attackers options and leaving next to no holes, while you have an extra body in which you can pressure the ball holder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So guys i have a load more to write about and discuss, however there is always a chance that this is of no use to anybody and I am simply rambling! So I&amp;#39;ll leave this here, if it helps enough people I&amp;#39;ll continue this, if not, well no harm done!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/65vk4r/imaduckquackk_tips_for_the_average_to_below/?st=J1M5ULWS&amp;amp;sh=5415f4b6\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/65vk4r/imaduckquackk_tips_for_the_average_to_below/?st=J1M5ULWS&amp;amp;sh=5415f4b6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "As a very average FIFA player, the lack of content available in order to improve my game was very limiting.
