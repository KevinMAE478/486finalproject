Food for thought I guess&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about if you could give that player a contract (read: challenge) of which you could pick (goals/assists/cleansheets/no.passes/chances created/whatever etc) to complete in a certain timeframe (vary depending on the contract), and upon completion you get the reward (extra chem/temp stat boost/etc) which then lasts for a certain number of games (depending on the reward, so won&amp;#39;t be OP). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could then give him a new contract when that previous one has expired (which stacks the reward on the old one) or extends his previous one (so he carries on with the same reward). If he doesn&amp;#39;t complete the requirements of his contract he will lose the reward when it expires.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then maybe if he plays 50 games for your club he&amp;#39;s able to have 2 contracts running at once, then at 200 games he could have 3 contracts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope that all makes sense haha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: as for ea making money, contracts could be applied like current consumbles, and only found in packs (perhaps exclusive packs like battlepacks on BF1). Rewards/contract requirements could vary depending on whether it&amp;#39;s a bronze/silver/gold contract so that it accommodates for all budgets &amp;amp; squads. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FIFA", "name": "t1_dg4g1b1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491954680.0, "created_utc": 1491925880.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q6vf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4g4k6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iDrownNerds", "parent_id": "t3_64q6vf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FIFA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Great idea but fifa would never go for it because they wouldn't really have a way to make money off of it I see your Edit 3 but those players would be worth little I would assume and people wouldn't want to open packs for them when they could just sell the sif and people will eat up those packs", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great idea but fifa would never go for it because they wouldn&amp;#39;t really have a way to make money off of it I see your Edit 3 but those players would be worth little I would assume and people wouldn&amp;#39;t want to open packs for them when they could just sell the sif and people will eat up those packs&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FIFA", "name": "t1_dg4g4k6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491954778.0, "created_utc": 1491925978.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q6vf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4gvm6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Agar_ioDemos", "parent_id": "t3_64q6vf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FIFA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I like the idea but it would be problematic due to sbcs.
