If you even take just his current 6 stats and make them the only variables, he still drops all the way down to an **80** Rated Card.\n\nYou then have to take in too consideration the importance of SM/WF, Height, Traits &amp; Specialities when deciding who is \"better\" or \"best\"\n\nSo TL:DR is quite simply that OVR &amp; Face Card stats are pretty much irrelevant in determining how good a player is.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &amp;quot;Best&amp;quot; player is entirely subjective. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could say &amp;quot;OVR&amp;quot; would define the best, and that surely 85 Player would player better than 82 Player, but that OVR is made up of more than just attributes, and also includes reputation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You then go deeper and look at how for example 80 Pace could actually be faster than 84 Pace, and so the face card stats don&amp;#39;t also really give an indication of &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; being [Variable] &amp;gt; [Variable]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then lastly, the weight of the in game stats. You can take a person (POTM Costa for example) who has a really high dribbling stat of 89 (Card) - 87 (In Game) - but dribbles like an absolute howzer with one leg, because he has 58 Balance, and 65 Agility. So the sheer weight of the influence of the Drib stat as an in-game stat, falsifies his dribbling card stat, when in reality his drib should be some where in the low 80&amp;#39;s. In fact, if each stat had 1/5 Weight, his dribbling OVR would be &lt;strong&gt;80&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we look at card weights as exact averages, and card overall as an exact average his card would look more like this;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pace : 79 (Shows 80)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shooting : 90 (Shows 92)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passing : 75 (Shows 78)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drib : 80 (Shows 87)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Def : 52 (Shows 47)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Phys : 86 (Shows 92)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And his overall if all 6 new stats were the only defining variables in his rating, would now read &lt;strong&gt;72&lt;/strong&gt; instead of the massive 89 Rating he actually has. If you even take just his current 6 stats and make them the only variables, he still drops all the way down to an &lt;strong&gt;80&lt;/strong&gt; Rated Card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You then have to take in too consideration the importance of SM/WF, Height, Traits &amp;amp; Specialities when deciding who is &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;best&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So TL:DR is quite simply that OVR &amp;amp; Face Card stats are pretty much irrelevant in determining how good a player is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FIFA", "name": "t1_dg9nq5u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492228649.0, "created_utc": 1492199849.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cl73", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cl73", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cl73", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cl73", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cl73", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cl73", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9aj6e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 28, "report_reasons": null, "author": "baubeauftragter", "parent_id": "t1_dg99hop", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FIFA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't like them, they are just more effective.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like them, they are just more effective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FIFA", "name": "t1_dg9aj6e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492213275.0, "created_utc": 1492184475.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cl73", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9if5u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Anthony_T_", "parent_id": "t1_dg99hop", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FIFA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I love Ribery, I just wish he wouldn't get injured everytime he takes a step on the field in fifa, but I'll risk and injured Ribery over martial any day.
