You can even add Warframe in there, which is PvE and totally free. The community actually gets behind issues when there is one and the developers actually listen. Maybe not about everything, but there is a ton of changes DE made that were requested or pointed out by the community. You can post videos of glitches and bugs happening and DE will actually make fixes based on that. They'll also actually communicate with their players. EA is pretty much the complete opposite and the reaction to issues here by the community seems the opposite. In other threads I've mentioned the game autoswitching me while I'm defending and I was told it was my fault. I've pointed out the absurdity and inconsistency of foul calls and was told I just needed to \"play around them\". I was told I shouldn't pass between defenders because \"we all know there's problems there\". I've posted video of balls going through a players leg and into the goal, only to be told it's lag (even though I play offline). I've never dealt with a community that has so many people simply accept the problems and even go so far as to blame others for issues the game has.\n\nIt isn't about esports or how rare certain problems might be. It's clear there are problems with the game and still so many people act like it's a minor issue that doesn't affect gameplay. It's just disappointing when so many shitposts (\"look how many screens I have\" or \"lol this player has a funny name\") gets 1k+ upvotes and ones that show serious gameplay issues are ignored. I guess I just haven't been around long enough to be made fully aware that no matter how much noise is made, it's not loud enough for EA to hear over all the money they're making regardless of those problems. It doesn't excuse the ones that act like the players are to blame for fouls not being called or balls clipping through players, though.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could find them, but I know I&amp;#39;ve seen around 3-4 others.

You can even add Warframe in there, which is PvE and totally free. The community actually gets behind issues when there is one and the developers actually listen. Maybe not about everything, but there is a ton of changes DE made that were requested or pointed out by the community. You can post videos of glitches and bugs happening and DE will actually make fixes based on that. They&amp;#39;ll also actually communicate with their players. EA is pretty much the complete opposite and the reaction to issues here by the community seems the opposite. In other threads I&amp;#39;ve mentioned the game autoswitching me while I&amp;#39;m defending and I was told it was my fault. I&amp;#39;ve pointed out the absurdity and inconsistency of foul calls and was told I just needed to &amp;quot;play around them&amp;quot;.
