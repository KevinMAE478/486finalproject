That has seriously been a game changer and I instantly started to win more games. Thank you new fast cool looking monitor! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;PLAY WITH ONE TEAM&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has been mentioned so many times before, but for the love of god play with one team. Stick with that team and get to know each player like they were your first girlfriend. Don\u2019t exchange the whole squad just because you loose 5 games in a row \u2013 that\u2019s on you, not the team. You can switch out players as you go a long but don\u2019t do it to frequently. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;HAVE A PLAN&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is so important to have a plan when you play FIFA. You need to have a plan for corners, for free kicks, for goal kicks, for when you give up the ball and when you are in open play. In open play I like to play on my backs and wingers and go to the backline and hit a R1 X cross to my strikers in the box. It is a lot more dangerous to loose the ball in the middle of the pitch than on the sides. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;SKILL MOVES&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FIFA is a mind game and you need to mess with your opponents head. I do 3 simple skill moves to do that: 1. Berba Spin, 2. Body feints 3. Ball Roll. You can watch youtube tutorials to get better, but trust me they are really easy to use if you practice a little. Ball Rolls must be the simplest skill in the game and yet so effective. I like to use it on the wings with my backs going forward - one ball roll and the opponent is going for half time pie while I am passing it easily to my wingers who goes to the backline to cross and boom 1-0.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;PLAY AGAINST BETTER OPPONENTS&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went 27w, 29w, 28w and 25w (3 games left) in 4 weekend leagues and I felt that I didn\u2019t progress. So I completely stopped playing in division 1 and started to look for better opponents to practice against. If I hadn&amp;#39;t done that I would never have been able to get Elite 1 which achieved yesterday. How do I find better opponents? If you look for it, you will find it! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;DEFENSE, DEFENSE, DEFENSE&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have always pressed X in my defense and I just couldn\u2019t get used to the fact that I had to use L2 to defend my opponents. As soon as I stopped using X and told myself ONLY to use L2 I got better immediately. The L2 defending is the only reason why I have been able to get Elite. I guess many of you players already defend like that, but for me it was something I had to change. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The buttons are one thing but having the right mindset for defense is another. Don\u2019t switch between players all the time. Stick to your central midfielder and start from there. Always put pressure on the ball holder, but don\u2019t over do it. Second man press is very effective, but its also very dangerous. Have discipline most of all, think and stay focused. If you are already in the weekend league, you must know how to defend in one way or the other, so stick to that and don\u2019t loose it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;RAGE&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lost 3 games on Saturday and I was so pissed because they were not as good as me, EA sucked and everything was just EAIDS! I played a game against a guy and I felt so much better than him, I underestimated him and raged over his goals. He scored 4 goals with Gray and ended up winning 4-3. At the end of the day, a win is a win and he won that game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FFS DO NOT FUCKING RAGE, PLAY FUCKING COOL AND STOP FUCKING WHINING. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;PLAY CALM&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can be able to play without any rage at all but feel very intimidated and nervous instead. That is maybe worse than raging. You need to control you nerves and you need to be able to play without a quick heartbeat and sweaty hands. Do what is working for you to get there, but if you feel nervous &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT PICK UP THE CONTROLLER&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice&lt;/strong&gt;: Don\u2019t look at your opponent\u2019s team when its loading the game. You see a full gold team and you start underestimate your opponent, you see a full special card team and you start getting nervous. Look away and spent the time to mentally prepare yourself for a very important game where you have to play calmly, not rage and just play the fucking best FIFA you have learned no matter the opponent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Last but not least, have confidence and don\u2019t loose it if you get behind 1-0 or 2-0, stay CALM and start making a plan on how to counter that. How many times have you not been able to score 2 goals within 10 minutes in the game? Why shouldn\u2019t you be able to do that when you are behind? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;SPLIT YOUR GAMES UP AND REMEMBER YOUR LIFE&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t let FIFA take over your life, but try to combine social life, family and all that stuff with playing FIFA during all 3 days of the weekend. It is so important that you stimulate your brain with other stuff than a video game. Go out and have fun, eat well, drink well, treat yourself well and then come back with happiness and focus and destroy your opponents. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "#**I have made a list of things that (I think) makes a crucial difference in weekend league.** \n\n#I started playing FUT in January (Used to play H2H) and I have tried Weekend League 8 times.
