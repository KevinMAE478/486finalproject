Do they give the boosts they say they do and does the amount of chevrons matter?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this clears up some of the questions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did some testing using the infamous LB step-over where 85+ dribbling is required to perform the move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: The boosts from chemistry is linear and the same percentage of boost is given to the effected stats from a chemistry style, so for instance a player On 7 chem and 100 team chemistry will receive +8 for any +15 stat boost, +5 for any +10 stat boost and +3 for any +5 stat boost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chevrons are a cosmetic feature and having full green chevrons does not mean that you will get the full boosts in that category. When individual chem is below 50 points, the player will receive a decrease in every stat from -1 to -25 depending on how low the individual player\u2019s points are. The chem style applied does not matter, the decrease is the same. A sub does only get 5 chem too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Player chem points are rounded down from .99 and the stat boost is rounded up from .5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Futhead\u2019s, Futbin&amp;#39;s and Futwiz&amp;#39;s chemistry feature is not quite accurate. Probably because they don&amp;#39;t round down correctly, but i&amp;#39;m not sure &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you want perfection, you can make a copy or download as an excel sheet and you can check individual stat boosts for any chem style on any chem for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eTxGZiB6HRAzVVoQsbgzRo8Z3rGHq1myOT3_pi2lILo/edit?pli=1#gid=0\"&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eTxGZiB6HRAzVVoQsbgzRo8Z3rGHq1myOT3_pi2lILo/edit?pli=1#gid=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: For anyone who downloads as an excel document you need to type =ROUNDDOWN(M2,0) under player chem highlighted in red&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the first player to go through the ringer is Palacio with 83 dribbling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"center\"&gt;Game&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th

Having 3,2 or 1 green chevrons is more of a cosmetic feature. 3 green chevrons in a stat category does not mean that category will get the maximum boosts.&lt;br/&gt;\nPlayer chem is rounded down from .99 and stat boosts are rounded normally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To test the base and decrease in stats I chose in-form Pizzi (85 dribble) and 83 Jonas (84 dribble) both of which were 5 chem on 50 team chemistry which is 50 points and should perform to base stats. Pizzi did the step-over and Jonas did not which is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if 50 points = 0 and 0 points = -25 we can assume that every -2 points from 50 will drop stats by 1. So, I tested Pizzi on 49 points (5/46) and he still did the step-over and then on 48 points (5/42) he did not do the step over which is in-line with the above theory. I also tried Pizzi on 48.5 points (5/44) and he did not do the step-over.\n48.9 - 47 points = -1 stats\n46.9 -45 points = -2 stats&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SBC Diago Costa has 89 dribbling, so if we use him on 40.75 points (4/43) he should get -5 stats and only 84 dribbling. He does not do the step-over which is good. When I moved Costa to 41 points (4/44) which should only be -4 stats and 85 dribbling he now does the step-over.\nWhen I used costa on 40.75 points I used hunter and sniper on him and on both occasions, he did not do the step-over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using OTW pogba with 92 dribbling. With 35 points he gets -7 stats, so 85 dribbling he does the step-over and on 34.75 points, -8 stats, 84 dribbling he doesn&amp;#39;t do it.\nThe decrease in stats seems to affect every stat and does not matter what chem style you have on. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Chemistry is still a bit of a Mystery, do the boosts work? Do they give the boosts they say they do and does the amount of chevrons matter?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHopefully this clears up some of the questions\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI did some testing using the infamous LB step-over where 85+ dribbling is required to perform the move.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTLDR: The boosts from chemistry is linear and the same percentage of boost is given to the effected stats from a chemistry style, so for instance a player On 7 chem and 100 team chemistry will receive +8 for any +15 stat boost, +5 for any +10 stat boost and +3 for any +5 stat boost.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nChevrons are a cosmetic feature and having full green chevrons does not mean that you will get the full boosts in that category. When individual chem is below 50 points, the player will receive a decrease in every stat from -1 to -25 depending on how low the individual player\u2019s points are. The chem style applied does not matter, the decrease is the same. A sub does only get 5 chem too.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPlayer chem points are rounded down from .99 and the stat boost is rounded up from .5\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \nEdit: Futhead\u2019s, Futbin's and Futwiz's chemistry feature is not quite accurate. Probably because they don't round down correctly, but i'm not sure \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo if you want perfection, you can make a copy or download as an excel sheet and you can check individual stat boosts for any chem style on any chem for yourself.  \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eTxGZiB6HRAzVVoQsbgzRo8Z3rGHq1myOT3_pi2lILo/edit?pli=1#gid=0\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: For anyone who downloads as an excel document you need to type =ROUNDDOWN(M2,0) under player chem highlighted in red\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, the first player to go through the ringer is Palacio with 83 dribbling.\n\nGame | Chemstyle | Player Chem | Step-over | Expected Boost\n:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:\n1 | Powerhouse | 10/100 | No | 0\n2 | Marksman | 6/100 | Yes | 2\n3 | Marksman | Sub | No | 1.2\n4 | Basic | 6/100 | Yes | 2\n5 | Basic | 6/99 | Yes | 1.9\n6 | Basic | 6/96 | Yes | 1.9\n7 | Basic | 6/80 | Yes | 1.5\n8 | Basic | 6/79 | No |\t1.4\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFrom this first test, player chem is rounded down even from .99 and the stat boost is rounded normally. \n\nStill using the +5 boosts I now use 87 Casemiro who has 81 dribbling\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGame | Chemstyle | Player Chem | Step-Over | Expected Boost\n:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:\n1 | Marksman | 8/100 | Yes | 3.5\n2 | Marksman | 8/99 | No | 3.4\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn to the +10 Dribble boosts now\nSigurdsson with 78 dribbling\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGame | Chemstyle | Player Chem | Step-over | Expected Boost\n:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:\n1 | Engine | 8/90 | No | 6.4\n2 | Engine | 8/91 | No | 6.4\n3 | Engine | 8/92 | Yes |6.6\n4 | Maestro | 8/92 | Yes | 6.6\n5 | Maestro | 8/91 | No | 6.4\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCasemiro 81 Dribbling\n\nGame | Chemstyle | Player Chem | Step-over | Expected Boost\n:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:\n1 | Engine | 6/92 | Yes | 3.6\n2 | Engine | 6/91 | No | 3.4\n3 | Maestro | 6/91 | No | 3.4\n4 | Maestro | 6/92 | Yes | 3.6\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJuanfran 77 Dribbling\n\nGame | Chemstyle | Player Chem | Step-over | Expected Boost\n:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:\n1 | Maestro | 9/82 | Yes | 7.6\n2 | Maestro | 9/81 | No | 7.4\n3 | Engine | 9/81 | No | 7.4\n4 | Engine | 9/82 | Yes | 7.6\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUsing different Chemstyles that give +10 dribbling on different players with different amounts of chemistry didn\u2019t bring anything that wasn\u2019t expected.

Having 3,2 or 1 green chevrons is more of a cosmetic feature. 3 green chevrons in a stat category does not mean that category will get the maximum boosts.  \nPlayer chem is rounded down from .99 and stat boosts are rounded normally.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo test the base and decrease in stats I chose in-form Pizzi (85 dribble) and 83 Jonas (84 dribble) both of which were 5 chem on 50 team chemistry which is 50 points and should perform to base stats. Pizzi did the step-over and Jonas did not which is perfect.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow if 50 points = 0 and 0 points = -25 we can assume that every -2 points from 50 will drop stats by 1. So, I tested Pizzi on 49 points (5/46) and he still did the step-over and then on 48 points (5/42) he did not do the step over which is in-line with the above theory. I also tried Pizzi on 48.5 points (5/44) and he did not do the step-over.\n48.9 - 47 points = -1 stats\n46.9 -45 points = -2 stats\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSBC Diago Costa has 89 dribbling, so if we use him on 40.75 points (4/43) he should get -5 stats and only 84 dribbling. He does not do the step-over which is good. When I moved Costa to 41 points (4/44) which should only be -4 stats and 85 dribbling he now does the step-over.\nWhen I used costa on 40.75 points I used hunter and sniper on him and on both occasions, he did not do the step-over.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUsing OTW pogba with 92 dribbling. With 35 points he gets -7 stats, so 85 dribbling he does the step-over and on 34.75 points, -8 stats, 84 dribbling he doesn't do it.\nThe decrease in stats seems to affect every stat and does not matter what chem style you have on. \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "FUT", "id": "65x5e3", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 132, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CRIPPLER1", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65x5e3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FIFA", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.FIFA", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "edited": 1492461561.0, "link_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/FIFA/comments/65x5e3/chemistry_the_full_lowdown_from_testing/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492480463.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/65x5e3/chemistry_the_full_lowdown_from_testing/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "CHEMISTRY, the full low-down from testing", "created_utc": 1492451663.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 63, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 132}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x5e3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x5e3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x5e3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x5e3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdzt5b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AHarvestMoon", "parent_id": "t1_dgdzgpo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FIFA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Exactly.

I believe there&amp;#39;s a cap somehwere though if only because if I put a +15 on smalling&amp;#39;s pace and he is clearly not 90 and 95 acceleration and pace, and there&amp;#39;s no other factors for that stat category.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FIFA", "name": "t1_dge5b6q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492493009.0, "created_utc": 1492464209.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdzgpo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 43, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CRIPPLER1", "parent_id": "t1_dgdyxpu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FIFA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A combination of dribbling, agility, balance, traits and i also believe height and body type also affect the feel of a player ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of dribbling, agility, balance, traits and i also believe height and body type also affect the feel of a player &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FIFA", "name": "t1_dgdzgpo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492486381.0, "created_utc": 1492457581.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x5e3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x5e3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge09lw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ffbqs", "parent_id": "t1_dgdztfr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FIFA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "His dribbling still feels like 80, not 95 though ...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;His dribbling still feels like 80, not 95 though ...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FIFA", "name": "t1_dge09lw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492487282.0, "created_utc": 1492458482.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x5e3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge10o9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dsrii", "parent_id": "t1_dgdztfr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FIFA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I believe the unique animations part for sure, I have tried a plethora of strikers in this FIFA and decided to try out IF Gabbiadini and I enjoy playing with him the most, I don't believe he has unique animations but his IF and regular card always do this weird ball slide when he gets the ball and I have never been able to replicate it with any other player.\n\nIt's kinda hard to say what he does exactly but when he gets the ball with his back towards goal, he does this weird turn and for some reason it always gets away from the defender.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe the unique animations part for sure, I have tried a plethora of strikers in this FIFA and decided to try out IF Gabbiadini and I enjoy playing with him the most, I don&amp;#39;t believe he has unique animations but his IF and regular card always do this weird ball slide when he gets the ball and I have never been able to replicate it with any other player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s kinda hard to say what he does exactly but when he gets the ball with his back towards goal, he does this weird turn and for some reason it always gets away from the defender.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FIFA", "name": "t1_dge10o9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492488126.0, "created_utc": 1492459326.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qxh7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x5e3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeq6h4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RescueRatchet", "parent_id": "t1_dgdztfr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FIFA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree.
