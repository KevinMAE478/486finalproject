6 months ago, it was girlfriend and I's one-year anniversary. Naturally, being the lazy p.o.s. that I am, this was a true \"last minute\" project. I kid you not when I say that I started and finished this thing in 35 hours. \n\nI was at a Red Robin (hamburger restaurant in the United States) and I saw a similar type of collage on the wall. Granted, the one I saw was done by a professional (and looked much better than the one I made...the one in the restaurant was a portrait of a woman) but whatever. \n\nAnyhow, after my luck of inspiration (and my decision to be a reposter IRL) I effectively stole this idea and made it my own. \n\nWith nothing but the vision in my head, I went to Wal-Mart and bought about 250 crayons (roughly 4 of the 64 packs). Additionally, I bought some craft paint, and a 12x12\" foam board. Also, I went to Lowe's hardware and bought a 2.5'x3.5' sheet of plywood that was about 3/4\" thick, along with a small sheet of plexiglass. \n\nLong story short, I just started methodically smashing the crayons into the foam (which did a decent job of holding them all in place), ending up with something close to 22x22 rows of crayons. My girlfriend loves pugs, so i found a clipart pic of one online and superimposed a 22x22 grid over the picture to correspond with the colors of the crayons. Note that I used the craft paint to paint each individual crayon the desired color. \n\n\nAt this point, our anniversary dinner is 6 hours away. I'm in a full-blown panic as I'm using a circular saw to cut the enclosure. Just used a tape measure, a marker, and some clamps to cut the pieces for the enclosure. No plans, just crude measurements (I'm sure you could never tell, seeing how the lines on that box are flawless! lol).\n\nBang it together with a simple hammer and nails, set the piece inside (it somehow fit perfect), and snapped the plexiglass on there....ultimately held on by 4 screws. \n\n\n\nSo there you have it. The worlds quickest crayon collage. It definitely ain't pretty but she loved it and I was kinda proud of myself for pulling it off. Would have loved to had the time to make a beautiful box, sanded it down and stained it, but I suppose we all can't have what we want haha....\n\nMoral of the story is, be sure to plan things far in advance. \n\nThanks for reading!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, so after finding this subreddit, I figure this is the best place to share this, along with the rather interesting story of how this piece came to be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 6 months ago, it was girlfriend and I&amp;#39;s one-year anniversary.
