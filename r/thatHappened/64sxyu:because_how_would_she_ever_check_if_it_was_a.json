But hey, better that way round than missing lav\n\nA huge order (biggest i ever saw was 100 quarter pounder meals) was every managers dream. For one, it fixes the labour almost\u200b certainly for that hour and may even be enough to offset several weak hours. For two 100 quarter pounder meals to one customer is a hell of a lot easier to do than selling 1 quarter pounder meal to 100 customers in a row.\n\nIt's because at any given time you have to keep the amount of quarter pounder and chips on standby at a certain level and end up throwing a lot away if you get it wrong.\n\n100 quarter pounder? Just go into full production mode. Get 4 grills in quarter pounder production and your quickest two chefs on it. All fry vats are going and the manager plus your best two servers are gathering it all together.\n\nYou could fill that order in 15 minutes and people would actually have fun teaming together to do an extreme order (yes working at McDonald's is that boring that a 100 meal order was a really exciting day for me). \n\nNow if someone phoned and ordered 2000 meals my manager would have been in heaven. One call to corporate and the front of store would be closed and we would become a drive thru only. A few extra employees would be bought in for a couple of hours and it could probably be just about churned out in that time. It would be an exciting event and profits for the day would be through the roof.\n\nOr the customer on the phone made a mistake.\n\nPoint is a manager is never going to be upset by a huge order.

Managers loved the fuck out of biblically huge orders when they happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were under constant pressure to keep labour below a certain % for every hour (the % of money taken through the tills that has been spent on paying people&amp;#39;s wages for that hour has to be below a certain number or someone above will get pissed).
