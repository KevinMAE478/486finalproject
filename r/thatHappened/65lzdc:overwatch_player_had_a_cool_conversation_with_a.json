The people directly in front of us were a middle aged couple and what appeared to be their son, a guy in his mid-20s who looked like a caricature of a guy who lives in his parents&amp;#39; basement and plays video games all day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the guys taking orders was also in his early/mid 20s and had an Oblivion shirt on. I thought it was a band, but I gathered from their short conversation that it&amp;#39;s a video game. They were excited about the upcoming release of a game, but I&amp;#39;m not sure if it was related to Oblivion or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t talk long, and it was then that I realized for the first time why people buy t-shirts that reference their favorite video games. It&amp;#39;s so that fellow gamers will know who they are so they can talk, however briefly, about their hobby with a fellow enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thatHappened", "name": "t1_dgbv19x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492361359.0, "created_utc": 1492332559.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vmb7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lzdc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbggth", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Myukupuku", "parent_id": "t3_65lzdc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thatHappened", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As soon as I saw this post on the Overwatch reddit, I came here to check if it was already posted.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I saw this post on the Overwatch reddit, I came here to check if it was already posted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thatHappened", "name": "t1_dgbggth", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492333540.0, "created_utc": 1492304740.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vmb7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lzdc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbsynn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LeiLeiVB", "parent_id": "t3_65lzdc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thatHappened", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was wondering how long this would take to get here.
