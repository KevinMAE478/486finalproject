So I'm sure they're a good read - they wouldn't be so popular otherwise.\n\nBut I was definitely older than the target age (I'm 3 years older than you).\n\nI'm a pretty big reader, even more so when I was a child and a teen - I read a hell of a lot. I have absolutely NOTHING against reading books like Harry Potter, I probably would myself if it were just one novel and not a series.\n\nThe problem with books is that no matter how fast a ready you are, reading a book, especially a series of long books, takes some time. And there's a cap on how fast I can read and still enjoy the story - I like to take my time, think about things, pause and ponder if I like..\n\nSo basically you get this equation where over the course of your life time, you're only going to be able to read a small fraction of the books you would like to.. So basically I have a rule to not re-read books (I've broken this once or twice for really special books) and to not read anything that isn't at the top of your list to read..\n\nSo while I'm sure the HP books are an OK read, I'm simply not going to read 7 books or however many there are, of a children's book and in turn miss out on something better ...
