Each bag of grapes is 3.99. the pineapple is 4.99. the raspberries are 2.99. the peanuts are 2.99 each. The bottle of water 1.50. That&amp;#39;s max $21 Canadian. A trio at mcdonalds is $10. Yeah I see the argument. But a bag of apples is 99 cents a pound. Pears are 1.29 a pound. A medium box of strawberries is $3 in special. Bananas are 79 cents a pound. Tons of cheaper fruits. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thatHappened", "name": "t1_dg6rkpe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492068888.0, "created_utc": 1492040088.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vmb7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vanz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vmb7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vanz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vmb7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vanz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6w1s1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "misosoupo", "parent_id": "t1_dg6syas", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thatHappened", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I wasn't doubting you.
