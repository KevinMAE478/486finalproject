They're probably the most well rounded, doing amazing builds, good redstone, and crazy mechanics. To a new Hermitcraft viewer, I would really suggest starting with X. He's the current \"leader\" of the group, if only in the sense that he's the co-owner and most active of the main admins of the server. He takes on all aspects of the game, and does amazing things with thm all. Cub plays in much the same style, but he takes on HUGE projects, like converting an entire area to custom biome, or building gigantic charged creeper farms.\n\nIf you want to see more straight building, Scar, False, and Welsknight would probably be my picks. Scar and False absolutly excel at landscaping and detailed building. Scar leans towards a more realistic style, building old west outposts and train stations that rival, if not surpass, some of the best builds Minecraft has ever seen, with some of the deepest levels of detail you can do in the game. False builds in much the same way, but her themes are more fantastical in natute. Giant jellyfish floating in the sky? Why not. Huge scientific research station sunk into the ocean? No problem. Wels, who just recently went fulltime YouTube after serving in the US military , combines more practical builds with the same deep level detail. Hobbit holes, elvish houses, and a MASSIVE sprawling underground drawven kingdom, all fully ready to serve as a fuctioning base, while still looking top notch. He's a very wise fellow, too, and I love it when he gives commentary on the world.\n\nImpulse and Tango are the mechanical masters. The have a very deep understanding of the underlying core of the game, combining knowledge of AI, in game physics, and redstone to pull off some absolutely crazy things.

They really fit more into the well rounded category, but I'm placing them seperate because they have the least sub and view count of the current members, and both deserve more. Their specialty lies more in themselves than in the game. Joe, which is the person you replyed to here, has an amazing since of humor, and an excellent way with words. He makes puns and jokes and poems, as he carves away mountians and builds barns, and talks about historic facts and movies and tabletop games. He's not a technical master or an over the top detailer, but he's one of my absolute favorites, because I can just listen to him forever. TFC is an older fellow. He's real down to earth. He does simple builds that look good without being extravagant. He's a grinder, too. Built his main base in season 4 out of diamond blocks just for the hell of it - but still made it fit and look decent. TFC is like that older uncle that comes by every couple of days to check on the family - he has a comforting presence, and goes on about things in his crackled voice that may not always understand, but you know that he's right anyway.\n\nThen you have Hermitcraft's wildchilds - Rendog and Iskall. These two guys are nuts, in that \"there's a fine line between crazy and genius\" kind of way. They both build some really impressive things. Iskall is the loud and boisterous kid in the neighborhood that calls everyone fools and has an imagination that doesn't stop. He built a mine dedicated to digging up iskallium - a fictional element that he wrote a complete back story and lore for. Rendog is his slighty derpy brother (for analogy's sake, they're not actually related). He's the one most likely to die over and over again trying to complete a single task. But when he does complete it, look out. It'll be pretty, it'll be interactive, and everyone is gonna get involved. Ren spent months working on a minigame that took over the whole server, and had every single other player searching the whole mesa for hidden boxes, to collect sets of renamed items and win points.\n\nEdit: I should add there's quite a few more Hermits as well, that I've not mentioned because they haven't been as active lately, although I bet they will be with the reset coming in two days. The most well known of these are Etho, Beef, and Doc, also of Mindcrack fame. There's also Python, Biffa, Cleo, Hypno, Jevin, Keralis, xB, and Jessassin. And Mumbo of course, but you seem to already be familiar with him, so I sorta left him out. Oops. Sorry MumboNation. There very may be a few more joining with the new season. It's speculated there will be three, and we THINK we know who those three are, but I can't confirm enough to add then to the list.\n\nOne final note, if you want to keep a general idea of what's going on with the server, but don't have time to watch everyone, check out The Hermitcraft Recap. It's a couple of guys that are as crazy about the server as it's members, and put out a short weekly video highlighting the biggest parts of the activitys. They don't play on the server, but they both also have seperate channels where they play on other servers.\n\nYou can find links to everyone's channels, including the Recap, on [the Official Hermitcraft site](http://www.hermitcraft.com).", "edited": 1491959704.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want an all around Minecraft experience, try Xisuma or Cubfan. They&amp;#39;re probably the most well rounded, doing amazing builds, good redstone, and crazy mechanics. To a new Hermitcraft viewer, I would really suggest starting with X. He&amp;#39;s the current &amp;quot;leader&amp;quot; of the group, if only in the sense that he&amp;#39;s the co-owner and most active of the main admins of the server. He takes on all aspects of the game, and does amazing things with thm all. Cub plays in much the same style, but he takes on HUGE projects, like converting an entire area to custom biome, or building gigantic charged creeper farms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to see more straight building, Scar, False, and Welsknight would probably be my picks. Scar and False absolutly excel at landscaping and detailed building. Scar leans towards a more realistic style, building old west outposts and train stations that rival, if not surpass, some of the best builds Minecraft has ever seen, with some of the deepest levels of detail you can do in the game. False builds in much the same way, but her themes are more fantastical in natute. Giant jellyfish floating in the sky? Why not. Huge scientific research station sunk into the ocean? No problem. Wels, who just recently went fulltime YouTube after serving in the US military , combines more practical builds with the same deep level detail. Hobbit holes, elvish houses, and a MASSIVE sprawling underground drawven kingdom, all fully ready to serve as a fuctioning base, while still looking top notch.
