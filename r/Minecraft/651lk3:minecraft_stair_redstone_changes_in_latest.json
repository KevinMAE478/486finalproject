The top dropper doesn&amp;#39;t power the bottom dropper, the button does. It&amp;#39;s a bug where pistons, dispensers and droppers are activated as though they were shaped like doors. Annoys me that it&amp;#39;s regarded as a feature. It&amp;#39;s inconsistent with the pocket edition (where it won&amp;#39;t be implemented because it&amp;#39;s a bug over there), and it&amp;#39;s a barrier to learning redstone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Minecraft", "name": "t1_dg7mbak", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492122645.0, "created_utc": 1492093845.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7kdfg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SuperGeniusZeb", "parent_id": "t1_dg78wa1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Minecraft", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Redstone should only act in Redstone ticks, which are equivalent to 2 game ticks, so yes.
