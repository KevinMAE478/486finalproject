It&amp;#39;s not concrete. The when they&amp;#39;re reminded that 99% of scientists agree they say that they&amp;#39;ve been bought off for some reason. Or like our president said, climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s insane because I can assume there&amp;#39;s an agenda that they are chasing and they are sacrificing the environment for short term gain, I can&amp;#39;t prove it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But look at guns.

I would like to see what exactly made his opinion of such actions change. My personal opinion is that he &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; actually have an opinion on the matter, and simply took the opposite position as Obama for the sake of opposing him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m wrong about chemical weapons being used by the Syrian government against their own people prior to the most recent event, I&amp;#39;ll admit as much. But unless I&amp;#39;m wrong about that, I think Trumps quick 180 was either political theater, or the result of him taking a hard stance against something he didnt understand at all simply to oppose Obama/Liberals. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "entertainment", "name": "t1_dg8n9w1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492166593.0, "created_utc": 1492137793.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655sw2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655sw2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8nr4p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HelperBot_", "parent_id": "t1_dg8nr1f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/entertainment", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouta_chemical_attack\n***\n^HelperBot ^v1.1 ^/r/HelperBot_ ^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Please ^message ^/u/swim1929 ^with ^any ^feedback ^and/or ^hate. ^Counter: ^55746", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Mobile link: &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouta_chemical_attack\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouta_chemical_attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;HelperBot&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;v1.1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/HelperBot_\"&gt;/r/HelperBot_&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;am&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;bot.&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Please&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;message&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/swim1929\"&gt;/u/swim1929&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;with&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;any&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;feedback&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;and/or&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;hate.&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Counter:&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;55746&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "entertainment", "name": "t1_dg8nr4p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492167288.0, "created_utc": 1492138488.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655sw2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655sw2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655sw2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8p567", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ghoti_styx", "parent_id": "t1_dg8oql3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/entertainment", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; She was either attacking me for punishing him just to be 'against' me, or she doesn't really have an opinion on punishment, and is just doing what she gets the urge to do moment to moment.\n\nOr she was punishing you this time for doing it again!
