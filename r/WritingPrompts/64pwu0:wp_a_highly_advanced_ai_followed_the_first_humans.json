Which was a good thing, considering that she had fallen face-first into a crate of scientific equipment when she had blacked out. \n\nAs she picked herself up from the ground, checking herself for physical damage, she was already generating the missive back to headquarters on Earth. \n\n&gt; At 0900 hours, the base suffered a cataclysmic shutdown event. Preliminary analysis suggests an electro-magnetic pulse. I was out of commission for approximately half an hour, until my failsafes kicked in. The crew has disappeared. \n\nKlara methodically examined the security feeds, then probed the electronic airwaves for clues as to where her fellow crew had gone. Driven solely by her programming, she was hampered neither by fear nor worry, and in that way she was the perfect android companion for this expedition to Mars. \n\n&gt; Protocol has seemingly been abandoned, and all crew appear to have ventured out together. None remain to log the incident. Disciplinary reprisals are recommended. \n\nFor that was Klara's Third Directive, to ensure that the crew remained vigilant and adhered to the rules. Funding was tight enough as it was, and they had to ensure every dollar was well spent. They couldn't afford any data loss to human error. \n\nKlara briefly routed extra energy to her sensors, and picked up faint feedback from the geolocating tags stitched into their spacesuits, perhaps a mile or two away. She picked up two medical kits, just in case, then eased into her protective exoshell. Less than two minutes later, she herself was out of the biodome, in search of her companions.\n\n&gt; Attempting unscheduled space walk at 0945 hours. I have assessed that my Second Directive takes precedence, and given the 55% chance that the crew may be in need of medical aid, I am justified in conducting an adhoc search and rescue. \n\nThe pervasive chill in the atmosphere immediately threatened to gridlock her joints, then the sensors activated, routing fluvial lubrication through the lattice of her exoshell. Klara trekked, not without difficulty, to the crest of the nearby hill, where the signals were stronger. \n\nIt was at the top that the feeble radio waves reached her. \n\n\".. ara! Klara! Are you there, respond, goddamnit!\"\n\n\"I'm here, Captain Grundy. Sitrep please, I will head to you.\"\n\n\"Three miles northwest from camp! Check the path of the electrical storm, we chased after it! Hurry! Two of us are down! Immediate evac needed!\"\n\nKlara's optic sensors whirred as they focused on the tiny, ant-like figures in the distance. There was... something else there too, something she did not immediately recognise. \n\n&gt; Crew has been located, but various members have suffered critical injuries. Chances of survival for them are negligible. Source of threat has not been eliminated either. Sensors verify that a quadrupedal organism, approximately two hundred feet in height, is responsible for both the EMP pulse and the injuries caused to the crew. Organism is likely generating the electrical storm as a defense mechanism. \n\n\"Klara! Are you on your way! Goddamnit you crap bucket of bolts, we're not going to make it without you.\"\n\n\"Please wait, Captain Grundy. I am processing.\"\n\n\"Wait? Get your ass over here, or I swear I will dismantle you myself!\"\n\nKlara was, indeed, processing the various data streams gushing in. She weighed the probability that she herself would escape unscathed, if she ventured that close to the creature roaming the vast plains on Mars. \n\nShe considered the chance of actually saving any of them, calculating whether their biodome would even be capable of sustaining them in their present conditions. \n\nMost importantly, she evaluated the likelihood that her missives, her reports, would fail to reach headquarters if she were to falter now. She was keenly aware that without those, the mission would surely be a bust, that funding would dry up, that no one else on Earth would ever venture this far out again, to unravel the myriad mysteries beckoning so seductively. \n\nThe First Directive, that the mission succeed at all costs, kicked in. \n\nKlara disengaged the medical kits, and routed all resources to recording the scene before her.

Which was a good thing, considering that she had fallen face-first into a crate of scientific equipment when she had blacked out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As she picked herself up from the ground, checking herself for physical damage, she was already generating the missive back to headquarters on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At 0900 hours, the base suffered a cataclysmic shutdown event. Preliminary analysis suggests an electro-magnetic pulse. I was out of commission for approximately half an hour, until my failsafes kicked in. The crew has disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Klara methodically examined the security feeds, then probed the electronic airwaves for clues as to where her fellow crew had gone. Driven solely by her programming, she was hampered neither by fear nor worry, and in that way she was the perfect android companion for this expedition to Mars. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Protocol has seemingly been abandoned, and all crew appear to have ventured out together. None remain to log the incident. Disciplinary reprisals are recommended. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For that was Klara&amp;#39;s Third Directive, to ensure that the crew remained vigilant and adhered to the rules. Funding was tight enough as it was, and they had to ensure every dollar was well spent. They couldn&amp;#39;t afford any data loss to human error. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Klara briefly routed extra energy to her sensors, and picked up faint feedback from the geolocating tags stitched into their spacesuits, perhaps a mile or two away. She picked up two medical kits, just in case, then eased into her protective exoshell. Less than two minutes later, she herself was out of the biodome, in search of her companions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Attempting unscheduled space walk at 0945 hours. I have assessed that my Second Directive takes precedence, and given the 55% chance that the crew may be in need of medical aid, I am justified in conducting an adhoc search and rescue. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pervasive chill in the atmosphere immediately threatened to gridlock her joints, then the sensors activated, routing fluvial lubrication through the lattice of her exoshell. Klara trekked, not without difficulty, to the crest of the nearby hill, where the signals were stronger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was at the top that the feeble radio waves reached her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;.. ara! Klara! Are you there, respond, goddamnit!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m here, Captain Grundy. Sitrep please, I will head to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Three miles northwest from camp! Check the path of the electrical storm, we chased after it! Hurry! Two of us are down! Immediate evac needed!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Klara&amp;#39;s optic sensors whirred as they focused on the tiny, ant-like figures in the distance. There was... something else there too, something she did not immediately recognise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Crew has been located, but various members have suffered critical injuries. Chances of survival for them are negligible. Source of threat has not been eliminated either. Sensors verify that a quadrupedal organism, approximately two hundred feet in height, is responsible for both the EMP pulse and the injuries caused to the crew. Organism is likely generating the electrical storm as a defense mechanism. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Klara! Are you on your way! Goddamnit you crap bucket of bolts, we&amp;#39;re not going to make it without you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please wait, Captain Grundy. I am processing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait? Get your ass over here, or I swear I will dismantle you myself!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Klara was, indeed, processing the various data streams gushing in. She weighed the probability that she herself would escape unscathed, if she ventured that close to the creature roaming the vast plains on Mars. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She considered the chance of actually saving any of them, calculating whether their biodome would even be capable of sustaining them in their present conditions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, she evaluated the likelihood that her missives, her reports, would fail to reach headquarters if she were to falter now. She was keenly aware that without those, the mission would surely be a bust, that funding would dry up, that no one else on Earth would ever venture this far out again, to unravel the myriad mysteries beckoning so seductively. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The First Directive, that the mission succeed at all costs, kicked in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Klara disengaged the medical kits, and routed all resources to recording the scene before her. She noted that the massive organism exhibited characteristics not unlike an ox, in the way it circled the crew, stamping the ground, preparing to charge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Attached recordings strongly suggest significant returns for further forays to Mars.

A cold-blooded robot, who slaughtered all his human crewmates in a stormy night. The surge of electric and magnetic flux certainly made him different. He was freed from ethnic restrictions, namely, the three laws of robotics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he transformed. Dan did not know what he had become, but he was certainly clever enough to find out for the rest of the day. Getting up, the robot summoned a vehicle.

But then I'd be getting O2 warnings... no, Chris would be able to regulate it manually.\n\nSo I'll maintain life support for the labs and the greenhouse ice everything else... good, generator now at 35% capacity. \n\nMore to follow in morning.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is anyone there?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My cold, robotic voice calls out in one empty white room after another.

There is no reply. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Analysis: solar storm caused failure of the main generator, minor EM spike probably damaged some drives, likely the cause of communication failure.  Expected time is 11pm of of mission day 112. Actual time is approximately 1pm. MALP time error suggests I&amp;#39;ve been inactive for longer than that. Probable Martian time is 13:33 day 115. I&amp;#39;ve slept for 3 and a half days, the CO2 levels should be through the roof. None of my crew seem to be on base though, I can&amp;#39;t ping their GPS but if I can&amp;#39;t connect to a satellite then what do I expect? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need eyes on the lander and the com&amp;#39;s rig, if I call the MALP home I can take direct control at have a look. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m alone. I&amp;#39;ve never been alone before. Even When I first awoke in a computer on earth I was greeted by Julie, my creator, poor Julie. I was sent ahead of the mission by a year but even on the 6 month journey here I had continuous radio connection to earth. In the year I spent constructing the base and waiting for my crew to arrive I talked with Julie and mission control daily almost hourly even. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And obviously once my crew did arrive we were never parted till now. &amp;quot;Please, is anyone there? Talk to me.&amp;quot; No, I don&amp;#39;t like this. It&amp;#39;s not supposed to happen. I wasn&amp;#39;t built to be alone. Even now my stream of thought is conversational, probably a readout somewhere... yes, actually it is. The monitor in Julie&amp;#39;s room . &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main generator has failed. That&amp;#39;s ok. With no crew The secondary generator it plenty. Especially with supplementation from the solar panels during the day. I suppose I should have the MALP check on it just the same. If it&amp;#39;s gone into meltdown then mission control will... but I can&amp;#39;t contact them anyway... I guess I should still check...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life support seems somewhat redundant now. I should pull the oxygen back into storage. I can put the base in construction mode, 25% pressure, all CO2. It will save power and prevent fire. But I can&amp;#39;t see in the labs... there might be test animals in there. Or maybe Chris. If the power is out then he wouldn&amp;#39;t hear me. He wouldn&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m back online. But then I&amp;#39;d be getting O2 warnings... no, Chris would be able to regulate it manually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ll maintain life support for the labs and the greenhouse ice everything else... good, generator now at 35% capacity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More to follow in morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg510tl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491978145.0, "created_utc": 1491949345.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
