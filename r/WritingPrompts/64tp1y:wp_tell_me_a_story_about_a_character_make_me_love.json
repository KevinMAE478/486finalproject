eating his lunch, on the hillside park bench overlooking the harbour with a smile and a ray of sun on his face. The cool breeze twisted his black hair and the birds sang their songs of love on the branches of the willow tree above him. His heart raced as Allison approached, he wasn't sure if she would even show after he finally got the nerve to ask her to have lunch with him. He knew from the moment he saw her that he was in love, and the way she smiled every time she saw him did nothing to repress that feeling. \n\n\"Hey there,\" Allison said with a nervous laugh as she approached. \"Can I sit with you?\" \n\n\"Of course\" Gregory replied as he cleared his tweed jacket and briefcase from the spot next to him and beckoned her with his hand. \"I wasn't sure if you were going to come\" he added, internally sighing after realizing how awkward it sounded. \n\nBut Allison simply smiled and said \"I can't believe you took so much time to ask,\"  adding a playful push to Gregory's shoulder. Picking up the plastic container, Gregory offered some of his food to Allison. \"Oh, thank you but I don't want to eat your food!\" she said. \n\n\"No, it's fine,\" he replied before lying \"I always bring two in case I have to stay late.\" In reality he had made two the night before in hopes that Allison would accept his request and he could show her some of his skills. It was a white lie, but again he felt it would have been too awkward if he admitted the truth. Gregory had always been socially anxious, clumsy in his speech, and these traits tripled in the presence of women.

She apologised with a laugh, and Gregory smiled back, not fearing the look he may get from commuters noticing the stain later, only thinking about this beautiful woman in his presence, he was in awe. \n\nAllison's eyes were twisted in the grass below her feet as she spoke up. \"Can I ask you a question?\" \n\n\"Of course\" he replied. \n\n\"Is everything okay? You left the office looking pretty upset on Friday. I wanted to call you, but I didn't know if that was okay or not...\" she said, her voice shrinking at the end. \n\nWith a sigh and a sniffle Gregory was taken back from the wonderful moment to his life's reality. \"Yeah, well no. I got a call that my dog had been injured and I rushed home. He uh.... is longer with us.\" \n\n\"Oh god, I'm so sorry\" Allison said as she embraced Gregory and felt a tear forming in her own eye thinking of her elderly pup, Kaiser. \"It's never easy losing a good friend. I'm sure you gave him the greatest life ever.\" \n\n\"I did. I raised Munchkin from a puppy after finding him abandoned in a parking lot twelve years ago.

Snapping a photograph, she smiled, noting how much each of them looked like their father. They were all daddy&amp;#39;s boys and resembled him in appearance and temperament. She could hardly remember herself before her ex-husband, he had given her a life that she had never expected. Opening up her text messages, she sent the photo to him with the caption, &amp;#39;All thanks to you, my dear. xx&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She turned the lamp back off and slumped down beside the bed, closing her eyes in rest. She was so tired all the time. Other mothers told her to nap when the toddler&amp;#39;s nap, but she always had too much to do to heed their advice. Just this once, she decided to take a few minutes of peace before the house was once again a commotion of tears and yelling. Moments of silence were rare in this household.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the sound of sirens roused her from her sleep, she swept the three shells on the carpet under the bed, and looking over her sons&amp;#39; bodies,  put the gun to her own temple, whispering &amp;#39;If I can&amp;#39;t have you, no one can.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5kgun", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492007364.0, "created_utc": 1491978564.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tp1y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tp1y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tp1y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tp1y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tp1y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5dj96", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JayAtCampmixup", "parent_id": "t1_dg5cm2z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "i guess i will...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i guess i will...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5dj96", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491994795.0, "created_utc": 1491965995.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5cm2z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lw01", "parent_id": "t1_dg5af7x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's pretty good, I encourage u to keep on posting on writing prompts", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s pretty good, I encourage u to keep on posting on writing prompts&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5cm2z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491993509.0, "created_utc": 1491964709.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tp1y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tp1y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6qhcy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JayAtCampmixup", "parent_id": "t1_dg5kf7e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "lol", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg6qhcy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492067552.0, "created_utc": 1492038752.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5kf7e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HowIMetYourBreevis", "parent_id": "t1_dg5af7x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I liked it.
