Barely cried for anything. He was always laughing and smiling, reaching out to grab anything he could reach. It only got worse once he learned to move around on his own. A little menace he was, scampering from room to room, giggling hysterically as we chased after him. We always were running after him.\n\nHis first word had been 'Mama.' I knew it was almost cliche at that point but my heart nearly burst when I heard it. Soon others would join it of course, but I always remembered the first time I heard it.

I remember shortly after his 5th birthday he had been invited over to play with a neighbour's daughter and he barely said a word to her. We were worried at first, but after a while he started just talking and talking. They became the best of friends in what seemed like minutes. He could always make her laugh and she made him smile brighter than the sun. \n\nHe always was in such awe at everything around him. He always wanted to know more, asking questions faster than we could answer. He ran around, looking at everything he could, just trying to figure it out. We would always buy him books on the things he was interested in, and trips to the library were a weekly occurence. His enthusiasm about the world was incredible and I couldn't help but get excited whenever we searched for new knowledge and facts. \n\nI sit there, continuing to think about our life so far. Memories flood by me. His 6th birthday party, just last month, he was so happy to be with everyone and we found out he was terrified of clowns. His first day of school where he was near tears as I waved from the doorway. His first steps, tottering carefully into my arms. So many happy times, almost too many to count. \n\nI try to avoid it but slowly the other thoughts spill in. The flashes of light. The crunching of glass and the screeching of metal.

The sounds of doctors and nurses yelling and rushing around. Waking up alone, until a nurse comes in to answer my endless questions. \n\nAll this has brought me here. Sitting with my boy in my arms in the bright room, surrounded by the beeping and whirring of machines. I softly brush a bit of his hair off his forehead, pressing my lips against the edge of where skin met gauze. They explained to me what happened. How the other driver had been drinking of course. That it forced us off the road. How a large branch crashed through the back window, striking my son in the head. How I would never see his smile again, never hear his voice. Never even see him open his eyes. I sit here now, knowing all I can, and making a choice. \n\nMeeting the eyes of the nurse who had been waiting patiently, I nod softly. His eyes fill with pain but he turns to give the news. Solemnly they enter, quietly starting the process of turning everything off. \n\nI clutch my sweet boy closer to my chest, humming the song he always asked for before he went to sleep. Even as machines are switched off, and the machine giving air to his lungs ceases causing his chest to still, I hold him. Pressing my lips firmly against his brow, I continue to hum, the melody becoming stilted as I hold back the sobs that want to rip their way out of my chest.

No one has ever had an effect on me quite like you. Unfortunately, I have been trapped in my own mind lately. It seems as if they don't like me the way you do. They tell me that I'm only going to hurt you, that I will never be good enough for you. At first they whispered it, but now they are screaming at me. I think they might be right. I will never be as good as you. I try to be open with you and show my love that way, but they keep telling me that I'm doing it wrong. The noise is deafening. I can't take it anymore. Make it stop. Please! Why didn't you ever help me?! I know this isn't your fault. You've never been anything but good to me. You've treated me like a princess since the beginning. Something isn't right though. Something with me. I'm afraid I can't be fixed and I can feel it getting worse. It's taking over. I love you. Please don't ever forget that I love you. I have to do this though because I don't want them to hurt you. I have to stop them. It will be okay though. We can be happy once they're gone. I can fix this.\n~Forever\"\n\n\"Baby,\nEveryone keeps telling me to move on but I can't. I think of you always. I hear you laughing, I see you dancing around my room, you're still here aren't you? I rub my eyes but you're still standing there smiling at me with that beautiful smile of yours. I reach out to touch you but I can't. You are always out of reach. What I wouldn't give to hold you again. To kiss you. To run my fingers through your hair as you sleep on my chest. Why did you leave me baby? You are my everything. My better half. I try to be functional, to do what's expected of me, but I can't do it anymore. I can't pretend like I am not broken, wandering around this life that has no meaning since you left me. I am nothing without you and I cannot take one more minute of this miserable life in which you are only alive in my memories. I'm on my way baby, you don't have to wait any longer.

She did everything with such passion and intensity. I used to watch her when we were together. She had so many different expressions and I loved watching them dance across her face while I tried to figure out what they meant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was so open with me and I knew I could ask her anything, but she kept certain things to herself and I could never bring myself to ask her about them. There were times where she would look troubled, lost in her thoughts. As soon as she noticed I was looking though, that beautiful smile would surface and she would go back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love her so much. She came to me broken and I tried so hard to put her back together. I thought she was happy. She always talked about how happy I made her and how she couldn&amp;#39;t wait for our future together. We made so many plans. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My love,\nYou are the most incredible man I know. You have accepted me despite all of my flaws and I will never be able to repay you for that. To love you has been a privilege and to be loved by you has truly been a blessing. I cannot express to you how appreciative I am of you, for you have always respected me and made me feel comfortable in my own skin. Because of you, I know that I am beautiful. I FEEL beautiful. No one has ever had an effect on me quite like you. Unfortunately, I have been trapped in my own mind lately. It seems as if they don&amp;#39;t like me the way you do. They tell me that I&amp;#39;m only going to hurt you, that I will never be good enough for you. At first they whispered it, but now they are screaming at me. I think they might be right. I will never be as good as you. I try to be open with you and show my love that way, but they keep telling me that I&amp;#39;m doing it wrong. The noise is deafening. I can&amp;#39;t take it anymore. Make it stop. Please! Why didn&amp;#39;t you ever help me?! I know this isn&amp;#39;t your fault. You&amp;#39;ve never been anything but good to me. You&amp;#39;ve treated me like a princess since the beginning. Something isn&amp;#39;t right though. Something with me. I&amp;#39;m afraid I can&amp;#39;t be fixed and I can feel it getting worse. It&amp;#39;s taking over. I love you. Please don&amp;#39;t ever forget that I love you. I have to do this though because I don&amp;#39;t want them to hurt you. I have to stop them. It will be okay though. We can be happy once they&amp;#39;re gone. I can fix this.\n~Forever&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Baby,\nEveryone keeps telling me to move on but I can&amp;#39;t. I think of you always. I hear you laughing, I see you dancing around my room, you&amp;#39;re still here aren&amp;#39;t you? I rub my eyes but you&amp;#39;re still standing there smiling at me with that beautiful smile of yours. I reach out to touch you but I can&amp;#39;t. You are always out of reach. What I wouldn&amp;#39;t give to hold you again. To kiss you. To run my fingers through your hair as you sleep on my chest. Why did you leave me baby? You are my everything. My better half. I try to be functional, to do what&amp;#39;s expected of me, but I can&amp;#39;t do it anymore. I can&amp;#39;t pretend like I am not broken, wandering around this life that has no meaning since you left me. I am nothing without you and I cannot take one more minute of this miserable life in which you are only alive in my memories. I&amp;#39;m on my way baby, you don&amp;#39;t have to wait any longer. We can finally be together in a world free of our pain.\nXO&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg8yney", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492191262.0, "created_utc": 1492162462.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658rh4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658rh4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658rh4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg98uwv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "low_calorie_doughnut", "parent_id": "t1_dg8yym8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I really appreciate that, thank you", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate that, thank you&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg98uwv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492211274.0, "created_utc": 1492182474.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8yym8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kz1229", "parent_id": "t1_dg8yv4r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So good", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So good&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg8yym8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492192278.0, "created_utc": 1492163478.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8yv4r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "low_calorie_doughnut", "parent_id": "t3_658rh4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just last week, I remember her looking at me. Her soft smile made my heart jump a little, as it always does, and it makes me strive to do whatever I can with the hope that she may reward me with another. I saw the stars in her eyes; I have ever since I met her. She is both kind and aggressive, the kind of woman other women would strive to be.\n\n     She always puts others first, no matter the consequences for her. \"How can I expect someone to be kind to me if I'm not kind to them?\" she says. I remember one time, years ago, an older lady's puppy got away from her and ran out into the street. She saw that the lady didn't have the ability to chase the dog, so she did it for her. She promptly broke her leg when a car hit her. But the puppy was unscathed, thanks to her. I was horrified. Tears of pain streamed down her face, but she just laughed. \"Totally worth it,\" she said. \"But like take me to the hospital now, 'cause I need medical assistance,\" she laughed again, \"and the look on your face indicates to me that you're not any kind of medical professional.\" A wordy quip, but it was effective. I was insulted and nauseous at the same time.\n\n     \"Incredible,\" I think to myself. \"What an incredible woman.\" Every single day. It didn't take long before I knew she was the one I would marry. I never thought I would meet the perfect woman, but she had appeared to me by what I can only describe as the grace of god, and I intended never to let her go. We started our new life together, and built a family. We were married two years when we had our first baby. As a mother, she has no fault. She was born for this.

I ask about her too, but she never really seems to want to talk about her life, outside our family. Or... she didn't.\n\n     I should have asked her. I should have pried. I should have taken more interest in her change in behavior. At the time, it seemed just subtle, the way she talked differently, the way she moved a little more slowly. Looking back I see it, clear as day. I don't know how I failed to notice before. I failed her. I wish I had done more for her, to prove that I love her and that she is the most important thing to me, along with our daughter. I wish I realized what was happening, so that I could make sure she knew just how important she was.\n\n     Our baby cries, knowing that her mother is no longer there to comfort her. I try to ease her pain at least a little, but I was never quite as good at it as she was. I feel numb. When I'm not focusing on my child, I can't convince myself to move. My mind sees nothing but but the things I never did for my wife. I can't help but blame myself, even though they tell me that it's not my fault, that nobody could have known. I should have. \n\n     She used to say that she wanted to be a pilot, because flying through the air made her feel free.

I can't tell you how delighted I am to be able to live forever with the girl of my dreams. \n\nWe are nearly out of the hospital.  Oh how beautiful she looks ! She looks me in the eye ,puts her hands on my waist and kisses me with all her passion . I kiss her back. \" It's our time now baby,\" she says. I smile . I'm lost for words and before I know it an ocean of salty tears are running down my cheek. The words get trapped in my throat. As if she knows what I'm trying to say, she puts her finger to her pink lips to tell me I don't have to say a word . We are one door away from our future. An eternity of love and care . Jessica runs for the door. No - for our future . Outside this hospital is our future. I grip her hand to stop her. \" Let's do it together darling ,\" I exclaim. She nods and links her fingers through mine . One step. Two step. Three. We sprint . No one can stop us. It was us against the world and we won. We're free. It's our time now. She wraps her arms around me and squeezes me so tightly I can just about breath. The sun gleaming down on our backs. I want to live in this moment forever . Just me holding her close to my chest. Protecting my everything.  And then as if it was too good to be true I hear what will torment my heart for an eternity.\n\nBANG!!! What the hell was that? I cover my ears . \" Are you ...\" No it can't be. She slumps to the ground . My Jessica falls lifelessly against the cold ,damp earth. How can this be ? I try to move but I can't . I'm frozen in fright . I know she's gone. I see her lips move one last time telling me that she loves me . And then her eyes close .

My wonderful lover was now ok . I thought she was going to die a cold and lonely death when we first found out she had breast cancer, but no. She&amp;#39;s alive. Alive and smiling at me with her wonderful smile . The same smile I saw the day I met my better half. The same smile that made me fall in love with an angel. It&amp;#39;s time for us to get on with our lives together . Just us ; me and her in our own home cuddling under a blanket. After all the pain  there is light at the end of the tunnel.
