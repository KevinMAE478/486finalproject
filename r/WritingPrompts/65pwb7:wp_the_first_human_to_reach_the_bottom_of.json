How could one not in the most advanced suit in human existence. The suit had an interior heating and cooling system, complete communications suite, and multiple compartments for drinks and snacks. His suit was currently broadcasting to the entire world, and though Jim felt comfortable indeed, he also felt overwhelmingly nervous. His fear warred with his veterancy in a private battle within his mind. He had been training for this moment his entire life.

How're you feeling?\" \n\n\nJim took a moment to collect his thoughts, \"I'm feeling ready for a new start!\" The strength of his voice surprised even him, and he heard a burst of cheers from the crew come through the speakers. His handler, Jim couldn't even remember his name in his nervousness, opened the private channel, \"The people on Earth loved that one Jim, keep it up.\" \n\n\nAs Jim continued his descent, his thoughts took on a meditative state, feeling the water rush through his fingers from the suit's sensors. Hearing the deep sounds of the ocean. The flow of his thought's was interrupted by his handler an indeterminate amount of time later. \n\n\"It should be coming up now Jim. You ready for this?\" \n\n\nJim said nothing, but his thoughts said *Dear God I hope so.* \n\n\nThe Reset Button came into view suddenly, slightly bigger than his hand, and clearly labeled.

When they finally got back to land, Jim and the crew walked around the base in utter shock. Everything was frozen. It was like time had stopped.

I guess I'm telling you this. Anyways man, so before you fucked up, we fucked up...a lot of times. Well not so much as your fucked up territory claiming species did but we did have ours. But way way way back when Earth 1 was created, by us, our leader had a brilliant idea.
