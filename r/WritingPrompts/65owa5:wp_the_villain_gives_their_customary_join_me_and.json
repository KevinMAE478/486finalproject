Really, do you even have a plan after you somehow end up in charge?\"\n\nThe girl before me had a point, most supervillains, even those who actually did want to do good at first, fell to the corruption that their powers brought eventually.

I don't ask to  your help in staging a takeover, rather your influence to guide a few well meaning but misguided people in power.

Tell me one more time what happened.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, it&amp;#39;s hard to remember.  It all happened sort of fast.  We were on the catwalk, and I was, you know, I was..  well, it was a lightsaber fight, and I&amp;#39;m -&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Palpatine spoke in unison with Vader, in a tired singsong, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good a lightsaber fights,&amp;quot; then rolled his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Um, right... well, I am.  So you know, I went and I lopped his hand off -&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Palpatine held up a hand in a &amp;#39;stop&amp;#39; motion.  &amp;quot;You lopped his hand off?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, yeah,&amp;quot; said Vader.  &amp;quot;It was right there and I thought it would underline my point pretty well.  So I lopped off his hand, and it and the lightsaber go tumbling down this impossibly deep hole - they really need to watch how they build those cloud platforms.  Huge hole right where anyone can fall in.  It&amp;#39;s a lawyers&amp;#39; field day.  Anyway, he&amp;#39;s hanging off of this gantry whining and sniveling and it just kind of... uh..  came out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; came out, Anakin?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vader muttered quickly, like a disclaimer at the end of a landspeeder commercial.  &amp;quot;Joinmeandwe&amp;#39;llrulethegalaxytogetherasfatherandson.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what did he do then?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He said okay.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah.  He was like, sniveling a little, and then he was like, &amp;#39;Okay&amp;#39;.  I really didn&amp;#39;t expect him to agree...  It just sounded like a good thing to say, you know, to like..  make him feel like I cared or something.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Palpatine groaned.  &amp;quot;Like you &lt;em&gt;cared&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah,&amp;quot; said Vader. &amp;quot;I felt bad for the guy.  You didn&amp;#39;t see this lightsaber fight.  He came in expecting to win and got totally trashed because I&amp;#39;m -&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In unison again, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good at lightsaber fights.&amp;quot;  Another groan from Palpatine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So now what?&amp;quot; Vader asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you mean, now what?&amp;quot;  Palpatine shot back.  &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s only two Sith.  Those are the rules.  There can&amp;#39;t be three Sith.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where does it say that?&amp;quot; asked Vader.  &amp;quot;We could have three Sith.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s in the handbook,&amp;quot; said Palpatine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, let&amp;#39;s change the handbook,&amp;quot; said Vader.  &amp;quot;What do we need to change the handbook?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A vote.  I vote no change.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I vote we change it to three Sith,&amp;quot; said Vader.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Split decision,&amp;quot; replied Palpatine.  &amp;quot;In a split decision, nothing changes.  Exar Kun and his apprentice tried to change that a while back, but they ended up in a split decision so it didn&amp;#39;t change.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vader put his hand to his face mask.  &amp;quot;This is going to be so awkward.  I&amp;#39;m going to have to go out there and tell him he can&amp;#39;t be a sith.  What do we do?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Palpatine shrugged.  &amp;quot;Bring him in here and we&amp;#39;ll just all agree to tell the story like he never agreed to anything, and then we&amp;#39;ll fight, and we can put this whole thing behind us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay,&amp;quot; said Vader, and headed for the throne room door.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgcpktr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492412022.0, "created_utc": 1492383222.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65owa5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgct194", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "I-need-no-username", "parent_id": "t3_65owa5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"...We could rule this world!
