You\u2019ve recovered less than half of the body! How on Earth do you intend to interrogate him?\u201d\n\nThe military man seemed somehow even less bothered by Wilson\u2019s outburst than before. He silently took a report from the folder in his right hand and placed it on the table. Wilson recognized it immediately.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been informed that you have a way to change that,\u201d the man continued.\n\nWilson clutched his fists and gritted his teeth. He hoped to never again revisit that research.\n\n\u201cDr. Emmett, if you want to do this the hard way I have the resources, believe me, but I\u2019d much rather solve this peacefully and quickly.\u201d The man leaned over the table, his face a hand\u2019s breadth from Wilson\u2019s. \u201cI understand your moral qualms with this research, but I can\u2019t sacrifice the lives of my men for your sentimental delusions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSentimental delusions?\u201d Wilson heard blood rushing in his ears. \u201cOh, it has nothing to do with morals or ethics. Do you know what happens to them after? Do you know what they become? Do you understand what doing that to an enemy may cause? You come here without even knowing the cost of things!\u201d\n\nFor the first time, the man\u2019s eyes flashed. His mouth curled into a sneer of contempt.\n\n\u201cCost, doctor? You want to preach to me about cost? Do you know how many of my men die out there each day? Do you know how many families are going to be receiving a casket and an apology we\u2019re sick of repeating over and over again? Do you know what some of them would see if they could open those caskets? Whatever your cost is, it can\u2019t be too high at this point!\u201d\n\nWilson sighed and gripped the desk to stop his hands from trembling.\n\n\u201cIs the brain intact?\u201d he asked, staring down at the report.\n\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ll order the body to be delivered today.\u201d\n\nWilson continued to read and re-read the sheet of paper before him, as the sound of military boots hitting the floor was eventually joined by the creak of the door.\n\n---\n\nWilson worked on the mangled mass of flesh tirelessly. Being focused helped to keep his mind off *what* he was doing and what happened last time. Wilson knew he didn\u2019t need to stitch the body together perfectly. It was more about removing unfixable parts than trying to repair what remained. He just needed to give it room to grow.\n\nSatisfied with the result, he turned to the room behind the glass and motioned for them to bring in the reagent. Two assistants in scrubs entered, carrying a container sealed with a number lock and set it on the table by Wilson. He nodded to them and entered the code into the lock. Four syringes, five slots.\n\nWilson carefully took a syringe filled with a bright green liquid and brought it up to the subject\u2019s spine. The needle slid in between two vertebrae. Wilson stared at it in disbelief. Images of things not living and not dead flashed before his eyes. His hand began to tremble. Seeing the concerned looks on the faces of his assistants, he sighed and drove the plunger in.\n\nThe flesh began growing, connecting, sewing itself back together. Tendons and muscle sprawled out like vines, nerves spread out in a web, even bones slowly inched forward, rebuilding the body. As the process began accelerating, Wilson turned away. The last thing he heard before exiting the operating room was the irregular wheezing sound of unsteady breathing.\n\n\u201cAre you sure it will work?\u201d the same military man that had come into his office that morning asked. \u201cWhat if the process fails half-way through?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will work,\u201d Wilson said, discarding his gloves and mask. \u201cThe process never fails. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long to wait? When will it stop?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be about two hours until the body is fully restored, but the process doesn\u2019t stop. Ever. The formula will reverse any and all injuries, even severe brain damage. On top of that, it will keep the whole body functioning under otherwise impossible conditions. You\u2019d better guard *that thing* well. Better than the last one at least.\u201d\n\nMuffled screams of pain began sounding from the closed off operation room.\n\n---\n\n\u201cWhy did you drag me here?\u201d Wilson asked, looking at his subject through reinforced glass.\n\nIt was chained to a chair in a room with metal walls. He felt a sudden wave of nausea as the thing unknowingly made eye contact with him. Wilson didn\u2019t consider it human. It was hard for him to even accept it as alive. At best it was a mass of sentient cancer looking back at him, and that thought terrified him.\n\n\u201cIt may prove useful,\u201d the same military man Wilson had met twice already answered. \u201cWe will be employing some unconventional methods.\u201d\n\nHe pressed a button on the panel before him and spoke into the microphone.\n\n\u201cState your name and rank.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t answer.\n\n\u201cName and rank! Now!\u201d\n\nHe moved his hand over to a different button on the panel, but the subject answered first.\n\n\u201cVictor Kalinin, lieutenant.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was a series of questions Wilson didn\u2019t understand. It answered to most with a \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. The interrogator was clearly getting impatient.\n\n\u201cLieutenant, it seems you don\u2019t understand the situation you\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nHe pressed the button and sparks began flying off the chair. The thing screamed, writhing in pain. It said something in what sounded like Russian, though by the look on the interrogator\u2019s face it most likely wasn\u2019t the answer to the question.\n\n\u201cThis will only make it longer,\u201d he said, pressing the button again. \u201cI don\u2019t like doing this either, but I need answers, lieutenant.\u201d\n\nAnother shock, another scream. It repeated over and over again. A few veins on the subject\u2019s skin bursted from the shock and immediately regrew. At some points its speech became completely unintelligible. After what felt like hours, it shouted out a set of coordinates and what sounded like codewords. The interrogator immediately got up and left, motioning to Wilson to remain in his seat.\n\nAfter about ten minutes he returned with a smile on his face.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve saved a lot of lives, Dr. Emmett.\u201d He put his hand on Wilson\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019d love to find better application for your work, but the orders from high up are to dispose of the subject.\u201d\n\nA wry smiled creeped onto Wilson\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cAnd how do you intend to do that? I\u2019ve told you already; the process can\u2019t be stopped\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll have to confirm that ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe man pressed a different button on the panel, and Wilson, heard gas rushing into the subject\u2019s room. After a minute or two of waiting, the man pressed the shock button again, and an inferno roared in the metal chamber, incinerating everything in its path.\n\nAs the flames died down, there was only a cloud of ash and an empty metal chair left in the room. Wilson knew it wouldn\u2019t end that easily. Little by little, the pieces of ash began converging into a small ball. Soon it grew to the size of a fist, gaining a red colour and a muscle-like structure.\n\nAs the gas began seeping in again, the flesh formed a mouth and lungs, both much too small for a human.\n\n\u201cNo, please,\u201d it begged in a croaking inhuman voice. \u201cI told you everything.\u201d\n\nThe fire rose again. Another cloud of ash, another half-functioning organism.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d was all it managed to scream before the next blast.\n\nWilson had seen it all before. This wouldn\u2019t work, just like it hadn\u2019t last time. They were only making it more aware of its power. Perpetual containment was the only option.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d it whispered before another burn.\n\nThis time it began reforming much faster. A humanoid creature with what looked like bone instead of skin stood in the room in less than a few seconds.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me, can you?\u201d\n\nThe protective layer didn\u2019t help. As soon as the fire faded, the thing looking like a completely unscathed Victor Kalinin was sitting in the chair. It was laughing. Wilson saw sweat beading on the military man\u2019s forehead. He was unnerved as well. The previous subject didn\u2019t have this much control. Its laugh echoed even as it burned.\n\nTwo more cycles of maddening laughter and\u2026 nothing. Just a cloud of ash. No regeneration, no threats, no begging, no laughing. Simply nothing.\n\n\u201cDid we get him?\u201d the man asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe ash rushed towards the glass like a spike, striking at one point with incredible speed. A single bone at the end was all it needed. The glass cracked and ash began flooding the room. Laughing. There was no mouth, no lungs, not even a single solid organ, only a maddening shriek coming from nowhere and everywhere at once.\n\nToo late Wilson saw the single hand appearing out of ash beside the interrogator\u2019s holster. It grabbed the pistol and delivered three shots into his back. The rest of the body soon followed, but Wilson wasn\u2019t looking at the likeness of Victor Kalinin anymore. The old wrinkly skin, the straight emotionless face, even some organic mimicry of the neat military dress uniform, it was an exact double of the interrogator. It threw the original\u2019s body through the glass and turned on the pumps supplying gas for the burn.\n\nWilson was trembling. The thing turned to him and smiled.\n\n\u201cYou must be the doctor, right?\u201d The voice was exactly the same as well. \u201cI suppose I should thank you.\u201d\n\nIt took the gun and threw it to his feet. Hoping for a miracle, Wilson rushed for it. The thing let him. Shot after shot, he saw its body simply revert back to still smoldering ash and reform, letting the bullet through. The thing calmly walked up to him and grabbed Wilson\u2019s wrist. Its hand was scorchingly hot.\n\n\u201cNo, I think you misunderstood.\u201d\n\nIt brought the gun to Wilson\u2019s temple.\n\n---\n\n*As always, constructive criticism, general impressions, comments, and questions are all very much welcome and appreciated.

You\u2019ve recovered less than half of the body! How on Earth do you intend to interrogate him?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The military man seemed somehow even less bothered by Wilson\u2019s outburst than before. He silently took a report from the folder in his right hand and placed it on the table. Wilson recognized it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve been informed that you have a way to change that,\u201d the man continued.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wilson clutched his fists and gritted his teeth. He hoped to never again revisit that research.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDr. Emmett, if you want to do this the hard way I have the resources, believe me, but I\u2019d much rather solve this peacefully and quickly.\u201d The man leaned over the table, his face a hand\u2019s breadth from Wilson\u2019s. \u201cI understand your moral qualms with this research, but I can\u2019t sacrifice the lives of my men for your sentimental delusions.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSentimental delusions?\u201d Wilson heard blood rushing in his ears. \u201cOh, it has nothing to do with morals or ethics. Do you know what happens to them after? Do you know what they become? Do you understand what doing that to an enemy may cause? You come here without even knowing the cost of things!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time, the man\u2019s eyes flashed. His mouth curled into a sneer of contempt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCost, doctor? You want to preach to me about cost? Do you know how many of my men die out there each day? Do you know how many families are going to be receiving a casket and an apology we\u2019re sick of repeating over and over again? Do you know what some of them would see if they could open those caskets? Whatever your cost is, it can\u2019t be too high at this point!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wilson sighed and gripped the desk to stop his hands from trembling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIs the brain intact?\u201d he asked, staring down at the report.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYes. I\u2019ll order the body to be delivered today.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wilson continued to read and re-read the sheet of paper before him, as the sound of military boots hitting the floor was eventually joined by the creak of the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wilson worked on the mangled mass of flesh tirelessly. Being focused helped to keep his mind off &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; he was doing and what happened last time. Wilson knew he didn\u2019t need to stitch the body together perfectly. It was more about removing unfixable parts than trying to repair what remained. He just needed to give it room to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Satisfied with the result, he turned to the room behind the glass and motioned for them to bring in the reagent. Two assistants in scrubs entered, carrying a container sealed with a number lock and set it on the table by Wilson. He nodded to them and entered the code into the lock. Four syringes, five slots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wilson carefully took a syringe filled with a bright green liquid and brought it up to the subject\u2019s spine. The needle slid in between two vertebrae. Wilson stared at it in disbelief. Images of things not living and not dead flashed before his eyes. His hand began to tremble. Seeing the concerned looks on the faces of his assistants, he sighed and drove the plunger in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The flesh began growing, connecting, sewing itself back together. Tendons and muscle sprawled out like vines, nerves spread out in a web, even bones slowly inched forward, rebuilding the body. As the process began accelerating, Wilson turned away. The last thing he heard before exiting the operating room was the irregular wheezing sound of unsteady breathing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you sure it will work?\u201d the same military man that had come into his office that morning asked. \u201cWhat if the process fails half-way through?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt will work,\u201d Wilson said, discarding his gloves and mask. \u201cThe process never fails. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow long to wait? When will it stop?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt will be about two hours until the body is fully restored, but the process doesn\u2019t stop. Ever. The formula will reverse any and all injuries, even severe brain damage. On top of that, it will keep the whole body functioning under otherwise impossible conditions. You\u2019d better guard &lt;em&gt;that thing&lt;/em&gt; well. Better than the last one at least.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Muffled screams of pain began sounding from the closed off operation room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy did you drag me here?\u201d Wilson asked, looking at his subject through reinforced glass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was chained to a chair in a room with metal walls. He felt a sudden wave of nausea as the thing unknowingly made eye contact with him. Wilson didn\u2019t consider it human. It was hard for him to even accept it as alive. At best it was a mass of sentient cancer looking back at him, and that thought terrified him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt may prove useful,\u201d the same military man Wilson had met twice already answered. \u201cWe will be employing some unconventional methods.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He pressed a button on the panel before him and spoke into the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cState your name and rank.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn\u2019t answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cName and rank! Now!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He moved his hand over to a different button on the panel, but the subject answered first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cVictor Kalinin, lieutenant.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What followed was a series of questions Wilson didn\u2019t understand.

Just minutes before Harry had called him with a panic in his voice that Sean had never heard before. He demanded that Sean come over at once, but refused to explain why.\n\nHarry's house had an eerie look to it in the moonlight. Sean parked his car in the driveway, and walked through the long shadows from the looming oaks in the front yard to ring the bell. Harry answered the door looking white as a ghost. A weak smile worked its way across his ashen visage.\n\n\"Thanks for coming Sean,\" he said, opening the door wider to let Sean in. \"Come with me.\"\n\nSean followed him in. \"Sure thing Harry. Now are you going to-\"\n\nHis eyes widened as he saw why Harry had called him there. Erica was sprawled in a bloody heap at the bottom of their staircase, her head turned an unnatural direction.\n\n\"Oh my God. Jesus, Harry! Is she- Jesus, she's dead, isn't she?\"\n\nHarry nodded his head. \"Yes,\" he said softly.\n\nSean reached into his pocked, groping for his cell phone. \"We've gotta call the police, Harry.\"\n\nHarry walked over to him and put his arm on Sean to stop him. \"We can't call the police, Sean. It was an accident, but they won't see it that way. Erica had found out I was having an affair, and confronted me about it. She was obviously pretty upset, and there was a lot of yelling. I followed her as she started for the stairs. She slipped, and tumbled down. It was an accident. It was. But nobody but you is going to believe me.\"\n\n\"There aren't any other options here, Harry. I'm sorry, but it's what we've got to do.\"\n\n\"No, there's another option.\"\n\nSean furrowed his brow, waiting for Harry to elaborate.\n\n\"We can bring her back.\"\n\nSean stared at his friends face, trying to see if this was some kind of joke. \"You know why we can't do that.\"\n\n\"Horseshit. It's my wife Sean. We can bring her back. It's just like we wrote about in med school.\"\n\n\"'Can' isn't the point. Don't you remember what Professor Mooney told us? We weren't the first to write a paper about bringing someone back from the dead. But what comes back isn't the same. It's an abomination and it's dangerous.\"\n\n\"It's Erica, Sean! Erica. She's not dangerous. We can do this.\"\n\nSean rolled it around in his head. \"I just... I can't be apart of this. It's too dangerous.\"\n\n\"I need you Sean. You're a much better surgeon than I am. You've got to be the one to attach the electrodes to her.\" Harry held out a hand that shook violently. \"Look at me. I'm a mess.\"\n\nSean looked down at Erica's body. He thought of all the good times they'd had together. The brightness of her smile. He nodded slowly. \"Okay. But if Mooney is right, and she comes back changed, we put her down.\"\n\nHarry smiled. \"She won't. But deal.\"\n\nThe two of them got to work. They set up a table in the garage and laid Erica's body out on it. While Harry worked on setting up the power supply from the dryer outlet and their cars' batteries, Sean placed makeshift electrodes - just screws, really - throughout Erica's body. He carefully connected them to key points in her nervous system, just like they had written about years ago.\n\nAfter a couple of hours, they were ready. They sent a large charge coursing through her body for a minute, which caused Erica's muscles to tighten. Then they sent quick pulses at the rate of a heart beat. They kept at this for ten minutes, then stopped. \n\nEven though they had stopped sending electricity, her body kept twitching in the same rhythm. Sean's eyes widened. It was working. Suddenly she sat up, taking a deep gasping breath like she'd been underwater for too long.\n\n\"Erica!\" Harry called excitedly.\n\nShe scanned the room slowly, like she was trying to understand what was happening.\n\nHarry moved to her. \"You're alright honey. You had an accident, but Sean and I helped you. You're okay now.\"\n\nErica fixed her gaze on Harry. She moved her mouth a couple of times before finally getting some words out. \"You pushed me,\" she said in a ragged voice.\n\n\"No, no I didn't. You're just confused. It was an accident.\"\n\nShe tightened her jaw. \"You pushed me down the stairs when I said I was going to take everything in the divorce,\" she said more confidently. There was a terrifying coldness in her voice.\n\n\"Honey, you've been through a lot, but the point is-\"\n\nHarry flew backwards and slammed into the wall, shoved by some invisible force. In a flash, Erica was off the table, advancing on him.\n\n\"You tried to kill me you little worm!\"\n\n*****\n\nIf you enjoyed this, subscribe to [Pubby's Creative Workshop](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pubby88) to read more of my prompt responses.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctor Sean Weathers drove to his friend&amp;#39;s house, worried about what he would find there.

He demanded that Sean come over at once, but refused to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry&amp;#39;s house had an eerie look to it in the moonlight. Sean parked his car in the driveway, and walked through the long shadows from the looming oaks in the front yard to ring the bell. Harry answered the door looking white as a ghost. A weak smile worked its way across his ashen visage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks for coming Sean,&amp;quot; he said, opening the door wider to let Sean in. &amp;quot;Come with me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sean followed him in. &amp;quot;Sure thing Harry. Now are you going to-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes widened as he saw why Harry had called him there. Erica was sprawled in a bloody heap at the bottom of their staircase, her head turned an unnatural direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh my God. Jesus, Harry! Is she- Jesus, she&amp;#39;s dead, isn&amp;#39;t she?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry nodded his head. &amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; he said softly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sean reached into his pocked, groping for his cell phone. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve gotta call the police, Harry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry walked over to him and put his arm on Sean to stop him. &amp;quot;We can&amp;#39;t call the police, Sean. It was an accident, but they won&amp;#39;t see it that way. Erica had found out I was having an affair, and confronted me about it. She was obviously pretty upset, and there was a lot of yelling. I followed her as she started for the stairs. She slipped, and tumbled down. It was an accident. It was. But nobody but you is going to believe me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There aren&amp;#39;t any other options here, Harry. I&amp;#39;m sorry, but it&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve got to do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, there&amp;#39;s another option.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sean furrowed his brow, waiting for Harry to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We can bring her back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sean stared at his friends face, trying to see if this was some kind of joke. &amp;quot;You know why we can&amp;#39;t do that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Horseshit. It&amp;#39;s my wife Sean. We can bring her back. It&amp;#39;s just like we wrote about in med school.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;#39;Can&amp;#39; isn&amp;#39;t the point. Don&amp;#39;t you remember what Professor Mooney told us? We weren&amp;#39;t the first to write a paper about bringing someone back from the dead. But what comes back isn&amp;#39;t the same. It&amp;#39;s an abomination and it&amp;#39;s dangerous.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s Erica, Sean! Erica. She&amp;#39;s not dangerous. We can do this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sean rolled it around in his head. &amp;quot;I just... I can&amp;#39;t be apart of this. It&amp;#39;s too dangerous.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I need you Sean. You&amp;#39;re a much better surgeon than I am. You&amp;#39;ve got to be the one to attach the electrodes to her.&amp;quot; Harry held out a hand that shook violently. &amp;quot;Look at me. I&amp;#39;m a mess.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sean looked down at Erica&amp;#39;s body. He thought of all the good times they&amp;#39;d had together. The brightness of her smile. He nodded slowly. &amp;quot;Okay. But if Mooney is right, and she comes back changed, we put her down.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry smiled. &amp;quot;She won&amp;#39;t. But deal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two of them got to work. They set up a table in the garage and laid Erica&amp;#39;s body out on it. While Harry worked on setting up the power supply from the dryer outlet and their cars&amp;#39; batteries, Sean placed makeshift electrodes - just screws, really - throughout Erica&amp;#39;s body. He carefully connected them to key points in her nervous system, just like they had written about years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a couple of hours, they were ready. They sent a large charge coursing through her body for a minute, which caused Erica&amp;#39;s muscles to tighten. Then they sent quick pulses at the rate of a heart beat. They kept at this for ten minutes, then stopped. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though they had stopped sending electricity, her body kept twitching in the same rhythm. Sean&amp;#39;s eyes widened. It was working. Suddenly she sat up, taking a deep gasping breath like she&amp;#39;d been underwater for too long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Erica!&amp;quot; Harry called excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She scanned the room slowly, like she was trying to understand what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry moved to her. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re alright honey. You had an accident, but Sean and I helped you. You&amp;#39;re okay now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Erica fixed her gaze on Harry. She moved her mouth a couple of times before finally getting some words out. &amp;quot;You pushed me,&amp;quot; she said in a ragged voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, no I didn&amp;#39;t. You&amp;#39;re just confused. It was an accident.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tightened her jaw. &amp;quot;You pushed me down the stairs when I said I was going to take everything in the divorce,&amp;quot; she said more confidently. There was a terrifying coldness in her voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Honey, you&amp;#39;ve been through a lot, but the point is-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry flew backwards and slammed into the wall, shoved by some invisible force. In a flash, Erica was off the table, advancing on him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You tried to kill me you little worm!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed this, subscribe to &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Pubby88\"&gt;Pubby&amp;#39;s Creative Workshop&lt;/a&gt; to read more of my prompt responses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5va5u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492033231.0, "created_utc": 1492004431.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xjgp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xjgp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xjgp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xjgp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6lz6u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gabriel1313", "parent_id": "t1_dg6k7h0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you so much ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg6lz6u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061986.0, "created_utc": 1492033186.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6k7h0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pubby88", "parent_id": "t1_dg6de3g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Do a double line break to get separate paragraphs.

The auditorium is full of chatty students high in spirit for this is to be their final lecture upon graduation. Soon they would go out into the world of medicine to heal the ill and save the wounded. What is strange about this lecture, however, is the gentleman hosting this lecture; no one has ever seen him before. To anyone in this room, no one ever seems to recall seeing him in any course, faculty office, or even nearby coffee houses and restaurants. \n\nThe gentleman has an air of command around him that silenced half the audience as he walks to the center platform. He looks like a man beyond his years in experience and knowledge with his frizzy white hair, un-kept mustache, large black eyeglasses, and wrinkled pale face. Next to him are two elevated metal slabs, one small one that holds small precision medical tools and a large one that holds a large figure underneath a white cloth. It didn't take a genius to know that there\u2019s a dead body underneath that white cloth. \n\nThe gentleman proceeds to speak in a loud, somewhat raspy, voice: \"Settle down children, the sooner we get this over with the sooner you can get to your graduation parties and your group selfies and Facebooks and whatnot.\"\n\nThe auditorium laughs but the gentleman did not. \"I am led to believe that everyone here was given a non-disclosure agreement to sign. Is there anybody who hasn\u2019t signed it yet?\u201d said the gentleman.\n\nWith no answer from the audience, the gentleman continues: \u201cGood, so we may proceed then. My name is Dr. Samuel Epstein and I have been a cardiologist and neurologist for over 30 years. I\u2019ve held several positions in many hospitals from department head to chair of the board. I\u2019ve even healed presidents to famous movie stars and everyone in between.\u201d\n\nDr. Epstein takes a pause then said, \u201cHowever impressive that may have sounded, I don\u2019t hold myself close to that candle. No matter what any of us will set out to do, everyone dies.\u201d \n\nWith that final word he sets down his briefcase and pulls the white sheet. The audience feels a bit morbid from the sight of the corpse in combination with what he just said.\n\n\u201cNow what goes from here on out does not leave this room. If what you see today is known to the outside world, directly or indirectly, with your involvement, then you will be banned from practicing medicine for life with no exception,\u201d said Dr. Epstein.\n\nThe students then start to look at each other with more fear than confusion. Immediately, Dr. Epstein picks three volunteers to step down to the platform. All three of them shudder at the sight of a naked, 50 year old, slightly obese John Doe on the metal slab. \n\n\u201cI want all three of you to prove to everyone here that this man is truly dead,\u201d said Dr. Epstein.\n\nWith his instructions, the students proceed to check for vitality via pulses, temperature, as well as signs from eyes, mouth, hair, and such. All three unanimously confirm to the professor and the entire audience that this man is actually dead.\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d said Dr. Epstein with a wide, eerie grin. \u201cSo what\u2019s the harm in one more test?\u201d With one quick motion, Dr. Epstein grabs a scalpel from the nearby slab and stabs John Doe right where his stomach is. \n\nThe audience gasps in shock and begins to cringe as Dr. Epstein pulls the scalpel out and into a disinfectant bath. The wound left by the scalpel is highly visible with a minimal flow of blood exiting it. Dr. Epstein gathers his composure, \u201cNow, here\u2019s where things get weird.\u201d\n\nHe pulls out of his suitcase a huge syringe filled with a turquoise serum, stabs John Doe in the heart, and pushes the plunger. As soon as the syringe was pulled out of his chest, the wound made by the scalpel began to bleed profusely. John Doe sits up with one quick jerk and gasped for air. Many in the audience scream in horror to find the man, clearly dead, now lives.\n\nJohn Doe frantically jumps off the slab and crawls backwards to the corner while screaming incomprehensible gibberish. There\u2019s a look of fear in his eyes as though he\u2019s a trapped animal locked in a cage. His eyes kept scanning the room, from student to student, until he sees the metal slab of instruments. Without hesitation, John Doe runs towards the center, grabs the once used scalpel and proceeds to cut his own throat in front of everyone.\n\nThe audience screams even louder than ever, some fainted, many crying, and Dr. Epstein stood perfectly still the whole time with the same collected composure. \n\n\u201cAlright settle down everyone, let me explain\u201d said Dr. Epstein. \u201cYes, this man was once dead, then alive, then dead again. Yes, we have known how to revive people for some time now but what happens after is still a mystery to all of us. No matter the age, gender, ethnicity, culture, or even history of the deceased; all will attempt to kill themselves via any possible method within their capability. Hell, even when we strap one of them down with a mouth piece to prevent them from biting their own tongue, they can still induce their own internal organs to shutdown within minutes.\u201d\n\nThe whole audience is at an all time low, all that has happened, how can they go on with all this information? But Dr. Epstein hasn\u2019t stopped:\n\n\u201cAs to what explains this abnormal behavior and, more importantly, the language he just spoke; there are a few theories but the most prominent is the following: The language that you just heard was the primordial one. The mother of all languages since the dawn of man that combined today\u2019s collective languages into one structured form of communication. We believe that the afterlife acts as an omnipresent absorption field that collects the conscious of everyone that has ever lived and died. Languages, knowledge, experience, all of it shared. Yet with all this information, they still do not wish to return to the living. Some say it\u2019s out of altruism, that we are not to be trusted with their new-found knowledge. Or perhaps it\u2019s something darker, that the knowledge they were vested with was too much. The idea of knowing the world\u2019s past, present, and possibly future; knowing how today\u2019s world functions makes living unbearable and death the better alternative.\u201d\n\nThe students look at each other with dread and turn around to find Dr. Epstein looking at each and every one of them with a great deal of attention.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to burden yourselves with heavy hearts. You will all venture forward and accomplish a whole lot for your fellow man and the world of medicine. Serve those in need to the best of your abilities and help them every step of the way. In a world where medicine is advancing at an exponential rate, the lines of experimentation and application are beginning to blur with more people pushing new procedures quickly to enhance our lives. The emphasis being lives, so I implore you: No matter what, no matter who they may be, no matter your reason or thought, for their sake and yours, just let them rest.\u201d\n\n", "edited": 1492088271.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gentleman walks into the auditorium in a sharp looking shirt, snazzy bow tie, a white lab coat, and an old black leather suitcase. The auditorium is full of chatty students high in spirit for this is to be their final lecture upon graduation. Soon they would go out into the world of medicine to heal the ill and save the wounded. What is strange about this lecture, however, is the gentleman hosting this lecture; no one has ever seen him before. To anyone in this room, no one ever seems to recall seeing him in any course, faculty office, or even nearby coffee houses and restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gentleman has an air of command around him that silenced half the audience as he walks to the center platform. He looks like a man beyond his years in experience and knowledge with his frizzy white hair, un-kept mustache, large black eyeglasses, and wrinkled pale face. Next to him are two elevated metal slabs, one small one that holds small precision medical tools and a large one that holds a large figure underneath a white cloth. It didn&amp;#39;t take a genius to know that there\u2019s a dead body underneath that white cloth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gentleman proceeds to speak in a loud, somewhat raspy, voice: &amp;quot;Settle down children, the sooner we get this over with the sooner you can get to your graduation parties and your group selfies and Facebooks and whatnot.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The auditorium laughs but the gentleman did not. &amp;quot;I am led to believe that everyone here was given a non-disclosure agreement to sign. Is there anybody who hasn\u2019t signed it yet?\u201d said the gentleman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With no answer from the audience, the gentleman continues: \u201cGood, so we may proceed then. My name is Dr. Samuel Epstein and I have been a cardiologist and neurologist for over 30 years. I\u2019ve held several positions in many hospitals from department head to chair of the board. I\u2019ve even healed presidents to famous movie stars and everyone in between.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Epstein takes a pause then said, \u201cHowever impressive that may have sounded, I don\u2019t hold myself close to that candle. No matter what any of us will set out to do, everyone dies.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that final word he sets down his briefcase and pulls the white sheet. The audience feels a bit morbid from the sight of the corpse in combination with what he just said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNow what goes from here on out does not leave this room. If what you see today is known to the outside world, directly or indirectly, with your involvement, then you will be banned from practicing medicine for life with no exception,\u201d said Dr. Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The students then start to look at each other with more fear than confusion. Immediately, Dr. Epstein picks three volunteers to step down to the platform. All three of them shudder at the sight of a naked, 50 year old, slightly obese John Doe on the metal slab. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI want all three of you to prove to everyone here that this man is truly dead,\u201d said Dr. Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With his instructions, the students proceed to check for vitality via pulses, temperature, as well as signs from eyes, mouth, hair, and such. All three unanimously confirm to the professor and the entire audience that this man is actually dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh?\u201d said Dr. Epstein with a wide, eerie grin. \u201cSo what\u2019s the harm in one more test?\u201d With one quick motion, Dr. Epstein grabs a scalpel from the nearby slab and stabs John Doe right where his stomach is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The audience gasps in shock and begins to cringe as Dr. Epstein pulls the scalpel out and into a disinfectant bath.
