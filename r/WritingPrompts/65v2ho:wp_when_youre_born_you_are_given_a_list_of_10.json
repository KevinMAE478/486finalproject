The letter had a golden trim. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNow the first task &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; believe you should tackle,\u201d whispered Matt. Analisa cried on. A safe goal, it would seem. \u201cis to reach one million Youtube followers for your Philosophy vlogs.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat do you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; with us,\u201d she whispered. She remembered how the closer he came to finishing his list, the darker their household became. She thought about the men coming home in the night, with blood on their hands, taking shots with her dad. She thought about the insidious build from fortune to ruinous hell. \u201cI won\u2019t do what you want, not anymore. It ends with me.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Matt put on a disappointed face, though he still smiled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere will be consequences if you don\u2019t,\u201d said Matt. He put on a kind voice. A fake voice. \u201cYou have a lifetime to do it, but I can\u2019t control the others if you don\u2019t do what we want.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Analisa turned around, crying a river  and shouting in horror. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI &lt;em&gt;won\u2019t&lt;/em&gt; DO IT!\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a quiet on the campus. Everybody watched the spectacle of the crazy girl. Matt stood still a moment, then adjusted his suit jacket. He rubbed his index finger and thumb together.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cEither you do it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;,\u201d whispered Matt. His eyes went redder, and a white flame creeped up from his hands, and grew all around him. The ground around Analisa\u2019s feet warmed up too. She felt her feet burn, and heard the voices of her family members wincing in her head. She shut her eyes and screamed. \u201cor you &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; burn.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgdtev4", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492479580.0, "created_utc": 1492450780.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v2ho", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge1hwl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GhostShadow3088", "parent_id": "t3_65v2ho", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Today was the day.
