The bastard.\n\n\"Right, so, this all seems to be in order,\" Jayhawk said, tossing the application into a pile on his desk.

A few hours, at most.\n\nOutside, Jayhawk led the way around a few of Main City's busy streets, blathering on about justice and protecting the innocent. It felt painfully like the end of one of my schemes. This time, I rolled my eyes and dutifully took notes.\n\nWe reached the corner of one intersection. Across the street, an elderly woman started into a bakery. In a flash of movement, she was knocked to the ground. Her purse now trailed from the arm of a fleeing man.\n\nAt last! This was my chance! \"I will stop that fiend, Jayhawk!\" I declared, pulling on strands of power. Lightening cracked across the sky, striking the street around the fleeing thief. I clenched my hand into a fist, causing a runic circle to ignite in the ground beneath him. \"To the depths of Tartarus with you!\"\n\nThe thief screamed, flailing his arms madly. The magic enveloped him, sucking the man into the ground. Only the purse remained behind, lying within a ring of ash. Silence fell over the street.\n\nJayhawk stared mutely at the scene, no doubt rendered speechless by my power. \"Did... did you just...\"\n\n\"I assure you, the thief lives,\" I explained, quickly reasoning out his possible distress. \"I am aware of your prescriptive against murder.

Satisfied, I turned back to Jayhawk, waiting to be congratulated.\n\nJayhawk's eyes turned from the thief to me. Strangely, he did not look pleased. \"Look... Nathan... I realize it's your first day.

I felt another voice saying repeatedly  &amp;quot;You thought I was gone, but now i&amp;#39;m unstoppable&amp;#39;. It felt as if time was frozen&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt Hell-Knights mind, the mind I had once taken, talking to me...in tatters. He had the fury of one thousand demons in his demonic voice. He screamed &amp;#39;THE WHORE SHALL DIE&amp;#39;. I shouted &amp;#39;WHAT ARE YOU?&amp;#39; he answered &amp;#39;EVIL INCARNATE&amp;#39;  &amp;#39;I thought you were the good guy!&amp;#39; Suddenly I felt the voice of Predictor, saying &amp;#39;He raped me and murdered my husband! Time seems to go back to normal were crashing &amp;#39;SEAT BELT! NOW!&amp;#39; Surprising myself, I followed her orders. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had a rough landing in the ocean. She let out a sigh of relief, &amp;#39;any questions?&amp;#39;.
