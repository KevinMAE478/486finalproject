The cops called me on my special phone while I was trying to enjoy a movie in the cinema in my special free time. I had my snacks and all. I told them he was not going to hurt them, he&amp;#39;d put on a little show, scare them off and they&amp;#39;d be fine. I was holding popcorn in my hand the next two times they called, the best scenes were already playing and I was getting called to go play with this moron. I was nearly frothing at the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only ask that my free time be respected, is that too much? I have a job and I have this extra duty, what free time I  have is sacrosanct. Especially when I eat, I hate, hate, &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; being taken away from meals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this man had violated what few important things I had. I could have broken his kneecaps, I could have broken his legs, I could have crippled him for the rest of his life. But what I wanted was something that would stay with him forever so he&amp;#39;d learn that I am not to be messed with. I wanted to hurt him where he would feel it. What&amp;#39;s more, I&amp;#39;d let him do it to himself, and for him to hate me for letting him do it to himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why I led him here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because I hate you Jace&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes grew wide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah I know who you are. I&amp;#39;m sick and tired of the time I waste with you. You want to burn? Fine, burn, but now though? Now you&amp;#39;ll fry too.
