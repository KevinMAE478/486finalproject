Surrounding him was all manner of laboratory crap, from pointless Tesla coils and gadgets to beakers and alchemic solutions. And tied up, hanging above a vat of some kind of bubbling solution, was Jack Johnson, photographer of Buzzweek News, a veritable white knight and love interest of the reporter Marsha Miller.\n\nBut the villainous Chemist knew all too well that Marsha Miller was not just some ordinary reporter, she was the famous heroine Ultra Lass. He knew she\u2019d come flying in to save Jack Johnson, and that\u2019s exactly what he wanted.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get away with this, Chemist,\u201d the dangling photographer said, \u201cUltra Lass will be here any minute to save me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m counting on it, Mr. Johnson. If my goal was to kill you, I\u2019d have done it already. I want her, and nothing more.\u201d Though his words were threatening, the truth of his last statement echoed in his head.\n\nThe ceiling caved in suddenly and a figure dropped down with the debris, landing crouched. Standing heroically from the debris was Ultra Lass.\n\nHer long, light brown hair cascaded over her shoulders, and her eyes glowed white behind the red mask that adorned her soft face. Her silver and red outfit hugged her strong, curvaceous body. She was the quintessence of beauty, the subject of countless ballads, and an angel in a world of devils.\n\nShe glanced at the man dangling above the vat and then stared at the Chemist, \u201cLet Mr. Johnson go and willingly surrender to me or this gets ugly.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltra Lass, Ultra Lass,\u201d the Chemist said, slowly shaking his head, \u201cyou know as well as I that I\u2019ll only escape again and again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll stop you again and again, but I\u2019d much rather not hurt you. Having to punch you every other week gets so boring.\u201d\n\nThe Chemist went silent and glanced at Jack Johnson, still dangling above the vat, \u201cTrust me, Ultra Lass, your punches don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d He stood up from his seat and fixated his gaze back on the beauty before him.\n\nThe heroine seemed somewhat perplexed by that, it made sense that she didn\u2019t understand. She was more powerful than a freight train; a single punch with nothing held back could level the tallest building in the city. Of course her punches hurt, but the Chemist\u2019s heart ached when she was away. Only he knew how he felt.\n\nHe and Ultra Lass had been at this for years, and while he was not the strongest of her plethora of enemies, they were bitter rivals from the beginning. He used to be able to outsmart her, he\u2019d won many of their early battles, but she eventually figured out ways to dupe him, and he enjoyed it. She was a challenge, constantly keeping him on his toes, forcing him to invent new ways of beating her and tricking her. She made him a better villain. He admired her.\n\nAnd yet\u2026 She did not look at him with the same kind of admiration. He challenged her more than anyone else, and, in turn, made her a better heroine. She didn\u2019t see it that way, she saw him as a monster and nothing else. But who got the credit for making her a better hero? Jack Johnson. The same Jack Johnson who was currently hanging above a harmless vat of green water that only bubbled because air was being forced up into it, creating an illusion of danger.\n\n\u201cFine, if you want to do this the hard way, let\u2019s do this the hard way.\u201d Ultra Lass said and darted toward the Chemist.\n\nHe was prepared, flipping a switch on his gauntlet adorned with an abundance of gadgets. Bright light burst from a lens on his gauntlet, a light that he shielded his eyes from as it temporarily blinded Ultra Lass. The Chemist took this opportunity to leap away and out of her range before he killed the light. He watched with a measure of pride how quickly she recovered from the blinding light and started toward him again.\n\n\u201cYour tricks won\u2019t work on me, Chemist! You can only stall the beating so long!\u201d she glared at him through squinting eyes.\n\nHe pressed a button on his gauntlet and laser turrets ascended from beneath the floor and began to fire at her immediately, and though she took the first few hits, she began to duck and dodged out of the way, edging her way closer and closer to him.\n\nThe Chemist released every gadget in his arsenal, old and new, and Ultra Lass countered each with such speed and skill that the villain was awed. All out of tricks, he feigned anger at his defeat.\n\n\u201cDamn you, Ultra Lass! I\u2019ve thrown everything I had at you and you\u2019ve foiled every single one! You win.\u201d\n\nUltra Lass panted, having exerted a lot of power to defend against the Chemist\u2019s gadgets, \u201cThen I\u2019ll be taking Mr. Johnson to safety and leaving.\u201d\n\nThe Chemist cocked his head, \u201cYou\u2019re not taking me in?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nIn unison, both the Chemist and Jack Johnson exclaimed: \u201cWHAT?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said it yourself,\u201d Ultra Lass shrugged, smirking slightly, \u201cyou\u2019ll just keep escaping prison. I\u2019ll just have to keep stopping you myself.\u201d\n\nHe was dumbstruck. He couldn\u2019t find a clever comeback for that, so he just said: \u201cThen I guess you will. Get Mr. Johnson out of here and go. He\u2019s been whining and crying this whole time, it\u2019s gotten quite annoying.\u201d\n\nHis heart melted when Ultra Lass giggled and he watched her fly up to Jack and untie him. She held the photographer close before looking down at her archenemy, \u201cYou know I\u2019m always going to stop you, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Ultra Lass,\u201d the Chemist said, \u201cI am counting on it.\u201d\n\nWith that, Ultra Lass took off through the hole in the ceiling, Jack Johnson in tow.\n\nThe Chemist darted right to his computer and typed in a few commands. Ultra Lass was still within range of his long range microphones and he wanted to hear if she had anything to say. Over the speakers he heard a conversation between Jack Johnson and the super-heroine.\n\n*\u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t bring him in after what he did to me,\u201d* Jack was saying.\n\n*\u201cHe didn\u2019t even touch you,\u201d* Ultra Lass said.\n\n*\u201cThose ropes were pretty uncomfortable, though.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cI know, I know.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cI gotta ask, though, Marsha, why\u2019d you let him go?\u201d*\n\nThere was a brief pause in the audio, and the Chemist thought for sure she\u2019d gone out of range before the audio came back.\n\n*\u201cIt\u2019s going to sound silly, but\u2026 He makes me a better hero.\u201d*\n\nBefore Jack\u2019s reply could be heard, they flew out of range and the audio feed died. But the Chemist hardly cared. His eyes welled up with tears and he let out a brief laugh of pure giddiness. The tears in his eyes fell, rolling over his pale cheeks as he smiled and isolated that last bit of audio.\n\n*He makes me a better hero.*\n\n*He makes me a better hero.*\n\n*He makes me a better hero.*\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sat in a high back chair in his evil lab, a menacing smile on his lips.

Cancel my plans this evening!\"\n\nAlphonse reappeared at the top of the stairs. \"You don't have any plans, sir.\"\n\n\"Don't I?\" Mr. Courageous stepped into the suit engine.

The vertical auxiliary engines powered off, and Mr. Courageous vaulted out of the cockpit.\n\nDotting the playground were greenish-gray, semi-translucent mounds. Mr. Courageous inspected one. Within, a young boy rested with his eyes closed. A tiny smile played across the boy's lips.\n\nMr. Courageous touched the mound at the boy's shoulder level. His glove sank into the goo to a depth of an inch, then stopped making progress. What's more, he couldn't pull the glove back out. He grabbed the wrist of his stuck hand and heaved with all his weight, but managed only to pull his hand out of the glove. He stumbled backward and narrowly avoided falling into another mound.\n\n\"Who would do this?\" he said.\n\nA peal of laughter rang across the playground. \"It is I! GOO GAL!\" A hunk of goo detached itself from the school wall and slithered over. Once it got close, it rose up, solidified, and assumed the shape of woman. She wore clothing -- a hoodie and jeans -- made out of deep green goo. Due to the goo's transparency, Mr. Courageous couldn't make out her face.\n\n\"Release the children, Goo Gal!\" Mr. Courageous said.\n\n\"Never!\" A throne of goo materialized under Goo Gal and lifted her into the air. \"This is the only way for me to assume my rightful place.\"\n\n\"So be it.\" Mr. Courageous tapped his wrist panel, activating his combat suit. Powerlines cross-hatched his torso. The rocket boosters attached to his feet fired and he flew at Goo Gal. She opened her arms as though to hug him. His momentum knocked her off her throne and the two of them fell to ground. \n\nGoo completely encased his battle suit. Where it touched his powerlines and boosters, it hissed and evaporated. \n\nGoo Gal said, \"Deal with this!\" The goo surged forward, pushed into his rocket boosters and deactivated them. It leeched the energy from his powerlines. \n\nMr. Courageous couldn't move. The only part of him left ungooed was his gloveless hand.\n\nIt was then that he noticed that Goo Gal was gasping for breath underneath him.\n\n\"Oh my god, you're heavy,\" she said.\n\n\"That's the combat suit,\" he said.\n\n\"Sure it is.\" She huffed and puffed. \"You're stuck.\"\n\n\"So are you.\"\n\n\"Now what?\"\n\nMr. Courageous bent his hand toward his wrist panel. \"Why did you attack these children?\"\n\n\"I told you. It's the only way to get what I want.\"\n\n\"There's got to be an easier way.\"\n\nGoo Gal turned her face to the side. \"Sometimes the easy way is actually harder.\"\n\nHis fingers hovered over the emergency eject button. \"Sometimes you have to admit that you're lying to yourself.\"\n\nGoo Gal's breathing became high-pitched and thin. \"Mark, I can't breathe.\"\n\n\"How do you know my name?\"\n\n\"I can't breathe,\" Goo Gal gasped.\n\n\"Let me help you.\" Mr. Courageous tapped the eject button. His suit split into segments, and, wearing the slim inner skeleton, he flew up and away and landed on the far side of his jet. \n\nBy the time he got back to where they'd fought, Goo Gal was gone.\n\n*****\n\n*more below*", "edited": 1492300071.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 32nd time in the last ten minutes, Mr. Courageous checked his phone.

It leeched the energy from his powerlines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Courageous couldn&amp;#39;t move. The only part of him left ungooed was his gloveless hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was then that he noticed that Goo Gal was gasping for breath underneath him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh my god, you&amp;#39;re heavy,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s the combat suit,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure it is.&amp;quot; She huffed and puffed. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re stuck.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So are you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Courageous bent his hand toward his wrist panel. &amp;quot;Why did you attack these children?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I told you. It&amp;#39;s the only way to get what I want.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s got to be an easier way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goo Gal turned her face to the side. &amp;quot;Sometimes the easy way is actually harder.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His fingers hovered over the emergency eject button. &amp;quot;Sometimes you have to admit that you&amp;#39;re lying to yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goo Gal&amp;#39;s breathing became high-pitched and thin. &amp;quot;Mark, I can&amp;#39;t breathe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How do you know my name?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t breathe,&amp;quot; Goo Gal gasped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Let me help you.&amp;quot; Mr. Courageous tapped the eject button. His suit split into segments, and, wearing the slim inner skeleton, he flew up and away and landed on the far side of his jet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time he got back to where they&amp;#39;d fought, Goo Gal was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;more below&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgauy2j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492303696.0, "created_utc": 1492274896.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 326}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jeny", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jeny", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb1zei", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 44, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JanySpades", "parent_id": "t1_dgb122b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh boy that was cute.

It\u2019s been months, years - I know better than that, now. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see the flame that flickers in her palm, the one she\u2019s trying to hide behind her back. She continues her attempt to distract me. It occurs to me that just a few years ago, I would have fallen for it. \u201cYou\u2019re capable of good, you don\u2019t need to keep doing this. I know what you did,\u201d she says, and something inside of me snaps.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me,\u201d I tell her. It\u2019s dangerous for me to be this angry, to be this out of control, but something about her has always driven me wild. As if I could ever control myself around her, I think to myself bitterly, as a storm gathers overhead. \u201cYou\u2019ve never known anything about me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat morning on the bridge,\u201d she says, and my fingertips crackle with electricity. She looks up at me with wide eyes, fearful, but she continues, makes no move to launch the fireball that has gathered in her hand. \u201cHe called me, but I was too far away. Too late. Across the city, a million cars between us. There was no way I could have gotten there.\u201d I shake my head, but she keeps going. \u201cMy brother should be dead, Elektra.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with me,\u201d I tell her, and I bring the building down.\n\nI\u2019ve already tried to be a hero for her sake. People like me aren\u2019t meant to help people. She proved it, when we turned on the news one night and she scoffed at every move of \u201cthe new hero in town,\u201d pointing out all the mistakes that put the lives of innocents at risk. I swallowed the lump in my throat, feigned interest in the grainy footage that I already knew every second of, and excused myself at the first chance I got. Things didn\u2019t get better from there. A day didn\u2019t pass that my name wasn\u2019t smeared across the front page of the newspaper, and I came home each night to a girl that hated every ounce of the hero I was trying to be. I was miserable. \n\nSo I stopped trying to be a hero. When I learned who she was, why she knew so much, how she knew exactly what to criticize about me and my grand persona, it was too late. In another life, I could be coming home to her. In another life, she could have gotten me training, could have gotten me help with the newly blooming powers that I didn\u2019t know how to control. In this life, though? I tear down skyscrapers and hope she takes notice. \n\nI walk home in the rain. I can see the rubble in the back of my mind, mangled steel beams and ruined concrete, and I can\u2019t stomach the guilt. I know what it costs to build something of that scale, and although it soothes my conscience that the hospital was evacuated, I\u2019ve still ruined a resource for a community I know is struggling. The rain is my way of punishing myself - I could make it stop, and even as I trudge forward, the fine curtain of mist parts in front of me, but if I return home soaking wet and catch pneumonia, I reason to myself that I would deserve it. \n\nMy mind wanders, as I walk, and somehow my feet take me back to the apartment that we shared. I bump into someone, and I look up to apologize, but before I can open my mouth my eyes widen with shock. The words at the tip of my tongue vanish. My mind is spinning with half-coherent thoughts. She shouldn\u2019t be here, it isn\u2019t regulation, does she know that I -\nShe\u2019s not wearing her uniform. If she recognizes me, she gives no indication, and I try my best to do the same. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, her voice soft, and I don\u2019t meet her eyes. I mumble something and try to move on, but she catches my elbow, and the gesture makes me go still. I haven\u2019t touched her in - I don\u2019t want to think about how long I haven\u2019t touched her.\n\n\u201cDid you know the women who lived here?\u201d She asks me, and I almost laugh at the irony of it all. She doesn\u2019t recognize me. Of course she doesn\u2019t, these days I wear a glamor so heavy most mornings I don\u2019t recognize my new face in the mirror. I could have done this a long time ago, I think, but no, I couldn\u2019t have. She isn\u2019t supposed to be out on a city block like this. She isn\u2019t supposed to be out at all, now that the crisis is over and I\u2019ve already won.\n\n\u201cA long time ago,\u201d I say. She makes a small sound of assent, and doesn\u2019t move from my side. \n\n\u201cOne day she just left,\u201d she says, and I start. There\u2019s no way I can respond to this, but thankfully, she keeps talking. I know that she noticed. She\u2019s being polite, I suppose. \u201cAnd then her partner was recruited, and this street never saw either of them again.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t have anything to say. I don\u2019t want to go, though. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve talked to her just like this, no uniform, no rivalry. There is a long, pregnant pause. Finally, she turns to me with a sad smile, and says, \u201cGoodbye, Iris.\u201d\n\nI want to chase her. Do I? After all these years, she\u2019s finally found a way to tell me what happened to her. Seeing her like this, without that ridiculous red plastered to her hips, makes her loss feel like a fresh wound. Before I can decide, the curtain of rain closes around her, and she\u2019s gone. I know that she wouldn\u2019t want me anyway, now that we\u2019re sworn to different causes, now that she\u2019s legally obligated to destroy me. Still, it hurts like nothing has before. I resolve that I\u2019m going to tear down another building tomorrow, a taller one, all glass and chrome, and immediately hate myself for it.\n\nAs I walk home, I\u2019m suddenly jolted back to reality by the sound of sirens. It\u2019s raining. Nothing should be on fire. And yet I recognize that shrill squeal, and for some reason I find myself breaking into a run. I turn the corner to my apartment. The entire block is in flames, and time seems to stop.\n\nA courier speeds by me, commissioned by the same agency that regulates superhumans. I can tell by silver wings on his shoes. \u201cNote\u2019s for you,\u201d he says, and he leaves a slightly singed piece of paper in my hands.\n\nMy hands shake as I open it. My building burns, and it seems so distant.\n\n*I\u2019m not above a bit of villainy myself, Iris. Move back in with me. The agency\u2019s not what I thought it would be, and I miss you.We don\u2019t have to fight for different sides. We can just fight for ourselves.*\n\nThe rain stops. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see a rainbow, and I allow myself to smile.

It\u2019s been months, years - I know better than that, now. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see the flame that flickers in her palm, the one she\u2019s trying to hide behind her back. She continues her attempt to distract me. It occurs to me that just a few years ago, I would have fallen for it. \u201cYou\u2019re capable of good, you don\u2019t need to keep doing this. I know what you did,\u201d she says, and something inside of me snaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me,\u201d I tell her. It\u2019s dangerous for me to be this angry, to be this out of control, but something about her has always driven me wild. As if I could ever control myself around her, I think to myself bitterly, as a storm gathers overhead. \u201cYou\u2019ve never known anything about me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat morning on the bridge,\u201d she says, and my fingertips crackle with electricity. She looks up at me with wide eyes, fearful, but she continues, makes no move to launch the fireball that has gathered in her hand. \u201cHe called me, but I was too far away. Too late. Across the city, a million cars between us. There was no way I could have gotten there.\u201d I shake my head, but she keeps going. \u201cMy brother should be dead, Elektra.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt has nothing to do with me,\u201d I tell her, and I bring the building down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve already tried to be a hero for her sake. People like me aren\u2019t meant to help people. She proved it, when we turned on the news one night and she scoffed at every move of \u201cthe new hero in town,\u201d pointing out all the mistakes that put the lives of innocents at risk. I swallowed the lump in my throat, feigned interest in the grainy footage that I already knew every second of, and excused myself at the first chance I got. Things didn\u2019t get better from there. A day didn\u2019t pass that my name wasn\u2019t smeared across the front page of the newspaper, and I came home each night to a girl that hated every ounce of the hero I was trying to be. I was miserable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I stopped trying to be a hero. When I learned who she was, why she knew so much, how she knew exactly what to criticize about me and my grand persona, it was too late. In another life, I could be coming home to her. In another life, she could have gotten me training, could have gotten me help with the newly blooming powers that I didn\u2019t know how to control. In this life, though? I tear down skyscrapers and hope she takes notice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walk home in the rain. I can see the rubble in the back of my mind, mangled steel beams and ruined concrete, and I can\u2019t stomach the guilt. I know what it costs to build something of that scale, and although it soothes my conscience that the hospital was evacuated, I\u2019ve still ruined a resource for a community I know is struggling. The rain is my way of punishing myself - I could make it stop, and even as I trudge forward, the fine curtain of mist parts in front of me, but if I return home soaking wet and catch pneumonia, I reason to myself that I would deserve it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mind wanders, as I walk, and somehow my feet take me back to the apartment that we shared. I bump into someone, and I look up to apologize, but before I can open my mouth my eyes widen with shock. The words at the tip of my tongue vanish. My mind is spinning with half-coherent thoughts. She shouldn\u2019t be here, it isn\u2019t regulation, does she know that I -\nShe\u2019s not wearing her uniform. If she recognizes me, she gives no indication, and I try my best to do the same. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, her voice soft, and I don\u2019t meet her eyes. I mumble something and try to move on, but she catches my elbow, and the gesture makes me go still. I haven\u2019t touched her in - I don\u2019t want to think about how long I haven\u2019t touched her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDid you know the women who lived here?\u201d She asks me, and I almost laugh at the irony of it all. She doesn\u2019t recognize me. Of course she doesn\u2019t, these days I wear a glamor so heavy most mornings I don\u2019t recognize my new face in the mirror. I could have done this a long time ago, I think, but no, I couldn\u2019t have. She isn\u2019t supposed to be out on a city block like this. She isn\u2019t supposed to be out at all, now that the crisis is over and I\u2019ve already won.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cA long time ago,\u201d I say. She makes a small sound of assent, and doesn\u2019t move from my side. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOne day she just left,\u201d she says, and I start. There\u2019s no way I can respond to this, but thankfully, she keeps talking. I know that she noticed. She\u2019s being polite, I suppose. \u201cAnd then her partner was recruited, and this street never saw either of them again.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t have anything to say. I don\u2019t want to go, though. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve talked to her just like this, no uniform, no rivalry. There is a long, pregnant pause. Finally, she turns to me with a sad smile, and says, \u201cGoodbye, Iris.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to chase her. Do I? After all these years, she\u2019s finally found a way to tell me what happened to her. Seeing her like this, without that ridiculous red plastered to her hips, makes her loss feel like a fresh wound. Before I can decide, the curtain of rain closes around her, and she\u2019s gone. I know that she wouldn\u2019t want me anyway, now that we\u2019re sworn to different causes, now that she\u2019s legally obligated to destroy me. Still, it hurts like nothing has before. I resolve that I\u2019m going to tear down another building tomorrow, a taller one, all glass and chrome, and immediately hate myself for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I walk home, I\u2019m suddenly jolted back to reality by the sound of sirens. It\u2019s raining. Nothing should be on fire. And yet I recognize that shrill squeal, and for some reason I find myself breaking into a run. I turn the corner to my apartment. The entire block is in flames, and time seems to stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A courier speeds by me, commissioned by the same agency that regulates superhumans. I can tell by silver wings on his shoes. \u201cNote\u2019s for you,\u201d he says, and he leaves a slightly singed piece of paper in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My hands shake as I open it. My building burns, and it seems so distant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I\u2019m not above a bit of villainy myself, Iris. Move back in with me. The agency\u2019s not what I thought it would be, and I miss you.We don\u2019t have to fight for different sides. We can just fight for ourselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rain stops. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see a rainbow, and I allow myself to smile. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgb4zf5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492317322.0, "created_utc": 1492288522.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 83}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jeny", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jeny", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb9g69", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 22, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ClydeBrooks", "parent_id": "t1_dgavmx7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is definitely not what the prompt intended.

I, uh... know your secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d He yelped, moving to partially hide behind the carved mahogany door.\n\n\u201cThe secret weakness of your robotic powers?

It would be, uh, terrible if the world discovered that!\u201d\n\nThere was a beat of silence.\n\n\u201cCan I come in?\u201d She asked.\n\n\u201cI, uh. Sure.\u201d He said, blinking.\n\nThe heroine followed him into the foyer, which was just as elaborate and over-the-top as the house\u2019s exterior. Gothic arches and spires crawled up an ever-higher entryway, spaced with brass lanterns and repetitive clockwork motifs. On the way to the sitting room, they were forced to dodge around a great brass pendulum, swinging inexorably back and forth to the rhythm of unseen mechanisms.\n\nMiss Majestic had barely sat down upon an antique-looking chaise when a ball of silky white fur settled itself on her lap.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d She asked bemusedly.\n\n\u201cProfessor Maligna von Shitsgoindown,\u201d the Baron replied. \u201cI, uh. Paid seventy dollars for her.\u201d\n\nThe heroine *beamed*, and he swallowed, looking away quickly when she glanced up from stroking the cat.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s awesome! So, you\u2019re\u2026 not doing the crime thing anymore?\u201d She asked brightly.\n\nHe shrugged, studying a section of crown molding that was ornately decorated with carved gears. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for you,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, that\u2019s great.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat-\u201d the Baron began, then stopped. He seemed to struggle for words for a moment. \u201cWhat do people do all day? When they aren\u2019t plotting to take over the city, I mean.\u201d\n\nMiss Majestic cocked her head, her mask briefly catching the light.\n\n\u201cWell, some people have hobbies. Most of us have jobs, and when we\u2019re not cleaning the house or going to the grocery store we spend time with friends. It\u2019s all very domestic,\u201d she added, with an odd expression.\n\n\u201cHmm.\u201d The Baron considered that for a while, Maligna\u2019s purring and his house\u2019s everpresent ticking clocks the only sounds in the room.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t really do any of those things, though,\u201d the heroine murmured. \u201cEver since I got my powers, it\u2019s been one crisis after another. I barely go out without the mask anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you\u2026 want to?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t know,\u201d she wavered, before he had a chance to clarify. \u201cFighting villains, saving the day\u2026 this is really all I\u2019m good at. And I\u2019d feel bad if someone got hurt because I took time off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure if you wanted-\u201d he began.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I think you\u2019d make a good hero!\u201d She interrupted, suddenly fierce. \u201cEven when you were trying to be evil, you were terrible at it! You saved people on accident, even if you weren\u2019t trying to!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you know what they say about stopped clocks,\u201d the Baron joked automatically.\n\nMiss Militia continued to look at him intensely before breaking down into laughter.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 haha, oh my god. That was a pretty funny. Good line,\u201d she managed, taking a deep breath. \u201cAt least you got the banter down.\u201d\n\nIf the Baron looked slightly shell-shocked after her laugh, she didn\u2019t notice. He quickly turned away, fighting a blush and wishing fervently for his mask.\n\n\u201cA-Anyway, I\u2019m not sure. About the whole hero thing, haha,\u201d he chuckled weakly.\n\u201cMaybe\u2026 and this is just a *maybe,* understand, purely hypothetical\u2026 my heart maybe wasn't in the whole villainy thing. Maybe I had really sinister ulterior motives that\u2026 aren\u2019t really the case anymore, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll make a good superhero.\u201d\n\nA shrill alarm sent Maligna leaping from Miss Majestic\u2019s lap, and she fished at her belt for a moment before pulling out a blinking phone.\n\n\u201cSome idiot\u2019s holding the city council hostage at their fundraiser,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI need to get going.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Yeah, of course,\u201d the Baron agreed, peering down the ornate hallway after his vanished cat.\n\n\u201cAnd hey, look,\u201d Miss Majestic said, laying a hand on his arm as she stepped toward the door. \u201cFlying robots and clockwork? Your powers are pretty cool, the public loves that sort of thing. You don\u2019t have to be perfect to help people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 give it some thought,\u201d he said hesitantly, holding the front door open for her. The sunlight caught the flecks in her costume as she stepped into the sun, a cascade of reflected light shimmering across the entryway.\n\n\u201cSeriously. Just don\u2019t let anyone figure out your weakness, and you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d\n\nWith a smirk and a rush of air, she was gone.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[part 2]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She knocked on his door again the following week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOkay, how the fuck did you find me this time?\u201d The Baron Automaton demanded, after wrenching it open to find Miss Majestic standing matter-of-fact on his porch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI ordered my robo-servitors to construct houses exactly like mine in strategically-picked neighborhoods!

Sure.\u201d He said, blinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The heroine followed him into the foyer, which was just as elaborate and over-the-top as the house\u2019s exterior. Gothic arches and spires crawled up an ever-higher entryway, spaced with brass lanterns and repetitive clockwork motifs. On the way to the sitting room, they were forced to dodge around a great brass pendulum, swinging inexorably back and forth to the rhythm of unseen mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miss Majestic had barely sat down upon an antique-looking chaise when a ball of silky white fur settled itself on her lap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d She asked bemusedly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cProfessor Maligna von Shitsgoindown,\u201d the Baron replied. \u201cI, uh. Paid seventy dollars for her.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The heroine &lt;em&gt;beamed&lt;/em&gt;, and he swallowed, looking away quickly when she glanced up from stroking the cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s awesome! So, you\u2019re\u2026 not doing the crime thing anymore?\u201d She asked brightly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He shrugged, studying a section of crown molding that was ornately decorated with carved gears. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m happy for you,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, that\u2019s great.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat-\u201d the Baron began, then stopped. He seemed to struggle for words for a moment. \u201cWhat do people do all day? When they aren\u2019t plotting to take over the city, I mean.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miss Majestic cocked her head, her mask briefly catching the light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, some people have hobbies. Most of us have jobs, and when we\u2019re not cleaning the house or going to the grocery store we spend time with friends. It\u2019s all very domestic,\u201d she added, with an odd expression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHmm.\u201d The Baron considered that for a while, Maligna\u2019s purring and his house\u2019s everpresent ticking clocks the only sounds in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t really do any of those things, though,\u201d the heroine murmured. \u201cEver since I got my powers, it\u2019s been one crisis after another. I barely go out without the mask anymore.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo you\u2026 want to?\u201d He asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t know,\u201d she wavered, before he had a chance to clarify. \u201cFighting villains, saving the day\u2026 this is really all I\u2019m good at. And I\u2019d feel bad if someone got hurt because I took time off.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure if you wanted-\u201d he began.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s why I think you\u2019d make a good hero!\u201d She interrupted, suddenly fierce. \u201cEven when you were trying to be evil, you were terrible at it! You saved people on accident, even if you weren\u2019t trying to!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, you know what they say about stopped clocks,\u201d the Baron joked automatically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miss Militia continued to look at him intensely before breaking down into laughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2026 haha, oh my god. That was a pretty funny. Good line,\u201d she managed, taking a deep breath. \u201cAt least you got the banter down.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the Baron looked slightly shell-shocked after her laugh, she didn\u2019t notice. He quickly turned away, fighting a blush and wishing fervently for his mask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cA-Anyway, I\u2019m not sure. About the whole hero thing, haha,\u201d he chuckled weakly.\n\u201cMaybe\u2026 and this is just a &lt;em&gt;maybe,&lt;/em&gt; understand, purely hypothetical\u2026 my heart maybe wasn&amp;#39;t in the whole villainy thing. Maybe I had really sinister ulterior motives that\u2026 aren\u2019t really the case anymore, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll make a good superhero.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A shrill alarm sent Maligna leaping from Miss Majestic\u2019s lap, and she fished at her belt for a moment before pulling out a blinking phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSome idiot\u2019s holding the city council hostage at their fundraiser,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI need to get going.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh! Yeah, of course,\u201d the Baron agreed, peering down the ornate hallway after his vanished cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd hey, look,\u201d Miss Majestic said, laying a hand on his arm as she stepped toward the door. \u201cFlying robots and clockwork? Your powers are pretty cool, the public loves that sort of thing. You don\u2019t have to be perfect to help people.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 give it some thought,\u201d he said hesitantly, holding the front door open for her. The sunlight caught the flecks in her costume as she stepped into the sun, a cascade of reflected light shimmering across the entryway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSeriously. Just don\u2019t let anyone figure out your weakness, and you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a smirk and a rush of air, she was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgbr0go", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492350449.0, "created_utc": 1492321649.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jeny", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jeny", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jeny", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgce2ny", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pieguyrobot5678", "parent_id": "t1_dgbr1ll", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "PART THREE", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PART THREE&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgce2ny", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492396854.0, "created_utc": 1492368054.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbr1ll", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Praeclara", "parent_id": "t1_dgbkgbm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm glad you enjoy it!

Your brain kicks into overdrive trying to form a coherent thought while staring into those piercing blue eyes. \"-here.\"\n\nShe smiles brightly. \"Oh don't worry, i made sure they stayed at the scene. Told them i was going on a stealth mission to catch Curio, and they let me go.\"\n\nYou fake a gasp of shock. \"Curio's here? Oh how brave of you to come capture him. I hope you're not here for me as well.\"\n\nShe smirks at this. \"Keep that sarcasm up and i just might. You're still all over the front page with that stunt you pulled. Why even kidnap all the potential mayoral candidates if you don't ask for a ransom?\"\n\n\"Well you see there's this girl i was trying to get the attention of maned Misdirection, and I figured she would notice me if I did something over the top like that.\" She blushes.\n\n\"You really did all that just to get my attention? That must have taken weeks to plan out.\"\n\n\"Compared to the months I've been trying to get your attention, I'd say it was well worth it.\"\n\n\"Oh really? Well I hope I was worth the wait-\" She's interrupted by the one noise you were worried might show up tonight. Helicopter rotors.\n\n\"BREAKING NEWS FROM LIVE A THE SCENE WHERE MISDIRECTION IS BATTLING ON THE ROOF WITH THE MENACING MINNITTO.\" The helicopter bound reporter announces to her audience, which is received by your earpiece. Always helps to come prepared. A sudden spotlight shines on the two of you, and you suddenly realize that the two of you are warped around each other in a very hard to misinterpret way.\n\nThinking fast, Misdirection throws you across the roof, and puts on her best \"saving the day\" voice. \"IT'S OVER MINNITTO. I'M TAKING YOU IN, AND CURIO TOO.\"\n\n\"YOU FOOL. CURIO'S ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY!\" You lie. \"HE'S PROBABLY HALFWAY TO HIS BASE BY NOW.\" You give your best evil laugh for the camera, and charge Misdirection, throwing an easily blocked punch her way.\n\nShe delivers an equally easy to stop roundhouse. \"I'LL TAKE YOU BOTH DOWN THEN! YOUR CRIMINAL DAYS ARE AT AN END!\" You leap out of the way of a sonic burst and shrink down to the size of an ant, springing up behind her to deliver a sneak attack that sends her across the building.\n\n\"Sorry!\" You instinctively say, before getting back into character. \"-SORRY THAT I'M SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU I MEAN! HAHAHA! NOW, LET'S KILL THAT SPOTLIGHT!\" You blast the helicopter with a shrink beam, and it instantly shifts to the size of a gnat. Rushing over to the girl you help her to her feet. \"Sorry about that, i got a bit too into character.\"\n\nShe chuckles. \"It's nothing. A bruise at best. what about the reporters though?\"\n\n\"Eh, Expandros will fix that. Now, where were we?\" You grin evilly as you go in for a long awaited kiss.\n\n\"DID SOMEONE SAY EXPANDROS?!\" A voice announces before you can complete that action, and you just barely spring away from the girl as a green suit clad man leaps onto the roof, grinning heroically. \"So this city is where you've been hiding out in my old nemesis! I'll put an end to your terror once and for all!\"\n\nYou're about to speak, probably saying something quite unflattering to the muscular man, when Misdirection steps forward. \"I've got this handled already. Go help the reporter she shrank and evacuate them to somewhere safe.\"\n\n\"No can do Misdirection. Me and her go way back, and i'm not going to abandon the call of a fellow super when she's involved. You go after Curio while i handle our friend here.\"\n\n\"No, you go after Curio, and i'll handle this fight that I was already dealing with! It's my fight, and my city, so i'll call the shots here!\" Misdirection was getting annoyed, starring daggers at the oblivious man.\n\n\"It's my nemesis! You don't see Batman ducking out of fights with the Joker just because Wonder Woman shows up! Besides, you already fought Rockracer today, on top of foiling Minnitto's first plot. You should go relax for a bit.\"\n\n\"I was until you showed up!\" She snaps at the large man. \"I was trying to have a good time, but you and the news just had to ruin it! Curio was never even here, and you know why i said he was? Because-\" She turns towards you, or at least where you used to be. The board you're holding cracks against Expandros's head, sending him crashing to the ground.\n\n\"Because she's trying to go on a date here you inconsiderate oaf.\" You finish for her. Noticing her shocked expression, you shrug. \"What? It's not like it killed him. I doubt anything could get through that thick skull of his. He'll wake up in a couple of hours with a headache and a helicopter full of microscopic reporters to deal with.\"\n\n\"Sounds good to me. Now we'd better get out of here before the police show up.\"\n\n\"OR-\" You toss her a dazzling blue gem, the prize display of the museum. \"You take that to the police and tell them that me and Curio got away. I doubt they'll ask questions.\"\n\nHer eyes narrow. \"Really? You just had to take something?\"\n\nYou shrug. \"I never said i wouldn't. Besides, how would it look if the most respected hero in the city got duped by two crooks without so much as a retrieved jewel to show for it? I'm just planning ahead.\"\n\nShe frowns. \"Sure you are. We're still going to talk about this, even if you're right.\"\n\n\"Fine. How about over dinner? Saffron lounge, 8:00, tomorrow.\" You suggest.\n\n\"No costumes? You sure you want to show off your identity? That could be dangerous.\"\n\n\"If i wanted safe i would have stuck with being a musician.\" You tell the girl. \"Now run along, or the cops'll be wondering what's taking you so long.\" You leap to the nearest rooftop, a huge smile on your face as the sound of sirens liven up the dark sky.", "edited": 1492395052.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Pt 2]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You tap your foot impatiently, waiting for your date to show up.

Lots of potential there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But i wanted some variety-&amp;quot; you wipe away a bead of sweat on your forehead. Where did that come from?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Plenty of other superheroes in the same city as him. you had to move to get here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah well I... ah... well...&amp;quot; Why couldn&amp;#39;t you think of a reason? You were usually great at thinking up lies! Just because she&amp;#39;s learning the truth, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have to give in! Your face flushes despite this, and she clearly takes notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aw, you&amp;#39;re cute when your flustered.&amp;quot; She mocks you with a triumphant smirk. &amp;quot;So you&amp;#39;ve got a crush on me, huh? Funny, i thought you liked Katastry, seeing as you team up with her so much.&amp;quot; What, what? &amp;quot;What, you couldn&amp;#39;t resist my-&amp;quot; She runs her hands over her sides with a grin. &amp;quot;-Personality? I suppose I can&amp;#39;t blame you for that-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve never teamed up against you with Kat.&amp;quot; Her face drops for a second, before regaining her composure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;yeah, but i saw it on the news. You two make a cute couple.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And which heist would that be that you saw? Keep in mind that all of them took place in various secret government labs. Turns out she&amp;#39;s got something of a knack for finding them, being an ex CIA herself apparently.&amp;quot; You can almost feel the tables turn as she&amp;#39;s now the nervous one, stumbling to her own defense.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I got special clearance-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How&amp;#39;d they contact you? Last i checked you were still &amp;quot;That masked menace who think&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s above the law&amp;quot; to them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As a journalist-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not a chance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-Snuck in-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;seems uncharacteristic. What whim sent you there, huh?&amp;quot; She grits her teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was tracking you-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then why not stop me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because... Because... Augh!&amp;quot; She throws her hands up in the air. &amp;quot;Fine, you got me... I&amp;#39;m-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Katastry.&amp;quot; You take a step closer. &amp;quot;You really think i didn&amp;#39;t catch on? Like you said, I&amp;#39;ve been following you.&amp;quot; another step closer. &amp;quot;Now, if you&amp;#39;re Kay, why would you be so insistent on me having a crush on her?&amp;quot; She blushes. &amp;quot;Could it be that-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I returned all those things we stole.&amp;quot; She interrupts defiantly. Even when she was cornered she refused to stop fighting. &amp;quot;I couldn&amp;#39;t let that laser fall into the wrong hands.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Didn&amp;#39;t want it anyways. Building a moon laser never really interested me.&amp;quot; Closer... &amp;quot;Besides, you&amp;#39;re the one who stole it. I just held off the guards. If you didn&amp;#39;t want it, then who were you trying to impress by taking it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wasn&amp;#39;t trying to impress you- i mean anyone! I did it because...&amp;quot; Closer still. Right in front of her in fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because...&amp;quot; You lean in, your arms around her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because I-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;HEY BOSS, THE CHOPPER&amp;#39;S HERE!&amp;quot; A booming voice sends the two of you apart like you&amp;#39;d been thrown, and a roof hatch swings open to the outside world. You knew you&amp;#39;d forgotten about that! Also, whoever interrupted you is so getting fired, even if they were trying to stop you from getting caught by the cops, who&amp;#39;s sirens you could hear through the hatch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;god dammit!&amp;quot; You curse loudly. &amp;quot;-I mean MWAHAHA! I GUESS I&amp;#39;LL BE GOING NOW! SO LONG MISDIRECTION! WE&amp;#39;LL MEET AGAIN! (10:00 tonight, museum rooftop).&amp;quot; You say loudly, mouthing the last past to her with your back to the crowd and your henchmen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She catches on quick. &amp;quot;UH- YOU&amp;#39;LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THIS MINNITTO. I SWEAR I&amp;#39;LL DEFEAT YOU AND UNDO WHATEVER MIND CONTROL YOU PUT THE HOSTAGES UNDER FOR THE PAST 5-10 MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW LONG I&amp;#39;VE BEEN HERE! (I&amp;#39;ll be there.)&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You run for the open roof hatch and leap through it, landing in front of the helicopter. Entering it, your second in command gives you an odd look. &amp;quot;Uh boss, the boys are saying that you were-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Enough! let&amp;#39;s just get out of here. I&amp;#39;ve got something planned for tonight, and it could put me closer to that ridiculous foe of mine than I&amp;#39;ve ever been before.

He made it behind another pillar before a hail of plasma shots rained down on him. \n\n\u201cOh for the love of- enough!\u201d He leapt out from behind the pillar and focused on the ground beneath the girl\u2019s feet. Large vines exploded out of the ground, knocking the girl off her feet and the plasma gun out of her hand. The vines wrapped around her torso, securing her arms to her sides and letting her dangle a couple of feet off the ground.

Arsenal looked around and saw tiny flowers pop out of a grassy carpet and from vines that ran around pillars and along the walls of the bare warehouse. As the flowers bloomed, they emitted a soft blue light, very similar in color to her plasma guns. \n\n\u201cWhat do these flowers do?\u201d Arsenal asked, eyeing them suspiciously. \n\nEvergreen\u2019s face fell. \u201cYou don\u2019t like them?

And since when?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout a year. Do you remember when I first came to this city?\u201d\n\nArsenal snorted. \u201cYeah, your vines grew all over the suspension bridge and tossed a bunch of cars around during rush hour.\u201d\n\nThe boy flushed a bright red beneath his eye mask. \u201cI had heard about you and the good you did here, so I wanted to come meet you\u2026 maybe team up. And I wanted to make a good first impression, but I guess I didn\u2019t have a great handle on my powers yet, so that happened. And then you showed up and socked me in the face. When the police arrested me, I told them my side of the story.\u201d \n\nArsenal\u2019s mouth twisted into a frown. \u201cAnd did they believe you?\n\n\u201cYeah, they confirmed with my old city that I was on the up-and-up. The police chief said, and I quote, that that was the \u2018\u2019best damn laugh they\u2019ve had in a while.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh. But what about that time at the 4th of July celebration with the fireworks?\u201d\n\nEvergreen hung his head. \u201cI was experimenting with a compound and seeds that would release flower petals when the fireworks went off.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd instead, it rained glowing embers. What about the time you made the last five floors of a skyscraper explode?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company who owns the building had asked me to do some work on their rooftop garden and things just kinda got out of hand. Besides, the windows only broke because of all the flowers that were growing. No one got hurt! Like I said, not that great with my powers at the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously? And the police just let you go? I never heard anything about you serving time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just found it funnier every time you brought me in.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one thought to explain any of this to me?\u201d Arsenal asked, her voice cracking. \n\nEvergreen looked at her with a sheepish expression. \u201cWell, in the time I\u2019ve known you, you\u2019ve always been a \u2018shoot first, ask questions later\u2019 kind of girl. ..Like now, for instance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Arsenal wailed, her shoulders sagging. \u201cI\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201cH-hey, it\u2019s ok. We all make mistakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cMistakes that last two years? And I didn\u2019t even let you explain?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you now,\u201d Evergreen said, stepping closer. \u201cThat\u2019s what matters. But I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t like the flowers. I\u2019m gonna let you go now, ok?\u201d\n\nArsenal looked taken aback. \u201cI never said I didn\u2019t like them,\u201d she said as the vines set her gently back on the ground. She took her time looking about the warehouse, admiring the way the flowers glowed softly but brightly. A smile played at her lips. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful. It shows you\u2019ve grown into your powers lately. You even put up a good fight this time!\u201d\n\nEvergreen ducked his head. \u201cI wanted this to be perfect because I- because I think you\u2019re perfect,\u201d he said, twiddling his thumbs. \n\nArsenal stepped closer to him, a blush noticeable on her own cheeks. \u201cI owe you an apology. Ok, a lot of apologies. Do you think we can start over?\u201d\n\nThe boy grinned, and stuck out his hand. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Jason.\u201d\n\nThe girl returned the handshake. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Abby.\u201d\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHold still!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A tangle of vines shot out to grab the girl but she dodged them with ease. From the cover a nearby pillar, she fired a plasma shot at the boy controlling the vines, but he was just as evasive as she was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey, hold on a sec!\u201d The girl ignored him, and fired more plasma shots. The boy raised an arm and more vines shot up in front of him, forming a protective barrier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf you could listen for just a-\u201d He suddenly gasped and barely had time to move out of the way as the girl leapt at him from a metal beam above. He made it behind another pillar before a hail of plasma shots rained down on him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh for the love of- enough!\u201d He leapt out from behind the pillar and focused on the ground beneath the girl\u2019s feet. Large vines exploded out of the ground, knocking the girl off her feet and the plasma gun out of her hand. The vines wrapped around her torso, securing her arms to her sides and letting her dangle a couple of feet off the ground. The boy let out a huff of relief, and slowly approached the girl struggling against her bonds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey, take it easy. I just want to-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLet me go, Evergreen. Fight fair!\u201d snarled the girl. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evergreen ran a hand through his hair in frustration. \u201cFight fair? You\u2019re one to talk, Arsenal. I send you a message asking you to meet me, and you ambush me!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cObviously, it was a trap! Why else would you want me to meet you at an abandoned warehouse at the edge of the city?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBecause it was the only place I could show you what I did for you!\u201d exclaimed Evergreen, throwing up his arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd what exactly did you do for me?\u201d \n\u201c\nThis!\u201d Evergreen gestured to the area around them. Arsenal looked around and saw tiny flowers pop out of a grassy carpet and from vines that ran around pillars and along the walls of the bare warehouse. As the flowers bloomed, they emitted a soft blue light, very similar in color to her plasma guns. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat do these flowers do?\u201d Arsenal asked, eyeing them suspiciously. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evergreen\u2019s face fell. \u201cYou don\u2019t like them? I bred these flowers specially for you\u2026because I like you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arsenal stared at him, deadpan. \u201cWhat.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI like you, ok?\u201d Evergreen looked away from her, rubbing his neck in discomfort. \nArsenal\u2019s mouth opened and closed a couple of times before she found her voice again. \u201cWell, you certainly have a funny way of showing it! And since when?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAbout a year. Do you remember when I first came to this city?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arsenal snorted. \u201cYeah, your vines grew all over the suspension bridge and tossed a bunch of cars around during rush hour.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boy flushed a bright red beneath his eye mask. \u201cI had heard about you and the good you did here, so I wanted to come meet you\u2026 maybe team up.

She takes a long look around the restaurant until she notices an empty seat next to me and a visually excited me. I better do a wave or a smile so she knows it&amp;#39;s me. She sighed.

I&amp;#39;m Brandon.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Well, hello, Brandon, I guess...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a 30 minutes of awkward silence and even more weird looks thrown each other&amp;#39;s way, the only relief being the waiter who took the order.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You look worried. Is something bothering you?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Oh, nothing. Or maybe, just maybe, it is the setting we both are in. I swear, I tried to kill you six days ago and now we are sitting at one table at one of the most normal restaurants in Futuropolis. Is something bothering me? Maybe the people who are held hostage just for this morbid date to happen.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Oh, that. Well, you can be reliefed as there is no bomb. I made that up.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;But why?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;I really - and I do mean really - wanted to meet you and... I sort of have a crush on you. And it may or may not be the reason why I became a villain in the first place.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m speechless. You did all that... just to meet me? All the murders--&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;I haven&amp;#39;t killed or injured anybody.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;All the destroyed buildings--&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Abondened and scheduled for demolition.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;All the bank robberies--&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;That was payback for the housing market fall.&amp;quot;\nShe let out a giggle, at least I did something right this date!\n&amp;quot;Call me quick to change my mind, but my view of you changed for the better. Maybe there is a chance for something here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brandon changed for the better, Jeniffer decided that Futuropolis had enough heroes and she could leave her mantle of Venera. They had 2 strong years together until Brandon got sick of her clogging the drain with her long blond hair.

Though I try my best to pay attention to everything at all times, I find myself drawn to the sound of her voice. It's distracting. Like a loud noise that forces me to look her way. But \"loud\" is not a word I'd use to describe Katherine. She is soft, gentle, like a lullaby. But she's no lullaby, either. When Katherine speaks, I find myself revitalized and full of energy, ready to take on the world. \n\nI have never been good with words. She's difficult for me to describe. But if I had to pick just one word, I'd say that she is beautiful.\n\nSo when I overheard her talking to the alchemist, James, in the castle gardens, I had to listen. My job was mind-numbingly tedious as it was, and I have already said that she distracts me to no end. Besides -- picking weeds and grooming hedges require only slight attention.\n\n\"Did you hear about the killings last night?\"\n\nMy ears perked up at this. \n\n\"No, but I expected a few. Who was it this time?\" James asked as they walked the gravel garden path.\n\n\"Two village men and a little girl, cut down in Market. Witnesses say the killer vanished in the blink of an eye.\"\n\nJames grunted. \"That matches the other reports we've received. Seems this guy has no intention of giving up.\"\n\nI frowned. Ten seperate killings in the last two weeks. Three or four victims each time. All in public, and the attacker didn't leave a trace. They were calling him \"The Reaper\" (a clich\u00e9d name, I know). The city was terrified, and King Florence had so far done nothing about it.\n\nKatherine sighed. I knew that sigh. She was leading up to something.\n\n\"I just wish there was something I could do,\" she said. She paused, waiting for a reply.\n\n\"All we can do is keep out of the Guard's way.\"\n\nShe was silent for a moment. Then she snapped her fingers. \"Oh!\" She exclaimed, \"I just got an idea!\"\n\nI smirked. She'd known for a while.\n\n\"What if you got me a bottle of invisibility elixir? I could wait at Market, watch for the Reaper, then take --\"\n\n\"NO,\" James interrupted. \"Absolutely not! It's too dangerous.\" \n\nBut no man can resist Katherine for long.\n\n**\n\nI realize I've neglected to tell you some important details about Katherine. She is beautiful, yes, but she has a fire in her belly; what drives her is not money or fame. She has a steadfast determination to do good simply for the sake of doing good. This manifests itself in a few ways, my favorite of which is her tendency to beat the shit out of anyone who threatens her city.\n\nI've seen it on a few occasions. The first time, she dismantled a group of bandits who had set up camp in a farm a few miles out. I was about to do something, myself, but she beat me to it. Instead I got to watch in awe as sixteen men, all armed to the teeth, were beaten down by a fourteen year old girl. That was four years ago. She was even better now.\n\nSuffice to say, James didn't know what he was talking about. If anything is \"too dangerous\" for Katherine, I'll eat my spade.\n\n**\n\nLater that night I found myself on a roof, in a black cloak and a mask, watching Katherine walk down the street.\n\nI know how that sounds. You may not believe me, but I just wanted to make sure she was safe. I have a... particular skill set of my own that lends itself to this sort of work. And I knew nothing about this Reaper fellow beyond what I had overheard, so she could very well have been in danger. I had no way of knowing.\n\nSo despite my utter confidence in Katherine, I was watching over her anyway. I tailed her for an hour or so, leaping from roof to roof while she walked below. Finally she reached Market. She looked around once or twice, made herself comfortable on the steps of a corner shop, and downed her invisibility elixir.\n\nThen she was gone. \n\nI made myself comfortable as well. All the attacks so far had been in broad daylight, and we had a few hours yet. It was a little strange that she had come out this early to begin with, but I wasn't one to judge.\n\nI heard a footstep on the roof behind me. Just one, so faint I shouldn't have been able to hear it. But I did, and to this day I regret it.\n\nI jumped to my feet and turned to face Katherine.\n\nI opened my mouth to explain, but the look in her eyes killed the words before they touched my lips. And in that second of hesitation, she struck. First a straight right, then a left hook. I blocked her attacks more by instinct than choice, and before I knew it we were locked in a battle. I tried to find the words to explain myself, but every breath I took was thrown out of me by her onslaught.\n\n\"You're not very good at tailing people,\" she said through her teeth as she fought. \"You follow too close. I could see you easily.\" \n\nSuddenly she disengaged and jumped backwards. I took the opportunity to catch my breath. I watched her as I panted. Reaching into her cloak, she pulled out a small bottle and quickly drank it. And then she was gone. Another invisibilty potion.\n\n*They must have a limited duration,* I mused. But I didn't think for long. A massive kick struck me in the back and I fell forward, the breath driven from my lungs.\n\nI scrambled to my feet and looked around, seeing nothing. I knew she was there. I just had to find her.\n\nI closed my eyes and listened. There! To the right.\n\nShe struck again, but this time I was ready. I caught her fist and yanked on it, slamming her to the ground. But just like that she had wriggled out from under me, and found her way on top.\n\nI don't know if you've ever wrestled with an invisible person before, but it's quite difficult. At various points during the grapple I searched for an arm or a leg to grab, then found it a foot in the other direction. She didn't have that problem.\n\nSo when I found myself underneath her, and had a reasonable idea of where her torso was, I took my chance and kicked her over my head, behind me. For a moment at least, I was in the clear. Then I heard a scream. I scrambled to my feet and turned around to face the edge of the roof.\n\n*Shit.*\n\nI raced to the side of the building and looked down. I couldn't see Katherine anywhere. The elixir hadn't worn off yet, it seemed. All I could see was a cloud of dust thrown up where she had landed, and even that was fading quickly. I waited for her to appear.\n\nWhen I found myself still standing there an hour later, I knew she was gone. I hoped she was alright. I didn't mean to hurt her. This was all just a misunderstanding. It would work itself out in the end, right?\n\nLooking back, I couldn't have been more naive.\n\n*Author's Note: Typed this on my phone at work. I hope it makes sense.

She grit her teeth and struggled to free herself, until her foe appeared once more. He seemed to be smiling, which wasn't something she ever had the chance to see before. The hooded figure removed his hood and looked at her from beyond his red veil. \"You noticed the surprise over head huh? My red smoke will fall upon the city soon and it will taint everything, it all will be under my command,\" His voice was a tad different from before, now it felt a lot less rehearsed as if he was just saying whatever came to his mind.\n\nShe screamed, \"Stop this! You don't have to hurt anyone!\"\n\n\"Are you still trying to persuade me to give up? After all these battles we had, you still believe I can change?\" He retorted.\n\n\"Yes I do! No one is truly bad. They have something good inside them; they have something they care about!\"\n\"I-I care about nothing!\" He yelled, but it felt like a lie. He has told many lies in his life, but this one was probably the biggest lie.\n\nThis little drop from focus weakened the smokes grasp of her, which freed one arm. This would be enough for her to manipulate the space between them, suddenly a clear line through the smoke appeared and in a snap of her fingers she appeared a foot away from him. The heroine watched as he quickly jumped away from her as if he just awoke from deep thought. Something was on his mind and it was causing him to make mistakes, this some how made her feel a bit curious. \"You aren't acting like your usual self today, is something the matter? Or is this some kind of trick?\" said the greatest hero New Dawn has ever known.\nHe felt the familiarity of her question, from the countless years he has realized that no matter who you are, she still cared about people...even the evil ones.\n\n\"I have no clue what you are talking about,\" he countered.\n\"Then why aren't you fighting back as much as you usually do? Or went on about your evil scheme? You have something else on your mind.\" \n\nHe gasped at her perceptiveness, which has lead to his defeat countless times.\n\"I'm just thinking about how it will be like once I rule this city!\" He said trying to regain composure. He reached out his hand and the red smoke in the sky began to fall towards the Earth and would encompass the city in its whole.\nHowever, this didn't phase the crime fighter in the slightest, she only stepped closer to the evil villain. Her mouth was was left open and her eyes were puzzled. She spoke with complete certainty, \"You don't actually want to do this, do you?\"\n\nThe realization made his heart drop. It felt as if her words pierced right through his mind and heart and left it gaping wide enough anyone could see through.\n\n\"You don't even want to take over the city. There was another reason you did all of this.\" She said gently.\nHe choked on his words as he tried to find what to say.\n\nShe cut him off before he could say anything and instead asked him once more, \"You don't have to do this, you know? We can end it all here.\"\n\nShe was right, he thought to himself. It could all end here.\n\nA message appeared on the HUD of Gal Galaxy's helmet screen. News report say that the monument has been returned to it's place, or that is was never moved to begin with. Reports say the monument appeared as red smoke began to float away from the area.\n\n\"You never stole the Tower of Dawn, Master of Evil.\" The heroine said.\n\nThe villain halted the falling clouds as he lowered his head and replied, \"I never did. I simply covered it in such a way that it was invisible to the naked eye.\"\n\nShe stepped closer and asked, \"If you didn't steal it and you don't want to take over the town, then why did you do all this?\"\n\nHe silently wished that all of this would lead to this one moment. With the every ounce of his will he looked up to her and spoke with honesty, \"I wanted to see that smile of yours, the one that makes the whole galaxy smile back.\" It seem she wasn't ready for that answer as her face turned a shade of red under her helmet. \"You only ever smile like that when you defeat some grate threat. So I wanted to create such a threat that once you win...I will be able to see that smile.\" He could hardly believe the words he was saying, but it was exactly how he felt. The Master of Evil raised his hand one last time and the smoke above the city just disappeared all at once. He looked at her and lowered his head and said wholeheartedly, \"Because I love you.\"\n\nShe couldn't believe what she was hearing and only having it be confirmed by his actions.\n\"I surrender, you win Gal Galaxy.\" He said getting onto his knees and removing his mask.\nSoon the police arrived and James Clinch was arrest for his evil deeds. He didn't put up a fight or anything, he plead guilty for his crimes. Gal Galaxy was hailed as a hero for returning the monument and saving the city from the Master of Evil. The city will be at peace until the next big threat to come its way and Gal Galaxy will be there to meet it.\n\n5 months later after a speedy trial, James was sitting in a cell made to hold super powered villains. It has been a long day there with nothing to do, he was still debating if turning himself in was a good idea. He could have successfully taken over the whole city if he actually wanted to.\n\nA knock on the door of his room surprised him. He could hear the man on the other side fiddle with the lock and know. James looked beyond the bullet proof glass put in to protect any person that comes to see him at the door as it slowly opened. The first thing he seen was a girl with brown hair, and kind blue eyes. He sat next to the glass and stared at her before asking, \"What do you want?\"\n\nShe pulled up a chair that was in the corner of the room and sat close to the glass barrier. Her eagerness to see him sort of caught him off guard, specially since the last three weeks he has been here no one came to visit.\n\"I thought you would like some company, that is all.\" Said the woman as she made herself comfortable. This prompted him to next ask, \"Who are you?\" Which only made her giggle for a few seconds. Something about her made him feel something familiar, as if they met before.\n\n\"My name is Krystal, it's nice that we can finally sit down in talk for a change James.\"\n\"Krystal? Have we met? I'm pretty sure we have, but I cant figure out where.\" \nShe stopped him by putting out one finger. Then he could hear a so very familiar warping sound, that he has grown to use to throughout the years. He was almost speechless, as he sat back looking at her. Then he seen it, the smile that could create galaxies. He felt his heart flutter like it did months ago and now without a doubt; he knew he made the right choice.\n\nThe two would then spend the next hour and a half of visitor time to talk about each other and get to know the person behind the costume. When time was up she gave him one last smile before leaving, she promised that she will visit him again when she gets the time and he told her that he will be looking forward to it.\n\nThe End!", "edited": 1492323746.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the crimson mist surrounded her and held her hands at their sides.

The heroine watched as he quickly jumped away from her as if he just awoke from deep thought. Something was on his mind and it was causing him to make mistakes, this some how made her feel a bit curious. &amp;quot;You aren&amp;#39;t acting like your usual self today, is something the matter? Or is this some kind of trick?&amp;quot; said the greatest hero New Dawn has ever known.\nHe felt the familiarity of her question, from the countless years he has realized that no matter who you are, she still cared about people...even the evil ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have no clue what you are talking about,&amp;quot; he countered.\n&amp;quot;Then why aren&amp;#39;t you fighting back as much as you usually do? Or went on about your evil scheme? You have something else on your mind.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gasped at her perceptiveness, which has lead to his defeat countless times.\n&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just thinking about how it will be like once I rule this city!&amp;quot; He said trying to regain composure. He reached out his hand and the red smoke in the sky began to fall towards the Earth and would encompass the city in its whole.\nHowever, this didn&amp;#39;t phase the crime fighter in the slightest, she only stepped closer to the evil villain. Her mouth was was left open and her eyes were puzzled. She spoke with complete certainty, &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t actually want to do this, do you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The realization made his heart drop. It felt as if her words pierced right through his mind and heart and left it gaping wide enough anyone could see through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t even want to take over the city. There was another reason you did all of this.&amp;quot; She said gently.\nHe choked on his words as he tried to find what to say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She cut him off before he could say anything and instead asked him once more, &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t have to do this, you know? We can end it all here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was right, he thought to himself. It could all end here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A message appeared on the HUD of Gal Galaxy&amp;#39;s helmet screen. News report say that the monument has been returned to it&amp;#39;s place, or that is was never moved to begin with. Reports say the monument appeared as red smoke began to float away from the area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You never stole the Tower of Dawn, Master of Evil.&amp;quot; The heroine said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The villain halted the falling clouds as he lowered his head and replied, &amp;quot;I never did. I simply covered it in such a way that it was invisible to the naked eye.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stepped closer and asked, &amp;quot;If you didn&amp;#39;t steal it and you don&amp;#39;t want to take over the town, then why did you do all this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He silently wished that all of this would lead to this one moment. With the every ounce of his will he looked up to her and spoke with honesty, &amp;quot;I wanted to see that smile of yours, the one that makes the whole galaxy smile back.&amp;quot; It seem she wasn&amp;#39;t ready for that answer as her face turned a shade of red under her helmet. &amp;quot;You only ever smile like that when you defeat some grate threat. So I wanted to create such a threat that once you win...I will be able to see that smile.&amp;quot; He could hardly believe the words he was saying, but it was exactly how he felt. The Master of Evil raised his hand one last time and the smoke above the city just disappeared all at once. He looked at her and lowered his head and said wholeheartedly, &amp;quot;Because I love you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She couldn&amp;#39;t believe what she was hearing and only having it be confirmed by his actions.\n&amp;quot;I surrender, you win Gal Galaxy.&amp;quot; He said getting onto his knees and removing his mask.\nSoon the police arrived and James Clinch was arrest for his evil deeds. He didn&amp;#39;t put up a fight or anything, he plead guilty for his crimes. Gal Galaxy was hailed as a hero for returning the monument and saving the city from the Master of Evil. The city will be at peace until the next big threat to come its way and Gal Galaxy will be there to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 months later after a speedy trial, James was sitting in a cell made to hold super powered villains. It has been a long day there with nothing to do, he was still debating if turning himself in was a good idea. He could have successfully taken over the whole city if he actually wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A knock on the door of his room surprised him. He could hear the man on the other side fiddle with the lock and know. James looked beyond the bullet proof glass put in to protect any person that comes to see him at the door as it slowly opened. The first thing he seen was a girl with brown hair, and kind blue eyes. He sat next to the glass and stared at her before asking, &amp;quot;What do you want?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She pulled up a chair that was in the corner of the room and sat close to the glass barrier. Her eagerness to see him sort of caught him off guard, specially since the last three weeks he has been here no one came to visit.\n&amp;quot;I thought you would like some company, that is all.&amp;quot; Said the woman as she made herself comfortable. This prompted him to next ask, &amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot; Which only made her giggle for a few seconds. Something about her made him feel something familiar, as if they met before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My name is Krystal, it&amp;#39;s nice that we can finally sit down in talk for a change James.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Krystal? Have we met? I&amp;#39;m pretty sure we have, but I cant figure out where.&amp;quot; \nShe stopped him by putting out one finger. Then he could hear a so very familiar warping sound, that he has grown to use to throughout the years. He was almost speechless, as he sat back looking at her. Then he seen it, the smile that could create galaxies. He felt his heart flutter like it did months ago and now without a doubt; he knew he made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two would then spend the next hour and a half of visitor time to talk about each other and get to know the person behind the costume. When time was up she gave him one last smile before leaving, she promised that she will visit him again when she gets the time and he told her that he will be looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The End!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgbrssi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492352238.0, "created_utc": 1492323438.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbrsiv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mattdoss", "parent_id": "t3_65jeny", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "8 hour before the end.\n\n\"Villainy has made me more honest with myself.\"\n\n\"It's as if casting away all my emotions have made me understand them more.\"\n\n\"I feel weird...I shouldn't be feeling this! Why am I feeling this?\"\n\n\"Why does she make me feel this way? I-I should hate her...but I love her,\" thought James Clinch, AKA Master of Evil. The villain, Master of Evil, has been the reigning champion of all things nefarious in New Dawn City. To meet this threat to all that is good is the heroine, Krystal Hanway, better known as Gal Galaxy. The two has been fighting for three years now and it seems like nothing has changed until now. He noticed the reason why his plans were becoming sloppy, why she was winning easier and easier. He was letting her win and he didn't even know, however this realization came in a rather pleasant message.\n\nJames had a dream the night before. It was a dream of him being happy. Him and her being happy together. The dream felt so far away, but so real it caused him to feeling a emotion he has long since forgot, the feeling of love. So today, he dawned his darkened hood and crimson suit with a new plan. He will end his battle once and for all.\nHe spent that 7 hour putting together an elaborate scheme just for his to the best of his abilities. The Master of Evil knew that this will be his final battle with the gallant heroine that has saved the day countless times. The thought has been running through his head all these hours and it only fueled his determination. \"Only a hour left until everything changes...a hour until the end,\" James thought to himself as he set things into motion.\nOn the clock, the villains trap was sprung. It seemed like a dream when the monument, known as the \"Tower of Dawn\" disappeared from its foundation. The monument was the symbol of the city and all its hardships. To steal the monument was like stealing the city itself. The evil master knew this quite well, and he knew the chaos such an act would stir inside the people. It will only be minutes until a certain space-themed helmet and leotard wearing hero would come on the scene to investigate.\n\nGal Galaxy appeared at the scene of the crime. She was in total shock by the disappearance, but she knew only one person was capable. \"Master of Evil,\" she whispered to herself as she pressed a button on her helmet to scan for clues. However, upon pressing the button video appeared on her HUD instead. Gal Galaxy was caught off guard, but she knew she had to watch it, \"he is toying with me I just know it,\" she said in a hush whisper. The video began to play and it showed a dark hood man standing in a oddly dim room. The figure spoke,\n\"Quick to get to business aren't you Gal Galaxy?\"\n\n\"What are you planning? Are you planning on holding the monument for ransomed so the city to get it back?\" Said the hero, impatiently.\n\nThe figure replied instantly, \"This is a prerecorded message, but I assume you were asking why I would steal the 'Tower of Dawn'? Well there is a good reason for it. But I won't tell you why, you will have to find me and then I'll tell you the answer.\"\n\nShe frowned a little displeased over the circumstance. She replayed the video at least a dozen times, trying to comb through for any clues of where he might be. Gal Galaxy always knew the Master of Evil was good at playing Hide-and-Seek, but she knew he'd slip up. Then one small clue came to her attention, which caused her to grin with glee under her mask. A soft green light was glowing in the far back of the video, which allowed her to see a faint logo in the dark, a logo for an infamous car dealership that went under about two years ago. She had him now.\n\nJames wasn't dumb; he was the Master of Evil after all. He wanted her to find him so the next part of his plan could come to fruition. It only took 5 minutes until he heard the famous warping noise that came when Gal Galaxy uses her ability to manipulate space. He watched as the one clear spot in the room began to distort and change as if the space around it has been rippled like a stone being dropped into the water. Then out stepped Gal Galaxy...the sight almost made the Master's legs to give out. The heroine quickly taken notice of the villain and yelled out in confidence, \"It's over for you Master of Evil! You are getting sloppy, maybe you should call it quits before things get serious.\"\n\nHer voice, a voice he has heard about a hundred times, a voice that has always held kindness and oozed self-confidence, a voice that at this moment made him pause for just a moment on each word that arose. It felt like he was listening to an old tune that he heard over and over and still never got old. But, he had no time to stay tranced as he lifted his hand and a red smoke formed from the tips. Quickly the smoke surrounded the hero and she countered by making the smoke fan out through space.\n\nThe two have fought so many times that they know each other's moves, which is why the Master of Evil had to think outside the box. \"You know I hate not putting on a show for my guest, so how about I change things up a little?\" said the villain as he covered himself in his red smoke. Gal Galaxy used her powers to cause the smoke to disappear, but he was gone.\n\n\"The plan is working, but why am I doing this? I'm the the ruler of all that is heinous. The red cloud of wickedness,\" said James as he sweated in a secret room. He felt his heart was beating any he couldn't contain himself. Even the red smoke that floated from beneath his cloak was taking weird shapes, he could of sworn he seen a little red heart. He shook his head and tried to get a hold of himself. \"I still have another step in my plan that I need to do before the end.\"\n\nGal Galaxy was feeling more confused than ever; she has faced this man every week since their first faithful encounter a couple years ago. It was back when she was still new and her powers have only recently appeared, and around that time a new meta said to be able to control mystical red smoke that could taint, trap, or form whatever they desired. She has always beat him, but he always got away, maybe he was taking it easy on her? The thought crossed her mind, but she dispelled it as nonsense.\n\nShe glanced out the window at the sun that was just setting. She always liked watching the sunset, but it seem she would have to miss it for now. Then it dawned on her...the sky was unusually red. Then panic struck her as she began to realize what was going on. She quickly used her powers to appear outside of the dealership and her eyes trained on the red sky. \"H-He couldn't have!\" she said in shock, the whole sky was covered in a red cloud which she never noticed until now. His plan was beginning to unveil one giant scheme. The Master of Evil stole the monument to cover up for a bigger plot, he was going to take over the city in one swoop.\n(Continue below)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;8 hour before the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Villainy has made me more honest with myself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s as if casting away all my emotions have made me understand them more.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I feel weird...I shouldn&amp;#39;t be feeling this!

The person in question was Blaze, a 'superhero', whose power revolved around control, manipulation, and usage of fire. His arch rival was the super villain Iceika, an ice cold girl that built robots to do her bidding. Sure to his statement, blast doors opened, and more robots came pouring forth, spraying wildly with their weapons. Sighing, he ignited his hands, and then he body, and he surged forward as he turned into a small brightly burning trail of fire. He zipped around the robots, his trail scorching and burning any robot it came in contact with. One of the bullets from the robots found purchase as it crossed through the main trail, eliciting a cry of pain from the hero.  He turned back into human form as he hit the ground sprawling. A bullet had passed through his left thigh. Growling, his hands burst alight as he charged forth, ignoring the pain. He let loose a barrage of fireballs as he charged, robot after robot being burnt as he charged them. As the last one fell, the water sprinklers turned on, triggered by his fire, and water began to pour over him. He shrieked as it splashed into his exposed fire, the pain driving his hands numb as he rushed to cover them, instinctively sinking to the grounf. A distinctly feminine laugh filled the air. *Iceika.* As if on queue, the largest door on the room opened, and the villain stepped forth. \n\nShe was clad in white, with grey plates of light armour attached, light blue runes glowing. She brushed her near-white blonde hair out of her face with a black gloved hand. A white mask wrapped around her face. Her ice cold eyes stared directly at the young hero on the ground. 'Ah, Blaze, thank you for accepting my invitation!' she exclaimed gleefully as she approached him, stopping a couple metres before him. The boy's face immediately contorted in confusion. 'Invitation? You said that you were going to blow up a bomb and freeze the city and I came to stop you.'\n\nShe stared back at him, her own face perplexed. 'That was the invitation, dummy.'\n\nThe water sprinklers turned off, and Blaze slowly pulled his hood off his face, revealing his dark skin to the dim lighting. 'Invitation? What kind of new trick is this? Weaken me so you can encase me in frozen ice?'\n\n\nShe closed the distance, and now stood at arms' length. She stood taller than he did. He was pretty short. But she was Vlose enough for her cold breath to reach him, sending chills down his spine, both figuratively and literally. 'No, dear, if I wanted you hurt I'd have done so already. No, I invited you for something el-'\n\n\n'So you're trying to tell me this is an accident?' He mumbled as he showed his thigh. Iceika's reaction was not what he expected, as she rushed to inspect his leg, kneeling in front of him\n\n'Oh my God I'm so sorry! Th-that wasn't m-meant to happen! But how? I set the aim of those robots to 'Worse than White Arnoured Sci-Fi Soldiers! I'm so sorry!'\n\nIceika's mere presence cancelled out any of his powers, so he had no way to escape. He would simply have to wait...\n\n'It's ok, it'll heal...but what was I invited for?\n\n\n'I wanted someone to talk to,' she responded as he got a band aid out from her pocket. She sloppily applied it to the wound. \n\n\n'So you built an army of robots, trashed a jewellery store, got me to come and fight said army of robots in tour secret lair, so you could..talk to me? Why me? I'm not interesting...'\n\n\nShe gasped, and slammed her hands into the ground in front of her (or either side of him, idk how to put it) and leaned forward. Her eyes narrowed.  'I wanted to talk with you, and you are interesting.  Very interesting' she awkwardly pulled her arms back. \n\n\nSeeing that arguing would not get him anywhere, he tried to converse with her. He wasn't usually good at talking with girls...much less a super villain...'so...what do you want to talk about?'\n\n\n\nShe shifted uncomfortably, looking at a very interesting piece of flooring. 'I was wondering...if you wanted to go to dinner with me....' she wrapped her arms around himself. \n\n*Maybe I should have just fought.* 'Why...me...?'\n\nShe looked up, and straight into his charcoal eyes. 'B-because...i...like you...d-dummy....'\n\nAs he heard that, he immediately looked at the ground, trembling. 'No, you don't,' he stammered. \n\n\nShe looked back at him, clearly hurt. 'But I just sai-'\n\n'No, you don't,' he growled. Rage began to pour into him, enough for his hands to ignite again. \n\n\nShe weakly tried to reach out. 'I really do-'\n\n'No, you don't!' He cried out as he stood up, tears welling in his eyes. 'No one can! No one can like me, so stop lying!'\n\n\nShe took her mask off, and tried to approach him. 'I do. I really do. Why else do you think I'm always trying to get you to come? Why else would I put so much time and effort into trying to get your attention, trying to get you to at least talk with me? All those times I captured you, I did it so I could talk to you...' tears ran down her face as she continued. 'Just because you were hurt before doesn't mean you have to push everyone away. Just because your parents abused and neglected you doesn't mean others will. Just because other people bully and harass you doesn't mean I will. Please...'\n\n*How does she know this?* he loosened up, as his fire died down. 'You mean...all this time...you just wanted to be...with...me...?'\n\n\n'Mhm' she sniffled. \n\nAnger met him again. 'Lies.' He ignited his hands and prepared to go. He had been here too long. He turned around, gritted his teeth, and began to run. \n\n\nHer eyes widened. 'No! Don't go!' she cried as she ran after him. In his weakened state, he was not running very fast, and he growled as she closed the distance. She dived for him, and tackled him to the ground. They went sprawling, and she latched on to his right arm, and refused to let go, even as he kneeled, preparing to leave again. 'Please..trust me...' she croaked, her teary eyes looking straight at him. Her right hand went and cupped his left cheek, her cold skin causing him to flinch.\n\nHis heart melted as he began to cry bitter tears. 'Why...why me... what have I ever done to deserve care...deserve friendship...deserve love...?' \n\n\nShe smiled back, and wiped his tears away. 'Because everyone deserves a chance. We all deserve a shot at love.'\n\nHe clenched his eyes shut, and he shuffled closer to her. He wiped her tears away with his own hand. His dark eyes locked onto her own blue ones, as they stood up. Without a word, they embraced, and slowly melted to the ground.\n\n\nTogether, they lay on the floor, tears of joy running down their faces, hands entwined and refusing to release the other. 'So...will you come to dinner with me...?' She inquired nervously.\n\n\n'Of course,' he responded with a smile.\n\n\nHours passed as they continued to lay on the lab floor. Eventually, he had fallen asleep, but she was still awake. *must be these damn armour plates.* she slowly peeled his arm off her, and stood up. *but we can't sleep here* she wondered as she looked at the time. 7pm. She sent a message to her robot to come with the teleporter. Glancing back at his sleeping body, she walked over, and gingerly picked him up and held him in her arms. \n\n\nThe ride home was nothing spectacular, because teleporters don't take long.  The robots took care of his wound as she took her armour off, and put on a shirt and pants. She walked into her room, and sighed happily as she saw his sleeping figure tucked in the bed. She climbed in, and placed herself In his arms as she dozed off.\n\n\n~~\n\nSo was that good? I hope it is....", "edited": 1492371027.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never written before but here we go&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~~~~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A figure, dressed in a simple hood, track pants and runners, stepped over the charred remains of what appeared to be a combat robot, a trail of embers following him. &lt;em&gt;More will come&lt;/em&gt; , he mused to himself. The person in question was Blaze, a &amp;#39;superhero&amp;#39;, whose power revolved around control, manipulation, and usage of fire. His arch rival was the super villain Iceika, an ice cold girl that built robots to do her bidding. Sure to his statement, blast doors opened, and more robots came pouring forth, spraying wildly with their weapons. Sighing, he ignited his hands, and then he body, and he surged forward as he turned into a small brightly burning trail of fire. He zipped around the robots, his trail scorching and burning any robot it came in contact with. One of the bullets from the robots found purchase as it crossed through the main trail, eliciting a cry of pain from the hero.  He turned back into human form as he hit the ground sprawling. A bullet had passed through his left thigh. Growling, his hands burst alight as he charged forth, ignoring the pain. He let loose a barrage of fireballs as he charged, robot after robot being burnt as he charged them. As the last one fell, the water sprinklers turned on, triggered by his fire, and water began to pour over him. He shrieked as it splashed into his exposed fire, the pain driving his hands numb as he rushed to cover them, instinctively sinking to the grounf. A distinctly feminine laugh filled the air. &lt;em&gt;Iceika.&lt;/em&gt; As if on queue, the largest door on the room opened, and the villain stepped forth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was clad in white, with grey plates of light armour attached, light blue runes glowing. She brushed her near-white blonde hair out of her face with a black gloved hand. A white mask wrapped around her face. Her ice cold eyes stared directly at the young hero on the ground. &amp;#39;Ah, Blaze, thank you for accepting my invitation!&amp;#39; she exclaimed gleefully as she approached him, stopping a couple metres before him. The boy&amp;#39;s face immediately contorted in confusion. &amp;#39;Invitation? You said that you were going to blow up a bomb and freeze the city and I came to stop you.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stared back at him, her own face perplexed. &amp;#39;That was the invitation, dummy.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The water sprinklers turned off, and Blaze slowly pulled his hood off his face, revealing his dark skin to the dim lighting. &amp;#39;Invitation? What kind of new trick is this? Weaken me so you can encase me in frozen ice?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She closed the distance, and now stood at arms&amp;#39; length. She stood taller than he did. He was pretty short. But she was Vlose enough for her cold breath to reach him, sending chills down his spine, both figuratively and literally. &amp;#39;No, dear, if I wanted you hurt I&amp;#39;d have done so already. No, I invited you for something el-&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;So you&amp;#39;re trying to tell me this is an accident?&amp;#39; He mumbled as he showed his thigh. Iceika&amp;#39;s reaction was not what he expected, as she rushed to inspect his leg, kneeling in front of him&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Oh my God I&amp;#39;m so sorry! Th-that wasn&amp;#39;t m-meant to happen! But how? I set the aim of those robots to &amp;#39;Worse than White Arnoured Sci-Fi Soldiers! I&amp;#39;m so sorry!&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Iceika&amp;#39;s mere presence cancelled out any of his powers, so he had no way to escape. He would simply have to wait...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s ok, it&amp;#39;ll heal...but what was I invited for?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;I wanted someone to talk to,&amp;#39; she responded as he got a band aid out from her pocket. She sloppily applied it to the wound. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;So you built an army of robots, trashed a jewellery store, got me to come and fight said army of robots in tour secret lair, so you could..talk to me? Why me? I&amp;#39;m not interesting...&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She gasped, and slammed her hands into the ground in front of her (or either side of him, idk how to put it) and leaned forward. Her eyes narrowed.  &amp;#39;I wanted to talk with you, and you are interesting.

I grabbed my energy scythe and walked out to where Tyrannosaur was, waving the bomb around and scaring civilians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He should be here by now..&amp;quot; I muttered, looking around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tyrannosaur turned to me and said,&amp;quot; You&amp;#39;re trying to bring him over, yeah?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s correct.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then help me, you son of a bitch! Scare these civies!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fine.&amp;quot; I walked up and raised my scythe in the air, &amp;quot;Citizens of New York! If you don&amp;#39;t surrender now, Tyrannosaur and I, the great Magnus, shall destroy you all!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The civilians were scared, perfect. I smiled, this was all going according to the plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oi, Magnus! Megaton and League are here!&amp;quot; Tyrannosaur yelled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned, seeing Megaton land from the ship, with Pyromaniac and Magician with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well if it isn&amp;#39;t Megaton and his lackeys!&amp;quot; I laughed defiantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Surrender you two! Your evil plans shall be foiled yet again!&amp;quot; Magician yelled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Quiet lady! Ill destroy the lot of you!&amp;quot; Tyrannosaur yelled, preparing to charge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before Tyrannosaur could charge, I trapped him in an energy field.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wha- Oi! Magnus, whaddya doing?&amp;quot; He yelled, trying to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, do explain.&amp;quot; Megaton said, walking over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Megaton, you can take me and my friend here in. But I wanted to talk to you.&amp;quot; I said, I could feel the butterflies in my stomach fluttering up a storm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pyromaniac, disable the bomb.&amp;quot; Megaton ordered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Da.&amp;quot; He ran over and began to fiddle with the bomb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright, what do you want to talk about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, would there be anyway we could this over coffee?&amp;quot; I said shyly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What, like a date?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Erm..&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a crazy man, Magnus, but I accept.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgbc4gg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492327407.0, "created_utc": 1492298607.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
