I've never heard of a better way to describe a song as ass.\"\n\nAt first I tried to hard restart my computer.

I went for the monitor's cord next, thinking the screen was somehow frozen. No, this was something else entirely.\n\nI removed the headphones, but it was still there... faint, but audible. Thinking for a few minutes, I realized it was getting louder. I only had a moment before the exponential burst of noise rocketed me back and started shaking the floor.\n\nMy mother rushed in, eyes wide in panic thinking a bomb went off. The moment she opened the door, I rushed out along with my friend, dragging my mother in tail, inaudible over the ever growing music, now rattling the building like an earthquake.\n\nSo much happened afterwards. In my mind, it was like a slideshow. Incomprehensible while happening, but I can remember the scenes as I think. The building was evacuated, the police called. Soon the swat came, and when no one could reach my headphones, the military became involved.\n\nNo scientist could explain what was going on, only that there was a hemisphere of destruction resonating from my headphones. Within was vibrations so strong that anything inside was torn to pieces. Just beyond it was a song now etched into mankind's collective mind.\n\nWe had no solution. After a few months, the noise had consumed most of America, and was clawing through Mexico and Canada. Only a few thousand had escaped to other countries. The rest were rejected and desperately used their time trying to find a way to stop the music. No one could stop it, and as it became apparent that the world would be consumed, everyone was in a frenzy.\n\nIt was a witch hunt after that. Darting from place to place, my friend and I being looked at as the harbingers of this unforeseen apocalypse. There was no arguing it, as herd mentality left us not as just pariahs, but as the targets for which distress could be centered on.\n\nIt meant nothing. Soon the governments collapsed. As the impending music screeched forward, the hemisphere inching upon the shores of Europe and Asia, the most rational people left either abandoned hope, or frantically tried to escape earth itself.\n\nI watch now with deaf ears, the music closing in. I stand in a shack soon to be touched by the white horseman. Nothing will be left but the siren of death. Though, even now I can feel the vibrations in my bones, the music shaking my very core. I feel now that which billions have felt before their end.\n\nOne beat after the other. Rhythmically, Chaotically Chanting across the world as it envelops the last virgin soil yet untouched by its entropy. My last feeling as I too am consumed by the music can only be described by its lyrics...
