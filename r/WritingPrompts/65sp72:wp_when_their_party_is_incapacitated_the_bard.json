Alice would regularly break the silence by reminding us that our mission is holy and that gods are on our side. She would point to the lovely weather as proof that we are blessed. The weather was surprisingly welcoming for this parts of the land. We are heading further north then my home town and it is only few days until winter. Yet I felt worm, actually Much warmer then I have felt in months. \"We are approaching the gates of hell\" Althalos replied\" Off course it is warm here\". I preferred Alice's theory. An hour later Janet stopped. She spotted  a horde of orcs \nmarching toward us. Doran drew his sword, Althalos started casting his spell and I pulled my harp. \n\"In the mountains of the north, the orcs would try their luck,\nbefore they could oppose, they will see how much they su...\" The hell. It went from being warm to boiling in a second. Oh, it is Althaloses fire ball. The orcs are all slain. I can but feel but disappointed.  My song didn't even start really, Doran felt the same. He was eagerly looking for a fight. Most interestingly, Jante was not even looking at the orcs, it seems like she was analyzing us. It is going to be a fun night.\n\nThe sun is gone, it is time for us to set up a camp. Althalos again did all the work. Why soul'd we bother when he can just cast one spell. Doran is getting more and more irritated, he is used to being the one who carries most weight in any party. Meanwhile no one trusted Janet, her kind gets a bad reputation. I don't know why but for once, my pride didn't get the best of me. Perhaps there is truth to the old saying about the bard and the camp fire.\n\"And who, of you children, did not hear the song?\n\nOf the mightiest hero, Sir Doran the strong?\n\nWhen the dragon faced him, the dragon was cut,\n\nHe went to the Giant and said kiss my butt.\n\nWe all should drink, for Sir Dorans sake,\n\nfor him, kings tourney, was a pice of cake.\n\nWhat about Janet and her quick hands?\n\nThe most honorable of the shadow lands.\n\nShe fouled daemons and lords alike\n\nHer bow would draw but her words would srike\"...\n\nThe songs went on, Everyone seemed more relaxed, had fine ale. We all knew that we needed rest for tomorrow. We are close to the hell portal. The battle was coming\n\nThe king of daemons ,Luciano himself, appeared.  His hordes of zombies sounded us. Doran and Janet rushed to him while Alice was banishing the undead. Luciano turned invisible! No one saw that coming. Alice fell. No, she cant be the first to fall. Who will heal us now? His next target was Althalos, the mage is powerless when facing such an opponent in close combat. Doran cut dozens of minions to reach them but he was too late. Althos fell. The might knight stood his ground against the deamon king. But hundreds of minions surrounded him. Striking him for every angle, he too was defied. janet is no where to be seen. Its all on me now. Well there is only one thing I can do. A bard should never preform this music as it hurts your party more then it helps them. Given that they are all dead\nI could not see the harm. I take out my harp and use the one spell that I know to turn it into a wicked electric guitar. And 3,2,1.\n\n\"DEMOOOOOONS, UNHOLY BASTAAAAAAAARDS!!\n\nGO TO HELL\n\nBURN IN HELL\n\nMAY YOU FOREVER DWELL\n\nIN HEEEEEEEEEELL!!\n\n\"wicked solo\"\n\n\" I will gauge your eyes,\n\nwatch your child as it dies,\n\nturn your truth to lies,\n\nto your doom give riiise!!\"\n\nHave you ever seen demon eyes out of their skulls. I must have seen couple of thousand that day. The ones who didn't have their heads explode jumped voluntarily back to hell. Including their King. \n\nNow all that is left, is for me to write a tragedy. Tragedy of the heroes that sacrificed their lives to save the world. Then I can go back to my merry life of ale and song.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492400276.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the gates of hell opened, I was surprised the king called me to aid.

Perhaps there is truth to the old saying about the bard and the camp fire.\n&amp;quot;And who, of you children, did not hear the song?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of the mightiest hero, Sir Doran the strong?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the dragon faced him, the dragon was cut,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He went to the Giant and said kiss my butt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all should drink, for Sir Dorans sake,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;for him, kings tourney, was a pice of cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about Janet and her quick hands?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most honorable of the shadow lands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She fouled daemons and lords alike&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her bow would draw but her words would srike&amp;quot;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The songs went on, Everyone seemed more relaxed, had fine ale. We all knew that we needed rest for tomorrow. We are close to the hell portal. The battle was coming&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The king of daemons ,Luciano himself, appeared.  His hordes of zombies sounded us. Doran and Janet rushed to him while Alice was banishing the undead. Luciano turned invisible! No one saw that coming. Alice fell. No, she cant be the first to fall. Who will heal us now? His next target was Althalos, the mage is powerless when facing such an opponent in close combat. Doran cut dozens of minions to reach them but he was too late. Althos fell. The might knight stood his ground against the deamon king. But hundreds of minions surrounded him. Striking him for every angle, he too was defied. janet is no where to be seen. Its all on me now. Well there is only one thing I can do. A bard should never preform this music as it hurts your party more then it helps them. Given that they are all dead\nI could not see the harm. I take out my harp and use the one spell that I know to turn it into a wicked electric guitar. And 3,2,1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;DEMOOOOOONS, UNHOLY BASTAAAAAAAARDS!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GO TO HELL&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BURN IN HELL&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MAY YOU FOREVER DWELL&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IN HEEEEEEEEEELL!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;wicked solo&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; I will gauge your eyes,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;watch your child as it dies,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;turn your truth to lies,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to your doom give riiise!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen demon eyes out of their skulls. I must have seen couple of thousand that day. The ones who didn&amp;#39;t have their heads explode jumped voluntarily back to hell. Including their King. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now all that is left, is for me to write a tragedy. Tragedy of the heroes that sacrificed their lives to save the world. Then I can go back to my merry life of ale and song.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgd1jlp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492428364.0, "created_utc": 1492399564.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 98}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sp72", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sp72", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sp72", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdn1c8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "monkify", "parent_id": "t1_dgdgi89", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hey, thanks!

Hers was the way of the sword: always had been, and I had admired her greatly for it. I, however, had chosen the way of music, to the dismay of my family. \n\n'*Bards have no place on the battlefield*,' my war-torn father would say, polishing his old, worn armor with his old, worn hands. '*They are meant for the stage, and nothing else.*' \n\nHe was not the only one to hold such an opinion. Yet, I did not falter. Music ran in my blood; I was made to compose, and not just for twittering nobles who wanted to see us sing like songbirds: for my comrades as well.\n\n\"Your valor spurs me to greater heights,\" she insisted, and gave me her hand to hold. Hers was rough; mine was soft. \"You will be my bard, won't you? I could not rest without you by my side, my dearest friend. Be my courage.\" \n\n\"If you will have me, O Knight Most Holy.\" I bowed\u2014making her fluster and insist that I never do such a thing and then stomping on my feet when I did it repeatedly to tease. \n\n----------\n\n\"Christine! I need\u2014\"\n\n*Already playing,* I thought, dipping my head down as my fingers flew along strings of my lute, trying to summon the utmost power I had welling inside of me\u2014anger and righteousness turned to song. The mage sighed in relief for but a split moment as he unleashed the largest peal of fire I'd seen in months. \n\nMy eyes caught sight of royal violet, and my attention turned yet again to my holy paladin, the backbone of our small band of heroes: Anastasia, holding her shield high against the swarm of undead. Fire caught at the edge of her violet cape, but I knew she paid it no mind as long as we were safe. \n\nJohn scowled as he cast his holy spells, pointing at a spirit and purifying it in an instant\u2014he was obviously too busy. \n\nTaking in a deep breath, I concentrated and started to strum a calming melody. I may not be blessed by the church (quite the opposite) but I could still heal my allies while they were otherwise preoccupied. \n\nPerhaps we were a little over our heads. It had never stopped Anastasia before, and where she went, I would always follow. \u2026 even if this dimly lit, mossy dungeon was cramped, creepy, and chillingly cryptic. We would have a talk about this when we escaped. \n\n\"\u2026 the west passage,\" Saito spoke, his voice calm and soothing even as he fought to catch his breath\u2014he tightened the black belt cinching his robe closed. \"It may be safest.\" \n\nThe black-robed shadow simply locked eyes with Anastasia and nodded, and she nodded in return, taking a step back as she let him move forwards, scout for traps and signs of the undead. \n\n\"Christine, are you alright?\" Anastasia turned her eyes to me. \n\nI just tried to put out the still-flickering flames at the edge of her cape with my boot, absentmindedly noting, \"I wasn't in any danger.\"\n\nJohn touched my shoulder to speak\u2014perhaps thank me? I could hope\u2014but we all flinched to attention as we heard rusted iron screech shut, and a loud cry of pain. \n\n\"Toma!\" Saito exclaimed, rushing forwards, the rest of us on his heels. Anastasia yanked on the back of Saito's robe, just barely saving him from a snarling animated skeleton, towering over all of us. As she leapt in to grab its attention, unable to see Toma anywhere, I couldn't help but notice the variable horde of skeletons now converging into the narrow pathway.\n\n\"Not good,\" I whispered, strumming on my lute again, knowing poor John would have to forgo healing once more. The healing field picked up around me, a light wind dusting at our feet as I continued to play. \n\nJohn moved forwards to try and concentrate on the horde approaching, trying to control the crowd. Yet, a splatter of blood broke through my thoughts\u2014in just a second I had spent looking towards the terrifying crowd, a spear had lodged in John's shoulder. He screamed in agony, pulling back, trying in vain to cast again\u2014but there was no point, not anymore. \n\nMy healing song was not enough to sustain Anastasia by itself, and despite how quickly I would strum, I saw her movements slow as she struggled to hold on. I couldn't keep this up.\n\n\"They're behind us!\" John called, crouching low to the floor as he kept bleeding. \n\nSaito pelted forwards in a blind rage, throwing his fists into the skeletons and knocking skulls off in amazing feats of strength. \n\nIt wouldn't be enough. The crowd of undead was too large, and without John being able to heal\u2026 \n\nA mirthful laugh echoed through the passageways. \n\n\"Oh, no,\" Jacob murmured, though he continued to cast despite the chaos. \"It's\u2026\" \n\n\"My dark brother,\" the voice spoke, an intimidating and towering figure bringing up the back of the undead horde. \"The Darkest Eminance notes your betrayal\u2026 for going against me, your allies will perish. You will perish\u2026 and join my side.\" \n\nBefore I could even blink, a tendril of darkness struck out, striking Jacob in the chest. \n\n\"C-christine\u2026\" Anastasia spoke, her voice pained: yet, as I looked to her, a sad smile appeared on her face. \n\n\"*No*,\" I replied immediately, white hot anger spiking through my trembling hands. I knew what she wanted to say: it was obvious. Something like 'stand down', or\u2026 something blindly heroic. My gentle plucking turned frantic, and my eyes focused on the dark figure heading the clamoring crowd of undead. No. No, no, no! We *would* not fail! I was *not* going to see Anastasia fall after so long! \n\nForbidden or not, it didn't matter. Our survival hinged on my decision: to follow what I had been told, or to do as I wanted. Even though I'd never composed the forbidden art, I had no choice: my voice dropped low and vocalized rough notes.\n\n\"Little bard,\" the figure laughed. \"Are you composing your requiem?\"\n\nThe wail that ripped from my throat shook the foundation beneath my feet\u2014even Anastasia lost her footing. Instead of gentle caress, the wind whipped around me like the eve of a storm. The figure bored his gaze right back into mine: I refused to blink. \n\nOne after the other, shockwaves pulsed through the crowd, reverberating in my chest, echoing like a violent heartbeat through my feet. \n\nThe skeletons shuddered. Their structures collapsed from the shockwaves as the field started to spread, hollow bones dropping to cracked stone ground and adding percussion to my already heavy beat. \n\n\"You useless peon!\" the figure snarled, raising his hand to send the rest of its army forwards. \"What dark magic runs through your veins? Die!\" \n\nWith a fast flurry of chords and rapidfire, gravelly lyrics torn from my tired throat, a barrier reflected their attacks, rebounding their flailing arms right back at them. \n\nI had to breathe, on my last legs\u2014I couldn't keep up. My energy was almost spent, and this music\u2026 forbidden as it was, was my salvation for the time being\u2026 I had to laugh. \n\n\"Magic? Do not flatter yourself. Your Darkest Eminence,\" I spoke, voice dripping with sarcasm, \"have you not heard? A holy priest is strongest in a church; a paladin is strongest taking a beating for their loved ones. You cannot break a ninja of their loyalty nor break the spirit of a monk.\"\n\n\"And a bard is meant for the stage!\" he sneered, lifting his hand again, a dark tendril rising to his hand. \n\nI strummed my lute hard, letting out a single, violent chord that reverberated through the entire damp, dark corridor. His Darkest Eminence gasped in pain, stunned still from the sound, unable to move. Slowly, I raised my head, peals of iridescent, blinding white light beginning to outline my form. \n\n\"We are, indeed,\" I said. \"And wouldn't you know it\u2026? All the world's a stage.\" \n\n---------\n\nI mean, it's probably not death metal. Maybe Babymetal? First time filling one of these out, orz, hope I'm doing this right. \n\nOtherwise: hey, I mean. There are many types of bards. :P\n\n**Edit** whaaat the fuck, my first gold! Thank you, stranger! (I was listening to Megitsune for inspiration...!)

The half-geckoling, being suddenly showered in cheap mead let out an appalled, hissing shriek, slamming down her chopsticks. She kicked her chair from under her and shoved the oblong table with all of her petite fury. Exceedingly amused by the futile show of force, the highlander mightily guffawed, revealing the only thing thicker than his brogue was his laughter.\n\n\"Now that's enough the both of you!\" barked the only man-kin at the table, a weather beaten human wearing a symbol of Belobog around his neck. The half-geckoling look at him aghast and waved her velcroed finger towards bull holstaur.\n\n\"But dis oaf...!\" she squeeled, hushed by the gavel of iron-clad fist on oak.

Nebit, you will apologize to the barkeep for disrupting his patrons.\"\n\n\"Yessssir.\" \"Aye sir.\"\n\nThe haggared man-kin turned his gaze to the newest member of the rag tag party. The lithe drow was visibly shaken by confrontation he had just bore witness to. The naive dark elf was just as much out of his comfort zone in the dinge filled pub as any location within the walled man-kin town. Lazlo exhaled a soft-hearted sigh.\n\n\"Your name was Derafi? You're from a long lineage of drow bards you said?\" The young elf nodded sheepishly. \n\n\"Good, Belobog is in need of your magyks. The coin is good, and the adventure broad. So you will join us?\" Lazlo gestured to the rogue, highlander, and layline dancer around the table.\n\n\"Y- yes. I will.\"\n\n_____\n\n\"Nebit is rogue, she find and stop traps wonderfully. We walk safe with her in quiet.\" spoke Namid in a breathy whisper, swaying as a snake would for a hypnotist. The thick smoke of incense swirled delicately around the wood elf's fingers in the din of her covered wagon.\n\n\"Angus is highlander, he mighty warrior, stronger than trees of one hundred years. As he stands, we fear not villains.\" Namid mused with with her vacant smile. She absently sipped her thick tea, before collecting her thoughts once more.\n\n\"Lazlo is paladin, the shield of his god. We face no harm through his righteousness, a good friend.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"Ah! Namid dances with magyk. Namid hears the song of the earth and recites to those who do not.\"\n\n\"I do not know what you mean.\" Derafi sighed, finding it hard to understand the woman he had as traveling companion. The miasma of scents assailing his nose, made him light headed, and Namid's foreign speech confused him all the more.\n\n\"It is fine Derafi, music of the dark elf, your magyk song is well suited for we. Now eat, long travel still awaits us this day.\"\n\n____\n\n\"Fer once Ieh agreeh! Would'yeh sang fer oos?\" roared Angus, waving around his drink with the same wild abandon as always. Derafi looked about nervously, his comrades goading him into song. He looked to Lazlo seeking solidarity, but the man-kin only shrugged and started to chant with the huge bullman.\n\nBeaten in numbers, the drow lifted the decorated bundle of his family's krar out of his rucksack. He gingerly folded away the drake-leather bindings, as he had watched his father do many times. Inspecting every corner, every string, every peg until he was satisfied it survived the long journey from his homeland. Derafi plucked a single string, letting it hum along side the crackle of the camp fire.\n\nFor his new family, Derafi wove the magyk of song.\n\n___________\n\nA clatter of iron against stone rang louder than any, signaling the end. Derafi dared not move from behind the column that kept him hidden. He began to whisper the magyk that Namid taught him, the sight without eyes. There was no life in the cave but him, his friends were slain. Derafi's whimpering turned to crying as he cursed himself for hiding. It took all he had not to bite through his finger as he stifled his shame. \n\nThe words of Muse suddenly rang in Derafi's mind. \"Heavy Metal, the forbidden music.\" He hesitantly crawled his hand towards his rucksack, delicately clawing through it until he found the small bone box. He tentatively removed the loadstone amplifier, and mumbled the electric magyk as his grandmatron instructed all the bards of his family.\n\nDerafi filled the poor sound chamber with an explosion of sound, strumming feverishly at geometric instrument. The Lich instantly turned to the drow and launched into a hellish pursuit. Derafi sung out in the language of the Muse.\n\n*Death I call upon thee*\n\n*Reach thine claw from hell*\n\n*Muse speaketh through me*\n\n*Mine life is thine to sell*\n\nAll went still. Derafi witnessed Death\n\n*My family lay at thine feet*\n\n*Mercy I do beg of thee*\n\n*Their souls returneth to their meat*\n\n*In exchange for theirs thou get me\"\n\nDeath gaze upon the drow. The young dark elf furiously strumming and plucking the strings of his krar.\n\n\"ENOUGH!\" a voiceless emotion shook Derafi's being.\n\n\"NOT YOU. NOT THEM. HIM\"\n__________\n\n\"Derafi wake up. Wake up pleassse.\" hissed Nebit, gently shaking dark elf's lifeless form. Lazlo's hand-of-healing shone brightly over the adolescent's chest, but he grimly shook his head. Now the only sound echoing through the cave were Angus's blubbery tears dripping into his stein of ale.\n\nA horrid gasp, the effluvia of life rushing through his veins, Derafi awoke.\n\n\"My friends you are all alive?\" \n\n\"Alive?\" inquired Lazlo, prying Nebit's bawling arms from around the dark elf's shoulders.\n\n\"And the Lich?\" Derafi asked\n\n\"The Lich?\" Lazlo questioned again, before Angus barreled into the dog pile of tears and hugs.\n\n\"Him, not them, not me.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you're ok Derafi? You're talking nonsense.\"\n\n\"I played Death Metal, I communed with Death.\"\n\n\"That would explain a lot. Well?\"\n\n\"Well what?\" asked Derafi.\n\n\"What did IT say?\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh my fates!

The thick smoke of incense swirled delicately around the wood elf&amp;#39;s fingers in the din of her covered wagon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Angus is highlander, he mighty warrior, stronger than trees of one hundred years. As he stands, we fear not villains.&amp;quot; Namid mused with with her vacant smile. She absently sipped her thick tea, before collecting her thoughts once more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lazlo is paladin, the shield of his god. We face no harm through his righteousness, a good friend.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah! Namid dances with magyk. Namid hears the song of the earth and recites to those who do not.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do not know what you mean.&amp;quot; Derafi sighed, finding it hard to understand the woman he had as traveling companion. The miasma of scents assailing his nose, made him light headed, and Namid&amp;#39;s foreign speech confused him all the more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is fine Derafi, music of the dark elf, your magyk song is well suited for we. Now eat, long travel still awaits us this day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fer once Ieh agreeh! Would&amp;#39;yeh sang fer oos?&amp;quot; roared Angus, waving around his drink with the same wild abandon as always. Derafi looked about nervously, his comrades goading him into song. He looked to Lazlo seeking solidarity, but the man-kin only shrugged and started to chant with the huge bullman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beaten in numbers, the drow lifted the decorated bundle of his family&amp;#39;s krar out of his rucksack. He gingerly folded away the drake-leather bindings, as he had watched his father do many times. Inspecting every corner, every string, every peg until he was satisfied it survived the long journey from his homeland. Derafi plucked a single string, letting it hum along side the crackle of the camp fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For his new family, Derafi wove the magyk of song.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A clatter of iron against stone rang louder than any, signaling the end. Derafi dared not move from behind the column that kept him hidden. He began to whisper the magyk that Namid taught him, the sight without eyes. There was no life in the cave but him, his friends were slain. Derafi&amp;#39;s whimpering turned to crying as he cursed himself for hiding. It took all he had not to bite through his finger as he stifled his shame. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The words of Muse suddenly rang in Derafi&amp;#39;s mind. &amp;quot;Heavy Metal, the forbidden music.&amp;quot; He hesitantly crawled his hand towards his rucksack, delicately clawing through it until he found the small bone box. He tentatively removed the loadstone amplifier, and mumbled the electric magyk as his grandmatron instructed all the bards of his family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Derafi filled the poor sound chamber with an explosion of sound, strumming feverishly at geometric instrument. The Lich instantly turned to the drow and launched into a hellish pursuit. Derafi sung out in the language of the Muse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death I call upon thee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reach thine claw from hell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Muse speaketh through me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mine life is thine to sell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All went still. Derafi witnessed Death&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My family lay at thine feet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mercy I do beg of thee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their souls returneth to their meat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*In exchange for theirs thou get me&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Death gaze upon the drow. The young dark elf furiously strumming and plucking the strings of his krar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;ENOUGH!&amp;quot; a voiceless emotion shook Derafi&amp;#39;s being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;NOT YOU. NOT THEM. HIM&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Derafi wake up. Wake up pleassse.&amp;quot; hissed Nebit, gently shaking dark elf&amp;#39;s lifeless form. Lazlo&amp;#39;s hand-of-healing shone brightly over the adolescent&amp;#39;s chest, but he grimly shook his head. Now the only sound echoing through the cave were Angus&amp;#39;s blubbery tears dripping into his stein of ale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A horrid gasp, the effluvia of life rushing through his veins, Derafi awoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My friends you are all alive?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alive?&amp;quot; inquired Lazlo, prying Nebit&amp;#39;s bawling arms from around the dark elf&amp;#39;s shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And the Lich?&amp;quot; Derafi asked&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Lich?&amp;quot; Lazlo questioned again, before Angus barreled into the dog pile of tears and hugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Him, not them, not me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you sure you&amp;#39;re ok Derafi? You&amp;#39;re talking nonsense.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I played Death Metal, I communed with Death.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That would explain a lot.

Her lance, as her armor, is forged in the Glade Kings own beacon flame, blessed with the virtue of a thousand years of art and peace and strengthen with the power of an unbreakable vow of faith and purity to the one and only Creator of All.

She is both a mercenary and a mage, a lycanthrope and a banshee. She was once thought to be one of the Fates, along for the ride, but the Fates cannot fail as she has, for now, the matchless power and ruthlessness of her unbridled majicks and the untamable ferocity of herself and her familiars has been matched, bridled, and tamed.

I am White Bread, born and raised in Revan to a merchant, living comfortably but not extravagantly in a little apartment above the market square. I picked the sackbut and lute to make a little money as a busier so that I could afford a little luxury, and a friendly old bard took me under his wing and taught me how to sound like I knew what I was doing. I wield his axe in one hand and his harp in the other now, the sackbut having found it's use as a cudgle earlier today. Now it is wrapped around the neck of a Warg some miles back, and my lute lies smashed when I reflexedly used to to defend myself from a crashing trolls club. I play a quiet, lilting melody on the harp as a cloak of invisibility, or at least a cloak of inconsequence, but I am still vulnerable to that what has no brain with which to be confused with. Somehow, I stand alone as a saviour for Revan and the Fennic Kingdom that the Necromancer is even now overtaking. The harp is too soft for power, though... It's application limited through its nature to subtilty. I mourn as I peer back towards the city walls, thronged with Orcs and goblins and trolls and all manner of fell abominations.\n\nI jump in fright as a string snaps beneath my fingers, overstrained with the burden of the magic to hide me from an army. My spell is broken and I am caught. Quickly, I improvise a driving reel and jig to speed me to my limits that I may escape to hide again, but the missing string cramps my style. As I hurdle towards the city walls, I miss a note here and there and lurch in and out of the safety of speed. As I approach the remains of the bashed-in gates, the harp is struck by an errant arrow and ripped from my grasp. I go sprawling through the brush and the harp goes flying and smashes against a tree. I am left with the axe, a weapon of evil, barely more than a trophy carried by my mentor from a victory in his youth when his troupe defeated a Band terrorizing the Black Forests and the land of Gr\u00fcndelmachenstein.\n\nAs I lay still in the bush, hiding and regrouping, I ponder this terrible fate. I see the towers on the Orange Kings keep, the spires of the mighty castle of the Fennic Kingdom, burn and fall into the town below, leaving behind a puff of white stone dust as the masonry breaks. I see that the battle is lost and that the hoards are barely slowed. Unless I do what I must, next it will be the lands of the Apiarists and glorious Elven Kingdoms Alliance based there that falls, for with all their might, they cowered under the threat of violence by the Orange King. And if they fall, all is lost, for no power will stand between them and the Glade King, the keepers of the Light and the Keystones\u200b of Creation.\n\nI must do what I must. I must use the final lessons of my Master and overcome my restraints. I must embrace the darkness to save the light. I gingerly undo the mutes on the strings and adjust the capo.

When the time comes, I must brandish this axe and do it right, so that the victory will be absolute and the need for it is past.\n\nMy voice gets dry and gravelly in anticipation, and I roar, unleashing an army of abominations of my own upon the land. I strike from behind the hoard, surprising them and disrupting the wholesale destruction of Revan. My rage grows and soars with the blood and entrails of my enemies spewing out into the void, my enthralled demons getting stronger and more numerous as the depth of my power and my victory grows. Destrati, Lathan, Lucretia, and Missanty rise and destroy like they never have done before, their corpses displaying a bloodthirst out of character.

Because either I&amp;#39;m gonna wipe the fucking stars with your ugly mug, and be forever known as the hero that ended a God-Dragon,&amp;quot; A guitar, so night black it could hardly be seen, formed of the shadows around them and fell into his hands, eight steel strings tuning themselves and the volume knobs cranking up all on their own. &amp;quot;Or the sheer effort it takes to kill me is gonna be so fucking much it&amp;#39;s gonna irk you until you run out of stars to eat and die that way instead!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He yanked his sterling-silver Guitar pick from the dog-tag necklace around his neck, and adjusted his grip on it until it felt right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And one more thing! I hate this fucking setting, I hate your shitty fucking Home-Brewed Ruleset, and I hate D20 Modern! Piss off!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Bard and The Dragon began the Song and Dance that would either end all things or save them. And as the darkest powers known to man gathered within a vessel far too weak to survive their use, The Bard knew in his heart he shouldn&amp;#39;t, by any means, be allowed to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he might as well make it quick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I make one attack, straight for his heart. All the power I can put into it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Roll for it, shithead.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nat 20, bitch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Roll to confirm.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Another Nat 20.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OK, Roll all the dice.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OK, the Dragon takes that much damage, each die forming one or two digits, starting with the highest number.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s at least twelve million points of damage.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sweet, you win.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But my body is demolished in the process?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pretty much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That works for me. I gotta go, my little bro&amp;#39;s soccer practice ends in like five minutes. Go ahead and wrap up without me, grant them their epic Destinies, etcetera.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s the plan. Take your dicebag, you colossal bitch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I love you too, ho.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgdgbnw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492463263.0, "created_utc": 1492434463.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
