He blinks slowly, and the reduction in speed between his own thoughts and voice and mine becomes painfully apparent as I wait for his response. It's not that we're smarter than the augmented humans, it's just that we're _faster_. For the same reason that a spider is proportionally faster than a human for its size, we're proportionally speedier with thoughts and words. Were it not for longevity drugs this would mean we would die faster too, but science will out and now the only certainty is taxes. \n\n\"Yeah, the robot's on the blink.\" \n\nSynth. It's a synth.

Deep breaths.\n\n\"...thank you for your concern, sir. I'll see to your friend shortly. Sydney, could you help me with my tools?\"\n\n---\n\nYaxer was possibly my favourite patient. No impoliteness, no laughs about how he hoped the job wasn't too \"big\" for me. No comments about how \"humans like you are always so inspiring\". He even apologised in hushed tones for his roommate.\n\n\"He just doesn't seem to get it. I've tried explaining why we don't use that term, for you or me, but he seems to think that it's OK to use it if he 'knows what it means'...\"\n\nI smiled a warm smile, the first all day, and told him he shouldn't be using his motor processors right now. His issue seemed to be a chronic one, some kind of hardware issue that was probably laid down at conception (as the manufacturing process is called, it's rather less clinical this way) and it wasn't clear if I would ever be able to fix it for good. Repeated checkups and finetunings might be necessary for the rest of his life - rather like myself.  \n\nAfterwards, post-rundown and after checking he really was good to go, he made Sydney and I some tea. Sydney packed up my tools, which were individually light but far too heavy for me to realistically carry together, and I sipped it carefully. The aroma was delicate, probably too delicate for Sydney to appreciate, and I smiled at him. \n\n\"Lavender and peppermint, with a hint of heather honey. Ever since I got the smell implant installed, it's been my favourite part of the day to sit down in my library and brew a pot.\" I nodded enthusiastically, earning a chiding mutter of \"don't hurt yourself...!\" from Sydney that I took a vicious pleasure in ignoring completely. Yaxer turned to me, and looked down into my eyes with a suddenly calculating look. I blushed, not used to not being the fastest thinker in the room, and looked down at my cup of half-drunk tea.\n\n\"What about you, Julia? What attracted you to this job? There are dozens of choices for dexters like you, you didn't have to pick a job where you're constantly presented with prejudice and misinformation. What's _your_ favourite part of the day?\"\n\nI took another sip.\n\n---\n\nAs I walked out of my new patient's home, telling him not to overstress his processors and to log his diagnostics twice-daily for the next month, Sydney looked down at me with a slier look than I think I've ever seen on her face. It was slightly unnerving really, like watching a goat do integrations.\n\n\"You never did answer him, you know. Why this job?\"\n\nShe'd been with me for twelve years. It can't be fun, being a glorified weightlifter for a legally-disabled dexter, but she'd never once been impatient, never once broken my trust. I took a deep breath.\n\n\"Every day I'm surrounded by things I can't lift, things I can't eat, things I can't breathe. You're all so... tough, and I'm just here. Being small.\" She began to open her mouth, but I continued quickly onwards. \n\n\"But when I open up a synth and start unplugging, replugging, examining, analysing... there's detail. There's scale I can work with. There's fineness. It's not just that it's something I can do that you, or anyone else, can't do... It's that, if I get it wrong...

I&amp;#39;ve tried explaining why we don&amp;#39;t use that term, for you or me, but he seems to think that it&amp;#39;s OK to use it if he &amp;#39;knows what it means&amp;#39;...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I smiled a warm smile, the first all day, and told him he shouldn&amp;#39;t be using his motor processors right now. His issue seemed to be a chronic one, some kind of hardware issue that was probably laid down at conception (as the manufacturing process is called, it&amp;#39;s rather less clinical this way) and it wasn&amp;#39;t clear if I would ever be able to fix it for good. Repeated checkups and finetunings might be necessary for the rest of his life - rather like myself.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, post-rundown and after checking he really was good to go, he made Sydney and I some tea. Sydney packed up my tools, which were individually light but far too heavy for me to realistically carry together, and I sipped it carefully. The aroma was delicate, probably too delicate for Sydney to appreciate, and I smiled at him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lavender and peppermint, with a hint of heather honey. Ever since I got the smell implant installed, it&amp;#39;s been my favourite part of the day to sit down in my library and brew a pot.&amp;quot; I nodded enthusiastically, earning a chiding mutter of &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t hurt yourself...!&amp;quot; from Sydney that I took a vicious pleasure in ignoring completely. Yaxer turned to me, and looked down into my eyes with a suddenly calculating look. I blushed, not used to not being the fastest thinker in the room, and looked down at my cup of half-drunk tea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What about you, Julia? What attracted you to this job? There are dozens of choices for dexters like you, you didn&amp;#39;t have to pick a job where you&amp;#39;re constantly presented with prejudice and misinformation. What&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; favourite part of the day?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took another sip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I walked out of my new patient&amp;#39;s home, telling him not to overstress his processors and to log his diagnostics twice-daily for the next month, Sydney looked down at me with a slier look than I think I&amp;#39;ve ever seen on her face. It was slightly unnerving really, like watching a goat do integrations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You never did answer him, you know. Why this job?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;d been with me for twelve years. It can&amp;#39;t be fun, being a glorified weightlifter for a legally-disabled dexter, but she&amp;#39;d never once been impatient, never once broken my trust. I took a deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Every day I&amp;#39;m surrounded by things I can&amp;#39;t lift, things I can&amp;#39;t eat, things I can&amp;#39;t breathe. You&amp;#39;re all so... tough, and I&amp;#39;m just here. Being small.&amp;quot; She began to open her mouth, but I continued quickly onwards. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But when I open up a synth and start unplugging, replugging, examining, analysing... there&amp;#39;s detail. There&amp;#39;s scale I can work with. There&amp;#39;s fineness. It&amp;#39;s not just that it&amp;#39;s something I can do that you, or anyone else, can&amp;#39;t do... It&amp;#39;s that, if I get it wrong... I&amp;#39;m strong enough that I might accidentally crush something&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg4bpug", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491949782.0, "created_utc": 1491920982.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 218}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oo63", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oo63", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oo63", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oo63", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oo63", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oo63", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oo63", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oo63", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5n583", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SLRWard", "parent_id": "t1_dg5d4yk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Me too, but I think the rubber band puts pressure on the sides of the cap more than I can when I'm having a RA flare.

Katie kept putting it on the third shelf, even though I had reminded her just yesterday that if she didn't want me wearing a dent into the floor I needed it on the bottom shelf. With a gasp and a wheeze I managed to park that on the table as well. Thank goodness the tables here were just as robust as the rest of everything.

Enough to topple buildings with a good shoulder to the base, or to blast a criminal through a wall down the block with a solid gut punch. But for whatever reason, I wasn't born with this gene. They made fun of me in my school years, singling me out, beating me up, shit like that. But what they considered a \"delicate\" body structure came in handy when I joined the force. Where the rest of the force couldn't so much as twist a doorknob without deforming it, I could handle the most fragile of evidence. What they had in strength, they lacked in speed. That's where I came in. \n\nI was smaller, but I was lighter and much more nimble. I didn't chase a criminal so much as just tracked them, and gave direction to the other officers to set up a perimeter and easily nab the criminals we were after. Oh, and what they had in strength, they also lacked in intelligence. In this world, everyone had varying degrees of superior strength, but the stronger they were, the less intelligent they were. By that definition, I was one of the smart ones. Don't get me wrong, I loved the guys I worked with. They poked fun at me, but they never made me feel inferior. I was respected here. but sometimes things got a little, how should I say it....destructive. \n\nExcitability was something of a kryptonite to these guys. Especially the bigger ones.\n\nOne of the guys I worked mostly with, Frank, was a good law enforcement officer. Guy was one of the best. He always upheld the law and respected his community. It was like he'd been born to do it. But he was something of a brute, and at times was rather careless with how he did certain things, especially when he got excited about a new case. He was under my wing and reported to me. We have a great relationship and I gotta say that while he isn't the smartest guy on the force, he's definitely one of the most effective.  \n\nSo, anyways, I'm wrapping up some paper work in my office; concentrating to make sure I have every detail lined up for my case presentation at the courthouse. It was a sure win for us, but, with the whole intelligence thing I mentioned earlier, it always helped to ensure that the judges and jury always understood every single detail. It was a bit like taking the Encyclopedia Britannica and translating it into a childs picture book. Small words, lots of examples, plenty of similes and metaphors. Just as I put the finishing edits together, I heard an explosion akin to a train smashing into a boat. \n\nIt was Frank. And in an excitable rage he smashed through the wall to my office, leaving a pile of dust, wood, and brick in a pile on the ground behind him. \n\n\"JESUS Frank what the hell?!\" Frank looked back at the smoke with a somewhat regretful look on his face. \n\n\"Oh, sorry boss\" he said with a heavy Brooklyn accent. \"Just got a case in for yas. Thinkin you'll like this one.\" I heard most of what he said, but my attention was still focused on the pile of rubble that was once my wall behind him. \n\n\"Frank, the door was 3 feet to the left..it was open,\" I said. \"What's with the Kool Aid stunts lately? That's the second wall this week.\"\n\n\"Oh, m-my fault boss\", he replied apologetically. I couldn't really be mad at the guy. After all its not like I had to pay for it, and since the crew that repaired our facilities were strong, labor was cheap since no real heavy equipment was needed to haul in materials to fix things around here. \"But hey, look at this case. I think we can nab this guy in 24 hours.\"\n\nI studied the case file intently, looking over the rap sheet and seeing what it was we were up against.\n\n\"24 hours huh? Well, he's got quite a history so at least we know who the guy is. And he's quite a brute too; says here he robbed a bank by literally smashing the vault door with his shoulder. Forensics says he probably broke it on the way in, so he can't have gotten that far.\" \n\n\"Yeah boss, maybe he's already lookin' for the next score,\" Frank replied enthusiastically. \"We gotta go to the bank and find some clues first\". \n\n\"Yeah, yeah I suppose we should get on this one sooner than later. A brute like that is bound to strike again, and given his strength, he'll be near by.\" \n\nWe walked out to the car. I got in the driver's seat with ease. But watching Frank get in was a bit like watching a boulder tumble down the side of a hill. He sat in the seat with a thud. The car sank to the left. But this is how it was. Being the little guy in this world is a bit like being David. And every day, I was up against goliaths of many different sizes. It was a never ending battle, but I was here to stay. \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was sitting in my office at the precinct.

I was respected here. but sometimes things got a little, how should I say it....destructive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Excitability was something of a kryptonite to these guys. Especially the bigger ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the guys I worked mostly with, Frank, was a good law enforcement officer. Guy was one of the best. He always upheld the law and respected his community. It was like he&amp;#39;d been born to do it. But he was something of a brute, and at times was rather careless with how he did certain things, especially when he got excited about a new case. He was under my wing and reported to me. We have a great relationship and I gotta say that while he isn&amp;#39;t the smartest guy on the force, he&amp;#39;s definitely one of the most effective.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, anyways, I&amp;#39;m wrapping up some paper work in my office; concentrating to make sure I have every detail lined up for my case presentation at the courthouse. It was a sure win for us, but, with the whole intelligence thing I mentioned earlier, it always helped to ensure that the judges and jury always understood every single detail. It was a bit like taking the Encyclopedia Britannica and translating it into a childs picture book. Small words, lots of examples, plenty of similes and metaphors. Just as I put the finishing edits together, I heard an explosion akin to a train smashing into a boat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was Frank. And in an excitable rage he smashed through the wall to my office, leaving a pile of dust, wood, and brick in a pile on the ground behind him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;JESUS Frank what the hell?!&amp;quot; Frank looked back at the smoke with a somewhat regretful look on his face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, sorry boss&amp;quot; he said with a heavy Brooklyn accent. &amp;quot;Just got a case in for yas. Thinkin you&amp;#39;ll like this one.&amp;quot; I heard most of what he said, but my attention was still focused on the pile of rubble that was once my wall behind him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Frank, the door was 3 feet to the left..it was open,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s with the Kool Aid stunts lately? That&amp;#39;s the second wall this week.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, m-my fault boss&amp;quot;, he replied apologetically. I couldn&amp;#39;t really be mad at the guy. After all its not like I had to pay for it, and since the crew that repaired our facilities were strong, labor was cheap since no real heavy equipment was needed to haul in materials to fix things around here. &amp;quot;But hey, look at this case. I think we can nab this guy in 24 hours.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I studied the case file intently, looking over the rap sheet and seeing what it was we were up against.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;24 hours huh? Well, he&amp;#39;s got quite a history so at least we know who the guy is. And he&amp;#39;s quite a brute too; says here he robbed a bank by literally smashing the vault door with his shoulder. Forensics says he probably broke it on the way in, so he can&amp;#39;t have gotten that far.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah boss, maybe he&amp;#39;s already lookin&amp;#39; for the next score,&amp;quot; Frank replied enthusiastically. &amp;quot;We gotta go to the bank and find some clues first&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, yeah I suppose we should get on this one sooner than later. A brute like that is bound to strike again, and given his strength, he&amp;#39;ll be near by.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We walked out to the car. I got in the driver&amp;#39;s seat with ease. But watching Frank get in was a bit like watching a boulder tumble down the side of a hill. He sat in the seat with a thud. The car sank to the left. But this is how it was. Being the little guy in this world is a bit like being David. And every day, I was up against goliaths of many different sizes. It was a never ending battle, but I was here to stay. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg4n9jk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491962580.0, "created_utc": 1491933780.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oo63", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oo63", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg61bt3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Manata3", "parent_id": "t1_dg5e704", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Please do", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please do&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg61bt3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492040349.0, "created_utc": 1492011549.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5e704", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Petti-The-Yeti", "parent_id": "t3_64oo63", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "When you're 77 inches tall, and are built out of some 255 pounds of muscle and bone, with hardly any fat to speak of, the common phrases sent your way tend to echo from \"You look like a balloon animal.\" to \"I wish I was as strong as you.\" to \"You're done, dude.

I can&amp;#39;t wait!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I smirk and walk inside, although this world needs me too much it isn&amp;#39;t so bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5dg6t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491994677.0, "created_utc": 1491965877.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
