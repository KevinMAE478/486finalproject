It is very obtuse to hear.  He can't possibly expect me to always be exactly on time.  That is absurd.\n\n\"I've looked over your resume, Mr.... Challec is it?  Yes, Mr. Challec, and I see you have quite an experienced background, but none held for more than a increment.  It appears you, put more optimistically, like to travel?\" Mr. Loave upturned the end of his sentence, over dramatizing his knack for questioning.\n\n\"You could say that.

Man, errand man, to take care of the many house calls we have.  It's nothing too draconian, nor terribly light of labor... and not for the faint of heart.  Now, I see you left your last position, so that leads me to believe you are not much afraid of doing what needs to be done when it is needed to be done so it won't  overstay it's welcome and drag on beyond its necessity?\"  Mr. Loave said this with such excessive speed I wasn't sure what to make of it.\n\n\"Yes.\"  I replied, though I wasn't sure if I should have.\n\n\"Excellent, yes, very good indeed.  Now, before we go any further I have a few rudimentary questions for you.  Nothing too exhausting, as I'm sure you must have been through this countless times with a work history such as yours?\"  He paused, reached into his desk, flipped through some papers and adjusting his glasses once again.  \"Erhem, hem, hrrr, egha, okay.  Have you ever lost someone close to you and how did you deal with it?\"\n\n\"Uh, what?  Isn't that a bit personal?\"\n\n\"It's all personal, Mr. Chellac, as it's a very personal job.  Now, please, if you would answer the question for me?\"\n\nI pondered for a moment as I didn't want to answer too quickly.\n\n\"My father died when I was fourteen.  I dealt with it by saying good riddance to another dead beat father on the long list of dead beat fathers in this world.\"  It was true, my father was a street dwelling drunk who left everything up to my mother, and she made it up to me by using his belt to kick my ass when she was on the bottle.  But, she raised me, so now I return the favor, even if I don't like her.\n\n\"Hmmm, a follow up question.  Did you dwell on it long?\"\n\n\"No, he was already dead to me by that time.  The police visiting our home just confirmed it.\"  I said.\n\n\"Okay, Mr. Chellac, question number two.  Where do you think you go when you die?\"  He grinned mildly at this.\n\n\"I don't know and I don't think about it.\"  I replied.\n\n\"You don't think about it?\"\n\n\"I don't think about it.  I know that I'll die and I expect it won't be pleasant, but after that it's none of my concern.\"\n\n\"Now, that is a good answer.  Very good, indeed.  I'm starting to grow fond of you Mr. Chellac.  Onto to question three.  You're a bit overweight.\"  Mr. Loave stared at me expecting a response.\n\n\"That's not a question.\" I said.\n\n\"That's not an answer.\" He chuckled.  \"Question four, another employee has mentioned they are not happy with the circumstances of their job and tell you of their plans to garnish further compensation from the workplace.  How do you proceed?\"\n\n\"Are their other workers here?  Who else works here, I just see you, Mr. Loave.\"  I am becoming very confused.\n\n\"How would you proceed?\" He asked again.\n\n\"I guess I would tell someone about it.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Chellac, we are entirely about secrecy here.  Never tell anyone anything about anything in regards to what we do, how we do it, why, or where.  Is that understood?\"  Mr. Loave bellowed this.\n\n\"Yeah, sure, okay Mr. Loave.  You got it.\"  I still had hardly a clue what I was there to be doing.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Chellac, question five.  Are you willing to fulfill all duties regardless of the race, sex, gender, age, or background of any and all personal house calls you may be a part of?\"\n\n\"I would say I have no issue with anyone.\"  I said.\n\n\"Good.  Mr. Chellac, you are the best candidate we have had so far.  The best and most suited for it.  You are detached, and that is hard to come by in pairing with honesty.  We need someone like you, and we know you need us.  And everyone needs us.

I won't let you down.\"  I bent over and shook his hand while the pens in my pocket fell out from the extreme angle.  Mr. Loave walked back to his chair and hopped up.  I knelt down to pick up my pens.\n\n\"What's tomorrow at 3:03?\"  I asked.\n\nMr. Loave kicked his desk and spun back to face the wall.\n\n\"A fitting.\"  He dramatically exclaimed with a finger to the air as he began to happily hum to himself.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, No, you mustn&amp;#39;t ever be early.

You must always be here precisely when you are supposed to be.&amp;quot; He said, pressing up the glasses off the tip of his crinkly old nose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, Sir, Mr. Loave.&amp;quot;  I said, holding back many questions.  It is very obtuse to hear.  He can&amp;#39;t possibly expect me to always be exactly on time.  That is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve looked over your resume, Mr.... Challec is it?  Yes, Mr. Challec, and I see you have quite an experienced background, but none held for more than a increment.  It appears you, put more optimistically, like to travel?&amp;quot; Mr. Loave upturned the end of his sentence, over dramatizing his knack for questioning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You could say that.  I&amp;#39;ve been around, tried different things.&amp;quot;  I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Marvelous, Marvelous, Mr. Challec.  That&amp;#39;s the kind of man I need around here.  A man who wants to travel.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, I didn&amp;#39;t say &amp;#39;want&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mr. Challec, we here at Corpus, Crooks &amp;amp; Grim are looking for a, hmm, bit of an errand boy, man, adult? Man, errand man, to take care of the many house calls we have.  It&amp;#39;s nothing too draconian, nor terribly light of labor... and not for the faint of heart.  Now, I see you left your last position, so that leads me to believe you are not much afraid of doing what needs to be done when it is needed to be done so it won&amp;#39;t  overstay it&amp;#39;s welcome and drag on beyond its necessity?&amp;quot;  Mr. Loave said this with such excessive speed I wasn&amp;#39;t sure what to make of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;  I replied, though I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if I should have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Excellent, yes, very good indeed.  Now, before we go any further I have a few rudimentary questions for you.  Nothing too exhausting, as I&amp;#39;m sure you must have been through this countless times with a work history such as yours?&amp;quot;  He paused, reached into his desk, flipped through some papers and adjusting his glasses once again.  &amp;quot;Erhem, hem, hrrr, egha, okay.  Have you ever lost someone close to you and how did you deal with it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uh, what?  Isn&amp;#39;t that a bit personal?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s all personal, Mr. Chellac, as it&amp;#39;s a very personal job.  Now, please, if you would answer the question for me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pondered for a moment as I didn&amp;#39;t want to answer too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My father died when I was fourteen.  I dealt with it by saying good riddance to another dead beat father on the long list of dead beat fathers in this world.&amp;quot;  It was true, my father was a street dwelling drunk who left everything up to my mother, and she made it up to me by using his belt to kick my ass when she was on the bottle.  But, she raised me, so now I return the favor, even if I don&amp;#39;t like her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hmmm, a follow up question.  Did you dwell on it long?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, he was already dead to me by that time.  The police visiting our home just confirmed it.&amp;quot;  I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay, Mr. Chellac, question number two.  Where do you think you go when you die?&amp;quot;  He grinned mildly at this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know and I don&amp;#39;t think about it.&amp;quot;  I replied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t think about it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think about it.  I know that I&amp;#39;ll die and I expect it won&amp;#39;t be pleasant, but after that it&amp;#39;s none of my concern.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, that is a good answer.  Very good, indeed.  I&amp;#39;m starting to grow fond of you Mr. Chellac.  Onto to question three.  You&amp;#39;re a bit overweight.&amp;quot;  Mr. Loave stared at me expecting a response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not a question.&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not an answer.&amp;quot; He chuckled.  &amp;quot;Question four, another employee has mentioned they are not happy with the circumstances of their job and tell you of their plans to garnish further compensation from the workplace.  How do you proceed?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are their other workers here?  Who else works here, I just see you, Mr. Loave.&amp;quot;  I am becoming very confused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How would you proceed?&amp;quot; He asked again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I guess I would tell someone about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, Mr. Chellac, we are entirely about secrecy here.  Never tell anyone anything about anything in regards to what we do, how we do it, why, or where.  Is that understood?&amp;quot;  Mr. Loave bellowed this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, sure, okay Mr. Loave.  You got it.&amp;quot;  I still had hardly a clue what I was there to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, Mr. Chellac, question five.  Are you willing to fulfill all duties regardless of the race, sex, gender, age, or background of any and all personal house calls you may be a part of?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I would say I have no issue with anyone.&amp;quot;  I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good.  Mr. Chellac, you are the best candidate we have had so far.  The best and most suited for it.  You are detached, and that is hard to come by in pairing with honesty.  We need someone like you, and we know you need us.  And everyone needs us.  Do you know what happens when Corpus, Crooks &amp;amp; Grim aren&amp;#39;t precisely on time?&amp;quot; He asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m still not entirely sure what you do.&amp;quot; I mildly guffawed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The world would suffer greatly if we do not fulfill our duties precisely when necessary.

Mr. Bite shuffled, making a *skritch* sound against the concrete step as he put out his cigarette. There were no cars in the driveway, and no little yipping dogs - only the warm, hot sun that blasted the surface of his knit black tie, black shirt, black jacket, leather black belt, black pants, black shoes, black socks and (black) sole. Also, the black bolo tie. Satan told him he was a \"bolo tie kind of guy\".\n\nHis gloved hand crinkled under his sweaty grip as he tried the knob. He was surprised when he found that it gave. Looking to his left and right at some imaginary onlooker, a few small children who had been biking down the small, sloping hill caught a glimpse of his lifelike mask - which was constructed with uncomfortably human features in a rubbery mold that leaned on the wrong side of the Uncanny Valley, and paid for using well-earned and responsibly spent tax dollars down here at the DD. They made the right choice in turning around. He himself had a brief consideration of turning back, and trying at another time when the occupant was home. There was, however, the detail included in his manual that contradicted this:\n\n**Section 9, paragraph 3, sub-paragraph 4, bullet point 5:**\n\nWe're evil. We're allowed to reap (HA!) the consequences of our actions. Except we don't, because we're already in Hell.

However, when you trespass, remember to always *enjoy it*. And by this, we specifically mean enjoyment that is almost sexual in nature. Go on, we\u2019re not watching.\n\nGiven this, he decided to press on. It\u2019s not like he had bodily needs or anything.\n\nStepping inside the house and setting his pitchfork on the coat hanger, he noticed that the house was cleanly decorated to IKEA assembly standards, and he had nothing bad to say about that. A man who can appreciate the fast food version of European design is a man to respect. Any time you can manage to be that sleazy \u2013 but in a manner that\u2019s not self-conscious, is even better. He probably goes to Starbucks, too. All this was was a little bit of investigation.\n\nAfter rummaging through drawers and finding things that he wished mortal memory-wipe could remove, he made his way back to the coat-hanger, grabbed his pitchfork, and sat on the couch. \n\n*Hisssss*, went the pleather. *Tick, tock*, went the grandfather clock.\n\nThen he waited. For a long time. \n\nAfter hearing some plucking, Mr. Bite went outside just as the sun was in the red glow of dusk. This guy was a regular John Lee Hooker on the banjo, and he had a wart of considerable size located in a strange place on his nose. He had one knee propped up on the ledge of the neighboring porch. Mr. Bite didn\u2019t make eye contact through his cut-out eye holes, because that would probably freak him out, and result in a non-target going to Heaven (which is illegal practice down here at the DD). But he did give him a rigorous double-barrel thumbs-up. (we at the DD do *not* endorse this action.) \n\nUnbeknownst to Mr. Bite, the man was actually blind, which is probably why he didn\u2019t react with unyielding horror and subsequent medical issues, but he did \u2013 perhaps unintentionally, stare blankly in his general direction, playing a series of slow, limbering notes that echoed in the pastel plains. Mrs. Salgado, who was trimming her lawn at the time, saw Mr. Bite out of the corner of her eye and had something of a violent heart reaction upon seeing his lifelike, handsome mask. This caused her to fall forward while her self-propelled gas mower soldiered on ahead of her and trespassed onto the lawns of three of her neighbors. Of course, the noise was too loud, so Mr. Bite did not notice her, nor did he report her death to us. But don\u2019t worry:\n\nShe\u2019s with us now.\n\nAside from that, Mr. Bite had no concept of earthly time (a fact which causes some of our employee send-outs to last decades upon decades), so he went inside and drank a few shots of whiskey that he found in the cabinet. He figured that if he added water to the bottle later, nobody would notice, but he did have a little bit of post-mortem guilt (we are very sorry for this joke. We're honestly trying to be serious). We saw this from our inter-dimentional monitoring system, and we\u2019ll spare you the details of what happened after the consumption of the alcohol, but we can definitely inform you that it involved Mr. Richter's British Shorthair, some matchsticks, and Mr. Bite\u2019s affinity for setting things aflame - also known as Arson (or Pyrophillia, but we're not sure which one, considering employer-employee confidentiality).\n\nHours passed, maybe even days, maybe even entire millennia\u2026 we can\u2019t provide an official timestamp. It\u2019s out of our capacity.\n\nMr. Bite eventually heard the sound of an engine turning off. Straightening his posture (as much as he could - as we at the DD know, Mr. Bite has a spine that naturally curves inwards), he assumed the best *American Gothic* impression he could. He had all the paperwork (and his favorite 1.0 G2 Flight pen) right in front of him, ready for his client.\n\n**Side note**: Before we go on with this report, we would like to inform our readers that Mr. Bite does not bite people upon client failure in the interview process. He sets them on fire. Mr. Bite was just his childhood nickname. Also, by pointing this out, we are not insinuating that the following events will be of Mr. Bite setting the interview subject, Ripley Richter, on fire. He is, however waiting for the post-Grim hiring process of his client becoming immortal so he can commit the act of Arson in the controlled context of friendly workplace competition \u2013 more frequently, and with both parties\u2019 consent.\n\nAs Mr. Richter opened the door and laid eyes on Mr. Bite, he dropped all the groceries on the floor and stared wide-eyed at his now post-arson cat. Mr. Bite clearly defined his intention for burning the cat through slurred speech, explaining that he had to think of something to grab his attention, and that maintaining a good work ethic is all about making a first impression. We can confirm that Mr. Bite did indeed make an impression, and would like to add that all of us at the DD enjoyed sharing some popcorn and Jolly Ranchers while also working on our careful write-up of the incident. (To this day, one of us has a VHS tape of it somewhere in the head office to pull out every once in a while for a little spit n' giggle.)\n\nWe can judge from our observation of Mr. Bite\u2019s inter-dimensional \"brain\" waves that he was as happy as a pig in mud at this moment, but that was mainly due to the alcohol consumption.

We have to say that Mr. Richter is the first subject of Mr. Bite\u2019s who has remained alive and mortal through the entire interviewing process. \n\nWe have since replaced Mr. Richter\u2019s cat, who we now call Mr. Scratch, purely for filing reasons.
