Less than five minutes later I had made it back to the remains of the facility. Only charcoal-black pieces to the structure remained intact. The occasional small fire ate whatever was still alive enough to consume. Smoke rose from the ashes like mist rising from the surface of a hotspring. The surrounding forestry seemed untouched by the forbidden flames, which was strange to me. How can a building burn to ashes while the forest invading it escapes unscathed?\n\nI know I had barely made it a quarter of a mile from the sign. This was a problem. It meant Arya was at the bottom of the cliff somewhere. Maybe she went that way for a reason. There's only one way to find out.\n\n...\n\nI gasped. My chest pumping with excitement. I had decided to go. The coffee shop. Some people would laugh at me, but this took real courage. I was *choosing* to be social.\n\nI turned the keys in the ignition of my klunker car. The thing was rusting from the inside out. The paint was chipping. I had to idle the engine to get it to start up. I was by no measure a wealthy man. But that night, I would feel richer than all of them.\n\nAs I parked outside the shop, my heart was racing. I had never done this before. *What would people think?* I got out of my car and walked up to the doors, slipping inside.\n\nOn the outside I was calm and confident. A charismatic young man that others would happily associate with. I ordered a drink. But then what? I just stood there. Paralyzed. I didn't know what to do.\n\nThat is when I saw her out of the corner of my eye. The most beautiful girl I had ever laid my eyes upon. I wanted to talk to her, but everything inside of me told me not to.\n\nI did it anyways. I pulled courage from what seemed to be thin air.\n\nI initiated conversation and our eyes locked. Some paranormal spark seemed to connect us in that moment. She said her name was \"Arya\". We talked for the rest of the night before she had to leave.\n\nThe first time I had ever truly fallen in love. Which is unfortunate. Less than two weeks later I recieved my summon from the government and had to say goodbye for what seemed like it could be forever.\n\n...\n\nI walked along the edge of the cliff, searching for a way down. Nothing but bare jagged pieces of stone and overhangs shrouded with shrubbery. How in the world could she have managed to get down? I sat on a particularly flat rock, surveying my options long into the afternoon, the sun hanging high among the large grey clouds.\n\nMy arms were trembling. 200 feet below me were the crushed concrete pieces of the west wing. My breathe quickened. I couldn't do it. I relaxed my grip and accepted my fate.\n\nThe makeshift rope of tree vine dug tightly into my hips. I was not certain it would hold. I could only *hope* it would hold. And it did. My body slammed into the cliff face, reopening the timid wound on my forehead. But it wasn't over. I was only 10 feet below my previous position on the wall,  but I was bleeding again.\n\nUnfortunately I had thrown my pack over the edge upon the start of the expedition, so there was no chance of patching up before I continued my descent. My vision seemed to fade in and out for a moment.\n\nI regained my composure and maintained a position on the wall which I could continue to climb from. I tore at the vine with my rigid canines for a few minutes, loosening out of my harness. When it finally snapped, I nearly fell, as I was letting it support too much of my body weight.\n\nI looked out at the sea of green that was nearly eye level at this point. It was majestic. The trees were not as densely packed down here. There seemed to be the a mountain far off in the distance shrouded in mist.\n\nAnd thats when I saw a pair of eerie dark eyes staring in my direction from amongst the treetops. On eye contact, whatever it was immediately disappeared. Shut its eyes. Ran off. Something. It was no longer there.\n\nAs I worked my way painstakingly slow down the wall, it became easier. Until the last ten feet. There were no more handholds. No more footholds. I was locked in place with no options. So I did it. I jumped. And I injured my ankle with an imperfect landing.\n\nI grabbed my pack and fixed what I could before I continued moving. A bandage for my head. Some wrap and a makeshift splint for my ankle. It was better than nothing I guess. It started to drizzle lightly as the heavens darkened.\n\nThat was when I saw her.\n\n...\n\nNo, it wasn't Arya. Not yet. It was Sam. Her body was less than 10 feet away from me. She was disfigured beyond recognition, but her cold dead eyes seemed to follow me.

She could explain.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Part 2&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made my way due East, keeping in mind the message Arya had left. Less than five minutes later I had made it back to the remains of the facility. Only charcoal-black pieces to the structure remained intact. The occasional small fire ate whatever was still alive enough to consume. Smoke rose from the ashes like mist rising from the surface of a hotspring. The surrounding forestry seemed untouched by the forbidden flames, which was strange to me. How can a building burn to ashes while the forest invading it escapes unscathed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I had barely made it a quarter of a mile from the sign. This was a problem. It meant Arya was at the bottom of the cliff somewhere. Maybe she went that way for a reason. There&amp;#39;s only one way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gasped. My chest pumping with excitement. I had decided to go. The coffee shop. Some people would laugh at me, but this took real courage. I was &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to be social.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned the keys in the ignition of my klunker car. The thing was rusting from the inside out. The paint was chipping. I had to idle the engine to get it to start up. I was by no measure a wealthy man. But that night, I would feel richer than all of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I parked outside the shop, my heart was racing. I had never done this before. &lt;em&gt;What would people think?&lt;/em&gt; I got out of my car and walked up to the doors, slipping inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the outside I was calm and confident. A charismatic young man that others would happily associate with. I ordered a drink. But then what? I just stood there. Paralyzed. I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is when I saw her out of the corner of my eye. The most beautiful girl I had ever laid my eyes upon. I wanted to talk to her, but everything inside of me told me not to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did it anyways. I pulled courage from what seemed to be thin air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I initiated conversation and our eyes locked. Some paranormal spark seemed to connect us in that moment. She said her name was &amp;quot;Arya&amp;quot;. We talked for the rest of the night before she had to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time I had ever truly fallen in love. Which is unfortunate. Less than two weeks later I recieved my summon from the government and had to say goodbye for what seemed like it could be forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked along the edge of the cliff, searching for a way down. Nothing but bare jagged pieces of stone and overhangs shrouded with shrubbery. How in the world could she have managed to get down? I sat on a particularly flat rock, surveying my options long into the afternoon, the sun hanging high among the large grey clouds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My arms were trembling. 200 feet below me were the crushed concrete pieces of the west wing. My breathe quickened. I couldn&amp;#39;t do it. I relaxed my grip and accepted my fate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The makeshift rope of tree vine dug tightly into my hips. I was not certain it would hold. I could only &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; it would hold. And it did. My body slammed into the cliff face, reopening the timid wound on my forehead. But it wasn&amp;#39;t over. I was only 10 feet below my previous position on the wall,  but I was bleeding again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I had thrown my pack over the edge upon the start of the expedition, so there was no chance of patching up before I continued my descent. My vision seemed to fade in and out for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I regained my composure and maintained a position on the wall which I could continue to climb from. I tore at the vine with my rigid canines for a few minutes, loosening out of my harness. When it finally snapped, I nearly fell, as I was letting it support too much of my body weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked out at the sea of green that was nearly eye level at this point. It was majestic. The trees were not as densely packed down here. There seemed to be the a mountain far off in the distance shrouded in mist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And thats when I saw a pair of eerie dark eyes staring in my direction from amongst the treetops. On eye contact, whatever it was immediately disappeared. Shut its eyes. Ran off. Something. It was no longer there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I worked my way painstakingly slow down the wall, it became easier. Until the last ten feet. There were no more handholds. No more footholds. I was locked in place with no options. So I did it. I jumped. And I injured my ankle with an imperfect landing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my pack and fixed what I could before I continued moving. A bandage for my head. Some wrap and a makeshift splint for my ankle. It was better than nothing I guess. It started to drizzle lightly as the heavens darkened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was when I saw her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, it wasn&amp;#39;t Arya. Not yet. It was Sam. Her body was less than 10 feet away from me. She was disfigured beyond recognition, but her cold dead eyes seemed to follow me. Her body lay lifeless on the edge of a jagged piece of concrete leftover from the west wing, and she had a severed rope still tied around his waist. The end was cut clean. I also found an arrowhead buried in the back of her shoulder. The concrete was stained maroon with dried blood. She also had a pack with nothing in it. Who carries an empty pack?

How could 99 people have disappeared?\n\nAn unsilenced alarm was sounding and lights were flashing. A small fire was raging across the room. Broken shards of glass lay shattered across the floor. Through the densely illuminated smoke, I could see the other tubes. Shards extruding from the pods and cryo-freeze gas leaking into the air. They seem to have been broken into. Only one other pod was still intact, but its door was open, and it was vacant.\n\nI carefully placed my bare foot outside of my pod, trying to avoid any glass. My vision was blurry, but I could still see the blood drop onto the marble white floor. I pressed a hand to my head and felt a gnarly gash. Looking back at my pod, I could see the cracks in the glass casing.\n\nNo one else was around. I was too afraid to call out for help. The fire was getting awfully close to the door. I needed to leave before the smoke filled my lungs or the fire scorched my sensitive skin.\n\nWith a bit of effort, I managed to pry the door open. I wandered the ghost-town of a facility. Flourescent lights flickering. I still remembered where I was, from before, but I did not know when I was. I was supposed to be in the year 3150, but now I am not so sure.\n\nThere was nobody else in the facility. I checked several times. At one point I found the main entrance, but I did not bother to leave. I couldn't leave. Outside the windows stood trees hundreds of feet tall. Plants in every colour of green, sprouting out of the ground, each fighting to make its way to the top. They sprawl out in the sunlight, soaking up as much as they can. They covered the door, making it impossible to open.\n\nThis was strange to me. Before I was frozen, this facility lay in a barren desert town at the top of a cliff. The red rock was unnatural, as if we were on Mars. The buildings were all vacated long before, and it was used as a government testing ground. I did have a chance to stay in one of the buildings after I had been selected for this project, but I cannot remember many details about it. My memory of before training in the facility is nonexistent, or hazy at best.\n\nBut now, things looked different. There was no longer any red desert sand. It rained every other day. Peering out the windows, I could not see any of the buildings from my time. Nothing at all, except dense rainforest.\n\nI was able to contain the fire for a couple days, but I was getting tired and it was bound to get worse. I would need to leave soon. I gathered the supplies I found from the work closet that had been keeping me alive and attempted to find a suitable exit.\n\nThere were only two. One was a hallway that used to lead to the west wing of the building. It turns out the west wing had fallen long ago, due to the erosion of the cliffside. This would mean a long climb down a mix of dirt and rock wall, descending from the mouth of an open hallway. A risk I was unwilling to take. The other door I found that was unblocked was a maintenance door near the east wing. I decided this was my only option for survival.\n\nI wandered through the thick foliage for hours, looking for the remains of the buildings that had once stood. I found no trace.\n\nIt is getting dark now. The noises are very frightening. I haven't got a weapon, so I decided it would be best to sleep up in the canopy of an isolated tree. A howl at the bright full moon echos through the wind sending shivers down my spine. The next few hours were the longest of my life as fear shook me to the very soul. There were not just howls any more. There were ungodly shrieks, riding the wind. There was also a loud bassy growl coming from directly below me.

I do not know where they went, or how went so quickly and all at once, but I was relieved to see them gone. I climbed higher into the canopy to get a richer view.

I could not survive like this.\n\nAfter some deep thinking, I decided my best option would be to try the other \"exit\" to the facility.
