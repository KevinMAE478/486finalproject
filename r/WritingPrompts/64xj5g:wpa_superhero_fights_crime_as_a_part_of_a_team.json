It was going to be close.  I tweaked it just slightly one more time.  The bullet would have about a hundredth of a second to slip under the bird and - if my calculations were correct - dip a fraction of a centimetre and begin its downward arc. My eyes followed its trajectory towards the control panel and the glowing numbers on it. It would stop with just a single second left.  \n\nI glanced back towards the entrance of the greenhouse at Lighting and Dynami.  They would be just behind me in the open door. My bullet would hit its target before they even knew what was happening. Take that, fastest man alive, I thought.\n\nMy eyes returned to the frozen hummingbird. Sometimes I wished I had never gone to check out the lab that night. My life had been pretty exciting before this, and I'd enjoyed working the beat as a local cop.  The kids recognized me, the regulars respected me, and I could relax after work with a beer.  Time had flowed, and I had flowed with it. Nowadays, it had a way of dragging on.  Time was slow when you grew too familiar with its moments. Though I was more patient these days.\n\nThe bird's feathers were somehow the colours of an iridescent rainbow. Idly, I wondered if I ought to go look up which species it was in the library across town. But no, I should probably make sure I can stop the explosion. It had taken ages to align everything properly to stop the Gardener's plot perfectly with a single second left. Tiny tweaks over the last twelve hours, making sure they took the exact amount of time to get here at the critical moment.  I'd found the greenhouse a few hours ago in real time.  \n\nThe Gardener, I knew, was running out the back entrance, and I wandered between the plants considering how best to stop him. I examined his fearful face under the sun's light. He looked far less confident than the last time I had seen him. Maybe he was regretting his decision.  Maybe I would let Lightning take him out. He was pretty soft on crime.\n\nReturning to the front entrance, I began one final trajectory calculation. My satchel was lined with paper pads that were usually filled with the complex mathematics that helped every shot hit its target. Unfortunately, electronics didn't work when time was frozen, which seemed a reasonable trade-off. I put the pencil down and looked at the hummingbird again. Its feather were beautiful. It seemed peaceful as it floated above the petals of a succulent looking flower. I took a breath and changed position slightly to avoid the cloud of carbon dioxide I was creating, then returned to my work. The hours passed easily enough, as I was an old friend with the scratching of my pencil on the page. \n\nAgain, everything looked like it was correct. I hid the paper back in my satchel, and placed the knives, guns, and explosives on top of them. I walked back to the entrance and took my place in front of Lightning and Dynami. Her eyes were lit with that fearsome energy that always took her in these moments.\n\nHer finely sculpted features were drawn, tight with excitement, as we burst through the door. I believed she was some Greek demigod or some such, but the library didn't have much information about her people.  They'd been hidden in some other plane, apparently. I tried talking with her about it, but it had turned into a long story so I had just done my own research. It was hard filling the time between calamities. I much preferred when villains were plentiful, quick, and dangerous. When things could change in an instant, it was almost fast enough for me.\n\nMaybe I should talk with Dynami more in real time. It had been a long time since I had dated anyone.  How long ago?  It must have been that girl I'd known in my old neighbourhood. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't figure out how many years ago that had been. I frowned. It hadn't been that long ago I knew, but it seemed like forever. I almost considered trying to find a nearby calendar, but I decided I wanted to see the look on Lightning's face when he burst in at supersonic speed to see my bullet stop the countdown.  \n\nI extended my arm and aligned the gun with the bullet I had just fired. \n\nA second passed.\n\nI walked out into the greenhouse where Lightning was frozen.

I feel a tremendous pain inside my ears, and the warmth of blood as it trickles over fine hairs deep within my ear canals. For some reason my thoughts begin to drift - I need to have my ears cleaned.

You would have loved saving New York one last time.*\n\nI pluck the bullet out of the air. It's beautiful really. So simple, so deadly. \n\nDoctor Munchausen is like a stone jester, grinning in the face of imminent death.\n\nHe knows - thinks - I never miss a shot. He doesn't *know* my real power - no one does. This way no one can stop me, at least not with technology. The *CopKiller* wore an electro-magnetic vest. He thought that would negate my aim. I strolled up to him and turned the magnet off, then I let the bullet continue its path into his brain. I paused time for a while, as the bullet exited his head. To this day I don't know why I did it; I'm not sadistic, but I confess I felt a strange kind of satisfaction in that moment. \n\nDoctor Munchausen knew he was dead even before his finger began to lower. So, why'd he try? What an absurd grin he's wearing. The smile of a man who knows death is about to grab him by the hand and drag him to another world.\n\n*God damn, me and Suzie made a good team.*\n\nI place the bullet an inch from Doctor Munchausen's chest. An easier point of entry than through his helmet. I walk back to Captain Cacophony and position the gun by my eye once more. A deep breath later, time resumes and the bullet enters the Doctor's chest.\n\nI feel the ground move, and I see a distant flash. *Oh, God.* I stop time - but I was too slow - the nuke is exploding. Some of central Manhattan is likely already gone.  \n\nI walk over to Doctor Munchausen's still grinning, standing-corpse. Blood globules have escaped his chest, hanging mid air like deranged red rain. But it's not just blood; there are tiny shards of metal mingled in. The real detonator was in his chest - the bomb miles away from us. I've just sentenced New York to death. The moment I unpause time, millions upon millions will die.\n\nI sit on the curb for a while, as shock washes over me. Could I evacuate New York? How many could I move before I'm too old and too broken to go on. Not many.\n\nMy last conversation with Suzie plays like an old piano song in my mind. *If you can't save them all, what's the point of having powers?* she says, crying. \n\nI play a counter melody, *You did your best. That's all any of us can do.* \n\n*It wasn't good enough, James!*\n\nThe chords become dissonant. *I can't do it any more, James. Any of this. I didn't ask for these powers or responsibilities.*  \n\nThe music hangs. \n\nSo does Suzie.\n\nI walk over to Captain Cacophony, and I gently close his mouth and force his lips into a frozen smile. I put my arm around his shoulders. \"Sorry old buddy.\"\n\nI think of Suzie, one last time. \"See you soon, baby.\"\n\nAs I unfreeze the world, a thought crosses my mind. *How pleasant and warm the breez-*\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492014176.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shoot him, James!&amp;quot; yells Captain Cacophony, stupidly choosing to use my real name.

She counted silently in her head, marking off her team members one by one.  \n\nThis was all Shockbear\u2019s idea. Cohesion Day, he had called it, the first one ever for the League. We have to build our interpersonal relationships, he had said, and what better way than through friendly sports together?\n\nA brief pang of guilt seized her. It was slightly unfair of her to ask Omphalos to join her basketball team, especially when she knew he was nursing a not-so-secret crush on her. But she was competitive, and what better way to win than to have the League\u2019s best marksman on her team?\n\n\u201cRemember, no superpowers today,\u201d Cortena reminded them through the PA system. She was one of the League\u2019s strongest magic users, and her word as the de facto leader of the League was law. No one else was more suited as umpire, really. \u201cAnyone caught cheating will be immediately disqualified.\u201d\n\nA good-natured groan collectively arose from the court as the players warmed up. Perplexity wasn\u2019t really worried \u2013 her draft was a good one. She had Vortex Man, who was still nimble even without utilising his ability to generate wind, the Purloiner, whose stamina was unmatched even without her slinking into other people\u2019s shadows\u2026 the list went on.\n\nExcept, where was Omphalos?\n\nShe recalled how she had cornered him in the corridor yesterday, and how he had nervously scuttled off the moment Shockbear announced that everyone had to participate in Cohesion Day, no exceptions. She thought Omphalos would have leapt at the chance to dominate in all the sporting events, especially with his unerring aim, but instead, he had seemed almost\u2026 fearful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to join your team, Perps,\u201d he had said, nervously wringing his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026 they said no superpowers are allowed in the games\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d Perplexity had laughed, jabbing Omphalos in the shoulder. \u201cWhy would we need your ability to magically conjure throwing weapons out of thin air? We\u2019re playing basketball, for goodness\u2019 sakes!\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 I know that\u2019s what I told you my superpower was\u2026 but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come on, Omphalos! Just one game! You know I really want to win this!\u201d\n\nOmphalos had sighed, then nodded resignedly. \u201cFine, but just basketball. I don\u2019t have enough time to train for anything else.\u201d\n\nPerplexity didn\u2019t think too much about what he had said, caught up as she was about managing to snag the star player. After all, she couldn\u2019t have known that Omphalos had the hand-eye coordination of a fish, and that his unfailing aim was actually the byproduct of his real superpower, the ability to stop time. Without his superpower, he would sometimes miss, even if he released his empty soda cans directly above the bins. \n\nFor that reason, Omphalos was always very, very careful cleaning up during poopy time.\n\nCortena knew, of course, but she knew when to hold her tongue.

Perplexity couldn\u2019t tell if it was the sunken pallor to his skin, or the curiously defined muscles which definitely were not there before, or the greyish hairs peeking out from his scalp.\n\n\u201cHey, Omphalos, you\u2019ve got this! Don\u2019t worry ok, it\u2019s just a game, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve played before, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I have,\u201d Omphalos said, through gritted teeth. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that I have been training recently\u2026 a lot of training.\u201d \n\n\u201cI only just invited you to join us yesterday!

But enough talk, let\u2019s play some ball.\u201d\n\n---\n\n/r/rarelyfunny", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perplexity laced up her sneakers, extra tight, then continued stretching as the other players arrived on the court. She counted silently in her head, marking off her team members one by one.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was all Shockbear\u2019s idea. Cohesion Day, he had called it, the first one ever for the League. We have to build our interpersonal relationships, he had said, and what better way than through friendly sports together?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A brief pang of guilt seized her. It was slightly unfair of her to ask Omphalos to join her basketball team, especially when she knew he was nursing a not-so-secret crush on her. But she was competitive, and what better way to win than to have the League\u2019s best marksman on her team?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRemember, no superpowers today,\u201d Cortena reminded them through the PA system. She was one of the League\u2019s strongest magic users, and her word as the de facto leader of the League was law. No one else was more suited as umpire, really. \u201cAnyone caught cheating will be immediately disqualified.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good-natured groan collectively arose from the court as the players warmed up. Perplexity wasn\u2019t really worried \u2013 her draft was a good one. She had Vortex Man, who was still nimble even without utilising his ability to generate wind, the Purloiner, whose stamina was unmatched even without her slinking into other people\u2019s shadows\u2026 the list went on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, where was Omphalos?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She recalled how she had cornered him in the corridor yesterday, and how he had nervously scuttled off the moment Shockbear announced that everyone had to participate in Cohesion Day, no exceptions. She thought Omphalos would have leapt at the chance to dominate in all the sporting events, especially with his unerring aim, but instead, he had seemed almost\u2026 fearful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to join your team, Perps,\u201d he had said, nervously wringing his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026 they said no superpowers are allowed in the games\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo what?\u201d Perplexity had laughed, jabbing Omphalos in the shoulder. \u201cWhy would we need your ability to magically conjure throwing weapons out of thin air? We\u2019re playing basketball, for goodness\u2019 sakes!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cEr\u2026 I know that\u2019s what I told you my superpower was\u2026 but\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh come on, Omphalos! Just one game! You know I really want to win this!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Omphalos had sighed, then nodded resignedly. \u201cFine, but just basketball. I don\u2019t have enough time to train for anything else.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perplexity didn\u2019t think too much about what he had said, caught up as she was about managing to snag the star player. After all, she couldn\u2019t have known that Omphalos had the hand-eye coordination of a fish, and that his unfailing aim was actually the byproduct of his real superpower, the ability to stop time. Without his superpower, he would sometimes miss, even if he released his empty soda cans directly above the bins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For that reason, Omphalos was always very, very careful cleaning up during poopy time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cortena knew, of course, but she knew when to hold her tongue. Besides, she did quite enjoy the meticulous way Omphalos went about arranging his trick shots, right in the middle of heated battles frozen in time. She found it amusing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAll players, get ready!

I'm in a superhero group called Venom.

But I joined specifically because I was lonely. And partly because I was in love with GaiaGirl.\n\nI wasn't supposed to be in Venom at all. You see Venom has a very strict anti-discriminatory policy when recruiting new members. They recruit heroes with superpowers and heroes without superpowers at an almost equal rate. \n\nWhen they recruited me, they specifically said they were looking for someone without superpowers, someone who could fight or shoot or something. They couldn't stress it enough. I got in because they think I can throw daggers without missing. I never miss.\n\nBut here's where it gets dark.\n\nI'm actually pretty terrible at throwing daggers. I'm hopeless. So what I do is, I stop time. Throw a couple of times, the knives flying past my opponent. If I can't get it right and the daggers run out, I have to walk all the way over and stab the person in the heart. Then I let time flow again, and the opponent falls to the ground and I punch the air and get praise from my teammates, particularly from GaiaGirl, but I always feel guilty. Always.\n\n***\n\nWe have trouble. There are a couple of robots terrorising an orphanage downtown.\n\nThe day's bright and warm, the worst day to make orphans feel even more miserable that they already are. I should know as I'm an orphan myself. Oh and did I mention I'm the nerdiest, most awkward person in the team? The dagger-throwing has elevated me to second spot from Zain, who sits at the pilot's seat looking disdainfully at the plume of smoke in the distant. GaiaGirl sits next to me, her eyes closed. She loves kids (she has like 9 younger siblings) and she's probably worried sick about them.\n\n\"Who attacks kids though? Who does that?\" Miriam-Jade says, twirling a shard of ice in her pale hands. She looks over at me since I'm the only who seems to be paying attention. \"Helpless kids, too.\"\n\n\"Evil robots,\" I answer, looking out the window.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Boron says. \"They have, like, no emotions and stuff, it makes sense.\" He yawns and coughs and a spark of fire flies from his mouth and heads straight for Miriam-Jade, who dissolves it with a flick of her icy hand. \n\n\"Who sent them, do you reckon?\" I ask.\n\n\"Probably BloodCanon,\" Zain says from upfront, putting the jet into a slight dive. \"And stop saying \"reckon\". You're not in England anymore, doofus.\"\n\nHe glances back at me with a smirk before landing the jet smoothly in Arthur Cunningham Avenue.\n\n***\n\nThere's smoke and destruction everywhere. The orphanage is up in flames and the robots are in full force. About 50 of them, moving around the foot of the tall Victorian-like building, firing fireballs and bullets into the windows. We get into action. Zain sprints forward snd punches one in the face while the Earth quivers and groans as GaiaGirl falls into a kind of trance, eyes blank, mouth moving rapidly, dust and rocks rising up around her. A burst of fire overhead snakes its way towards robots on the roof as Boron takes to the air, while Miriam-Jade tries to put out the fire downstairs with an icy stream from her hands.\n\n\"Careful not to hit the building, Boron!\" she screams as she sends bullets of ice from her knee to an oncoming wall of angry robots and ducks into the building to go retrieve the orphans, dead or alive.\n\nI look around, for a bit and see him, the boss of the robots. He's bigger than the rest so it must be him. Zain and I had an agreement that only he goes for the bosses, but he's busy right now so I have no choice but to take his place. I close my eyes and feel the world stop, feel the silence descend.\n\n\nOne dagger, two dagger, three dagger, four. No luck. I'm walking over to the boss to plunge a knife in its chest when I hear a movement behind me. I wheel about to see GaiaGirl frozen on the spot, but her arms start shaking because she's holding up this giant boulder over her head. When she can't hold it any longer, she lets it drop to the ground with a crash.\n\n\"Ah, drat,\" she says, dusting off her fingers.\n\n\"Wait - \" I choke, staggering towards her. \"How - ?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she says, removing more dust from her arms. She seems angry at herself. \"It's been like this ever since you joined and I've frozen up and tried not to move whenever you stopped time. I always knew.\"\n\n\"Oh my - \" I put my head into my hands and turn away, it's the end of the world...\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nI look at her and feel ashamed. I start crying. \"I'm a fraud.\" I say.\n\n\"No. Hey. You're not.\" She moves over and hugs me. I start crying even harder.\n\n\"Yes I am!\"\n\n\"No you're not Oliver,\" she says more forcefully, breaking the embrace. \"You're a legitimate part of Venom and will always be!\"\n\n\"Do the others know?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How come you didn't tell them?\"\n\n\"Why?\" She looks at the fire beside us, brilliantly glowing and as still as a rock. \"Because you didn't have a family. Because you were looking for a family. And because you were so... happy.\"\n\nSilence. I sniffle and look away. I say: \"Zain would be really, really angry. And Miriam-would be crushed.\"\n\nShe sighes. \"They don't have to know. It's between you and me, if you want it that way alright?\"\n\nShe punches me on the shoulder. \"Cheer up, Oliver, *gosh*, you're killing me. Now lets take advantage of time and cheat and adjust a couple of things first before we unfreeze it. You have a really handy superpower Sharpshooter. And oh, you're terrible at throwing daggers, by the way.\"\n\n\"Thanks for sharing,\" I say with a wet grin and I immerse the knife slowly and carefully into the robot boss's chest.", "edited": 1492010877.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Sharpshooter.

She looks over at me since I&amp;#39;m the only who seems to be paying attention. &amp;quot;Helpless kids, too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Evil robots,&amp;quot; I answer, looking out the window.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah,&amp;quot; Boron says. &amp;quot;They have, like, no emotions and stuff, it makes sense.&amp;quot; He yawns and coughs and a spark of fire flies from his mouth and heads straight for Miriam-Jade, who dissolves it with a flick of her icy hand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who sent them, do you reckon?&amp;quot; I ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Probably BloodCanon,&amp;quot; Zain says from upfront, putting the jet into a slight dive. &amp;quot;And stop saying &amp;quot;reckon&amp;quot;. You&amp;#39;re not in England anymore, doofus.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He glances back at me with a smirk before landing the jet smoothly in Arthur Cunningham Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s smoke and destruction everywhere. The orphanage is up in flames and the robots are in full force. About 50 of them, moving around the foot of the tall Victorian-like building, firing fireballs and bullets into the windows. We get into action. Zain sprints forward snd punches one in the face while the Earth quivers and groans as GaiaGirl falls into a kind of trance, eyes blank, mouth moving rapidly, dust and rocks rising up around her. A burst of fire overhead snakes its way towards robots on the roof as Boron takes to the air, while Miriam-Jade tries to put out the fire downstairs with an icy stream from her hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Careful not to hit the building, Boron!&amp;quot; she screams as she sends bullets of ice from her knee to an oncoming wall of angry robots and ducks into the building to go retrieve the orphans, dead or alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look around, for a bit and see him, the boss of the robots. He&amp;#39;s bigger than the rest so it must be him. Zain and I had an agreement that only he goes for the bosses, but he&amp;#39;s busy right now so I have no choice but to take his place. I close my eyes and feel the world stop, feel the silence descend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One dagger, two dagger, three dagger, four. No luck. I&amp;#39;m walking over to the boss to plunge a knife in its chest when I hear a movement behind me. I wheel about to see GaiaGirl frozen on the spot, but her arms start shaking because she&amp;#39;s holding up this giant boulder over her head. When she can&amp;#39;t hold it any longer, she lets it drop to the ground with a crash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah, drat,&amp;quot; she says, dusting off her fingers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait - &amp;quot; I choke, staggering towards her. &amp;quot;How - ?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know,&amp;quot; she says, removing more dust from her arms. She seems angry at herself. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been like this ever since you joined and I&amp;#39;ve frozen up and tried not to move whenever you stopped time. I always knew.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh my - &amp;quot; I put my head into my hands and turn away, it&amp;#39;s the end of the world...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look at her and feel ashamed. I start crying. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a fraud.&amp;quot; I say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. Hey. You&amp;#39;re not.&amp;quot; She moves over and hugs me. I start crying even harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes I am!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No you&amp;#39;re not Oliver,&amp;quot; she says more forcefully, breaking the embrace. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a legitimate part of Venom and will always be!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do the others know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How come you didn&amp;#39;t tell them?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; She looks at the fire beside us, brilliantly glowing and as still as a rock. &amp;quot;Because you didn&amp;#39;t have a family. Because you were looking for a family. And because you were so... happy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence. I sniffle and look away. I say: &amp;quot;Zain would be really, really angry. And Miriam-would be crushed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She sighes. &amp;quot;They don&amp;#39;t have to know. It&amp;#39;s between you and me, if you want it that way alright?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She punches me on the shoulder. &amp;quot;Cheer up, Oliver, &lt;em&gt;gosh&lt;/em&gt;, you&amp;#39;re killing me. Now lets take advantage of time and cheat and adjust a couple of things first before we unfreeze it. You have a really handy superpower Sharpshooter. And oh, you&amp;#39;re terrible at throwing daggers, by the way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks for sharing,&amp;quot; I say with a wet grin and I immerse the knife slowly and carefully into the robot boss&amp;#39;s chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5xdg7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492035886.0, "created_utc": 1492007086.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 193}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xj5g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xj5g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xj5g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6sovr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "prob_antifederalist", "parent_id": "t1_dg6cxg5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have an idea.

OK, so this time...\u201d The photographer worked with his model, James. James had a secret. He was One-shot, a member of the League of Crime Stoppers. James rolled his eyes every time the LCS was mentioned by name. He hated the name but he had good friends there.  He noticed his phone buzzing. He blinked. It was the LCS. He blinked again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I really need to take this call.\u201d James interrupted the shoot. The photographer\u2019s mouth gaped, he was clearly offended. He apologized again, grabbed his phone, and stepped outside. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a hostage situation on 9th. You think you can come clean it up?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, I can be there in ten.\u201d\n\nJames hit the red button and trotted toward the exit. He never told the league where he would be when he modeled. It would lead to too many questions. He blinked. He ran to 9th Ave and found a bathroom to change. He could probably make the change in public but didn\u2019t want to test it. He ran up one more street and blinked again. From here he would hail a cab the last couple blocks. He glanced at his watch, perfect.\n\n One-shot stopped the cab when he saw the Great Shadow. The Great Shadow had the ability to cast darkness, the darkness would suck in light rendering the victims blind. James remembered when the Great Shadow was first learning how to function in the team and caused the bank robbers to panic, resulting in more than a couple injuries. The Great Shadow had really come a long way.\n\nJames came around to pay the driver.\n\n\u201cNo. This one is free.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, I insist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI insist too. I can say my cab drove One-shot. It\u2019ll make me more money.\u201d\n\nJames realized there was no arguing with the driver and blinked. He placed a fifty in the passenger seat and blinked again. \u201cAlright, you win,\u201d One-shot resigned. \u201cThank you for your services.\u201d\n\nOne-shot ran over to Great Shadow. Great Shadow was tossing a small wrench to himself. James muttered, \u201cGreat.\u201d A few months ago, the League had taken to giving him challenges. After One-shot took out three guards with an apple, the League started giving him random items to push his limits. He\u2019s used about forty random items since then, including an empty can of soda, a hamster, and a tube of toothpaste. James found the silver lining, at least it was something heavy.\n\n\u201cOne-shot! You made it. Okay, so the perp is inside,\u201d Great Shadow began to explain the situation. James believed Great Shadow\u2019s secret identity was a cop. He never broached the subject, but who says, \u201cperp.\u201d Not to mention, his super just sounds villainous, but he\u2019s never even broached the subject. \n\nThey stood outside a jewelry store. Through the glass, One-shot could see a man holding a child at gunpoint. He lamented, \u201cReally, a child?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just told you that. Were you even paying attention,\u201d Great Shadow asked annoyed? Apparently, One-shot had interrupted the exposition. Again, One-shot wondered why the Great Shadow wasn\u2019t a villain, he loved to monologue. He snapped himself out of it to hear Great Shadow finishing his breakdown. \u201cSo I grabbed this wrench. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll cast my shadow over the store slowly and you throw the paper cup and knock the guy out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d One-shot suddenly registered what Great Shadow said, \u201cWait. What?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust making sure you were paying attention. Here\u2019s the wrench. You can hit him, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m One-shot!\u201d\n\nGreat Shadow turned and let his shadow spread toward the jewelry store. James waited until the man saw the shadow. The look of panic on the bad guy's faces when they see the end always brought a small smile to James\u2019 face. He brought the wrench over his head to throw it. He looked toward the man\u2019s face taking aim. He blinked.\n\nOne-shot had a secret. He couldn\u2019t make the shot. In fact, James couldn\u2019t throw a baseball in a game of catch. He\u2019s taken lessons, but nothing ever clicked. He didn\u2019t mind too much because James could stop time. There\u2019s a serenity when time stops. The serenity balances the insane amount of power when nothing else can move. \n\nHe dropped his arm and walked up to the glass. The glass shattered from the wrenches impact. He wasn\u2019t sure why objects he touched could react to him when everything else was frozen. He walked through the showcase and over the shattered glass, wrench still in hand. James stood and looked at the bad guy. He could stare him in the face and leave a mental imprint of One-shot\u2019s mask before he finished the job, but he reserved that for the supervillains. He redirected the gun to point at the ceiling. He didn\u2019t want to take any chance that his body flinches and pulls the trigger. He raised the wrench and struck him over the forehead.\n\nThe man crumpled into a heap with the boy falling with him. One-shot dropped the wrench nearby. He walked back to Great Shadow. He mimicked the position of a pitcher after throwing a fastball and blinked. The world swirled back into motion. Great Shadow saw the aftermath and smiled at me, before racing in comfort the boy.\n\nJames wanted to tell them the truth and come clean. He hated the lies and deceit. He knew better, though. He\u2019d either be locked up as too powerful or drafted into the Super League of World Savers. Seriously, he wondered why the superheroes had to use the most stupid names for their organizations. He liked the somewhat quiet job of fighting crime in his hometown. He told himself if there was ever a need so desperate that the Super League couldn\u2019t handle it, he would step up. He prayed that day would never come.\n\nHe walked over to Great Shadow and put his hand on his shoulder as he knelt down to see how the boy was doing. \u201cThank you One-shot,\u201d the boy threw his arms around One-shots neck. Yeah, James thought, this is worth it and smiled.\n___\nThank you for reading. You can read more at r/LetThereBeWords. I appreciate constructive criticism and would like to hear from you.

He blinked again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I really need to take this call.\u201d James interrupted the shoot. The photographer\u2019s mouth gaped, he was clearly offended. He apologized again, grabbed his phone, and stepped outside. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe\u2019ve got a hostage situation on 9th. You think you can come clean it up?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOf course, I can be there in ten.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;James hit the red button and trotted toward the exit. He never told the league where he would be when he modeled. It would lead to too many questions. He blinked. He ran to 9th Ave and found a bathroom to change. He could probably make the change in public but didn\u2019t want to test it. He ran up one more street and blinked again. From here he would hail a cab the last couple blocks. He glanced at his watch, perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One-shot stopped the cab when he saw the Great Shadow. The Great Shadow had the ability to cast darkness, the darkness would suck in light rendering the victims blind. James remembered when the Great Shadow was first learning how to function in the team and caused the bank robbers to panic, resulting in more than a couple injuries. The Great Shadow had really come a long way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;James came around to pay the driver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo. This one is free.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSir, I insist.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI insist too. I can say my cab drove One-shot. It\u2019ll make me more money.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;James realized there was no arguing with the driver and blinked. He placed a fifty in the passenger seat and blinked again. \u201cAlright, you win,\u201d One-shot resigned. \u201cThank you for your services.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One-shot ran over to Great Shadow. Great Shadow was tossing a small wrench to himself. James muttered, \u201cGreat.\u201d A few months ago, the League had taken to giving him challenges. After One-shot took out three guards with an apple, the League started giving him random items to push his limits. He\u2019s used about forty random items since then, including an empty can of soda, a hamster, and a tube of toothpaste. James found the silver lining, at least it was something heavy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOne-shot! You made it. Okay, so the perp is inside,\u201d Great Shadow began to explain the situation. James believed Great Shadow\u2019s secret identity was a cop. He never broached the subject, but who says, \u201cperp.\u201d Not to mention, his super just sounds villainous, but he\u2019s never even broached the subject. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They stood outside a jewelry store. Through the glass, One-shot could see a man holding a child at gunpoint. He lamented, \u201cReally, a child?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI just told you that. Were you even paying attention,\u201d Great Shadow asked annoyed? Apparently, One-shot had interrupted the exposition. Again, One-shot wondered why the Great Shadow wasn\u2019t a villain, he loved to monologue. He snapped himself out of it to hear Great Shadow finishing his breakdown. \u201cSo I grabbed this wrench. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll cast my shadow over the store slowly and you throw the paper cup and knock the guy out.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d One-shot suddenly registered what Great Shadow said, \u201cWait. What?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust making sure you were paying attention. Here\u2019s the wrench. You can hit him, right?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOf course, I\u2019m One-shot!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great Shadow turned and let his shadow spread toward the jewelry store. James waited until the man saw the shadow. The look of panic on the bad guy&amp;#39;s faces when they see the end always brought a small smile to James\u2019 face. He brought the wrench over his head to throw it. He looked toward the man\u2019s face taking aim. He blinked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One-shot had a secret. He couldn\u2019t make the shot. In fact, James couldn\u2019t throw a baseball in a game of catch. He\u2019s taken lessons, but nothing ever clicked. He didn\u2019t mind too much because James could stop time. There\u2019s a serenity when time stops. The serenity balances the insane amount of power when nothing else can move. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He dropped his arm and walked up to the glass. The glass shattered from the wrenches impact. He wasn\u2019t sure why objects he touched could react to him when everything else was frozen. He walked through the showcase and over the shattered glass, wrench still in hand. James stood and looked at the bad guy. He could stare him in the face and leave a mental imprint of One-shot\u2019s mask before he finished the job, but he reserved that for the supervillains. He redirected the gun to point at the ceiling. He didn\u2019t want to take any chance that his body flinches and pulls the trigger. He raised the wrench and struck him over the forehead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man crumpled into a heap with the boy falling with him. One-shot dropped the wrench nearby. He walked back to Great Shadow. He mimicked the position of a pitcher after throwing a fastball and blinked. The world swirled back into motion. Great Shadow saw the aftermath and smiled at me, before racing in comfort the boy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;James wanted to tell them the truth and come clean. He hated the lies and deceit. He knew better, though. He\u2019d either be locked up as too powerful or drafted into the Super League of World Savers. Seriously, he wondered why the superheroes had to use the most stupid names for their organizations. He liked the somewhat quiet job of fighting crime in his hometown. He told himself if there was ever a need so desperate that the Super League couldn\u2019t handle it, he would step up. He prayed that day would never come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He walked over to Great Shadow and put his hand on his shoulder as he knelt down to see how the boy was doing. \u201cThank you One-shot,\u201d the boy threw his arms around One-shots neck. Yeah, James thought, this is worth it and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. You can read more at &lt;a href=\"/r/LetThereBeWords\"&gt;r/LetThereBeWords&lt;/a&gt;.

Danielle spent a week trying to find a way to tell Captain Parker what she knew and a week having increasingly unpleasant visions of the captain deciding to seek further evidence, followed by Dr. Jacobs knowing we were on to him almost immediately, with the inevitable result of Jacobs killing everyone who knew. Or at least, everyone he thought knew. Sometimes it was just the captain; usually it was both Captain Parker and Danielle; sometimes it was all three of us. There was also one occasion Danielle refused to actually tell me about, but considering the mere vision of it left her puking in the base bathroom, I probably don't want to know.\n\nDanielle, unsurprisingly, has been increasingly on-edge all week.\n\n\"So, A, the base is bugged. Definitely bugged.\" Daniella was pacing around my apartment like she was afraid rigor mortis would set in if she didn't keep moving. I guess having three visions of yourself dying in one day will do that. \"Not just the captain's office, either, and I don't think it's someone spying on us, unless someone can turn invisible - no, I don't think there's a real telepath involved,\" she said, interrupting me before I could actually ask about the possibility, \"I think we'd both be dead already if there was. But Captain Parker always seems to take me seriously, even if she's skeptical, and no way she bungles a serious investigation so quickly *anyone* finds out who's not supposed to within ten minutes.\" Danielle dropped into a chair for all of three seconds before getting up to pace again.\n\n\"And B?\"\n\n\"What? Oh, yeah, I said the office being bugged was A. B, *how the hell does the captain keep dying?*\"\n\n\"She's not immortal.\"\n\n\"She's not non-powered, either.\"\n\n\"Superfast reflexes don't make you - oh.\" Shit, how *did* she keep dying? Captain Parker's always at the very least been able to dodge whatever the bad guys threw, shot, kicked, or otherwise aimed at her. What kind of weapon could actually move faster than her ability to dodge it?\n\n\"Usually a gun,\" Danielle said, before I had a chance to actually ask. \n\n\"No way a regular gun kills Captain Parker.\"\n\n\"No way a regular *anything* kills Captain Parker, except maybe poison. Someone either has the ability to - someone besides you, god do you really think I'd be *in your apartment* if it was you, and even if I didn't trust you which I *do* I'd be dead *already* if it were you and you *wouldn't* be dying in any of my visions, *no* we're not having an argument - \"\n\n\"Are you sure? It sounds like you're having an argument I haven't gotten to ye-\"\n\n\"- but either someone has basically the same time-stop ability as you, or someone can mess up the captain's reflexes, or someone is such a great telekinetic they can control mid-air bullets, or... I don't even know, but someone powered is involved, so either Jacobs has help or he's lying about *not* being powered, and - yes, of *course* I considered just writing everything down or telling her the office is bugged and we're all gonna die if she doesn't meet me somewhere outside, but when I actually went to do either I had a vision of both of us getting killed anyway.\" Danielle sighed and rubbed her forehead. \"Sorry, I'm really trying *not* to focus hard enough on this conversation to keep jumping ahead in it. No, no, focusing on a conversation like this keeps me about three or four minutes ahead. Because I'm not just focusing on what we're saying, I'm focusing on a bunch of other stuff relevant to the topic, but the only part of the future I'm paying attention to is the conversation, and - Wait, you haven't asked about the time/focus relationship yet. Do you have any - great. Can I have a beer? Or two?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they're...\" Already in the kitchen. \"Can you...\" Aaand also already grabbing the full twelve-pack of beer instead of just two. \"Why am I still *talking*.\"\n\n\"Because I'm not actually a telepath and if you quit talking then I won't be able to see what you're not-saying in the future so the only way I'll know what you're saying is if you keep saying it. Or almost-saying it. Doing whatever it is which makes the likelihood of you talking high enough to not need to talk.\" she rattled as she came back and dropped the beer on my coffee table. \"Also, the beer's gonna help me lose focus enough to actually have the damn conversation in real time,\" she said as she passed one to me and popped another one open for herself. \"I mean, I might still end up skipping a few sentences, or I might end up knowing what the traffic twenty minutes from now is gonna be like, but it'll make conversation easier because I'll be able to see something else.\"\n\nI watched her go through half the bottle with alarming speed. \"Should I order Chinese or something? I think you're gonna be a few steps past 'losing focus' if you down multiple beers on an empty stomach.\"\n\n\"S'not empty. I ate before I came here.\"\n\nIf she was non-powered I'd rather doubt she'd eaten *enough*, but whatever. She knows how alcohol affects her and her powers better than I do. \n\n\"Okay, then.\" I opened my own drink and took a more moderate swig from it. \"Are you totally sure we're being bugged? I thought the captain was the only one who always died. Why doesn't whoever's bugging the base, or the captain, realize you're the leak and kill you, too?\"\n\n\"See, this is why I go fake telepath instead of real psychic. Just because I only ever see the captain die doesn't mean she's the only one who *does*. Just means nobody gets around to killing *me* in the very brief timeframe I can see.\" She made a face and stood to start pacing again, gesticulating with the hand which wasn't holding a half-finished beer. \"I mean, who's so desperate they commit murder within ten minutes of someone going to the CO about them? And whatever he's covering up, he needs to hit the captain first. If I manage to get out alive after she dies, I might be too scared to go to anyone else. If *she* gets out alive after *I* die, she's gonna know exactly who did it and bring every current and former super-powered army buddy down on his ass before the blood dries.\" She paused. \"I am not actually offended by your willingness to pay money to see that, by the way. *I'd* pay money to see it if I wouldn't be, y'know, dead.\"\n\nA few weeks ago I thought I had decent impulse control. Now I clearly need to work on it more to push down even the chance of saying stuff like that. \n\nAt least she wasn't jumping so far ahead I couldn't follow her side of the conversation any more. No wonder she always told the rest of us stress makes it harder for her to limit her \"telepathy\".\n\n\"What about bringing the captain here?\" I suggested. \"Or someplace else not bugged? Not telling her the base is bugged, just, I don't know, asking her over for some drinks or something.\"\n\n\"Tried. *Did*, actually, on Monday. Got a polite rejection because she doesn't mind fraternization among the team, but it would be just inappropriate for her, as team leader, to engage in it.\"\n\n\"But we didn't die over it.\"\n\n\"Nope.\" She dropped back into the chair, actually staying seated long enough to finish her beer this time. \"And I'm getting really worried about Tonya. I doubt Jacobs is interfering with research on her power and open to murdering the rest of us for any reason which is good for her.\"\n\n\"She seems fine.\"\n\n\"And Dr. Jacobs seems an upstanding member of the medical community,\" Danielle said as she opened her second beer. \"Have you had any luck getting into his office?\"\n\n\"My time-stopping powers are still bested by superpowered government HR bureaucrats hellbent on following HIPAA regulations while simultaneously keeping injured supervillains from escaping.\"\n\n\"So no.\" \n\n\"I got to the outer office and found the tantalizing information of what pizza place Dr. Jacobs and Solomon order from when they're working late. Might have more luck at my next round of tests or whatever they're calling them now, but it isn't for another two weeks and with Dr. Solomon, not Jacobs.\"\n\n\"I had one two weeks ago with Jacobs, and tried my... not-telepathic interrogation on him. Nothing useful, and I do not intend to try it again.\"\n\n\"Death visions?\"\n\n\"For future reference, he does not keep a gun in his office. He does keep many, many scalpels and sedatives and other drugs in his office.\" \n\nI fought the urge to shudder. Mostly failed. \"But he doesn't suspect you know anything? He thinks you're a telepath.\"\n\n\"A telepath with morals against eavesdropping. He thinks as long as he keeps me calm enough to avoid losing control, he'll be fine. But I can't see futures which go completely against anything possible, and there's no way in hell I'm going to actually question him now, so I don't think I could psychically interrogate him even if we're still trying to figure things out at my next appointment.\"\n\nI took a long drink of beer as I thought over the problem. \"We need to get evidence on Dr. Jacobs without getting the captain involved.\"\n\n\"And *we* can't get it, which means we need to get *someone* else involved.\"\n\n\"Someone who has an appointment sooner than us. Like, someone with a still-confusing power who has appointments with both doctors every week for testing.\"\n\n\"And someone who will be pissed enough at Jacobs to side with us, not him.\"\n\n\"Like someone whose powers are not what she thinks they are and has enough of a temper to want to completely *end* Jacobs when she finds out he's been withholding information from her.\"\n\nDanielle finished her second beer, looked at the carton like she was seriously considering a third, and pulled out her cell phone. \"Okay, I'm ordering Chinese.

And then we&amp;#39;re figuring out how we&amp;#39;re going to tell Tonya we suspect she&amp;#39;s telekinetic without her getting pissed at &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; first.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg8g8fy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492156819.0, "created_utc": 1492128019.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xj5g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6wjqe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pikachai-latte", "parent_id": "t1_dg6pq5z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can...\nCan we please have some more?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can...\nCan we please have some more?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg6wjqe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492074952.0, "created_utc": 1492046152.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xj5g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6w5an", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dragynwulf", "parent_id": "t1_dg6pq5z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": " I want to see more of this.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to see more of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg6w5an", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492074462.0, "created_utc": 1492045662.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xj5g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6zu18", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zaro_", "parent_id": "t1_dg6pq5z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Me four", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me four&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg6zu18", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492079036.0, "created_utc": 1492050236.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6pq5z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 43, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CaoilfhionnRuadh", "parent_id": "t3_64xj5g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I settled across the kitchen table from Danielle and slid one of my coffee mugs toward her. \"So how do you do it?\" I asked casually.\n\nShe paused, not suspiciously long but long enough for me to notice. \"Do what?\" she finally asked as she reached for the coffee.\n\n\"Fake a superpower you don't have.\"\n\n*That* pause was suspicious. More of a panicked freeze, really. Her pupils dilated the way they do when she's focusing intently on using her actual power, whatever the hell it is, and I forced myself to stay calm. \n\nWorst case scenario, I just accused an actual telepath of not being a telepath. And the totally-actually-a-telepath is now trying to figure out what made me think otherwise and is seeing nothing in my head but a big flashing neon \"well, if the mind-reader who has trouble limiting her power when she's in battle hasn't figured out I can't shoot for shit...\"\n\nBest case scenario, I'm trying to learn about *her* fake superpower before she can learn about *my* fake superpower. Which is a little risky because regardless of what her actual superpower is, if it allows her to fake telepathy, it could still allow her to figure out my lies before I figure out hers, *and* now I've given her motivation to.\n\nI've been practicing this meeting ever since I realized she's not a telepath. Okay, I still don't know Danielle's real power. If I *did*, I wouldn't need to worry about whether - or when - she'd figure mine out. I could avoid discovery, or if discovery was inevitable maybe we could trade secrets. You don't tell anyone I'm stopping time to fake being a good shot, I don't tell anyone what you're doing to fake telepathy, we good? Good.\n\nWith no idea how she's pulling this off, I don't know how long I can go undetected. And while I know she's putting effort into keeping up her charade - probably as much as I'm putting into keeping up mine - I don't know if it's worth as much to her. Certainly won't be worth shit if I can't actually prove she's lying to anyone who would care about our powers.\n\nSo I made a list of questions I will ask. And questions she might ask me, both the ones I am willing to answer, and deflections to ones I'm not willing to answer, and otherwise...\n\nOtherwise, I'm just going to stay quiet. If I'm wrong and she's actually a telepath, she'll know everything soon enough anyway. If I'm right and she needs something more, she's not getting it from me.\n\nI took a sip from my coffee and waited long past the point where it would be reasonable for Danielle to stop staring at me and make any commentary on my thoughts. Eventually, she sagged back against the chair and dropped her gaze to stare at her hands instead of me. \"How'd you know?\" she asked.\n\nI shrugged. \"You claim you try not to eavesdrop on our thoughts. You also claim a wide variety of circumstances make it exceptionally difficult for you to avoid 'periphery interference'. But the real giveaway is, you *apologize* under those circumstances. 'Hey, sorry to have picked up on this, but I thought you should know I know about the affair with Lightweave and the argument with your sister and the time you pissed your pants three seconds before shooting the ten-story-tall iguana.' There's other things I expected you to know about me by now, and you *don't*. On such a level it's genuinely weird, because a real telepath would.\"\n\n\"Maybe I didn't want to make things awkward by bringing up anything overly personal,\" she said. Little late; she'd already asked how I knew about the lack of telepathy. \n\nBesides, she's admitted to knowing *way* too much embarrassing personal information about me in the past.\n\nI stayed silent for a while, counting to thirty - rehearsed this bit, too - before gently saying \"I won't tell anyone what you've been doing if you don't want me to. But I figured it out, and someone else might, too. If it's something you'd get kicked off the team for, you're gonna have to get better at hiding it.\"\n\nDanielle shook her head and snorted before raising her head to look at me. \"I won't get kicked off the team - not for my actual power, anyway. Maybe for lying about it. 'Unit cohesion' or something.\" I nodded. I was concerned about the same thing, at least to some extent. She sighed. \"It's pretty pathetic, but if you already know part of it, I may as well tell you the rest.\" She paused again, long enough I almost thought she would change her mind. \"I can see possible futures.\"\n\nMy turn to stare. \"And... you think being able to see the future is... pathetic?\"\n\n\"I can only see a short time into the future. An hour, at most, and only if I'm not trying to focus on anything in particular. The tighter my focus, the shorter the time. And I can't see every possibility, either, only a few of the most likely ones. It's not actually very useful for predicting what's going to happen. But it's amazing how many personal things people almost say or do and then don't. They change their mind. The conversation might have gone one way but actually went another. They might not have realized anyone else was within earshot but they did. Stuff like that. There's just so *much*, and I can kind of control it but I can't actually turn it *off*, and it's impossible to keep track of what people almost-said-but-didn't after a while, and I ended up knowing so goddamn many secrets and not being sure what anyone knew I knew and I wanted people to *know* because it's so weird otherwise and so hard to work around pretending not to know and finally I just started saying I was a telepath so I'd have a bloody *excuse* for knowing so much and. Well. Now people think I'm a telepath. And I'm very much not. But my actual power is useless for much beyond pretending to be a telepath and dodging bullets, so there it is.\" The whole monologue came out in a rush and ended with Danielle grabbing her coffee and taking a large swig, like she'd said far more than she'd meant to and was looking for a way to shut herself up.\n\n\"Huh,\" I said. Followed almost immediately by \"Oh, dammit.\"\n\nIt hadn't seemed fair to pressure Danielle into telling me about her power without telling her about mine, but I hadn't wanted to decide for sure what I would tell her until I knew about her power, and now I had to decide, which meant there was a chance I would tell her, which meant... \n\n\"Wait. You're faking your power, too?\"\n\nWhich meant I didn't really need to decide anything, I guess, because the very process of deciding had edged it into being a likely possibility within the next few minutes.\n\n\"You can't actually shoot. You're *stopping time* so you can fake a power which is, let's be real, only moderately more impressive than what a well-trained non-powered sharpshooter can pull off. And you've been freaking out about me figuring it out. You... Oh. My. God.\" She set the mug down and buried her face in her hands. \"Oh my *god*,\" she repeated, obvious laughter tinting the words before she dropped her hands again. \"Just the two of us makes up a third of the main powered team. And we're *faking* our *powers*,\" she said, still laughing. \"Do you think there's anyone else?\"\n\n\"Aaron,\" I said, without hesitation.\n\n\"How do you fake flying?\"\n\n\"Hell if I know, but we've worked together for years. Have you *ever* seen him take off or land? He's faking, or he has the godawful ugliest flight liftoff possible and is embarrassed to have it seen.\"\n\n\"Y'know, I think you're right. He keeps *almost* ending every meeting by telling me we need to talk in private and then chickening out. I think he's worried I'll figure out his flight-faking power with my fake telepathy, too,\" she said, laughing again before her smile faded into a more serious expression. \"But have you noticed anything weird about Tonya? Or Dr. Jacobs?\"\n\n\"Dr. Jacobs is powered?\" Superheroes get access to the best doctors, but most of them are non-powered. There's one in China with healing abilities, and a few more with relatively minor powers, but none of ours, as far as I'd known.\n\n\"I don't think so. Tonya is, though.\"\n\n\"Yeah, the super strength is kinda hard not to notice.\"\n\n\"I think it's actually touch-based telekinesis. Which is functionally the same thing, I guess, but without physical muscle behind it.\"\n\n\"For fuck's... Tonya's faking her power, too?\"\n\n\"No. I mean, not intentionally. She wants to throw something heavy, it gets thrown. If you had the telekinetic ability to move your coffee cup, but only if you were touching it, how long do you think it would take you to realize you were doing it with your mind instead of your hand?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't,\" I admitted, though now I had to fight the immediate urge to touch my mug with just one finger and see if I could make it levitate.\n\nDanielle nodded. \"But Dr. Solomon keeps running tests which bring up normal muscle. And Dr. Jacobs keeps running tests which *don't* bring up a normal brain. And he's almost been caught enough times for me to notice, but he hasn't *actually* been caught.\"\n\nI frowned. \"That's a huge deal. Why haven't you told the captain?\"\n\n\"I thought about it,\" she said quietly. \"I almost *did*. But twelve minutes later Dr. Jacobs would have found out. Thirteen minutes later the captain would be dead. Fourteen minutes later, *I'd* be dead. I am disturbingly familiar with how I feel dead, and I have an admittedly cowardly policy of *not doing* the things which get me there.\" \n\nAll the times in battle she'd narrowly avoided a fatal blow through wow-she-must-have-telepathically-sensed-someone-shooting-at-her suddenly seemed a lot less lucky.\n\n\"Understandable,\" I said. And explained why Jacobs was so averse to being around Danielle when she was in the sort of circumstances she always claimed threw off her ability to control her telepathy. \"But we can't just *not* do anything about something Dr. Jacobs is willing to kill us over.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" she admitted, before her smile returned. \"It's too bad I don't have a colleague who can keep huge secrets and has a superpower even Jacobs doesn't know about.\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I settled across the kitchen table from Danielle and slid one of my coffee mugs toward her. &amp;quot;So how do you do it?&amp;quot; I asked casually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She paused, not suspiciously long but long enough for me to notice. &amp;quot;Do what?&amp;quot; she finally asked as she reached for the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fake a superpower you don&amp;#39;t have.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; pause was suspicious.

But twelve minutes later Dr. Jacobs would have found out. Thirteen minutes later the captain would be dead. Fourteen minutes later, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;d&lt;/em&gt; be dead. I am disturbingly familiar with how I feel dead, and I have an admittedly cowardly policy of &lt;em&gt;not doing&lt;/em&gt; the things which get me there.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the times in battle she&amp;#39;d narrowly avoided a fatal blow through wow-she-must-have-telepathically-sensed-someone-shooting-at-her suddenly seemed a lot less lucky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Understandable,&amp;quot; I said. And explained why Jacobs was so averse to being around Danielle when she was in the sort of circumstances she always claimed threw off her ability to control her telepathy. &amp;quot;But we can&amp;#39;t just &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do anything about something Dr. Jacobs is willing to kill us over.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right,&amp;quot; she admitted, before her smile returned. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s too bad I don&amp;#39;t have a colleague who can keep huge secrets and has a superpower even Jacobs doesn&amp;#39;t know about.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg6pq5z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492066596.0, "created_utc": 1492037796.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xj5g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6uyxy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lizardmen134", "parent_id": "t3_64xj5g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\u201cJesse!

Out of the creaking space between realities where nightmares seep and madness takes form. The boy would learn that the creature, a whirling mass of protomorphic flesh and fangs, was called an infovore. These were apex predators in their native reality, which was similar to his own in the same way a piece of shit is similar to the meal that produced it. The infovore came out of nothing and latched onto the Sparrow as yet another wave of Arachnoids experienced localized matter-antimatter annihilation. The Sparrow screamed as a thousand tentacles lined with suction cups dripping acid were wrapped around her. The creature attempted to devour her, but it's head turned red, and then detonated. The loss of a head was no great obstacle, though it did cause those horrible black ropes to slacken the slightest bit. Only.\n\n\nOnly the tentacles were falling away entirely, now, severed from the trunk of the creature's body. That body itself... no longer seemed to exist. Instead there was a huge mass of purple Arachnoid spear tips, the spiders they had presumably grown from nowhere in sight. The mass shuddered, and the Sparrow saw that it was still the infovore that was before her, albeit one whose protomorphic body was now so entirely pinioned with Arachnoid parts that it was unable to move.\n\n\nShe darted away, looking down at her burnt body, trying to put it back together. Past her smoking hands, the ground was... too close. As the acidic sores began to close, the Sparrow gathered herself and attempted to take stock of her surroundings. The tops of the Washington bridge support columns were just visible sticking out of a sea of broken purple bodies. Far too many bodies. She had killed Arachnoids by the score, but there were thousands here, choking the street and bridge to the point that her formerly elevated position had in fact been about level with this grotesque mountain's top. Purple bodies spilled into the streets in every direction. The official count would be just south of an even 9,000. This also accounted for the body of the invading force, from Manhattan all the way down to the Florida Everglades. Heroes, police, the military... all reported being in combat with the creatures at one moment, only to have their opponents vanish completely, all in the same instant.\n\n\nThe Sparrow would learn about all this later. Having gathered her wits and healing her injuries, she used her powers to obliterate the infovore in a roar of quantum fire. The beast died screaming, and there was satisfaction in that, because the Sparrow was very sure that it would have killed her, or distracted her enough to allow the Arachnoids to finish the job. Only as the creature dissolved into green sparks did the Sparrow remember the boy.\n\n\nBut the boy was gone, and she would never find him. The identity of the person or entity that wiped out the Arachnoid invasion force in the blink of an eye? He, she, or it would remain unknown.\n\n\nThe night after that horrible ordeal, the Sparrow returned to her quarters and discovered a message than had been slid under her door. The message was a sheet of paper, torn in two. The paper, had it been whole, would have been a reproduction of the glyph that the Mad Hillbilly, or someone in his employ, had used on the interior maps of his subterranean compound to show where Hangar 2N was located. It was a crude, neuvo-redneck depiction of a cage. And the cage was torn in two. \n\n\nThis made the Sparrow glad. The boy was alive. He was also clearly severing ties, and that hurt her in a way that would never really heal, but knowing that he had not died during her moment of inattention? That was the seed of satisfaction that will hopefully, one day soon, blossom into acceptance of the boy's choice. And acceptance that the boy will never come back.\n\n\nA few days after the Arachnoid invasion was so decisively repulsed, a man showed up at the SQS recruitment station in Atlanta and stunned them with his uncanny precision with pretty much any weapon upon which he could lay hands. The man was immediately seconded to an active superhero squad that had been decimated in the defense of Boca Raton, where he performed ably for many years.\n\n\nSeveral years after the Arachnoid invasion, the Sparrow happened to meet the man during a joint maneuver to take down the Maven of Madness, who was normally a Manhattan problem that had rolled on town to Florida with the rest of the shit. The man smiled at the Sparrow, and she smiled in return, uncertain and a little intimidated. The man, who went by the code name Dead Center, looked like he had about zero percent body fat. He also looked to be about 70 years old. The Maven of Madness's Maladies fell quickly to the combined might of the SQS, and the Sparrow was amazed to watch Dead Center casually lumber through the capering forms of the Maladies, taking out chainsaw arms, hypodermic fingers, and eyes that spit glittering acid, all with the casual wire of someone making their way through an especially tedious house of mirrors. \n\n\nLong after that team up, the Sparrow would speak fondly of Dead Center. When he was lost in the final ascension of the Great Devoured God, she spoke at his funeral. Looking down at the photos in the place of a body, the Sparrow was for the first time struck by Dead Center's face. It was actually quite a lot like the boy's face. Perhaps the old man had been a relative. \n\n\nThe Sparrow still thought wistfully of the boy from time to time, as she passed the predictable milestones of her life. She liked to wonder how he had experienced those same milestones. Whom had he married? Where did he live? Had he settled on a cat, or a dog? Did he have children yet? How many? For the rest of her life, the Sparrow remembered the boy with fondness.\n\n\nAnd that is exactly as it should be.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It came out of the nothing.

The mass shuddered, and the Sparrow saw that it was still the infovore that was before her, albeit one whose protomorphic body was now so entirely pinioned with Arachnoid parts that it was unable to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She darted away, looking down at her burnt body, trying to put it back together. Past her smoking hands, the ground was... too close. As the acidic sores began to close, the Sparrow gathered herself and attempted to take stock of her surroundings. The tops of the Washington bridge support columns were just visible sticking out of a sea of broken purple bodies. Far too many bodies. She had killed Arachnoids by the score, but there were thousands here, choking the street and bridge to the point that her formerly elevated position had in fact been about level with this grotesque mountain&amp;#39;s top. Purple bodies spilled into the streets in every direction. The official count would be just south of an even 9,000. This also accounted for the body of the invading force, from Manhattan all the way down to the Florida Everglades. Heroes, police, the military... all reported being in combat with the creatures at one moment, only to have their opponents vanish completely, all in the same instant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Sparrow would learn about all this later. Having gathered her wits and healing her injuries, she used her powers to obliterate the infovore in a roar of quantum fire. The beast died screaming, and there was satisfaction in that, because the Sparrow was very sure that it would have killed her, or distracted her enough to allow the Arachnoids to finish the job. Only as the creature dissolved into green sparks did the Sparrow remember the boy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the boy was gone, and she would never find him. The identity of the person or entity that wiped out the Arachnoid invasion force in the blink of an eye? He, she, or it would remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The night after that horrible ordeal, the Sparrow returned to her quarters and discovered a message than had been slid under her door. The message was a sheet of paper, torn in two. The paper, had it been whole, would have been a reproduction of the glyph that the Mad Hillbilly, or someone in his employ, had used on the interior maps of his subterranean compound to show where Hangar 2N was located. It was a crude, neuvo-redneck depiction of a cage. And the cage was torn in two. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This made the Sparrow glad. The boy was alive. He was also clearly severing ties, and that hurt her in a way that would never really heal, but knowing that he had not died during her moment of inattention? That was the seed of satisfaction that will hopefully, one day soon, blossom into acceptance of the boy&amp;#39;s choice. And acceptance that the boy will never come back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days after the Arachnoid invasion was so decisively repulsed, a man showed up at the SQS recruitment station in Atlanta and stunned them with his uncanny precision with pretty much any weapon upon which he could lay hands. The man was immediately seconded to an active superhero squad that had been decimated in the defense of Boca Raton, where he performed ably for many years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several years after the Arachnoid invasion, the Sparrow happened to meet the man during a joint maneuver to take down the Maven of Madness, who was normally a Manhattan problem that had rolled on town to Florida with the rest of the shit. The man smiled at the Sparrow, and she smiled in return, uncertain and a little intimidated. The man, who went by the code name Dead Center, looked like he had about zero percent body fat. He also looked to be about 70 years old. The Maven of Madness&amp;#39;s Maladies fell quickly to the combined might of the SQS, and the Sparrow was amazed to watch Dead Center casually lumber through the capering forms of the Maladies, taking out chainsaw arms, hypodermic fingers, and eyes that spit glittering acid, all with the casual wire of someone making their way through an especially tedious house of mirrors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long after that team up, the Sparrow would speak fondly of Dead Center. When he was lost in the final ascension of the Great Devoured God, she spoke at his funeral. Looking down at the photos in the place of a body, the Sparrow was for the first time struck by Dead Center&amp;#39;s face. It was actually quite a lot like the boy&amp;#39;s face. Perhaps the old man had been a relative. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Sparrow still thought wistfully of the boy from time to time, as she passed the predictable milestones of her life. She liked to wonder how he had experienced those same milestones. Whom had he married? Where did he live? Had he settled on a cat, or a dog? Did he have children yet? How many? For the rest of her life, the Sparrow remembered the boy with fondness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that is exactly as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg77uof", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492091487.0, "created_utc": 1492062687.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg77slk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mustachioed_cat", "parent_id": "t3_64xj5g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Long ago, in the far off land of Chicago, a girl fell in love with a boy. \n\n\nThey shared a cage in the back of Hangar 2N, which was one of the last liberated by the SQS when they took down the Mad Hillbilly and his army of mutant orangutan still workers. The boy and the girl had been together for nearly a year by that point, the Mad Hillbilly using their DNA to engineer a most loathsome genetic spike to his dread moonshine. The SQS found them hours before the Mad Hillbilly would have spiked the entire Chicago water supply, leaving the populace irretrievably intoxicated.\n\n\nThe boy and girl were ten or eleven. It was hard to tell, and no one was able to learn anything about their origins. What was obvious to everyone, however, was that the girl, who called herself Sparrow, was capable of parachromatic transfiguration, which gave her absolute control over the color of anything within her line of sight. The SQS development team figured the underlying mechanism was fine manipulation of quantum structures, and that her powerset could expand rapidly as she matured.\n\n\nThe boy who referred to himself by any mundane name that came to mind, seemed to have no abilities whatsoever. He also seemed to be thoroughly exasperated by Sparrow's constant need for attention. By the time they were thirteen, Sparrow was acting as a sidekick to Mystic Miracle, going out on patrol and training to be a superhero one day. The boy was living in a foster home and had decided to be a\ndoctor when he grew up. Sparrow still loved the boy, but separation and his lack of enthusiasm were beginning to take their toll.\n\n\nBy the time they were sixteen, Sparrow was out on her own. She had a five block section of Manhatten to patrol. Her abilities had progressed to outright matter manipulation, and no conventional weapons could do her the slightest harm. She could fly now. She could teleport to any location within her line of sight. Her quantum abilities were developing nicely, the SQS said. In a few years, she'd be able to join the main team. The boy was drifting through school like a ghost, getting straight A's in every subject except P.E.\n\n\nThey were both seventeen, or thereabouts, when the girl dropped in to visit her cage buddy. They had seen very little of one another over the last few years, and the rightly proud Sparrow took the boy up into the sky, where they could tread upon clouds as solid as sidewalk beneath the infinite sky and a gibbous moon.\n\n\n\"Do you know what my name means?\" the Sparrow asked.\n\n\n\"That you like to eat seeds,\" the boy said, not at all serious.\n\n\n\"You know what it means,\" she said, smiling. \"I didn't pick that name, but I think it describes me. Don't you?\"\n\n\n\"I think,\" the boy said, looking down at the city far below, \"I was happier back in the cage.\"\n\n\n\"But look at this world!\" Sparrow drifted in a lazy circle. \"It's so big and incredible!\"\n\n\n\"I liked the cage better,\" the boy said.\n\n\n\"Because you had me all to yourself,\" the Sparrow teased, leaning in close, hot breath on the boy's face.\n\n\n\"Because in the cage, the only world I could end was my own,\" the boy replied, leaning away. \"I hate this place, but I hate myself more.\"\n\n\n\"It isn't your fault that Jenny died,\" the Sparrow said. \"Haven't you... they're sending you to... you've got a therapist, right?\"\n\n\nThe boy grinned with bitter satisfaction. \"The SQS is done with me, and fuck them. If it hadn't taken them six months to notice what that overall-wearing fuck was trying to do, Jenny would still be alive.\"\n\n\nThe Sparrow reclined indecently on a cloud nearby, hiking up her faux skirt to reveal a peek of form-fitting spandex. The boy still wore a grin like an empty crypt.\n\n\nThey spoke some more, and at length, but the boy failed to respond to the Sparrow, whose name meant true love, not just lust, and the Sparrow's heart grew more and more troubled as the boy stoically refused even her most overt advances. To be perfectly fair, she was an angel that had risen from the muck of the Mad Hillbilly's genetic labs. The boy though, the boy was a broken toy, held together by strips of tape, glue, and a sense of self-loathing so utterly complete that it was only his sardonic outlook and fear of death that kept him alive. The Sparrow really should have been making friends with other supers her own age, forgetting about the Mad Hillbilly, forgetting about the cage, and forgetting about the boy that she had, for whatever reason, had such affection for back then.\n\n\nEventually, the Sparrow gathered up the boy and deposited him back on the rooftop of his foster family'a house. She hung in the air, unhappy, unsatisfied, and confused. She was Sparrow, and this was her chosen mate, but something was wrong. Something was always wrong, with him. She waited in the air, waiting for him to say something, waiting for him to apologize, waiting for him to go, waiting for him to breakdown and admit his flaws and allow her to help him overcome his traumas.\n\n\nEventually, the boy turned away and left.\n\n\nSix months later, the Arachnoids from  the Asteroid Beyond the Moon invaded, flooding Manhattan with countless battlemorphs. While SQS heavy hitters were taking down the queen and the prime nest off world, the B-listers were stuck protecting evacuation routes and issuing the occasional guerrilla strike against the invading forces. The Burroughs were all lost and covered in the purple webs of the enemy. People were gathered up and drained of blood before their loved ones, with the Arachnoids pressing in close to the surviving family members, gorging themselves on the emotional torment of having someone die in front of them.\n\n\nThe Sparrow was at the Washington bridge, trying to interrupt the stream of eight-legged reinforcements skittering out of the Bronx. The boy was there in a nearby rooftop. She had gone to him in the early hours of the crisis; she wanted to be able to keep him safe. The boy stood at the edge of the roof, looking down in mute terror as the Arachnoids exploded left and right beneath the Sparrow's gaze, their purple carapaces burning to red, the telltale sign of Sparrow prepping a site for spontaneous positronic emission. The anti-electron annihilation cooked dozens of spiders. The Sparrow stood tall, upon nothing, above the tumult like an angry and glorious god.\n\n\nIt should be said, at this point, that the boy loved the Sparrow. He may not have admitted as much to himself, but there was a gravity between them that he could not deny, and why deny something you can waste time sneering at?\n\n\nThe boy's 'problem', if such a\nfundamental trauma could ever be given such a small label, was that he had been made to watch as his sister Jenny had been cut into pieces by the Mad Hillbilly. Jenny had been able to regenerate, and the Mad Hillbilly had made a grand show of wanting to test her abilities. The boy had tried to use his power, as he had a half dozen times in the past, but as always, the Mad Hillbilly had properly secured him--to a machine that sapped his power. On that day, the Mad Hillbilly got exactly what he wanted. First, he determined that a little girl that can regrow a finger cannot regenerate if you put her body into a wood chipper, and, second, that the boy's chronorepulsion field was sufficient to add decades of deep learning to the neural network the Mad Hillbilly had running in the machines to which the boy was chained. In mere seconds, a half-century of processing power was executed, on equipment powered by long-lasting nuclear batteries. The boy's power had been stolen, not shanghai'd, and he was still intact. The boy had given the Mad Hillbilly the perfect formula for a perfect moonshine that could permanently alter the DNA of anyone that got so much as a single molecule of moonshine in their system, beginning a transformation which, in thirty days time, result in the infected being a permanently inebriated redneck, love of modern country music and the confederate flag included. The boy had been made to watch as everyone else in the cage, with the exception of Sparrow (who the Mad Hillbilly still needed for another phase of his plan) were made to drink the perfect moonshine. He watched them gradually transform from the people he knew into a slack-jawed parody of a bad stereotype, with nothing of their original personalities in place. These kids were eventually removed from the cage--the chew spit was proving to be a nightmare to clean up--leaving the Sparrow and the boy alone. The Sparrow had endured this through sheer force of will. The boy was broken into a thousand pieces and not properly alive. He had seen his sister squirm and shriek as she was lowered into that wood chipper, and he had seen the mush that came out the other end shiver, as though trying to reassemble itself. And he had seen the Mad Hillbilly dump the whole thing into a vat of sizzling acid.\n\n\nSo yeah, the boy was broke. Undead. A zombie. And here he was on a rooftop, watching the Sparrow be a total badass, killing alien spiders left, right, and center. And he felt nothing.\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long ago, in the far off land of Chicago, a girl fell in love with a boy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They shared a cage in the back of Hangar 2N, which was one of the last liberated by the SQS when they took down the Mad Hillbilly and his army of mutant orangutan still workers.
