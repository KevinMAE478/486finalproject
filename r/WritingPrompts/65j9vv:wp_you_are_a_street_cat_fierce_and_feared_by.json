That was my name on the street. Baddest-assed cat around. Could catch a mouse in 3.2 seconds after the first spotting. The little gray buggers didn't stand a chance. The other cats knew, if I could do that to a mouse, they wouldn't be shown any mercy either. \n\nSo that was my life, catching, eating and making sure others knew that my land was my land. It wasn't so bad. You get used to living in turmoil amongst the buzzing cars and barking dogs. You get used to it. But then one day one of those humans came by and wouldn't stop pestering me. It wasn't even a big one. It was this little one with blonde hair split into two strands on each side of her head. \n\n\"Kitty!\" she kept saying. \n\n\"*Feral*\" I would meow, but her expression wouldn't change. \n\nShe crouched down and came closer slowly. \n\n\"Kitty, come,\" she said, softer this time. \n\n\"*Feral!*\" I meowed louder, puffing up my hair. She would have to understand I wasn't one of those softy house-cats. If she got too close, she would regret it. \n\nThe little human reached into her pocket and took out some little brown pebble. She threw it down in front of me. The nerve. Throwing dirt at Feral. She deserved a good slash. But then an aroma wafted through the air. It was delicious and mysterious. I paused and soaked in the sweet smell before investigating the source. \n\nIt was the dirt. I don't know how, but the dirt smelt amazing. It smelt better than any mouse I had ever dove my teeth into, so I took a bite. There's no comparison to each wonderful flavour that soft piece of heaven delivered. And then the little human took out another. \n\n\"Here, Kitty,\" she said. How many did she have?\n\nI walked slowly up to her and sniffed. It was the same thing and my mouth watered instantly. She dropped in this time and I sprang to eat it, sniffing her hand for more once I finished. The human giggled and attacked. \n\nShe scooped me up into the air below my front paws and exposed me to the great open world. I jostled and fought, but her grip was like rock. \n\n\"Honey, put that down!\" I heard another human yell from a distance. This one came racing up, twice the size of the little one with her brunette hair draped over her shoulders. \n\n\"No!\" said the little one. \"I want this kitty.\" \n\n\"*What about what I want?*\" I meowed, kicking with a swift fury. \n\n\"Charlotte, put it down,\" the big human demanded. \n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"It's dirty though, you don't want to get all dirty do you?\"\n\n\"*Dirty? You think I worry about dirt out here?*\" I meow. \n\n\"Then I'll clean him!\" the little human said. \n\n\"*I'm a girl!*\" I meow, relaxing all my muscles in hopes of sliding through her vice grip. \n\n\"Now!\" demanded the large human. \"You have until 3. 1. 2.\"\n\n\"I'll come back, Kitty,\" the little human said and dropped me before the big one said \"3\". \n\nI sprang forward and turned around to hiss before running into the woods. That night it took me 11.3 seconds to catch a mouse for dinner. My slowest time in 3 years. It tasted terrible too. All night I couldn't help but remember the soft and delectable taste of those dirt pellets. The next day I waited in the woods next to the road for the little human to pass by. \n\nIt was just past noon when the little thing hobbled along the sidewalk, peering in the trees every few feet. The big one pushed a baby stroller and kept looking away from the little one while rolling her eyes. When the little one came closer, I casually walked into view. \n\n\"Kitty!\" the little one yelled and I ignored her. \"Kitty!\" The little one threw a dirt pellet, hitting me in the ear. I hissed in return before being seduced by the soft scent of the dirt. \n\nWhile eating the little human came up to me and I readied myself to run. I didn't want to be caught again. The first time was embarrassing enough. Then the human dropped four pellets on the ground. I could feel my eyes grow and I chowed down on the first one. \n\nBested again. The little human scooped me up. \n\n\"Mum said I could keep you,\" she said as I wiggled. I gave up much quicker this time, finding no point in fighting. \n\nIt turned out well though. After a short walk, I was placed inside a warm shelter. There were a bunch of soft places to jump onto and rest. A large window that looked out onto a large spot of land at the back of the shelter. And the best of all, there was a bowl of dirt, which I'll call food now, waiting for me. \n\nNow I spend my days in the warmth of this place, sometimes allowed to play in the back land, though they don't seem to appreciate my mouse gifts. I let the people here pet me and my hair has never felt so smooth. They don't call me Feral, but Mindy and I don't think I mind too much anymore. \n\nThe cats I knew before say I lost their respect and went soft. They don't understand. I never fought for respect. I fought to survive. Inside, Feral will remain a part of me. And I still catch the mice in the back land in under 5 seconds, but now I am Mindy and life is good. \n\n---\n\nThank you for reading!

It was this little one with blonde hair split into two strands on each side of her head. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kitty!&amp;quot; she kept saying. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Feral&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; I would meow, but her expression wouldn&amp;#39;t change. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She crouched down and came closer slowly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kitty, come,&amp;quot; she said, softer this time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Feral!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; I meowed louder, puffing up my hair. She would have to understand I wasn&amp;#39;t one of those softy house-cats. If she got too close, she would regret it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little human reached into her pocket and took out some little brown pebble. She threw it down in front of me. The nerve. Throwing dirt at Feral. She deserved a good slash. But then an aroma wafted through the air. It was delicious and mysterious. I paused and soaked in the sweet smell before investigating the source. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the dirt. I don&amp;#39;t know how, but the dirt smelt amazing. It smelt better than any mouse I had ever dove my teeth into, so I took a bite. There&amp;#39;s no comparison to each wonderful flavour that soft piece of heaven delivered. And then the little human took out another. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here, Kitty,&amp;quot; she said. How many did she have?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked slowly up to her and sniffed. It was the same thing and my mouth watered instantly. She dropped in this time and I sprang to eat it, sniffing her hand for more once I finished. The human giggled and attacked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She scooped me up into the air below my front paws and exposed me to the great open world. I jostled and fought, but her grip was like rock. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Honey, put that down!&amp;quot; I heard another human yell from a distance. This one came racing up, twice the size of the little one with her brunette hair draped over her shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No!&amp;quot; said the little one. &amp;quot;I want this kitty.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;What about what I want?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; I meowed, kicking with a swift fury. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Charlotte, put it down,&amp;quot; the big human demanded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s dirty though, you don&amp;#39;t want to get all dirty do you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Dirty? You think I worry about dirt out here?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; I meow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then I&amp;#39;ll clean him!&amp;quot; the little human said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m a girl!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; I meow, relaxing all my muscles in hopes of sliding through her vice grip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now!&amp;quot; demanded the large human. &amp;quot;You have until 3. 1. 2.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll come back, Kitty,&amp;quot; the little human said and dropped me before the big one said &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sprang forward and turned around to hiss before running into the woods. That night it took me 11.3 seconds to catch a mouse for dinner. My slowest time in 3 years. It tasted terrible too. All night I couldn&amp;#39;t help but remember the soft and delectable taste of those dirt pellets. The next day I waited in the woods next to the road for the little human to pass by. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was just past noon when the little thing hobbled along the sidewalk, peering in the trees every few feet. The big one pushed a baby stroller and kept looking away from the little one while rolling her eyes. When the little one came closer, I casually walked into view. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kitty!&amp;quot; the little one yelled and I ignored her. &amp;quot;Kitty!&amp;quot; The little one threw a dirt pellet, hitting me in the ear. I hissed in return before being seduced by the soft scent of the dirt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While eating the little human came up to me and I readied myself to run. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be caught again. The first time was embarrassing enough. Then the human dropped four pellets on the ground. I could feel my eyes grow and I chowed down on the first one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bested again. The little human scooped me up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mum said I could keep you,&amp;quot; she said as I wiggled. I gave up much quicker this time, finding no point in fighting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turned out well though. After a short walk, I was placed inside a warm shelter. There were a bunch of soft places to jump onto and rest. A large window that looked out onto a large spot of land at the back of the shelter. And the best of all, there was a bowl of dirt, which I&amp;#39;ll call food now, waiting for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I spend my days in the warmth of this place, sometimes allowed to play in the back land, though they don&amp;#39;t seem to appreciate my mouse gifts. I let the people here pet me and my hair has never felt so smooth. They don&amp;#39;t call me Feral, but Mindy and I don&amp;#39;t think I mind too much anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cats I knew before say I lost their respect and went soft. They don&amp;#39;t understand. I never fought for respect. I fought to survive. Inside, Feral will remain a part of me. And I still catch the mice in the back land in under 5 seconds, but now I am Mindy and life is good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading!

They didn't call me Mice Hunter Tom for nothing. However, what occurred in front of my eyes was unheard of.\n\nA mouse dodging my attack? This mouse must of been trained in combat, there's just no way. Not only did that happen, but there was another dilemma. My claws, they were stuck! Almost like this exact scenario had been devilishly planned. As I'm trying to claw my way out of the wall, I hear a muffled laugh. My head turns to take a look and BAM! A f**king brick falls on my head. So now I'm both stuck and flattened like a pancake. \n\nThat was just the first of many incidents with that mouse. Electrocuted, burned, drowned, anything you can think of, that mouse had done it to me. My new life had been tarnished, and now I'm the one getting bossed around.

Oh such a naive cat I was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the third month began, everything went to hell. Like usual, I was lazing around when I spotted a gray mouse in the corner of my eye. Excited at the thought of some meat, I jumped like a rocket and began to chase him. I was tailing the mouse for what seemed like hours until I finally managed to corner it, with its back against a wall. With my claws out, I got in for the kill. I swipe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slash&lt;/em&gt;. I looked up, expecting to see a lifeless mouse awaiting to be eaten, though what I saw instead was something not expected. Nothing, he was no where to be seen. That bastard dodged my attack at the last moment. Now let me tell you, I&amp;#39;ve hunted many mice in my days. In fact I held the highest kill record in my territory. They didn&amp;#39;t call me Mice Hunter Tom for nothing. However, what occurred in front of my eyes was unheard of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A mouse dodging my attack? This mouse must of been trained in combat, there&amp;#39;s just no way. Not only did that happen, but there was another dilemma. My claws, they were stuck! Almost like this exact scenario had been devilishly planned. As I&amp;#39;m trying to claw my way out of the wall, I hear a muffled laugh. My head turns to take a look and BAM! A f**king brick falls on my head. So now I&amp;#39;m both stuck and flattened like a pancake. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was just the first of many incidents with that mouse. Electrocuted, burned, drowned, anything you can think of, that mouse had done it to me. My new life had been tarnished, and now I&amp;#39;m the one getting bossed around. In commemoration to my new worst enemy, I shall give him the most vile name I could think of. A name so horrible, even uttering it will cause anyone to puke. Hmm, lets see.. I shall call him Jerry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgb03mw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492310741.0, "created_utc": 1492281941.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j9vv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb8t62", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rynthion", "parent_id": "t3_65j9vv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This was\u2014by far\u2014 the most demeaning experience I had ever been in, in every since of the word.\n\n\nI was the merciless king of Elm and 8th, and this two-legged wretch thought it could pull me from my very throne?

It's been a while since I went by that name. These days they call me The Ginger Death. Since I was a little kitten all them years ago, I never had a father figure ; my dad was never around. My beloved mother told me he scarpered the day he found out he was gonna be a dad. Needless to say, this screwed me up , along with the death of my mum when I was one and a half years of age. She was all I ever had until she was taken from this world when she was run over by what I now know is a car. Since that day I've had to look after myself on these cruel and unforgiving streets. I had to catch my own mice. Except there was never enough food to go around so we would always fight to see who would get their meal. My numerous brawls have taught me one thing. It's kill or be killed on these streets. By the age of 3 I was hardened to life on these rocky roads. I would kill anyone who ever got in my way. That is how I earned not just my food and milk , but my name.It was them or me. I look back on my darkest days and mourn for the poor felines my claws killed. I had no choice though. My life has been a struggle to survive since day one. My daily activities involved fighting to see who was top cat and robbing some consumables off of other cats. During this dark and hopeless period of my life, I never sustained any serious wounds ( most of the time I would be lucky enough to leave with a couple of cuts) except for one incident. The incident which changed my whole future. \n\nIt was a sunny afternoon over a year ago. I was a five year old cat foraging for  food, whilst I swaggered to and fro. All the kitty cats knew I was a hoodlum. When they saw my scarred kipper ( hehe see what I did there) they would flee at all costs. Every single cat feared that I would strike them down or that their food would be no more. Except today not every cat ran in terror. As I walked down the alleyway three grey cats ( brothers ) who I had seen countless times in my five years of life approached me with menacing grins. They were public enemy number two. I , of course , was public enemy number one. Despite this, these  three brothers by the names of Tom , Fudge and Chewy were no pushovers. These were born killers who I had fought many a time in my existence.\n \" Where do you think you're going Furball? \" , leered Fudge, as he flexed his razor sharp fangs. His brothers chuckled at this remark. \n\"  Cut the kitten talk you idiots. I'll take all three of you on you dogs ! \" , I shouted .\nThe crowd of cats purred rapturously in excitement for the fight of all fights.\n\" Wow! \", laughed Chewy. \" I thought he was gonna run away just like his dad did. \" \nThe blood in my veins boiled. I charged straight at that villainous tyrant , whilst half the crowd cheered my name . As soon as I could, I struck my claws into his neck to make him pay for what he had done. Chewy let out a scream of terror ! Dozens of fans purred in delight. No sooner had this happened, Tom and Fudge rushed in and struck me to the ground. The other half of the spectators yelled the three brother's names in unison. Chewy rushed back up on to his four paws and scratched me clean in the face with his front left claws. Blood shot out of my face . All of these fans were sure getting their daily dose of violence and bloodshed. Scratch after scratch sliced my haggard face. It was the first time I had ever thought that I was going to lose my life. The blood dripped in to my eyes so I could not see a thing. \n\" He's had enough,\" said Tom.\nI don't recall what happened then ,as I blacked out thinking that I was going to lose one of my nine lives.\n\nSome time after I woke up. I was not in a backstreet alley anymore ; I was lying on a sofa next to a human. She was an old woman with long grey hair and a smile which lit up the room. She had a flannel in her hands and was dabbing at my wounds with it. Something about this woman let me know that I was safe. Her smile let me know that everything was going to be alright. Despite the overwhelming situation and the pain from my wounds, I smiled for one of the first times in my life. I knew that I was going to be ok now. That life was going to be enjoyable and easy , unlike before. I was happy.\n\" Oh my! You're awake. Would you like some milk ? \" , cried the old woman. \nI purred heartily , as cats cannot vocally communicate with humans. She fetched some milk from the fridge and put it in an orange saucer for me. When I saw this I purred in ecstasy. It wasn't long until I had gulped it all down. In an instant the milk replenished my strength. \n\" Now you get some rest my dear.\"\nI tried to do as she instructed but I was simply too overwhelmed by this new home I was in. The old woman saw this and offered me some more milk. Me being me, I was not going to decline the generous offer so I purred to show that I wanted the milk. After I had finished the meal , the woman proceeded to tell me about her life and how she used to have a husband but he was now in heaven with the rest of her family. Her children were the other side of the Earth and she didn't have any friends who were alive. I put my paw on her lap as a means of sympathy , as I too know what it feels to lose a loved one. She stroked my fur back and forth. I'll never forget what she said after all this. The words which she said next brought tears to my little green eyes.\n\" At least I've got you to keep me company now Tiddles.\"\n\nShe had named me Tiddles . It has been exactly  a year since I met the  old woman ( who's name I learnt was Agatha). Since then life has been great . I have no worries anymore and don't have to fight to earn my meal. Six months ago I met a beautiful stray cat named Leyla who I am now married to. Even better, Agatha let Leyla live with us so I get to see my sweetheart every second of every day. A month ago we had a kitten who Agatha named for us. She named the kitten Grace. I could not believe it ; Grace was my mother's name.
