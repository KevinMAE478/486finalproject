Halfway to the door he stumbles over and lies still. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So...Everyone in here is an alien, right?&amp;quot; the barman asks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several yeps can be heard, and the faces all nod. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cool.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/Periapoapsis\"&gt;/r/Periapoapsis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgbj7o8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492337548.0, "created_utc": 1492308748.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 124}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mi3g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mi3g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mi3g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc5e3z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nikolaijune", "parent_id": "t1_dgc1ftt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Haha, make sure you wrap it right \ud83d\ude1c", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haha, make sure you wrap it right \ud83d\ude1c&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgc5e3z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492385309.0, "created_utc": 1492356509.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mi3g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd0hhh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LeaveTheMatrix", "parent_id": "t1_dgc1ftt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm tempted to make a tin foil hat that has been dipped in ecstasy and force someone to wear it.

He had a certain charisma that garnered himself a vast following of fanatical supporters, and I was eager to discover his secrets.\n\nWe met at his office and he greeted me. The mayor had pale skin and looked rather sickly, but he had an energy about him that seemed to dispute that thought.\n\nThe meeting went smoothly enough, but he seemed to divert all my tough questions, which pricked my interest.\n\nOnce our meeting adjourned he politely guided me to the door. I discretely placed a covert camera on a shelf facing his desk when he turned his back for a moment. Then thanked him for his time and left.\n\nI knew there was something strange going on here, it became more and more apparent as I left his office. Everyone I ran into had the same ghostly pallor as the mayor, and my suspicions grew.\n\nAs I walked back to my car I saw the homeless man again. He waved me towards him. I hesitated but strode over to him.\n\n\"Aliens! There are aliens hiding among us regular folks, and I can prove it!\" He shouted frantically, waving his hands in the air wildly.\n\nHe shuffled through his cart, tossing his few earthly possessions around as he searched for something.\n\nHe finally seemed to find what he wanted because he grabbed a well-used box of tinfoil and ripped it open.\n\nHe started unrolling it onto the street and tore off several large strips.\n\n\"Put this on! You will see! You will see!\" He was shouting louder now and had attracted the attention of a few onlookers.\n\nI was embarrassed, and I wasn't going to humour him, but I saw the look of pure panic cross the eyes of the pale onlookers and let the man wrap tin foil around my head.\n\nAt first, I didn't notice anything different, but then, as I looked around, I could see them. Truly see the sickly looking people around me. They were not human. They looked like nothing I had ever seen before.\n\nAs the man wrapped more and more foil on my head, I saw more and more clearly that everyone, aside from this man and myself, were aliens. \n\nI let out a scream. The onlookers looked angry now and started drawing closer.\n\nI didn't think, I just ran towards my car. I struggled at first, in my panic, to open the car door, but I opened it and got inside just as a few aliens ran into my car. \n\nThey snarled at me. I quickly locked and started my car before speeding off. It wasn't until I was back in my city an hour away that I removed the makeshift hat and left it in my car. I didn't want to freak out my girlfriend. \n\nWhen I got home, the first thing I did was check the footage from the covert camera I had hidden in the mayor's office.\n\nMy girlfriend Angela was already asleep, so I was careful not to be too loud.\n\nI needed some kind of irrefutable proof if I was going to take this story to anyone. I watched the footage well into the night.\n\nThe first few hours were pretty normal, but by morning I had found footage of the mayor moulting his skin. \n\n\"If this isn't proof, I don't know what is!\" I thought to myself.\n\nI saved the video onto a thumb drive and raced out the door. I was going straight to the FBI with this. They needed to know what was going on.\n\nAs I left my car, I hesitated before deciding on bringing the foil hat. Yes, it was ridiculous, but it seemed to somehow work to let me see them.\n\n\"I need to speak with someone!\" I was frantic, but the receptionist calmly directed me to an office, wordlessly. I thought it was strange, but I was too caught up in my racing thoughts to give it too much thought.\n\nThe office was dark. Lit with only a single lamp in a corner. I didn't see anyone at first but then saw a man sitting behind a stately desk in a dark corner of the room.\n\n\"I understand you needed to speak to someone.\" He said matter-of-factly.\n\n\"Yes, sir you have to see this footage. I think it speaks for itself that aliens have taken over the town of Milton.\" I tried to remain level-headed and calm, but my nerves somewhat betrayed me.\n\n\"Give it here.\" \n\nI passed the thumb drive to the man and watched as his face was lit up by the screen of his computer. He remained expressionless as he watched the footage.\n\n\"It seems, sir, that you have merely come across some high quality doctored footage. There is no such thing as aliens. Thank you for your time.\"\n\n\"No, wait! I can prove it! With this hat, please, I am not crazy!\" I snatched up the aluminium hat.\n\n\"I know this sounds crazy, but if you put the foil on your head like this-\" I paused to jam the foil around my head before looking back to him.\n\nI screamed. \n\nThere sitting before me was another one of them. \n\n\"Yo-you're one of them! You're an alien!\" I squeaked out.\n\n\"There is no such thing as aliens. Thank you for your time.\" He sounded irritated this time.\n\nI quickly approached his desk, snatched my drive, and then bolted from the room in a matter of seconds. \n\nIn the building lobby, I cried out as everyone there was one of them, they were all aliens, every single one.\n\nTears flooded my cheeks. I was panic stricken as I raced into the streets. Everywhere I looked, all I saw were aliens where people had once stood. \n\nI collapsed in the streets. I felt so alone. I could feel swarms of them begin to surround me. I was finished.\n\n---\n\nI woke up screaming in my bed. My girlfriend sat beside me, holding my face with a concerned expression on her face. \n\n\"Honey are you ok?! You were having a bad dream, you were screaming!\" \n\nI lay still for a moment and focused on my breathing. \n\nI sat up and, after reassuring my girlfriend I was fine, went to the kitchen for a glass of water. \n\nThe dream haunted me. It had felt so real. I saw a box of tin foil in a half opened drawer in the kitchen. Without thinking I pulled some out and stared at it for some time. \n\nI found my hands begin to wrap it around my head. I laughed to myself as I did it. It was only a dream, right?\n\nI walked back into the bedroom giggling like an idiot.\n\n\"Angie, in my dream everyone was an alien and this hat let me see-\" \n\nIt wasn't my Angela in our bed. I froze. \n\n\"What is it honey?\" snarled the beast in front of me.\n\n\"No...\" I backed out of the room and raced out of my apartment and into the streets. \n\nIt wasn't a dream.\n\nEverywhere I looked were these disgusting creatures. These aliens had taken over everything. Everyone I knew and loved. Everyone and everything is theirs now.

We just need to pull off the facade long enough to get the data.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I suppose you&amp;#39;re right&amp;quot; the One said, passively, &amp;quot;I kind of pity him though. He knows so much, but at the same time he knows so little. It only drives him to go further and further in his thirst for truth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But didn&amp;#39;t you just want to murder him?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know anymore. Maybe it was part of the facade, maybe it was my irrational morning attitude, which that itself could be part of the facade.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Maybe you need to take it easy until we get called back. You&amp;#39;re over analyzing this whole operation. Just pretend to be a human for a little longer, then we can go home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right, I need to take it easy. Although we do need something to eat, would you mind heading to the market and getting some bread for us?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nah I can&amp;#39;t. The Lord had my legs chopped off because I accidentally kicked a pebble at his daughter. I had to crawl back home. You couldn&amp;#39;t tell my f###ing legs were gone?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thought that was part of your monthly. I guess I&amp;#39;ll be heading off to the store then, anything you need?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No thank you, I&amp;#39;m good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I guess I&amp;#39;ll be of-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;F###ING GO TO THE STORE ALREADY STOP DRAGGING THIS ON LIKE A MEDIOCR-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The door slammed and rang.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Barely dawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The village was empty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was a farmer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;EYE DEW SEIH WOT DO WE HAEV HEYARH SUM KEYND UFF FOOKEN AY-LEE-EHN SPOOKEHN UHP DE VILLAGE NOW DEW WEEH????&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fool of the town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one that would ring his bell and warn the others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one that would repeat the same mantra at the crack of dawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have time for your games, peasant. Now, anyway, I would like three sticks of bread and a fig to with it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I AYM NAWT GOAYING TO ASS-OAH-SEE-ATE WETH SUM FOOKEN ALIEN NOW AYM EYE GOAYING TO PROT-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Give me the DAMN BREAD YOU MOR-&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man front of the shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was not a man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a beast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But an alien.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His jaws opened where he could fit the whole village into. Black tentacles came from where his eye sockets cracked. His arms extended, darkened, sharpened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fool was right. The aliens had to be triggered into an extensive rage in order for him to be right. His distressful face turned into a smirk. He grasped the shaft of something he had been hiding in his pants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BAM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It went off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The monster front of the stand closed his jaws and relaxed his face, at least what was left of it. A white aura glowed on his temple. This is where it shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You think your kind has the wit to stand against &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;? I&amp;#39;ve been watching you: How you talk, how you act, even where you hide your stuff. I found this neat little gadget after sneaking in your arms base. You must be thinking this is a dream, I can sense it. But it&amp;#39;s not, Dreden, I can assure you that.
