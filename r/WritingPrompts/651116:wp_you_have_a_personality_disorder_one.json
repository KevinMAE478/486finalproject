I'm glad you could make it for our session today. I hear your people found another victim today\n\nCyrus: We did, Doctor Bloor. Eighth one.\n\n*The Doctor nods sympathetically, waiting for him to go on*\n\n Cyrus: You know, it's funny how people love to talk about how the Canton Belladonna was never caught. In the past tense, like she's already a legend\n\nDoctor: Yes, I've noticed the papers doing that.\n\nCyrus: And I'm sure, Doctor, that you can understand the Belladonna's appeal. I was drawn to her from the start; the simplicity of her poison and the romance of her displays. I can't tell you what it meant to me, being assigned to this case.\n\nDoctor: Yes, that was... five years ago now?\n\nCyrus: Yeah, just about. For those first few years, I studied the Belladonna's patterns. After a while I felt like I understood what she was trying to say with it; the pale yellow petals weaving through protruding ribcages. She did it lovingly, I think. Made her victims beautiful, in her mind\n\nDoctor: You could empathize with her.\n\nCyrus: Well no, I could... detach myself from my own disgust, I guess. I could settle into her skin and see her next move every time I closed my eyes. I felt so close to finding her.\n\nDoctor: Does it affect your pride, still searching for her today?\n\nCyrus: That's the thing, Doctor Bloor. I did find her. Two years ago.\n\n*Doctor Bloor puts down her pen, slowly*\n\nCyrus: I shot her in her own greenhouse, three years into my investigation and seconds before she could kill her next victim. It was neat and quick. Between the eyes. *mimes the action*\n\nCyrus: *Getting frustrated*, But it didn't make sense, you know? The Belladonna I knew, the one who had taken up permanent residence in my mind, that thing couldn't be her. The thing in front of me was like a... like a paperweight. Earthbound. I could feel the real Belladonna tugging at the back of my mind, begging to finish the job. And so I sat back, and I let her.\n\n*For a moment, the doctor lets the silence hang*\n\nDoctor: Did you watch?\n\nCyrus: Yes. Well, not the first time. But we trust each other now. She knows it's my mind, originally, so she lets me watch now\n\nDoctor: *nodding, regaining composure*, That's interesting. It's a common misconception that amnesia goes hand in hand with dissociative identity disorder.\n\nCyrus: *laughs with amusement*. Is that what this is? My roommate situation? Shouldn't I be forgetting where I am or fighting for dominance or something?\n\nDoctor: Well, DID isn't my specialization, but personalities can work together. I'd say that's what you're experiencing\n\nCyrus: *smiling, seemingly unfazed by the diagnosis*, Yeah, it's not your specialization, that's true. I know all about your specialization. I've read your work on criminal psychopathology. You had a different diagnosis for the Canton Belladonna, didn't you? Does it affect your pride, knowing that you missed something this big?\n\nDoctor: What did you do with her body, Cyrus?\n\nCyrus: *Under his breath*, Thing like this wouldn't be good for your book sales\n\nDoctor: Cyrus\n\nCyrus: I didn't touch it. Bella took care of it. She doesn't want me getting my hands dirty, even though we're on the same team now.\n\nDoctor: * calming herself once more*, Well, Cyrus, we are on the same team as well. You want to keep Bella safe  -\n\nCyrus: And you want people to buy your books.\n\nDoctor: I'm sure we can all come to an agreement\n\nCyrus: *Shrugs*, you'll find I have a pretty accommodating personality.
