She pressed a button on her app, and he started break dancing. \u201cHe was supposed to fight the other androids and save Julia when things escalated between the others. \n\n\u201cHow many androids did you throw into this?\u201d asked Harvey. \n\nA Ninian 3000 emerged shyly from the bathroom hallway. \n\n\u201cWell our masters,\u201d said Ninian. \u201cKind of rented out close to a hundred androids from Elihu\u2019s today.\u201d \n\nHarvey\u2019s jaw dropped. \n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d asked Harvey. \u201cHow did you *pay* for all of that.\u201d \n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Julia. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a *fetish* this was a very thought out, intricate plot where a big fight breaks out, Shamus saves me, there\u2019s a dramatic pause, Shamus kisses my cheek, he feels ashamed and-\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then *I* come in,\u201d said Harvey 1. \n\nHarvey\u2019s jaw dropped even further. \n\n\u201cYou made,\u201d said Harvey. \u201cAnd android version of *me*?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s *complicated*,\u201d said Julia. \n\n\u201cWell try me,\u201d said Harvey. \n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Julia, she let out a sigh. \u201cSo *android you* fights them all off, and then a whole bunch of androids one by one come over and try to hit on me and you kill them all at Cindy\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nAnother android tip-toed out from the hallway. And then another. And then a few dozen others. \n\nHarvey looked outside the mall, and about fifty other androids trickled out from the walls and waved hi at master Harvey. \n\nHarvey breathed in, then let out a staggered breath. \n\n\u201cOkay?\u201d said Harvey. \n\n\u201cAnd *then*,\u201d said Julia. She scrolled through her notes. \u201cYou recite this speech of your undying love for me.\u201d \n\nHarvey looked baffled. \n\n\u201cI could\u2019ve totally done this,\u201d said Harvey. \n\nAn android from the hallway walked up to Harvey. He put his hand on Harvey\u2019s back. His arm made robotic noises as he did so. \n\n\u201cYou *could* have,\u201d said Vladimir 1200, with a Russian accent. \u201cBut master Julia says you were so busy playing Modern Warfare Mars that you didn\u2019t listen to her for a week.\u201d \n\nVladimir 1200 walked back away from them. Harvey pointed at him. \n\n\u201cIs that an android of that Russian President from way back?\u201d said Harvey. \n\n\u201cYup,\u201d said Julia. \u201cThink so. So yeah,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve just, I don\u2019t know I\u2019ve missed you. You\u2019re addicted to-\u201d\n\nAn android Obama sprinted from the side hall, and grabbed the bag of games. \n\u201cUhhhh you know,\u201d said Obama 3000, chucking the games at the wall. \u201cI think, your relationship would do *far better*,\u201d he made some robotic movements, and pointed at Harvey with his thumbs. \u201cif you put down the controller, and picked up your wife from time to time.\u201d \n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d whispered Harvey. He pointed at his heart. \u201cThat hits *here.* I\u2019m sorry babe.\u201d \n\nJulia smiled, and many of the androids gathered around them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry *too*, let\u2019s go out tonight,\u201d said Julia. She hugged him tight, and squeezed her cheek against his cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve *missed* you.\u201d \n\nThe androids all around let out a collective \u2018awwwwww\u2019 and smiled at real love. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way to make this work,\u201d said Julia.
