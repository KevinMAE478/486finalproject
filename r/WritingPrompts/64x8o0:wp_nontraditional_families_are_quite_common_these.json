But, I saw it coming. Pestilence spent most of his time in China and America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Famine?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;West Africa.&amp;quot; Again, not surprised, but I was thinking he&amp;#39;d be more south.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Death?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shopping.&amp;quot; Well that was new.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quickly sat down, eating my breakfast. &amp;quot;Wait, but then that means...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could feel the smile on War&amp;#39;s face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godammit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quickly jumped out the car onto the curb. &amp;quot;Okaybye!&amp;quot; I quickly shut the door, but War&amp;#39;s strong arms stopped it from fully closing. I had roughly 1 or 2 minutes before someone would come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Remember, kid, knock &amp;#39;em dead, alright?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded. &amp;quot;Sure thing!&amp;quot; 45 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You got Sports Club today, right? Pick you up at 3?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uh...3:30.&amp;quot; I stammered out. &lt;em&gt;Dammit just leave before people see me!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hmm...you think you can wait &amp;#39;til 4?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quickly nodded. &lt;em&gt;Is this guy wanting to be seen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He stared at me for a few seconds. &amp;quot;Well? You gonna leave or what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thought raced through my head so fast I didn&amp;#39;t anticipate it. I quickly slammed the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wheeling around, there were about 5 or 6 people staring at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quickly eyed them up, calculating the damage to my reputation it would give me.  Booth Collins, Smash Club, not much damage. Linda Ho, Book Club, would probably need to buy a book in exchange for silence. if A couple drama kids, nothing a Pepsi wouldn&amp;#39;t fix, and... oh god. Jenny Marshall. I&amp;#39;ve had a crush on her for years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I swear, I can explain...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t think you can explain a 7&amp;#39; man in armor driving you to school easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg6weyb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492074789.0, "created_utc": 1492045989.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
