Hallucinations at night - or just nightmares - made much more sense than a dedicated terror campaign. Perhaps it was sleep paralysis, perhaps it was just eating too much too late, it didn't really matter.\n\nOf course, that didn't mean they stopped. It just meant I ceased caring. The voices were ignored, weird shapes assumed to be tricks of the eyes, odd feelings nothing more than the blankets shifting. After some time, the weird visions at night started to subside.\n\nWhen I moved off to college, it stopped entirely. Not exactly what I had expected, but welcome nonetheless.

In any case, it made sleeping easier than I had expected for a new lodging.\n\nA week later, I broke up with my boyfriend. \n\nIt was never going to work out. Long-distance relationships were incredibly difficult to keep going. Carl and I were too different as people. We just didn't have enough time, thanks to classes.\n\nAll things I told myself. Nothing more than meagre attempts at consolation, completely useless in the end. It wasn't just another step in my life, it was an ordeal, a heartbreak. \n\nI hardly slept for a week.\n\nMy school was a large on, the classes packed with hundreds or thousands of students. Nobody cared about me, and it drove me deeper into some kind of depression. \n\nThat was when I met Brian.\n\nI suppose 'met' is a poor word to use. Encounter, perhaps, would fit better; it was at two in the morning that I saw him, standing in the middle of my room, looking somewhat forlorn. He would have terrified me, were he human; instead, the creature was more an amalgamation of what I supposed the horrors of my childhood nights would have looked like. \n\nOdd, of course, for a creature so horrible to not induce fear in any way. But my childhood 'training' had made me rather apathetic to visions at night, and so I just accepted it.\n\n\"Hello,\" said Brian, when I was staring at him for the first time. \n\n\"Hello,\" I had said in response.\n\nIs it sad to say we talked - me and the hallucination? We spoke for two hours exactly. Two to four in the morning, a discussion filled with inane subjects, nothing important and yet everything interesting in some way. \n\nWe met again, every night that week, at exactly two hours past midnight. Philosophy was the main discussion point, but it branched out into current events (with which Brian was not familiar whatsoever) and, eventually, all manner of other interests.\n\nHeartbreak might not stop hurting, but at one point, I had to stop losing sleep over it. And so I did, in some short order. \n\nI didn't see Brian again for quite a while.\n\nOne morning, I awoke to find a note on the floor. It lay in such a way that it appeared to have been slid out from underneath my closet door. Upon a closer look, I found that it had my name written in a scrawled manner across the back.\n\nOn the other side, I found a rather erratic letter.\n\n*My dear,*\n\n*I miss you. Can we attempt a relationship once more? We worked well together! Please respond at your latest convenience.*\n\n*With much love,*\n\n*Carl.*\n\nSeeing his name again was... a shock. I'd managed to put him out of my mind, stop thinking about him almost entirely, but something still wrenched inside of me.\n\nIt wasn't from him, though. I doubted my highschool boyfriend was hiding inside my closet. It was a stalker, perhaps - or another hallucination.\n\nThat night, I struggled to fall asleep. One question kept rebounding in my head, centred around the note that I had tucked away in a drawer. Was I going insane?\n\nSomehow, I convinced myself to try. Some last desperate attempt to reignite a passion that was no doubt much less amazing than I remembered it.\n\nI wrote a note, and slipped it under the closet.\n\nMy reply came the following morning.\n\n*I was lying. I don't love you. I only tolerated you when we dated. I resent you for the waste of time.*\n\n*Carl.*\n\nNo sleep came that night.\n\nFor the first time in weeks, I saw Brian again, and we talked once more. \n\nMaybe I was crazy, but I felt happy to have that conversation, and he seemed somewhat relieved himself.\n\n^^^more ^^^stories ^^^on ^^^r/forricide", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I was always terrified of the monsters under my bed.

Whoever had left this had really been trying to impress her - it was handwritten, with what seemed like nervous, shaky fingers, on clearly expensive stationary with little red hearts across the top, and sealed up in an envelope with a nice little monogrammed \"H\" sticker sealing it.  It was even sprayed with cologne.\n\nUnfortunately, the cologne smelled like rotten socks, the H sticker had caught some violently purple fur beneath it, the shaky hand had also included what she suspected, from the slight lacerations in the paper, to be clawed fingers, and rather than being stuck under her dorm room door, it had been lovingly slid... under the closet's sliding panel.\n\nThe very first thing she'd done had been to strip the closet bare.  Her clothes, coats, shoes, and storage bins now rested in a pile under the window.  She'd spoken to the RA about keys, but nobody had checked out the spares for her room and her RA swore that nobody had been in here.  Certainly, nobody with purple hair or smelling like moldy laundry.  Sandra had no roommate, and few friends - certainly nobody who would play this kind of prank.  She lived on the fourth floor, so she doubted someone had used the window.  Nothing else in the room had been disturbed.\n\nThe only thing she'd found to make her pause, to keep her from going straight to campus police to complain of a break-in, was a tiny - infinitesimal - minuscule - patch of purple and yellow fur stuck to a loose nail in the back corner of the closet floor.\n\nSo she sat on her bed and stared at the letter.\n\nMonsters in the closet?  She didn't think she'd ever believed in them.  She hadn't been what you'd call an overly imaginative child.  Sandra preferred history to fantasy; science kits and digging toys to fairies and princesses.  She'd take police procedurals over Disney movies.  She'd always colored precisely within the lines and in realistic colors.  Her Lego towers were architecturally sound.  So logically, this was probably a cruel joke played on her by some frat.  Perhaps the student in charge of checking the keys out was complicit.  She really should complain, make a big noise, get the student support groups involved.  Someone breaking into girl's dorm rooms was a big deal.\n\nOn the other hand...\n\nShe'd been single for almost four years now...\n\nShe's always told herself, after Jack dumped her, that she was too broken to deserve love.  That she was boring and dull and had too many problems.  That anyone that got to know her at all would be put off by her issues.\n\nWell, anyone who lived in her closet for any length of time had to know her fairly well.  They'd seen her attempts at knitting, the way she snored and farted in her sleep, seen how she watched the same episodes of law and order over and over.  They'd heard her fights over the phone with her mother, knew she cut herself when her depression flared up, and experienced the nights when loneliness and anxiety left her crying until it was time to leave for her morning classes.  If they'd seen and heard all that, and still called her kind, and smart, and beautiful...\n\nThe note was sweet, if you ignored the \"watching you from your closet\" creepiness, and Hairy had clearly made an effort.  She understood anxiety and how hard it was to face rejection. She could hardly comprehend how that must factor in when you were covered in purple hair and smelled like feet, and - especially and - weren't human.  How did you meet people in person if you're afraid of getting punched or shot just for saying hi?  Maybe, in that situation, you could forgive a note, and a less than perfect invitation.\n\nSandra closed the closet door, and decided to stay home.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think you know I exist.

I didn't write the note, but I should have.  *How could I not have known I was gay?*\n\n\"Yea,\" I lie on purpose for the first time in our long bestie history.  Would she believe that some closet fairy pushed me out with a glitter bomb on a Valentine?  Maybe it was my roommate. Maybe it was my RA or someone who has a girl on girl crush on me.  *Girl on girl crush, wow!*  I begin to fantasize about what a Valentine's Day would be like with a girl.  I'd dress like normal, or maybe a fancier version, and she'd dress like, well, like Kara.

I take off the navy dress and look for black slacks.  I'm kinda excited about the social now.  Maybe I'll find my secret admirer there.  Maybe I'll make eye contact with a lady who likes me.

Or, we do but the she gets a regular date.  Tonight I think it's Marcus.  She has guys asking her out all the time.  Not me.  But I don't really mind it.  Dating's weird and I'm not really interested in any of the guys here.  I thought I might meet someone I liked, but, meh.  So our standing date is usually us chatting while she gets dressed up and I say how lame the holiday is.  Marcus is picking up Kara at 8, so that means we can chat from like 6 on.  I might even \"meet\" him.  She likes to do that: introduce me to all her guys while we're on Facetime.  I think she likes to show off.  I think it's kinda funny.  *What does she see in this guy?*  When I meet the guy she's going out with I can't imagine what she likes about him.  *He's just a guy.  Nothing special* \n\nI call Kara because of course I call her.  I don't mind it.  I know she loves me and we'll always be there for each other.  She knows I'm calling because we just texted.  \"Heya Babes!\" she squeals in her super happyexcitedfabulous way that is only hers and hers alone.  Sometimes, if I think about it, it's weird how we're actually even friends.  She's like a cheerleader, sorta, and I'm kinda a loner.  All right, I am a loner, but at least I shower and stuff.  I just don't care about the stuff other people seem to care about as much.  \n\n\"Hey.\" I growl.  This is part of the routine.  I pretend to not care and she pretends this is the last first date for the rest of her life.  *What guy wants a first date on Valentine's Day?*, I wonder.  *Weirdo.* \n\n\"So, Marcus is like picking me up at 8 and he says he's taking me to a totally fabulous restaurant with like fancy candles and everything!\" She squeals and I feel my blood rush.  She was never actually a cheerleader, but her enthusiasm has always been contagious.  If Kara likes it, then I like it too.  I smile at her.  \n\n\"I'm gonna set my phone here so you can see me.  I'm gonna try on some dresses and I want you to let me know what you think.\"  She leans the phone and fidgets until it is angled at her closet.  She stands and adjusts the phone again until I can clearly see her entire body in the doorway of her closet.  She turns around, flipping her gorgeous honey-colored locks around her shoulder and then looks back again.  Suddenly her eyes are smoldering and my breath stops.  *Damn, Kara.*  \n\n\"Heya, handsome.\" She says in a slightly deeper but still peppy voice.  \n\nI laugh, \"Hey,\" I return in my best approximation of what some random dude might say.  I haven't met Marcus yet.  Maybe he has a squeaky voice like some guys do.  \n\n\"Ohmygosh!  You should totally how off outfits too!\"  Her face fills the screen and her perfect mocha colored eyes light up her face.  She smiles and looks at me expectantly.  \"I can help you get ready and you can go to that social or whatever.  Maybe you'll meet someone there tonight!\"  She begins clapping her hands and shaking her shoulders and head in a fake sexy dance.  I laugh and copy her moves.  \n\nI don't want to dress up, but I also don't want her to feel sorry for me about not having a date.  She knows I don't care, but she cares, so I kinda care about that.  \"Okay,\" I shrug.  She changes and I adjust my phone so it is angled at my closet.  We both begin to sort through our closets. \n\nKara tells me about her day.  She has a really boring professor who doesn't seem to know how to teach.  She goes to a community college in LA and takes almost all acting classes.  This professor teaches a basic English class.  He treats everyone like they're stupid.  It bums her out, but she met Marcus in that class so it's turned out okay.  When it's my turn to share I tell her about how I've eaten waffles every day this week for breakfast AND dinner because it is seriously the only good thing in the cafeteria.  She gives me a look when I say that.  Kara eats mostly salads.  She doesn't try to change me, but I know she wishes I were healthier.  I love her for that.  \n\n\"So, this is outfit number one.\"  She stands straight and looks directly at me.  She is wearing a low cut red dress that flares out at the waste.  I don't know much about style, but I think she looks beautiful.  My breath stops for a minute.  I know that soon Kara will be famous with looks like this and so much talent.  \n\n\"You are so fucking gorgeous,\" I choke out when I can speak.\n\nShe giggles and flips her hair. \"Oh, you are too funny!  So, I was thinking I'd curl my hair into ringlet with this and wear like a little pearl necklace. What do you think?\"  \n\nI pause for a moment.  \"Uhhhh.\"  I'm standing off camera because I'm shy.  She's seen me naked too many times to count now, but rarely has she seen me in a dress.  This one is a bit too tight for me, but it's the only dress I own.  My mom sent it to me for my birthday.  \n\n\"Hey, silly, come show me what you're wearing!\"  I peak my head out and slowly move into frame.  \"My dress is simple.  It's all navy and has no sleeves.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're so pretty!\" She gushes, then laughs.  My cheeks turn red.  I turn around and pretend to be busy closing the closet door.  \n\n\"So, should I wear this or?\"  She holds up another dress.  This one is strapless and super short.  It's white with little sailor things on it, like anchors and boats and seagulls.  I think it looks kinda lame, but I don't want her to feel sad.  \n\n\"I want to see what that one looks like on you before I reach a judgment.\"  I'm sitting again, not sure if she wants me to try on more outfits. \n\n\"I'll change, but you have to tell me about the guys you think are cute now.  I haven't heard you talk about anyone lately.  Who's gonna be at this social thing?  Your RA?  You said he was kinda nice, right?  And he's older too, right?\"  She talks on as she pulls the red dress over her head and puts the white and blue one.  \n\n\"So...\"  She turns and I see that the cut actually suits her.  *Of course it does.  Everything makes Kara look fantastic.*  \"You look amaze-balls, baby.\"  I say it in my own voice instead of pretending to be Marcus or whatever.  She looks up at me and smiles.  Her eyes are kinda dreamy now.  \n\n\"Hey, what's that?\"  She points at me.  I look down at my chest.  *What?*  \"No, goof ball, what's THAT?\"  She gestures again and I turn around.  There's a bright and shiny, almost-neon pink heart on the floor partially sticking out of my closet door.  *How weird.*  ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a mushy sort of girl.&lt;/em&gt;  I&amp;#39;d say that every year.

I might even &amp;quot;meet&amp;quot; him.  She likes to do that: introduce me to all her guys while we&amp;#39;re on Facetime.  I think she likes to show off.  I think it&amp;#39;s kinda funny.  &lt;em&gt;What does she see in this guy?&lt;/em&gt;  When I meet the guy she&amp;#39;s going out with I can&amp;#39;t imagine what she likes about him.  &lt;em&gt;He&amp;#39;s just a guy.  Nothing special&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I call Kara because of course I call her.  I don&amp;#39;t mind it.  I know she loves me and we&amp;#39;ll always be there for each other.  She knows I&amp;#39;m calling because we just texted.  &amp;quot;Heya Babes!&amp;quot; she squeals in her super happyexcitedfabulous way that is only hers and hers alone.  Sometimes, if I think about it, it&amp;#39;s weird how we&amp;#39;re actually even friends.  She&amp;#39;s like a cheerleader, sorta, and I&amp;#39;m kinda a loner.  All right, I am a loner, but at least I shower and stuff.  I just don&amp;#39;t care about the stuff other people seem to care about as much.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey.&amp;quot; I growl.  This is part of the routine.  I pretend to not care and she pretends this is the last first date for the rest of her life.  &lt;em&gt;What guy wants a first date on Valentine&amp;#39;s Day?&lt;/em&gt;, I wonder.  &lt;em&gt;Weirdo.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, Marcus is like picking me up at 8 and he says he&amp;#39;s taking me to a totally fabulous restaurant with like fancy candles and everything!&amp;quot; She squeals and I feel my blood rush.  She was never actually a cheerleader, but her enthusiasm has always been contagious.  If Kara likes it, then I like it too.  I smile at her.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna set my phone here so you can see me.  I&amp;#39;m gonna try on some dresses and I want you to let me know what you think.&amp;quot;  She leans the phone and fidgets until it is angled at her closet.  She stands and adjusts the phone again until I can clearly see her entire body in the doorway of her closet.  She turns around, flipping her gorgeous honey-colored locks around her shoulder and then looks back again.  Suddenly her eyes are smoldering and my breath stops.  &lt;em&gt;Damn, Kara.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Heya, handsome.&amp;quot; She says in a slightly deeper but still peppy voice.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I laugh, &amp;quot;Hey,&amp;quot; I return in my best approximation of what some random dude might say.  I haven&amp;#39;t met Marcus yet.  Maybe he has a squeaky voice like some guys do.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ohmygosh!  You should totally how off outfits too!&amp;quot;  Her face fills the screen and her perfect mocha colored eyes light up her face.  She smiles and looks at me expectantly.  &amp;quot;I can help you get ready and you can go to that social or whatever.  Maybe you&amp;#39;ll meet someone there tonight!&amp;quot;  She begins clapping her hands and shaking her shoulders and head in a fake sexy dance.  I laugh and copy her moves.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to dress up, but I also don&amp;#39;t want her to feel sorry for me about not having a date.  She knows I don&amp;#39;t care, but she cares, so I kinda care about that.  &amp;quot;Okay,&amp;quot; I shrug.  She changes and I adjust my phone so it is angled at my closet.  We both begin to sort through our closets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kara tells me about her day.  She has a really boring professor who doesn&amp;#39;t seem to know how to teach.  She goes to a community college in LA and takes almost all acting classes.  This professor teaches a basic English class.  He treats everyone like they&amp;#39;re stupid.  It bums her out, but she met Marcus in that class so it&amp;#39;s turned out okay.  When it&amp;#39;s my turn to share I tell her about how I&amp;#39;ve eaten waffles every day this week for breakfast AND dinner because it is seriously the only good thing in the cafeteria.  She gives me a look when I say that.  Kara eats mostly salads.  She doesn&amp;#39;t try to change me, but I know she wishes I were healthier.  I love her for that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, this is outfit number one.&amp;quot;  She stands straight and looks directly at me.  She is wearing a low cut red dress that flares out at the waste.  I don&amp;#39;t know much about style, but I think she looks beautiful.  My breath stops for a minute.  I know that soon Kara will be famous with looks like this and so much talent.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You are so fucking gorgeous,&amp;quot; I choke out when I can speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She giggles and flips her hair. &amp;quot;Oh, you are too funny!  So, I was thinking I&amp;#39;d curl my hair into ringlet with this and wear like a little pearl necklace. What do you think?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pause for a moment.  &amp;quot;Uhhhh.&amp;quot;  I&amp;#39;m standing off camera because I&amp;#39;m shy.  She&amp;#39;s seen me naked too many times to count now, but rarely has she seen me in a dress.  This one is a bit too tight for me, but it&amp;#39;s the only dress I own.  My mom sent it to me for my birthday.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, silly, come show me what you&amp;#39;re wearing!&amp;quot;  I peak my head out and slowly move into frame.  &amp;quot;My dress is simple.  It&amp;#39;s all navy and has no sleeves.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, you&amp;#39;re so pretty!&amp;quot; She gushes, then laughs.  My cheeks turn red.  I turn around and pretend to be busy closing the closet door.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, should I wear this or?&amp;quot;  She holds up another dress.  This one is strapless and super short.  It&amp;#39;s white with little sailor things on it, like anchors and boats and seagulls.  I think it looks kinda lame, but I don&amp;#39;t want her to feel sad.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want to see what that one looks like on you before I reach a judgment.&amp;quot;  I&amp;#39;m sitting again, not sure if she wants me to try on more outfits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll change, but you have to tell me about the guys you think are cute now.  I haven&amp;#39;t heard you talk about anyone lately.  Who&amp;#39;s gonna be at this social thing?  Your RA?  You said he was kinda nice, right?  And he&amp;#39;s older too, right?&amp;quot;  She talks on as she pulls the red dress over her head and puts the white and blue one.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So...&amp;quot;  She turns and I see that the cut actually suits her.  &lt;em&gt;Of course it does.  Everything makes Kara look fantastic.&lt;/em&gt;  &amp;quot;You look amaze-balls, baby.&amp;quot;  I say it in my own voice instead of pretending to be Marcus or whatever.  She looks up at me and smiles.  Her eyes are kinda dreamy now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, what&amp;#39;s that?&amp;quot;  She points at me.  I look down at my chest.  &lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;  &amp;quot;No, goof ball, what&amp;#39;s THAT?&amp;quot;  She gestures again and I turn around.  There&amp;#39;s a bright and shiny, almost-neon pink heart on the floor partially sticking out of my closet door.  &lt;em&gt;How weird.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg59cek", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491989122.0, "created_utc": 1491960322.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64thcm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64thcm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5hzyy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "djsoren19", "parent_id": "t1_dg5c0pp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hell naw, to the naw naw naw.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hell naw, to the naw naw naw.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5hzyy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492002103.0, "created_utc": 1491973303.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5c0pp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "itsme_timd", "parent_id": "t3_64thcm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"I just need to get some rest.\", I thought to myself after an especially grueling day of classes.

You're such a muscular and athletic 20 year old. Your meat must taste delicious.\n\nAgain, I apologize how much awkwardness and discomfort you must feel from reading this, but I am well aware that human-monster relationships never turn out well for the human. I just wanted to get this off of my thorax because it has been bothering me for years.\n\nLove with all of my 4 hearts, \n\nThe Thing That Dwells In The Shadows\n\n\n\nAfter reading the letter, Peter sat down on the foot of his bed trying to process what he had just read.

Why the bells were even still connected up to anything was a mystery to the entire school. But at least this ringing meant I could breathe a sigh of relief for a while before any important homework was due.\n\nWith a burden lifted from my shoulders, I walked back to my dorm room where I was hoping to relax and waste away the evening playing Factorio. My life wasn't very interesting, and I didn't really know anyone on campus since this was my first semester.\n\nBut someone knew me. Before I had laid down on my bed for even a minute, I heard the familiar sound of paper rubbing across a hard surface. Someone must have left me a note. Probably this week's university-approved solicitation. I turned my head towards the door to see what had arrived, but the vinyl floor was bare, save for my own shoes.\n\nI put my laptop on the nightstand and stood up, thinking to myself that my shoes were blocking my view of whatever trash I had to now put in the recycling bin at the end of the hall.  Before I had even taken a step back towards the door, I saw the newly arrived document. It was a letter enclosed in a bright red envelope. And it had been delivered from under the closet door.\n\n*Great, the RA must be pranking me,* I thought to myself, walking over to the closet door. Opening the door revealed something that I already knew in the back of my mind, however. The closet wasn't deep enough for more than a textbook, and there were far too many shelves for even a ballerina to stuff themself inside.\n\nConfused, and very suspicious of how the delivery could have arrived, I picked up and examined the envelope. Other than the handwritten greeting, \"Hello, Dear,\" the envelope had no distinguishing features. But it clearly had more than paper inside, as something was sliding around and bulging the envelope.\n\nI stuck my finger under the flap, and tore open the envelope. A key slid out into my hand, and a letter came out with it. I read the letter:\n&gt;Dear Karen,\n&gt;\n&gt;You were made for more than a Liberal Arts degree. A lot more. You don't know me yet, but we must meet. Karen, I can show you a whole new world. If you want to meet me, use the enclosed key to unlock your door.\n&gt;I promise you, no one else can offer what I do.\n&gt;\n&gt;M\n\nOn the back lay a series of directions that started with \"Go through the door,\" gave lefts, rights, and straights, and finished with \"Fourth door on the left.\" As the key had no markings for what it belongs to, or even who made it, I thought very little of the letter for the time being.\n\nThe next morning I played with the key before class. Looking back at the closet, I realized it had a lock on it for some reason. So I tried inserting the key into the lock. It fit cleanly, and turned without much resistance. I opened the door, and nearly screamed.\n\nThe doorway no longer was a portal to my tiny closet, but it was now a quite literal portal to an endless, whitewashed hallway of seemingly identical doors. Since my classes couldn't be any less interesting than this, I grabbed the letter, pocketed the key, and, cautiously, walked through the doorway. The first direction was *Turn Left*. So I turned left, and walked down the hallway of doors. I followed the directions extremely carefully, as with each turn I became more fearful I would make a mistake and be lost forever. Eventually, I came to the final instruction.\n\nI walked up to the door and tried turned the handle. It wouldn't budge. I took the key out of my pocket, and inserted it into the door's lock. The door swung inward to reveal a blacked out room, with two dishes, a crystal water glass, and a handwritten note.\n\n&gt;I'm glad you made it. Now you've got a decision to make: will you take the blue pill in the left dish, and wake up from this dream, or take the red pill in the right dish, and see the rest of the world I want to show you?\n\nWell, if this was a dream, I would wake up anyways. And if it wasn't, I didn't want to pass up the opportunity. I approached the dishes and the door shut behind me. I cupped the red pill in my hand, doubting whether any of this was real.\n\nFed up with the nagging doubts, I plopped the pill in my mouth and downed it with some water. The lights came on in the room, and a movie-familiar face greeted me from the other side of the table.

Pain bringing tears to my eyes, I reached behind me and slammed my laptop lid down. In the sudden darkness, I panicked. Launching myself out of my seat, I stumbled across to the opposite wall, and fumbled blindly for the light switch. As the lights flickered on, I stood staring at my closet.\nI stared, and stared, and stared. I refused to move for over an hour, standing rooted to the spot, sweat and tears meeting on my chin.\n\nBut nothing happened.\nFinally overcoming shock, I took one step forward, bent over, and picked up what appeared to be a letter. Sliding into my pocket, I wrenched open my closet door, and flung my clothes aside as I fought to reach the back of it. After emptying it completely, I was faced with the fact that there was nothing hiding inside my closet. My hands shook as I reached for the letter. Unfolding it, the hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I forced myself to sit down, as my head spun. It read:\n\n       Dear Harvey,\nI don't really know how to say this, but I've been watching you since you arrived. I've watched you as you've cried yourself to sleep, convinced that no-one loves you. \nBut I do.\nSincerely, \nYour Friend.\n\nI didn't sleep a wink that night.\n\n\nReturning from class a week later, I fumbled with my key as I tried to enter my room. Dropping exhausted into my chair, I felt something amiss. My room was different in some way, I knew. My OCD has its advantages. I stood up, and gazed around my room. My bed was made, the bathroom door shut, the closet door... \nOpen.\nSuddenly, the lights went out. I took a step towards the closet, and tripped. I fell forward, and then... Kept falling.\nFor what seemed an eternity, I was falling into an unknown abyss. Abruptly, I stopped. I hadn't landed, I had merely stopped falling. I had materialised onto a hard surface, which proved to be wet rock, as I learnt when I tripped over my own feet attempting to walk forward. Unable to see, I became aware of something breathing behind me as I stood up. A heavy panting, it grew louder, as though someone were coming up behind me. I found myself unable to turn around, and began to shake as the thing behind me laid a clawed hand on my shoulder.\n\"Don't worry. I am Your Friend. We can spend all the time in the world together. You've finally found someone who loves you.\"\nMy voice quaking, I responded.\n\"Who are you?\"\nMy query was met with silence.\nSuddenly I understood.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everybody hates me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t walk to class without getting tripped and pushed over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t sit in class without someone callling me &amp;quot;nerd&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;weirdo&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t talk to a girl without her wrinkling her nose and giggling with her friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;#39;s me.

I refused to move for over an hour, standing rooted to the spot, sweat and tears meeting on my chin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But nothing happened.\nFinally overcoming shock, I took one step forward, bent over, and picked up what appeared to be a letter. Sliding into my pocket, I wrenched open my closet door, and flung my clothes aside as I fought to reach the back of it. After emptying it completely, I was faced with the fact that there was nothing hiding inside my closet. My hands shook as I reached for the letter. Unfolding it, the hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I forced myself to sit down, as my head spun. It read:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   Dear Harvey,\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really know how to say this, but I&amp;#39;ve been watching you since you arrived. I&amp;#39;ve watched you as you&amp;#39;ve cried yourself to sleep, convinced that no-one loves you. \nBut I do.\nSincerely, \nYour Friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t sleep a wink that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Returning from class a week later, I fumbled with my key as I tried to enter my room. Dropping exhausted into my chair, I felt something amiss. My room was different in some way, I knew. My OCD has its advantages. I stood up, and gazed around my room. My bed was made, the bathroom door shut, the closet door... \nOpen.\nSuddenly, the lights went out. I took a step towards the closet, and tripped. I fell forward, and then... Kept falling.\nFor what seemed an eternity, I was falling into an unknown abyss. Abruptly, I stopped. I hadn&amp;#39;t landed, I had merely stopped falling. I had materialised onto a hard surface, which proved to be wet rock, as I learnt when I tripped over my own feet attempting to walk forward. Unable to see, I became aware of something breathing behind me as I stood up. A heavy panting, it grew louder, as though someone were coming up behind me. I found myself unable to turn around, and began to shake as the thing behind me laid a clawed hand on my shoulder.\n&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry. I am Your Friend. We can spend all the time in the world together. You&amp;#39;ve finally found someone who loves you.&amp;quot;\nMy voice quaking, I responded.\n&amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot;\nMy query was met with silence.\nSuddenly I understood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5eh3n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491996171.0, "created_utc": 1491967371.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64thcm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5go0r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "austinape9", "parent_id": "t3_64thcm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's been one year, 5 months, 22 days and 4 hours since that car crash.

But that never stopped me from aiming high and daydreaming about Chad in my Ancient Literature class. \n\nI always tried to sit near him. He never noticed me but at least I could eavesdrop on their conversation. Him and his friend would always talk about their nights out partying. I tried going to parties before, but I always felt so ignored and invisible. Seeing all the other girls getting attention from boys made me so mad, or sometimes just really sad. Those girls even got more attention from other girls. Even if I went out with my friends, it wouldn't be long before I would slowly get pushed out of the conversation. Eventually I would always leave the group and just look at everyone else having fun without me at a distance.\n\nBut something like that would never happen to Chad. He would always be talking to someone, and everyone always wanted his company. Even in class everyone would always laugh at his jokes. Sometimes I felt bad though. He would sometimes make a joke that implied a character in the story was lame, or that the story itself was boring or dumb. Everyone would laugh, even the teacher, and I would join in, but I always felt bad about doing it. I always loved stories. It doesn't matter who you are, even if you are too scared to go on an adventure or too lame for an exciting love life you can still get amazing feelings from a great story.  Chad doesn't need stories for excitement though, he makes his own fun. \n\nOne day while I was doing homework I noticed a note by the closet. My closet would always make funny noises but when I would open it, nothing strange would be inside. So I would usually ignore my closet if anything weird happened around it. But this time, I decided to check. Maybe it was just cause I wanted to procrastinate my homework a little bit. When I checked the note it said \"I really like you, will you go on a date with me?\" I was basically 100% sure it as some kind of prank. I wrote underneath the question \"No way\". Even if it was real, anyone who wasn't Chad just wasn't worth it. It was the safer option anyway in case it really was a cruel prank. Then I realized the note really made no sense. Where was I supposed to leave it? How would the person who wrote it ever see my response? This was my third year so I didn't have a roommate. I decided to just drop the note where I found it. Some people in college are just really stupid and immature I thought.\n\nWhen I woke up the next day, I checked the note again. It had a reply on it. Honestly, I was a bit scared that someone managed to sneak into my room at night. The note had a new line that said \"Why not?\" and for some reason the stupidity of the question annoyed me so much that I forgot I was scared and I decided to write another reply \"I don't even know who you are. Of course I wouldn't want to meet up with someone I don't know at all!\" I put the note back down and ran to class. On my way I thought maybe it was a resident assistant (RA), a student who also kind of babysits people living in the dorm in exchange for free rent. This made me feel a lot less creeped out, since all the RA guys I've seen were kinda cute. When I came back from class I looked at the note again. It said \"I show myself then. Don't be scared please.\" The \"don't be scared\" part destroyed my fantasies of this being a hot RA boy. If his looks were anything like his handwriting, this was a really ugly guy. A part of me got really sad, my self esteem took a hit. Is this the only kind of guy that will ever like me? \n\nJust then I heard a knock. At first I thought it was my room door, but it turned out it was coming from the closet. I stood there confused until I heard the knock again. I got nervous and swallowed hard. After a few moments I grabbed a glass bottle on my desk and dialed 911 on my phone without calling it and opened the door. Inside was a tiny guy, I was a tiny girl so he was still about my height but super skinny. His posture was awful so I had to look down to see him, and he didn't really look human. He looked like Gollum from LOTR and wore scraps of cloth. \"M-... M-... My... My name is Charlie.\" It, or he I guess, stuck out his hand. I shook is hand with minimal contact because it was so ugly, kind of just grabbed his fingers which were way longer than a human's should be. I had no idea what to say. \"Y-, yo, your name is Irene?\" he said after an awkward silence. His voice sounded like a cross between barney the dinosaur and a high-pitched retard. Gross. I think because of my facial expression he shrunk away from me. This gave me the confidence to say \"Do you fucking live in my closet?\" and he replied \"Y- Yes... I, Charlie, I can hide in the shadows\" he suddenly got sucked in by the dark back of my closet and disappeared. Only to pop out and reappear a few moments later. \"What the fuck...\" I said under my breadth. After some awkward silence I said \"I have to do some homework...\" I left the closet door open from then on that weirdo thing stayed in the shadow. But I still wondered if I was being watched and decided to leave and study in the library instead. I asked my RA for a key and decided to lock my closet door at night. \n\nBut I still couldn't sleep. It was just too creepy. So I yelled \"Charlie, come out.\" I heard a knock at my closet door and heard some mumbling about how he couldn't open the door. I sighed and unlocked the closet. \"Charlie, make me a sandwish\" I said. He seemed to cheer up a bit and said \"Y- Yes!\" and enthusiastically made me a sandwish with a smile on his face. He knew just how I liked it too, I guess there are benefits to having a stalker. After forcing him to make me a sandwish I felt much safer. I told him \"you better not even look at me while I'm sleeping\". And he seemed a little proud as he said \"I would never do that!\" I closed the closet door 95% of the way leaving it just slightly ajar. I was really tired and fell right asleep. \n\nHe did all sorts of chores like laundry, dishes, cooking. Somehow having a weird monster as a slave boosted my self esteem. I decided to try my hand at makeup again. I always felt weird putting it on. My friends really weren't very helpful in giving me feedback. It felt like they were just patronizing me if they ever complimented me. Eventually I mustered up the courage to go to a party. A party I knew Chad would be at. I took a risk and drank more than I usually do. Chad still didn't notice me but I decided I was gonna make a move myself. I poured myself a huge drink and walked over to him and said \"Hey, you're in my class right?\" and he replied \"Huh? What class?\" he seemed a little drunk. \"Ancient Literature\"  I said. \"Oh right...\" he replied there was an awkward pause until I said \"Hey I don't think I can finish this drink, you want some?\" he smiled and said sure, and drank it pretty fast. He kept mentioning \"damn its pretty strong\" but kept drinking it anyway. He got really damn drunk and started finally talking to me. He talked about some movies he saw, some stories about when he was high, his favorite sports teams. I just nodded along and pretended what he said was interesting. I caught a few of his friends looking at us with a \"wtf?\" face but they ultimately left us alone. It was getting late and he tried to stumble his way toward his friends. I grabbed him and said \"Are you okay? You should just stay over my place its right across the street\". \"Woah that's close...\" he mumbled. I lied, my place was 3 blocks away. He complained and said something like \"Are we close yet?\" half way but I think he was too drunk to remember how close I told him it was. I got him inside and sat him on the bed. I got him some water, but also a beer. He drank both and eventually our eyes met and I started to make out with him. One thing led to another. I completely forgot Charlie might be watching. When I woke up Chad was gone. \n\nI walked to class with a smile on my face. I noticed Chad with his friend and walked up behind him. I was too nervous to say hi and instead eavesdropped. \"Yo you know that girl you were with at that party is in this class right?\" his friend said. \"What girl?\" Chad replied. \"Damn dude how drunk were you?\" said the friend. \"Ohhhh wait now I remember. Damn I wish I didn't. When I woke up the next day I was like holy shit this girl is ugly. Man I hope she doesn't try to talk to me in class.\" and his friend laughed a little and said \"Haha, I was wondering why you were talking to her man. We all were. I'm sure she'll get the hint if she tries to talk to you. What's she gonna do haha\". Chad chuckled with his friend. I distanced myself from them and made sure to arrive a bit after they did. I pretended like nothing happened. \n\nWhen I got to my room I started to cry. Charlie slowly peaked out of the closet. \"W- What happen?\" he murmured. I just started to cry even more and told him exactly what happened. \"I... Is... Is okay! Charlie love you!\" he said trying to console me. But it just made me feel even worse, I didn't even want something as gross as Charlie to know my name. I told him I wanted to be alone and he disappeared.\n\nThe next day during classes I found out there was a murder on campus. It was Chad. Chad had been stabbed 26 times in his room. The security cameras didn't catch anyone. When I got to my room I shut the door, started crying again and screamed \"YOU KILLED CHAD!\" Charlie popped out and I noticed how sharp the tips of his fingers were. \"He... he mean to you!\" retorted Charlie. And I yelled \"I RATHER GET BEAT UP BY CHAD THAN EVEN LOOK AT YOU!\" I found out whatever Charlie was could cry like a human as tears started pouring out of his eyes. He ran out and grabbed a knife from the kitchen and held it to his own throat. I said \"Do it, you fucking disgusting, retarded, piece of shit. But don't get my room dirty\". He disappeared and I never saw him again. \n\nFor more stories: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sharpWriting/", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have low self esteem. But that never stopped me from aiming high and daydreaming about Chad in my Ancient Literature class. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always tried to sit near him. He never noticed me but at least I could eavesdrop on their conversation. Him and his friend would always talk about their nights out partying. I tried going to parties before, but I always felt so ignored and invisible. Seeing all the other girls getting attention from boys made me so mad, or sometimes just really sad. Those girls even got more attention from other girls. Even if I went out with my friends, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be long before I would slowly get pushed out of the conversation. Eventually I would always leave the group and just look at everyone else having fun without me at a distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But something like that would never happen to Chad. He would always be talking to someone, and everyone always wanted his company. Even in class everyone would always laugh at his jokes. Sometimes I felt bad though. He would sometimes make a joke that implied a character in the story was lame, or that the story itself was boring or dumb. Everyone would laugh, even the teacher, and I would join in, but I always felt bad about doing it. I always loved stories. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter who you are, even if you are too scared to go on an adventure or too lame for an exciting love life you can still get amazing feelings from a great story.  Chad doesn&amp;#39;t need stories for excitement though, he makes his own fun. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day while I was doing homework I noticed a note by the closet. My closet would always make funny noises but when I would open it, nothing strange would be inside. So I would usually ignore my closet if anything weird happened around it. But this time, I decided to check. Maybe it was just cause I wanted to procrastinate my homework a little bit. When I checked the note it said &amp;quot;I really like you, will you go on a date with me?&amp;quot; I was basically 100% sure it as some kind of prank. I wrote underneath the question &amp;quot;No way&amp;quot;. Even if it was real, anyone who wasn&amp;#39;t Chad just wasn&amp;#39;t worth it. It was the safer option anyway in case it really was a cruel prank. Then I realized the note really made no sense. Where was I supposed to leave it? How would the person who wrote it ever see my response? This was my third year so I didn&amp;#39;t have a roommate. I decided to just drop the note where I found it. Some people in college are just really stupid and immature I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I woke up the next day, I checked the note again. It had a reply on it. Honestly, I was a bit scared that someone managed to sneak into my room at night. The note had a new line that said &amp;quot;Why not?&amp;quot; and for some reason the stupidity of the question annoyed me so much that I forgot I was scared and I decided to write another reply &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t even know who you are. Of course I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to meet up with someone I don&amp;#39;t know at all!&amp;quot; I put the note back down and ran to class. On my way I thought maybe it was a resident assistant (RA), a student who also kind of babysits people living in the dorm in exchange for free rent. This made me feel a lot less creeped out, since all the RA guys I&amp;#39;ve seen were kinda cute. When I came back from class I looked at the note again. It said &amp;quot;I show myself then. Don&amp;#39;t be scared please.&amp;quot; The &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t be scared&amp;quot; part destroyed my fantasies of this being a hot RA boy. If his looks were anything like his handwriting, this was a really ugly guy. A part of me got really sad, my self esteem took a hit. Is this the only kind of guy that will ever like me? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just then I heard a knock. At first I thought it was my room door, but it turned out it was coming from the closet. I stood there confused until I heard the knock again. I got nervous and swallowed hard. After a few moments I grabbed a glass bottle on my desk and dialed 911 on my phone without calling it and opened the door. Inside was a tiny guy, I was a tiny girl so he was still about my height but super skinny. His posture was awful so I had to look down to see him, and he didn&amp;#39;t really look human. He looked like Gollum from LOTR and wore scraps of cloth. &amp;quot;M-... M-... My... My name is Charlie.&amp;quot; It, or he I guess, stuck out his hand. I shook is hand with minimal contact because it was so ugly, kind of just grabbed his fingers which were way longer than a human&amp;#39;s should be. I had no idea what to say. &amp;quot;Y-, yo, your name is Irene?&amp;quot; he said after an awkward silence. His voice sounded like a cross between barney the dinosaur and a high-pitched retard. Gross. I think because of my facial expression he shrunk away from me. This gave me the confidence to say &amp;quot;Do you fucking live in my closet?&amp;quot; and he replied &amp;quot;Y- Yes... I, Charlie, I can hide in the shadows&amp;quot; he suddenly got sucked in by the dark back of my closet and disappeared. Only to pop out and reappear a few moments later. &amp;quot;What the fuck...&amp;quot; I said under my breadth. After some awkward silence I said &amp;quot;I have to do some homework...&amp;quot; I left the closet door open from then on that weirdo thing stayed in the shadow. But I still wondered if I was being watched and decided to leave and study in the library instead. I asked my RA for a key and decided to lock my closet door at night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I still couldn&amp;#39;t sleep. It was just too creepy. So I yelled &amp;quot;Charlie, come out.&amp;quot; I heard a knock at my closet door and heard some mumbling about how he couldn&amp;#39;t open the door. I sighed and unlocked the closet. &amp;quot;Charlie, make me a sandwish&amp;quot; I said.

Going outside was a thing to avoid unless you fancied coming back in wet, freezing, and losing fingers. \n\nWhen my roommate moved out and her replacement never came, I turned her side of our shared closet into storage space. Boxes that would be easy to move if anyone new moved in, but also boxes that were finally out of my fucking way. I barely ever even needed to open them. \n\nSaturday was a day for laziness and soup, I'd decided. Spring was coming and damn was I ready for it, the cold and I had never hung out alone quite this long. I took my morning shower and made some hot tea in hopes of offsetting the cold I knew was coming my way. \n\nSettling into my usual space in the futon, I queued next on \"My List\" on Netflix.

I was counting on Astrology, Chemistry and Anthropology to keep me safe while I did something potentially very stupid. \n\nI walked over, bent down, and picked up the letter. \n\nThe design was stunning, with an attention to detail I'd only ever met once before, on shrooms. The front lettering was gold and green, surrounded by some sort of braided floral system that bloomed into 2D flowers of different sized and variations. \n\n\"Welcome Back\" it read. \n\nFlipping it over I could feel the weight of it, there was actual parchment in here. It was sealed with a wax stamp, the impression of a sort of swirl pressed into it, the letters PRTL stamped into the bottom of the image. \n\nBreathing it open, praying I didn't tear it or ruin the seal, I sat down on the futon again.

Peter picked it up, now aware that he wasn't alone in the apartment. \n\n\"Karl? You better not be messing around again!\" Peter warned, perparing himself to open the closet door. He took a deep breath and opened the door as quickly as he could. There was a short Japanese girl sitting in the closet, giving Peter a look of utmost adoration. Not expecting the girl there, Peter yelled and stumbled backwards,  almost tripping on his Physics textbook.\n\n\"What the hell!? What are you doing in my closet!?\" Peter demanded uneasily. The girl stood up and got out. She could not have been more than 5 feet tall.\n\n\"I was waiting for you Peter.\" She said. \"I've been waiting for such a long time for you~\"\n\n\"How long were you in there?\" Peter asked.\n\n\"Oh around two hours.\" The girl said. \"I got to make sure I catch you.\"\n\n\"Who are you anyway?

He yelped and tripped on his textbook, landing on his bed.\n\n\"Let me make myself clear on one thing, Senpai.\" The crazy girl said. \"You are mine, forever and always. And you can't do anything about it.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah!? Try me!\" Peter said as he made his way to the window of his dorm.

You wanna come out?&amp;quot; I ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another note, a simple 8.5&amp;quot;x11&amp;quot; folded in half this time, slides out from inside the closet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, my sweet. Nothing would make me happier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Come on out whenever you&amp;#39;re ready,&amp;quot; I reply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walk over to the window and watch the few cars driving by in the fading dusk. A few moments later, the combined smells of ozone, hot iron and a bit of sulfur fill the room and then the closet doors creak open. I tense up and force myself to keep my eyes forward in spite of the demoness behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel a pair of clawed hands rest on my shoulders, and they begin to snake across my chest into a proper hug. The warmth radiating from Cinder is pleasant and relaxing, dispelling any remaining fear I might have had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mmmmmm, you feel so good&amp;quot; Cinder purrs as she hugs me to her a little tighter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5t6is", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492030104.0, "created_utc": 1492001304.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64thcm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5wna4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cha0tiqu3", "parent_id": "t3_64thcm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I notice the envelope when I get back from class.
