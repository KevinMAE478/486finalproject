Officially she was in charge of the house staff.  Unofficially she helped Kris through the PTSD episodes.\n\n\nThe elves stood around in a circle.  Their sad faces clashing emphatically with their ostentatious outfits of merriment.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, a thousand miles away in a city mall, Santa, the *real* Santa, called \u201cAnd who\u2019s next?\u201d\n\n\nThe line of excited children and bored parents slowly creeped forward underneath the finest quality Christmas tunes a hundred overhead speakers could render.\n\n\n\u201cOh me, ME!\u201d a small, cherub-eyed-boy wearing a Lego Batman hoodie came running up.  He jumped and landed squarely on Santa\u2019s knee with a giggle.\n\n\n\u201cHo ho ho, you are quite the bundle of energy.  And what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChristopher!\u201d the boy exclaimed.\n\n\n\u201cChristopher\u2026\u201d  Santa said distantly.  Memories threatened to overwhelm him.  He gave his head a firm shake, he had duties in the here and now.  \u201cAnd what would Christopher like this year?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWeeeeeeellll, I want Legos, and a bicycle, and a firetruck, but if it\u2019s not to much to ask, could you get something for my baby sister too?\u201d\n\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 Santa thought, don\u2019t say that.  Santa added, \u201cWhat would your sister like?\u201d\n\n\nBut it was too late.  The mall was gone.  \n\n\nKris, eight years old, face covered in dirt, stood in the empty shell of a house that had once been his childhood friend Christopher\u2019s home.  \n\n\n\u201cWe have to get out of here!\u201d Kris pleaded.\n\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d Christopher yelled back, \u201cMy sister is still in here somewhere.\u201d  Outside, loud grinding noises of gears scraping together heralded the imminent arrival of the Kubla Kraus\u2019 mechanized army.  \n\n\nA small whimper and cry came from the former living room.  \n\n\n\u201cChristopher, she\u2019s over there.  Please hurry!\u201d Kris pleaded.\n\n\nChristopher started furiously throwing debris out of the way while Kris kept watch for the robots.  \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got her hand, she\u2019s here!\u201d Christopher yelled.\n\n\nKris turned just in time to see the wall behind Christopher collapse outward.  From the swirling dust, one of the mechanized robots lurched forward arm outstretched and grabbed Christopher.  It shoved the boy boy down it\u2019s snapping metal jaws.  Kris ran to save himself.  One glance over his shoulder burned the image of Christopher\u2019s little sister\u2019s hand sticking out of the rubble, as the robot chewed its meal slowly.\n\n\nTears ran hot and fast down the adult Santa\u2019s face.  The child Christopher, framed in a fluorescent light glow, looked up, \u201cMr. Santa?  You\u2019re crying! Why?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHo ho ho,\u201d Santa said sadly, \u201cI\u2019m OK.  It was just such a beautiful request that I was overcome with joy.  You must love your little sister very much.\u201d\n\n\nThe boy beamed and nodded eagerly.  \n\n\n\u201cSmile for the camera,\u201d A distant voice called; a light flashed.  The parents declined to pay the $19.95 for the 8x10 glossy.\n\n\n\u201cGet it together Kris, you can do this,\u201d Santa admonished himself under his breath,  \u201cIt\u2019s for the kids.\u201d\n\n\nA rambunctious pile of energy, pigtails and pink clothes flew through the air and landed on Santa\u2019s knee.  \n\n\n\u201cOh my, and what\u2019s your name little girl?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHANNNNNAH!\u201d  The blonde haired girl beamed as she talked.  The sheer volume of energetic enthusiasm overwhelmed Santa and he smiled a genuine loving smile back at her.\n\n\nI\u2019m safe, Santa thought, I never knew a Hannah.\n\n\n\u201cHo ho ho!  And what would you like this year little Hannah?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want\u2026 I want\u2026. I want\u2026 oh I can\u2019t say, you\u2019ll think it\u2019s silly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m Santa!  My only wish is to bring good little girls and boys whatever it is they need or want in life.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWwwwwwwwwwwwell, I want a pack of twenty-four blank greeting cards.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh my, that *is* unusual.  And what will you do with these cards?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSee, I didn\u2019t use to have a mommy and a daddy.  I came from an Orph\u2026\u201d\n\n\nNo, please no, Santa thought.  Don\u2019t say THAT word.\n\n\nTime slowed to a crawl and the little girl, slowly, careful, perfectly enunciated the word \u201cOrphanage.\u201d  She explained that she had been in one until six months ago when she was adopted.  She wanted to send a Christmas card to all of her friends still in the orphanage that she missed so much. \n\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter.  Santa didn\u2019t hear here at all.  \n\n\nLittle Kris was again a thousand miles away, a lifetime ago, standing at the edge of a collapsed wooden structure that had once been home to the poorest and most vulnerable of the community.  Even Kubla Kraus would never dare to be so cruel as to attack mere children.\n\n\nRobots, on the other hand, had no such compunction nor morality.  A rebel, bleeding and wounded, had fled through the front door.  A mechanized machine followed through, and collapsed the building in the process.  \n\n\n\u201cHelp us!\u201d, \u201cGet us!\u201d,  \u201cI\u2019m scarrrred.\u201d, \u201cSomebody.\u201d The voices of the children oozed from under the collapsed building.  \n\n\nKris worked and scrambled in the darkness.  The dust choked his lungs and burned his eyes.  A black haired boy, pinned under a beam pleaded to Kris, \u201cSave me!\u201d  Kris pushed the beam out of the way. \n\n\nThe boy almost had time to say, \u201cThank you\u201d before the pooling blood in his chest, from the recently vacated chest wound the beam had been holding shut, flooded his vocal cords and mouth.  He choked to death in front of Kris, spitting blood on Kris\u2019s face.\n\n\nA hand grabbed Kris\u2019s ankle and he screamed.  He almost kicked the hand, but at the last moment he spied the face the hand belonged to.  A face covered in dust and unrecognizable.  Kris dragged the helpless child outside.  It lived thirty minutes before succumbing to injuries.  Three hours later, ten living children and fourteen bodies lined up outside the orphanage.  Kris remembered nothing of the rest of the day.\n\n\nThe adult Santa remembered nothing of the next hour.  Children came and went.  They were a distant vision at the end of a long tunnel.  He recognized that they were sitting on a knee that belonged to him.  He heard his own voice saying \u201cHo ho ho\u201d and asking what they wanted for Christmas.  Otherwise his disassociation was utter and complete.\n\n\n\u201cSanta?\u201d a voice reached him.  The world came snapped back into reality.  \n\n\nThe voice asked him again, \u201cSanta, I have a question for you.\u201d\n\n\nSanta looked down at the child on his knee.  A small white haired boy with a terribly earnest expression and a Minecraft jacket on.  \n\n\n\u201cYes my child?\u201d Santa said.  \n\n\n\u201cWell, it seems like you always are giving people what they want, so I just wanted to know.  What do *you* want for Christmas?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been asked that before.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou should say the first thing in your mind.  It\u2019s the most honest answer, that\u2019s what my mommy always says.\u201d\n\n\nSanta did.  He cleared his mind and heart, then said, \u201cI would like a hug.\u201d\n\n\nThe boy jumped up and gripped Santa in the tightest hug his little arms could muster.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d\n\n\nBetween the red hot tears, Santa agreed.  It\u2019s going to be OK. \n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhere is the big guy today?\u201d Max Mistletoe, head of rubber ball development, asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe\u2019s at the Ridgedale mall again today,\u201d Berry Peppermint replied.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh no\u2026 not again.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnother sleepless night?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPoor master was up all night last night,\u201d Trixie Eggnog came in.  Officially she was in charge of the house staff.  Unofficially she helped Kris through the PTSD episodes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The elves stood around in a circle.  Their sad faces clashing emphatically with their ostentatious outfits of merriment.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a thousand miles away in a city mall, Santa, the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; Santa, called \u201cAnd who\u2019s next?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The line of excited children and bored parents slowly creeped forward underneath the finest quality Christmas tunes a hundred overhead speakers could render.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh me, ME!\u201d a small, cherub-eyed-boy wearing a Lego Batman hoodie came running up.  He jumped and landed squarely on Santa\u2019s knee with a giggle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHo ho ho, you are quite the bundle of energy.  And what\u2019s your name?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cChristopher!\u201d the boy exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cChristopher\u2026\u201d  Santa said distantly.  Memories threatened to overwhelm him.  He gave his head a firm shake, he had duties in the here and now.  \u201cAnd what would Christopher like this year?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWeeeeeeellll, I want Legos, and a bicycle, and a firetruck, but if it\u2019s not to much to ask, could you get something for my baby sister too?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2018No,\u2019 Santa thought, don\u2019t say that.  Santa added, \u201cWhat would your sister like?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was too late.  The mall was gone.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kris, eight years old, face covered in dirt, stood in the empty shell of a house that had once been his childhood friend Christopher\u2019s home.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe have to get out of here!\u201d Kris pleaded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNO!\u201d Christopher yelled back, \u201cMy sister is still in here somewhere.\u201d  Outside, loud grinding noises of gears scraping together heralded the imminent arrival of the Kubla Kraus\u2019 mechanized army.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A small whimper and cry came from the former living room.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cChristopher, she\u2019s over there.  Please hurry!\u201d Kris pleaded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Christopher started furiously throwing debris out of the way while Kris kept watch for the robots.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve got her hand, she\u2019s here!\u201d Christopher yelled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kris turned just in time to see the wall behind Christopher collapse outward.  From the swirling dust, one of the mechanized robots lurched forward arm outstretched and grabbed Christopher.  It shoved the boy boy down it\u2019s snapping metal jaws.  Kris ran to save himself.  One glance over his shoulder burned the image of Christopher\u2019s little sister\u2019s hand sticking out of the rubble, as the robot chewed its meal slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tears ran hot and fast down the adult Santa\u2019s face.  The child Christopher, framed in a fluorescent light glow, looked up, \u201cMr. Santa?  You\u2019re crying! Why?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHo ho ho,\u201d Santa said sadly, \u201cI\u2019m OK.  It was just such a beautiful request that I was overcome with joy.  You must love your little sister very much.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boy beamed and nodded eagerly.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSmile for the camera,\u201d A distant voice called; a light flashed.  The parents declined to pay the $19.95 for the 8x10 glossy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGet it together Kris, you can do this,\u201d Santa admonished himself under his breath,  \u201cIt\u2019s for the kids.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A rambunctious pile of energy, pigtails and pink clothes flew through the air and landed on Santa\u2019s knee.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh my, and what\u2019s your name little girl?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHANNNNNAH!\u201d  The blonde haired girl beamed as she talked.  The sheer volume of energetic enthusiasm overwhelmed Santa and he smiled a genuine loving smile back at her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m safe, Santa thought, I never knew a Hannah.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHo ho ho!  And what would you like this year little Hannah?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI want\u2026 I want\u2026. I want\u2026 oh I can\u2019t say, you\u2019ll think it\u2019s silly.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut I\u2019m Santa!  My only wish is to bring good little girls and boys whatever it is they need or want in life.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWwwwwwwwwwwwell, I want a pack of twenty-four blank greeting cards.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh my, that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; unusual.  And what will you do with these cards?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSee, I didn\u2019t use to have a mommy and a daddy.  I came from an Orph\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, please no, Santa thought.  Don\u2019t say THAT word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time slowed to a crawl and the little girl, slowly, careful, perfectly enunciated the word \u201cOrphanage.\u201d  She explained that she had been in one until six months ago when she was adopted.  She wanted to send a Christmas card to all of her friends still in the orphanage that she missed so much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn\u2019t matter.  Santa didn\u2019t hear here at all.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little Kris was again a thousand miles away, a lifetime ago, standing at the edge of a collapsed wooden structure that had once been home to the poorest and most vulnerable of the community.  Even Kubla Kraus would never dare to be so cruel as to attack mere children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robots, on the other hand, had no such compunction nor morality.  A rebel, bleeding and wounded, had fled through the front door.  A mechanized machine followed through, and collapsed the building in the process.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHelp us!\u201d, \u201cGet us!\u201d,  \u201cI\u2019m scarrrred.\u201d, \u201cSomebody.\u201d The voices of the children oozed from under the collapsed building.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kris worked and scrambled in the darkness.  The dust choked his lungs and burned his eyes.  A black haired boy, pinned under a beam pleaded to Kris, \u201cSave me!\u201d  Kris pushed the beam out of the way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boy almost had time to say, \u201cThank you\u201d before the pooling blood in his chest, from the recently vacated chest wound the beam had been holding shut, flooded his vocal cords and mouth.

Father dropped his ho and ran to me across the field. \"Get to the cellar,\" he said.\n\nI clutched my wooden horse to my chest.\n\n\"Take it with you,\" he said. \"Now go.\"\n\nI did as I was told. My brothers and sisters joined me. Father locked the cellar, and the light through the slats disappeared when he placed bales of hay over the doors.\n\nWe huddled in the dark and the quiet.\n\nClyde, the youngest, asked, \"What's happening?\"\n\n\"Shh,\" said my older sister Annabelle.\n\nThe oldest in the family, Jared, said, \"We're being raided. Father and the men are going to protect us.\"\n\nI plonked my horse down on the soil and played at war raiders.\n\nHours passed. \n\nThe bales of hay were removed from the cellar doors. Light did not appear through the slats. It was night. We didn't recognize the man who came down the stairs, but he brought with him a smell of horse, metal, and ale. \"Buncha kids,\" he called upstairs.\n\n\"Any stuff?\" was the response.\n\nClyde approached the man. \"Where's dad?\"\n\nThe man put his hand on Clyde's face and shoved him backwards. \"Nah, just a buncha kids and a coupla bags a wheat.\"\n\n\"Grab the wheat. We'll torch the rest.\"\n\nThe man pushed past my sisters and brothers to our winter supply of wheat, corn, and barley.\n\n\"You can't have that,\" Jared said.\n\nThe man put his knife in Jared's neck. Then he grabbed the bags and hauled them upstairs.\n\nThe cellar doors clunked shut. The bales of hay returned, only now they smelled of lantern oil.\n\nAnnabelle pressed a handful of rags to Jared's neck. He made a sound like a stream bursting through a dam.\n\nFirst came the smoke, then came the fire.\n\nI tried to push open the doors. The smoke got into my eyes, which burned, and throat, which closed up. I fell down the stairs, the earth turned tilt, and then I woke up with my head tucked into a corner of the cellar and the sun streaming through a burnt opening in the cellar door.\n\nGrime coated my face and clothes. A wet towel had been placed across my mouth and nose. My sister Annabelle was slouched against the wall next to me. Blood covered her wool dress. Her chin rested against her chest. I nudged her shoulder and slid over to the side. She didn't respond when I shook her. None of my siblings did.\n\nI got halfway up the stairs, then went back for my toy horse. In my lungs the fire still burned, and when I got to the surface I fell to my knees coughing.\n\nThe man who approached me smelled of horses and metal, but not ale. \n\nHe crouched beside me and inclined his head toward the cellar. \"Survived a burning, eh?\"\n\nA river of drool spilled out of my mouth.\n\n\"You'll be alright,\" he said. \"You're a tough one.\"\n\nWhen I'd recovered, he took me to his where his horses were tied up out back of my home. He gave me a skein of water, a heel of dark bread, and a knob of aged cheddar. I ate.\n\nHe sat on our chopping log and sharpened a curved blade. \"You're first question's gonna be about your family,\" he said. \"Don't ask it. They're dead.\"\n\nI put down the water, bread, and cheese. \"Father is alive,\" I said. I clutched the wooden horse.\n\nHe spoke to the blade. \"He's not. He got chopped up. Or rode down. Or hung. If you'd like, we can go find him.\"\n\nWhenever father spoke of the town, he'd raise his chin toward the church's steeple poking above the treetops. Now, the steeple had been replaced by fat worms of smoke crawling into the sky.\n\n\"He's alive,\" I said.\n\nThe man sheathed his blade. \"Let's go.\"\n\nI placed the wooden horse in the man's saddlebags.\n\n\"Leave it,\" the man said.\n\n\"My father made it for me,\" I said.\n\nHe shrugged. \"Fair enough.\"\n\nWe rode into town.\n\nThe church roof had caved in. The post office looked the way our abandoned, hundred-year-old outhouse did. Behind a pile of timber logs that had been set up to block the main rode, we found the fathers of my schoolfriends.\n\nI stopped blinking.\n\nI saw the cuts, missing limbs, burn marks, mashed body parts, but I didn't see them as anything that would kill a person. They were simple changes to the men's bodies. Like scraped knees. They couldn't possibly take the men from being living, joking, and hardworking to dead.\n\nBut they didn't move when I spoke to them.\n\nWe rode on, and found father hanging from a tree. A sword was stuck halfway through his chest. His neck had purpled around the rope. His body rocked in the breeze.\n\nI blinked. I went away in my head for a while, and accused myself of being unfaithful to father for having blinked. I owed him my full attention.\n\nThe man shook me. He slapped my face.\n\n\"Why did this happen?\" I asked him.\n\nHe rode over to father, put an arm around his waist, and cut him down. The weight nearly pulled the man from his saddle. \"There's people with swords, and there's people without swords,\" the man said. He set father down against the tree trunk. Father's hands lay in his lap. They still looked big and strong. \"Your father was a man without a sword.\"\n\n\"What are you?\"\n\nThe man unsheathed the top few inches of his sabre. He said, \"What do you want to be?\"\n\nI walked over to father, kissed his forehead, closed his eyes, put my hand against his shoulder, and pulled the sword from his chest. It was heavy. I used two hands to keep the point off the ground.\n\nThe man nodded. \"What's your name?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nicholas.\"\n\n*****\n\nThe man taught me to hunt, ride, camp, and fight. He taught me to distrust the strong and to baby the weak. He taught me that people will never give you what you haven't already taken.\n\n*****\n\nWe came on a group of raiders late in the evening. They'd rounded the bulk of a town's people into the stone church, barricaded the door, and were piling hay, logs, and kindling around the walls.\n\nThe man and I were beyond words. He tapped his chest, then pointed to the church's west side. I tapped mine, and pointed to the east. He nodded.\n\nI took up a position behind the sprawling oak at the center of town. Red and white streamers hung from the branches. The townsfolk had recently celebrated the spring and the tree had been their maypole.\n\nIt begins with arrows.\n\nMy first took a raider in the neck. He fell onto the torch he'd been holding.\n\nMy second glanced off a raider's shoulder. He cried out, found me, and alerted the others. My third entered his eye.\n\nA man outnumbered is a man killed. When a man is outnumbered, he runs.\n\nAnd so, after the arrows comes the chase.\n\nI hid around the corner of the town inn, and dropped the first raider into with another arrow.\n\nThen, down the alley between the post office and the apothecary, I did the same.\n\nThe raiders grew wary. They peeked, rather than ran, around corners.\n\nI put my knife to good use.\n\nBy this time, their numbers had thinned. They knew fear.\n\nFinally, there comes the reversal. The chasers become the chased.\n\nThe raiders return to their horses and find them gone. Out of options, the raiders stand their ground.\n\nArrows, knives, swords.\n\nThe raiders are no more.\n\nIt was with a light heart that I stamped out the flames, pulled the barricade away from the church doors, and greeted the townsfolk. \n\nThey saw me, smelled the horse and the metal on me, and their instinct was to pull away.\n\n\"What do you want?\" the priest said.\n\n\"I saved you,\" I told him.\n\n\"We don't have anything to give you,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't understand. I got rid of the raiders. They're gone.\"\n\nThe townspeople looked me up and down. They took in the blood on my clothes, the cuts on my face and neck, and the practiced way I carried my sword, and they pulled away.\n\nA little boy burst into tears at the sight of me.\n\nAn idea occurred to me. \"Wait here, all of you,\" I said, and went back outside to where the man waited with our horses.\n\n\"It's a thankless life,\" he said.\n\nI went through my saddlebags. \"It doesn't have to be.\"\n\nIn the church, I knelt by the kneeling boy. His mother clutched the top of his head, and her hands trembled.\n\n\"Take this,\" I told the boy, and pushed my wooden horse into his hands.\n\nHe held it at arm's length.\n\n\"It's a horse,\" I told him.\n\nHe didn't move.\n\nI placed my hands on his, guided the horse to the ground, and made it trot along. \"Clop clop clop,\" I said.\n\n\"Clop clop,\" the boy said. He'd forgotten his tears.\n\n*****\n\nThat evening, after the man and I had set up camp, I went into the woods with an ax and brought back a log of wood.\n\nThe man was sharpening his sword. \"What's that for?\" he said.\n\nI got out my knife and peeled strips off the log. \"Carving a horse,\" I said.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"There are more than two kinds of men in the world,\" I said. \"Some men make horses out of wood.\"", "edited": 1492359734.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town&amp;#39;s bell rang the alarm.

We didn&amp;#39;t recognize the man who came down the stairs, but he brought with him a smell of horse, metal, and ale. &amp;quot;Buncha kids,&amp;quot; he called upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Any stuff?&amp;quot; was the response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clyde approached the man. &amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;s dad?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man put his hand on Clyde&amp;#39;s face and shoved him backwards. &amp;quot;Nah, just a buncha kids and a coupla bags a wheat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Grab the wheat. We&amp;#39;ll torch the rest.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man pushed past my sisters and brothers to our winter supply of wheat, corn, and barley.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t have that,&amp;quot; Jared said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man put his knife in Jared&amp;#39;s neck. Then he grabbed the bags and hauled them upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cellar doors clunked shut. The bales of hay returned, only now they smelled of lantern oil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Annabelle pressed a handful of rags to Jared&amp;#39;s neck. He made a sound like a stream bursting through a dam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First came the smoke, then came the fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to push open the doors. The smoke got into my eyes, which burned, and throat, which closed up. I fell down the stairs, the earth turned tilt, and then I woke up with my head tucked into a corner of the cellar and the sun streaming through a burnt opening in the cellar door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grime coated my face and clothes. A wet towel had been placed across my mouth and nose. My sister Annabelle was slouched against the wall next to me. Blood covered her wool dress. Her chin rested against her chest. I nudged her shoulder and slid over to the side. She didn&amp;#39;t respond when I shook her. None of my siblings did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got halfway up the stairs, then went back for my toy horse. In my lungs the fire still burned, and when I got to the surface I fell to my knees coughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man who approached me smelled of horses and metal, but not ale. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He crouched beside me and inclined his head toward the cellar. &amp;quot;Survived a burning, eh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A river of drool spilled out of my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll be alright,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a tough one.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;d recovered, he took me to his where his horses were tied up out back of my home. He gave me a skein of water, a heel of dark bread, and a knob of aged cheddar. I ate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sat on our chopping log and sharpened a curved blade. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re first question&amp;#39;s gonna be about your family,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t ask it. They&amp;#39;re dead.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put down the water, bread, and cheese. &amp;quot;Father is alive,&amp;quot; I said. I clutched the wooden horse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He spoke to the blade. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s not. He got chopped up. Or rode down. Or hung. If you&amp;#39;d like, we can go find him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever father spoke of the town, he&amp;#39;d raise his chin toward the church&amp;#39;s steeple poking above the treetops. Now, the steeple had been replaced by fat worms of smoke crawling into the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s alive,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man sheathed his blade. &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s go.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I placed the wooden horse in the man&amp;#39;s saddlebags.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Leave it,&amp;quot; the man said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My father made it for me,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He shrugged. &amp;quot;Fair enough.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We rode into town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The church roof had caved in. The post office looked the way our abandoned, hundred-year-old outhouse did. Behind a pile of timber logs that had been set up to block the main rode, we found the fathers of my schoolfriends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped blinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw the cuts, missing limbs, burn marks, mashed body parts, but I didn&amp;#39;t see them as anything that would kill a person. They were simple changes to the men&amp;#39;s bodies. Like scraped knees. They couldn&amp;#39;t possibly take the men from being living, joking, and hardworking to dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they didn&amp;#39;t move when I spoke to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We rode on, and found father hanging from a tree. A sword was stuck halfway through his chest. His neck had purpled around the rope. His body rocked in the breeze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I blinked. I went away in my head for a while, and accused myself of being unfaithful to father for having blinked. I owed him my full attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man shook me. He slapped my face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why did this happen?&amp;quot; I asked him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He rode over to father, put an arm around his waist, and cut him down. The weight nearly pulled the man from his saddle. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s people with swords, and there&amp;#39;s people without swords,&amp;quot; the man said. He set father down against the tree trunk. Father&amp;#39;s hands lay in his lap. They still looked big and strong. &amp;quot;Your father was a man without a sword.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man unsheathed the top few inches of his sabre. He said, &amp;quot;What do you want to be?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked over to father, kissed his forehead, closed his eyes, put my hand against his shoulder, and pulled the sword from his chest. It was heavy. I used two hands to keep the point off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man nodded. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s your name?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nicholas.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man taught me to hunt, ride, camp, and fight. He taught me to distrust the strong and to baby the weak. He taught me that people will never give you what you haven&amp;#39;t already taken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We came on a group of raiders late in the evening. They&amp;#39;d rounded the bulk of a town&amp;#39;s people into the stone church, barricaded the door, and were piling hay, logs, and kindling around the walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man and I were beyond words. He tapped his chest, then pointed to the church&amp;#39;s west side. I tapped mine, and pointed to the east. He nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took up a position behind the sprawling oak at the center of town. Red and white streamers hung from the branches. The townsfolk had recently celebrated the spring and the tree had been their maypole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It begins with arrows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first took a raider in the neck. He fell onto the torch he&amp;#39;d been holding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My second glanced off a raider&amp;#39;s shoulder. He cried out, found me, and alerted the others. My third entered his eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A man outnumbered is a man killed. When a man is outnumbered, he runs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so, after the arrows comes the chase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hid around the corner of the town inn, and dropped the first raider into with another arrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, down the alley between the post office and the apothecary, I did the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The raiders grew wary. They peeked, rather than ran, around corners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put my knife to good use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By this time, their numbers had thinned. They knew fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, there comes the reversal. The chasers become the chased.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The raiders return to their horses and find them gone. Out of options, the raiders stand their ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arrows, knives, swords.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The raiders are no more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was with a light heart that I stamped out the flames, pulled the barricade away from the church doors, and greeted the townsfolk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They saw me, smelled the horse and the metal on me, and their instinct was to pull away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you want?&amp;quot; the priest said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I saved you,&amp;quot; I told him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t have anything to give you,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t understand. I got rid of the raiders. They&amp;#39;re gone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The townspeople looked me up and down. They took in the blood on my clothes, the cuts on my face and neck, and the practiced way I carried my sword, and they pulled away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little boy burst into tears at the sight of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An idea occurred to me. &amp;quot;Wait here, all of you,&amp;quot; I said, and went back outside to where the man waited with our horses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a thankless life,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went through my saddlebags. &amp;quot;It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the church, I knelt by the kneeling boy. His mother clutched the top of his head, and her hands trembled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Take this,&amp;quot; I told the boy, and pushed my wooden horse into his hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He held it at arm&amp;#39;s length.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a horse,&amp;quot; I told him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I placed my hands on his, guided the horse to the ground, and made it trot along. &amp;quot;Clop clop clop,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Clop clop,&amp;quot; the boy said. He&amp;#39;d forgotten his tears.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That evening, after the man and I had set up camp, I went into the woods with an ax and brought back a log of wood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man was sharpening his sword. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s that for?&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got out my knife and peeled strips off the log. &amp;quot;Carving a horse,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are more than two kinds of men in the world,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;Some men make horses out of wood.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgc72u5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492387615.0, "created_utc": 1492358815.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p3q7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcib6p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mialbowy", "parent_id": "t3_65p3q7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There's a homeless man in the neighborhood. No one knows his name anymore, but everyone calls him Santa, because he hands out these little woodcarvings to the kids. Really nice ones, like cars and animals that actually look right, not just blobs of wood you have to squint at. From what some of the oldies around say, he's been doing it for a few decades now, so I guess all that practice didn't go to waste.\n\nMy mom says I used to cry when I saw him. Dunno why back then, but I'm still uncomfortable seeing him now. There's something inside me that just doesn't like looking at him. Not because of how he looks, or anything like that. Maybe it is, because I can't think of any other reason why. It's not how he smells, or how he sounds.\n\nI wasn't satisfied with all that, so I went to see him. It unsettled me to be just a couple of steps away from him. For whatever reason, I couldn't take my eyes off his hands as he carved with a penknife. Even when I looked away, they got drawn back. Like how bright red catches the eye.\n\nWithout a plan, I stumbled over my words, getting out whatever came to mind first. \u201cDid you need some more wood?\u201d He didn't react, just kept carving. \u201cEr, Santa?\u201d\n\nHis eyebrows raised, and he finished the slice before looking up at me. I couldn't meet his gaze, dropping my eyes back to his hands.\n\n\u201cDid you need some more wood, uh, sir?\u201d\n\nHis voice had some gravel to it, but otherwise not as deep as I expected\u2014kind of reassuring, actually. \u201cThat's okay, son. I get scraps from the carpenter's a few blocks down.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d I said, mumbling more to myself than him. \u201cDid you, I mean, I could fetch some, if you're nearly out.\u201d\n\nHe brought a hand up and stroked his beard. A bushy thing, dyed white with age and gray with grime. Not entirely unkempt, but far from neat. \u201cWell, I won't stop you if that's what you want to do.\u201d\n\nWanting to get rid of the uncomfortable feeling, I turned around fast as I could.\n\nThe carpenter shop had gone pretty unnoticed by me before then. Not much there to interest a kid. Standing outside, it looked like a family thing, branded by a surname and a general clutter to it. Chain stores and all those felt cold, everything exactly where some boss said. This store pretty much matched my bedroom, with a path to walk through and stuff half-piled everywhere else.\n\nI didn't recognize the man behind the counter, but he looked like any guy off the street. When I got to the counter, I noticed he had kind of the same hands as Santa, though I didn't know quite why. They just looked rough.\n\n\u201cCan I help yer?\u201d he said, and though politely he didn't really look at me. Half service for the youngster.\n\n\u201cYeah, uh, did you have any scraps?\u201d\n\nHe pressed his lips tight, and looked up at me. \u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr, the homeless man,\u201d I said, and then quickly added, \u201cSanta.\u201d\n\nHe snorted, shaking his head softly. \u201cSanta, eh?\u201d he said, turning to the side and checking over something behind the counter. \u201cWell, not like I'm short on the stuff. How much he want?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, I dunno.\u201d\n\nAfter clicking his tongue, he pulled out a small, linen bag. \u201cJust a couple pieces, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nHe slotted in four oddly shaped chunks, pine wood I thought. Then, he handed it over. \u201cOff you go then.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, nodding my head in thanks too. He just waved me off though, so I left.\n\nThe wood didn't feel all that heavy on the way back, but I still dragged my feet. Santa looked the same, head bent down and the carving coming into shape. He didn't notice me, or didn't react to me. Kept doing what he did. I guessed most people ignored him, so he did the same.\n\n\u201cUh, Santa?\u201d\n\nLike before, he finished the slice and looked up. \u201cAh, it's you again.\u201d\n\nI offered him the bag, and he put down the penknife to accept it. When his hand brushed against mine, I realized it shook, slightly. Not sure how I missed that, too focused I guessed. Couldn't see the woods for the tree. I followed his hand as it put down the bag next to him, and then picked up the knife again. When he pressed it into the wood, though, his hand stopped shaking.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI, uh, you're welcome.\u201d\n\nThe carving looked hard to do, both of his hands subtly moving in all kinds of ways, twisting and turning. Made me wonder if he'd really only spent thirty years doing it.\n\nHe hummed, and then asked, \u201cWhich animal is your favorite?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I, I don't want anything, it's fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, indulge my curiosity.\u201d\n\nI didn't really follow how that fit, but I got the idea. \u201cMaybe a lion?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe, eh?\u201d\n\nThe lightness in his tone rustled me, so I thought about it a bit more. \u201cA dog, then. St. Bernard.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled to himself, a deep but quiet chuckle. \u201cIt's funny you should say that,\u201d he said, putting down the carving and knife, and turning to another linen bag at his side. A mix of confused and no-way filled me, while he went through the bag, wood clunking against wood. \u201cAh, here we go,\u201d he said, and pulled out a carving. \u201cFor you.\u201d\n\nI didn't believe it even though he held it out in front of me. Not just a dog, it really looked like a St. Bernard. A big, shaggy St. Bernard, sitting on its haunches, and its face looked happy. \u201cNo, I can't,\u201d I said, stepping back.\n\nHe turned it around, looking at it. \u201cReally? It seems I made him for you, though.\u201d\n\nI wanted to turn him down again, and just run home. It didn't make sense. But, in the end, I asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nHe hummed, and looked back at me. \u201cWhy what?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust\u2026 why?\u201d I didn't know what I was asking, and I doubted he did either. But, I wanted some answer, something that made sense.\n\nRolling the figure between his fingers, he hummed again, inspecting it. \u201cWhen you become as old as me,\u201d he said, and his tone had a softness to it. \u201cThere are memories I only have, because I can remember remembering them. Does that make sense to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d After trailing off, I shook my head. \u201cNot really, no.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose it wouldn't. Instead, then, you have seen pictures of yourself as a baby, have you not?\u201d\n\nNodding, I said, \u201cYeah, I have.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, though his eyes didn't change. \u201cIt's like that. You know that that moment existed, but you cannot remember it.\u201d\n\nI nodded again, though it took me a while to really start to understand what he meant. Eventually, I pieced together enough to ask, \u201cWhat can't you remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father,\u201d he said, lowering the carving to rest his hands on his knees. \u201cHe would carve toys like this for me, and he taught me how to as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, I'm sorry.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, though his eyes still looked distant. \u201cI'm full of memories I'd rather forget, so I hope that, one day, I'll hand a child a carving, and a precious memory of that time spent with my father will return.\u201d\n\nI couldn't even begin to understand what he felt. Searching my brain for anything to say, I ended up falling back on the weakest thing I could have. \u201cI hope you do too.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, and lifted his gaze to me. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nI smiled back awkwardly, before looking away.\n\n\u201cAh, before you go, your present.\u201d\n\nAfter what he'd said, I didn't resist, and reached over to take it. Light, and it felt soft from all the nicks that made up the fur. \u201cUh, my name is Jake. What's yours?\u201d\n\nHe chuckled. \u201cWell, my name is Nicholas. I imagine that's why they began calling me Santa.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d\n\nPicking back up the half-done carving and penknife, he said, \u201cGoodbye, Jake.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, goodbye.\u201d\n\nI turned around, and walked away, but, rather than never seeing him again, I felt a little of something different.

Half service for the youngster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah, uh, did you have any scraps?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He pressed his lips tight, and looked up at me. \u201cWhat for?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cEr, the homeless man,\u201d I said, and then quickly added, \u201cSanta.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He snorted, shaking his head softly. \u201cSanta, eh?\u201d he said, turning to the side and checking over something behind the counter. \u201cWell, not like I&amp;#39;m short on the stuff. How much he want?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI, I dunno.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After clicking his tongue, he pulled out a small, linen bag. \u201cJust a couple pieces, then.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOkay.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He slotted in four oddly shaped chunks, pine wood I thought. Then, he handed it over. \u201cOff you go then.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, nodding my head in thanks too. He just waved me off though, so I left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wood didn&amp;#39;t feel all that heavy on the way back, but I still dragged my feet. Santa looked the same, head bent down and the carving coming into shape. He didn&amp;#39;t notice me, or didn&amp;#39;t react to me. Kept doing what he did. I guessed most people ignored him, so he did the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUh, Santa?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like before, he finished the slice and looked up. \u201cAh, it&amp;#39;s you again.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I offered him the bag, and he put down the penknife to accept it. When his hand brushed against mine, I realized it shook, slightly. Not sure how I missed that, too focused I guessed. Couldn&amp;#39;t see the woods for the tree. I followed his hand as it put down the bag next to him, and then picked up the knife again. When he pressed it into the wood, though, his hand stopped shaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI, uh, you&amp;#39;re welcome.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The carving looked hard to do, both of his hands subtly moving in all kinds of ways, twisting and turning. Made me wonder if he&amp;#39;d really only spent thirty years doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He hummed, and then asked, \u201cWhich animal is your favorite?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, I, I don&amp;#39;t want anything, it&amp;#39;s fine.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThen, indulge my curiosity.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t really follow how that fit, but I got the idea. \u201cMaybe a lion?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMaybe, eh?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lightness in his tone rustled me, so I thought about it a bit more. \u201cA dog, then. St. Bernard.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He chuckled to himself, a deep but quiet chuckle. \u201cIt&amp;#39;s funny you should say that,\u201d he said, putting down the carving and knife, and turning to another linen bag at his side. A mix of confused and no-way filled me, while he went through the bag, wood clunking against wood. \u201cAh, here we go,\u201d he said, and pulled out a carving. \u201cFor you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t believe it even though he held it out in front of me. Not just a dog, it really looked like a St. Bernard. A big, shaggy St. Bernard, sitting on its haunches, and its face looked happy. \u201cNo, I can&amp;#39;t,\u201d I said, stepping back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He turned it around, looking at it. \u201cReally? It seems I made him for you, though.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to turn him down again, and just run home. It didn&amp;#39;t make sense. But, in the end, I asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He hummed, and looked back at me. \u201cWhy what?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust\u2026 why?\u201d I didn&amp;#39;t know what I was asking, and I doubted he did either. But, I wanted some answer, something that made sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rolling the figure between his fingers, he hummed again, inspecting it. \u201cWhen you become as old as me,\u201d he said, and his tone had a softness to it. \u201cThere are memories I only have, because I can remember remembering them. Does that make sense to you?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2026\u201d After trailing off, I shook my head. \u201cNot really, no.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI suppose it wouldn&amp;#39;t. Instead, then, you have seen pictures of yourself as a baby, have you not?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nodding, I said, \u201cYeah, I have.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled, though his eyes didn&amp;#39;t change. \u201cIt&amp;#39;s like that. You know that that moment existed, but you cannot remember it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded again, though it took me a while to really start to understand what he meant. Eventually, I pieced together enough to ask, \u201cWhat can&amp;#39;t you remember?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMy father,\u201d he said, lowering the carving to rest his hands on his knees. \u201cHe would carve toys like this for me, and he taught me how to as well.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI, I&amp;#39;m sorry.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled, though his eyes still looked distant. \u201cI&amp;#39;m full of memories I&amp;#39;d rather forget, so I hope that, one day, I&amp;#39;ll hand a child a carving, and a precious memory of that time spent with my father will return.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t even begin to understand what he felt. Searching my brain for anything to say, I ended up falling back on the weakest thing I could have. \u201cI hope you do too.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled, and lifted his gaze to me. \u201cThank you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I smiled back awkwardly, before looking away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAh, before you go, your present.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After what he&amp;#39;d said, I didn&amp;#39;t resist, and reached over to take it. Light, and it felt soft from all the nicks that made up the fur. \u201cUh, my name is Jake. What&amp;#39;s yours?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He chuckled. \u201cWell, my name is Nicholas. I imagine that&amp;#39;s why they began calling me Santa.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, okay.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Picking back up the half-done carving and penknife, he said, \u201cGoodbye, Jake.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah, goodbye.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned around, and walked away, but, rather than never seeing him again, I felt a little of something different. In the end, it didn&amp;#39;t take that long before I stopped by to watch him carve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgcib6p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492402420.0, "created_utc": 1492373620.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p3q7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcdnwb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rudlin0", "parent_id": "t3_65p3q7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nick was tired.

You're doing a fine job as our newest foreman, and don't you forget it.\"\n\nHe beamed before scurrying off to join his companions in the usual merriment that pervaded the workplace. So full of youth, that Tobias is. Such enthusiasm and optimism that I had observed amongst so many youth of so many races within the Multiverse. I'll be damned if I had even the slightest capacity of understanding it at all.  \n\nThere was a soothing lull in the air as they filed out of the workshop, leaving me alone in silence. One would think this is something I'd enjoy, given the complications of coordinating the various machinations associated with delivering gifts around the planet.  But, no. This silence signals the next part of my day, one that I keep hidden to refrain from spoiling the exuberance of the elves.\n\nI trudge back to my office.  To the casual observer, it has a simple layout: my desk, a couple chairs, and some bookshelves against the back wall with various items scattered within them.  I plop myself down into my chair, closing my eyes and steeling myself for the battle I was about to partake in.  \n\n\u201cWelcome back.  Ready to waste away with me enveloping your fetid entrails like I do every night?\u201d The bottle of Jack Daniels I had engorged myself upon during the previous night taunted me from its perch upon the third bookshelf, where so many of his companions had rested in days past.\n\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t listen to him. He\u2019s just wasting your time. I can make all your troubles disappear just like *that*. All you gotta do is caress me real good, baby.\u201d  My old standard-issue MX-900 plasma pistol was just as eager to present itself from its resting place within the left desk drawer.  \n\n\u201cI won\u2019t, not this time...,\u201d I uttered as I felt myself reach for a shot glass and climb out of my chair towards the Jack Daniels bottle.  Try as I might, I helplessly watched as I poured myself copious amounts of that sweet whiskey and began downing shot after shot. It wasn\u2019t long until I had emptied the bottle and entered the usual drunken stupor I had fallen into as part of my nightly ritual. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, you spineless coward. You know where the rest of my friends are, go get them and drink until you cry yourself to sleep like you always do,\u201d the bottle sneered.\n\n\u201cOh, let me have a turn already! I haven\u2019t fired off squat since the last time that pushover squeezed my trigger nice and tight,\u201d the MX-900 angrily pouted.\n\n\u201cPlease, just let me be\u2026\u201d I begged as I slumped once more into my chair and saw my right hand reaching for the gun.  I saw Xeosillan from the rearview simulation of my land speeder, screaming for me to save him as three Gregan lancers dragged him and the other three infiltrators into the munitions plant we had failed to sabotage. I saw the villagers of a small tribe in Sotra cowering before our unit, knowing full well what we were about to do with them.  And, of course, I saw Ksacha.  My beloved Ksacha, oozing viscous purple blood from her abdomen as I held her lifeless body in my arms and shielded her from the falling debris of our desecrated home.  Before long, I saw the gun firmly entrenched within my hand.\n\n\u201cYES! I can already feel my energy cells warming up for this. Hurry up and pull that trigger so I can feel that sweet, sweet release one last time!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, screw him! If you go through with this, I will haunt you for the rest of your pathetic existence in the Multiverse!\u201d\n\nThe cacophony of the two arguing over who should be the rightful adjudicator to my fate grew ever louder.  I clawed at my falsely-dyed white hair and beard, fighting desperately for a semblance of sanity within my mind. All the other flashbacks from so many years of service roared back to the forefront of my thoughts as I was forced to relive every aspect of them.  I was losing this fight tonight, and I was well aware of the potential repercussions.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for, you pathetic oaf? SQUEEZE ME!\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely NOT! Drink ME instead!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, ME!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, ME!\u201d\n\nI was at my wit\u2019s end, ready to give in to alleviate the madness that ravaged my psyche.\n\n\u201cME!\u201d\n\n\u201cME!\u201d\n\nMy finger tightened around the trigger.  \u201cThis is really it\u2026,\u201d I thought as I closed my eyes for the final time.\n\n\u201cME!\u201d\n\n\u201cME!\u201d\n\n\u201cME!\u201d\n\n\u201cME!\u201d\n\nJust then, there was a knock at the door.  A sound that was foreign to me at this hour in the night, one that jerked me back to reality.  The MX-900 was in its usual resting place, safely out of reach from me for now.  I breathe a sigh of relief, counting my lucky stars for the unexpected visitor that had inadvertently saved my life this evening. The knock resonated again throughout my office with more force, prompting me to stagger out of my chair and towards the door.  \u201cPerhaps one of the elves needed something?\u201d I wondered as I opened the door to greet my visitor.\n\nThe last person I expected to see in front of me was Kuumlon, my liaison to the S.A.N.T.A. program who placed war veterans of the 2nd Multiverse Rebellion into recuperative positions on far-away planets. He was dressed in the typical human disguise he preferred to wear: a balding white male in a pinstripe suit with an obnoxiously radiant orange tie and a worn felt hat on his head.  As I was about to speak, he cut me off:\n\n\u201c337. I\u2019ve just been informed of your progress thus far on the road to a full recovery. We need to talk.

If you go through with this, I will haunt you for the rest of your pathetic existence in the Multiverse!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cacophony of the two arguing over who should be the rightful adjudicator to my fate grew ever louder.  I clawed at my falsely-dyed white hair and beard, fighting desperately for a semblance of sanity within my mind. All the other flashbacks from so many years of service roared back to the forefront of my thoughts as I was forced to relive every aspect of them.  I was losing this fight tonight, and I was well aware of the potential repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat are you waiting for, you pathetic oaf? SQUEEZE ME!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAbsolutely NOT! Drink ME instead!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, ME!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, ME!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was at my wit\u2019s end, ready to give in to alleviate the madness that ravaged my psyche.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cME!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cME!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My finger tightened around the trigger.  \u201cThis is really it\u2026,\u201d I thought as I closed my eyes for the final time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cME!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cME!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cME!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cME!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just then, there was a knock at the door.  A sound that was foreign to me at this hour in the night, one that jerked me back to reality.  The MX-900 was in its usual resting place, safely out of reach from me for now.  I breathe a sigh of relief, counting my lucky stars for the unexpected visitor that had inadvertently saved my life this evening. The knock resonated again throughout my office with more force, prompting me to stagger out of my chair and towards the door.  \u201cPerhaps one of the elves needed something?\u201d I wondered as I opened the door to greet my visitor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last person I expected to see in front of me was Kuumlon, my liaison to the S.A.N.T.A. program who placed war veterans of the 2nd Multiverse Rebellion into recuperative positions on far-away planets. He was dressed in the typical human disguise he preferred to wear: a balding white male in a pinstripe suit with an obnoxiously radiant orange tie and a worn felt hat on his head.  As I was about to speak, he cut me off:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c337. I\u2019ve just been informed of your progress thus far on the road to a full recovery. We need to talk.
