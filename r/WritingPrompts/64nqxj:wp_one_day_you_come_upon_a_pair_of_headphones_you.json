They were a strange group, she knew. Students that didn't quite fit in with the trouble-makers, only occasionally getting loud enough to earn a warning, yet at the same time not part of those that showed respect to teachers as much as they should. Table-groups like theirs, that type that finish every test first by a longshot, generally fell into one of those categories.   \n\nShe smiled at the teacher, acknowledging his unspoken words. *Quiet down*.  \n\n\"Look at I what got.\" Jenna whispered as she pulled out the old pair of headphones and held them up by the cord. She let the torn-up ear-pieces dangle above the table, swaying back and forth like a pendulum. They were white. Or rather, they were *once* white. Now, it was more of a gray.  \n\n\"Jesus.\" Wesley whispered back. \"You found Adam and Eve's headphones.\"  \n\nJenna laughed, getting another look from Mr Joshi. She quieted down and let the headphones drop to the table.  \n\n\"From the time capsule, I assume?\" Vanessa asked. She finished first even among the table, but that was less because she knew every answer and more because she didn't care about her grades.  \n\n\"That's right.\"  \n\n\"What brand are they?\" Vanessa asked again.  \n\nNot for the first time, Jenna squinted at the strange logo. \"Not sure.\"  \n\n\"Companies didn't exist back when these were made.\" Wesley said. He was met with laughter from the table, even from Sam. It was quiet enough to not attract Joshi's attention.  \n\n\"They're Beats by Dre.\" Jenna said, a smile starting at the edges of her lips. Wesley had been wanting a pair since freshman year.  \n\n\"Shit,\" Wesley laughed. \"Maybe they were *beat* by Dre.\"  \n\nAnother chorus of laughter went up from the group. Jenna herself laughed as well, despite trying to remain quiet.  \n\nAs Joshi's body got closer to the table, none of the students looked up. It was the same philosophy that children had when it came to monsters. *Maybe if I don't look, it won't be there*.  \n\nJenna looked.  \n\nHe was there.  \n\n\"Quiet.\" He said.   \n\nJenna nodded, as did Vanessa and Wesley.  \n\nShe grabbed the headphones and brought them to her ears. She wasn't really going to put them in, but the horrified look on Vanessa's face made it worth it. She stuck them in and turned to Wesley, hoping to see a similar stare of horror.  \n\n\"Somehow they look good on her.\" His voice came, but his lips didn't move. \"Everything does.\"  \n\nJenna narrowed her eyes at him, removing the headphones, holding them out an inch or so. \"What?\"  \n\n\"What?\" He repeated the word, clearly surprised. \"I didn't say anything.\"  \n\nJenna stuck the ear-pieces back in.  \n\n\"Did I say that out loud?\" He sounded confused. His lips still didn't move.  \n\nJenna looked away, at Joshi. He was clear across the room and staring at her.  \n\n\"- could be top of the class if she'd just apply herself.\" The words were spoken as if he were right next to her, though again his mouth didn't move. A few whispers sounded as well and Jenna looked for the source, but saw nothing.  \n\n\"What'd you get for five?\" One of the whispers asked.  \n\nShe watched as Joshi walked over to the table nearest him and picked up Mark's test. \"You think I'm deaf?\"  \n\nHe walked to the front of the room with the half-filled test.  \n\nShe looked at Mark.  \n\n\"Fuckin' piece of shit, shit-skin towel-head-\"  \n\nShe looked away from the boy.  \n\nJenna pulled the headphones out and sat up straight. Wesley, Vanessa, and Sam were staring at her. They looked concerned. If they were looking at her like that... how did *she* look?  \n\nShe swallowed and took in a breath.  \n\n\"Guys.\" She said, voice barely even a whisper. They all leaned in to the table's center. She thought of what to say, but didn't find any words. She settled for a pair that she used too often, but if ever they were required, this was the time. \"Holy shit.\"  \n\nShe looked at Mark once more and put the headphones in again.  \n\n\"- how he likes it if he gets shot.\"  \n\nHe reached into his backpack.  \n\nJenna tanked the cord and yelled across the room. \"Mark!\"   \n\nHe stopped rummaging through the pack and sat up, looking at Jenna.  \n\nHe didn't speak, but he watched her, waiting for her to go on.  \n\nShe couldn't find the words, so she settled for just shaking her head.  \n\nMark hesitated, arm still in the backpack.  \n\n\"Want to go with me to prom?\" She asked the question without embarrassment, despite yelling it across Mr Joshi's class. She had only fear on her mind.  \n\nMark's mouth opened to respond, then he shut it. Jenna could see Wesley blink and looked around, waiting to hear the answer as well.  \n\n\"Of course.\" Mark said, arm now out of the backpack. He smiled, though it looked forced. \"I'd uh, yeah.\"  \n\nJenna sat back and took another focused breath.  \n\nSam and Vanessa stared at Jenna with shock apparent on their faces now. She wasn't the type to make attention, let alone do... that.  \n\nWesley was looking at his phone, pretending to text someone, though he was the last person to text anyone. He had a reputation for being a perpetual non-responder, even to Sam, and they'd been friends since middle school. Though, Jenna found that Wesley replied near instantly whenever she texted him.  \n\n\"Idiot.\" She whispered the word loud enough so only she could hear. She had to focus.  \n\nMark had a gun.  \n\n", "edited": 1491876904.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mister Joshi frowned at Jenna as well as the other students sitting at her table.

He spun his thumb on the wheel of the device looking for the album he had downloaded the night before. After a third look through his lists, the songs were nowhere to be found. He sighed and lazily tugged the earbuds out of his ears and rested his head against the cool bark of the tree.\n\nThe day was warm and breezy, the gusts of wind swaying the leaves above him making the soft rustling one heard on quiet mid days like these. 'The music of mother nature.' He chuckled to himself at how cheesy that sounded. \n\nThe iPod in his hand was an old one, a still working first generation. He used to be one of the cool kids with the awesome new music player that just came out. But when the thinner, smaller and clearly much better models were advertised, people had told him to get one so it didn't look like he had a brick in his pocket. \n\nNowadays when people see him with that old block of an iPod, it's the coolest thing ever again. 'Retro' or 'hipster' were the usual words used to describe it. Some even offered to buy it for more than it was worth. But he always turned them down. It held a lot of music since he was a kid and it was always nice to go back and listen to some of the stuff he used to listen to and remember the old days. Like a little picture album but with music.\n\nAs Tom reminisced the old days, there was a peculiar rustling sound above him. Before he could realize what was happening, there was a loud THWACK! As something hit him against the head. He rolled out of the way grabbing the side of his head and stood back up a few feet from where he had sat.\n\nThere was no blood but it hurt like hell and he rubbed at it waiting for the pain to subside. He opened his eyes to see the size of the branch that probably fell on him but his eyes were met with something completely different. \n\nDangling from the lowest branch was a pair of headphones. Black and orange, hanging onto the branch by its chord. It swayed from side to side slowly coming to rest from the impact to Tom's head. \n\n\"What the hell?\" He walked over to take a closer look at it. He picked them up and tugged at the chord which was a tangled mess around the branch above him. Tom's reach was just high enough to get it sorted out and the rest of the unusually long and thick wire fell to the ground at his feet.\n\nLooking the headphones over, it was quite clean and probably still in working condition. He sniffed at it. Smelled like it was straight out of the box even. They were a little larger than what most people used. Studio headphones maybe? Tom looked back up through the leaves of the old oak tree, all the way through to the light blue breakage of the sky on the other side. Nothing was up there.\n\nShrugging, he put them on his head to see how they fit. As he slipped the cushions over his ears, his ears were filled with the sounds of low almost muffled voices. He quickly took them off and stared at them. He looked down at his feet again, the chord lay on the grass and at the end of it the metallic plug sat disconnected.\n\nTom's brows furrowed in confusion. Slowly he put the headphones back over his ears. The muffled sounds of people were back as well as other non distinct sounds which he couldn't make out. He couldn't make out much of it at all until he looked around.\n\nTwo girls were walking by him and saw his stupefied expression. They gave him glances and giggled as they walked away.\n\n\"What a weirdo.\" One of them said. Or he was sure that's what she said but either weren't actually talking when he watched them.\n\n\"...Cute.\" When he looked to the other girl. Tom couldn't help but smile and he \n awkwardly waved at them. They held back more laughs as they sped up their stride. He couldn't hear anything else once they were far away. Did he just read their thoughts?\n\nTom turned his attention to someone else, another test. A student sat at a table, alone on his laptop working intently on something. He focused on the student and instead of words he heard something else. It was a beat and a melody. Tom couldn't help but bob his head to it until the bass dropped. And he was moving this way and that to the music. \n\nThe student looked up from his work and gave Tom an awkward look and the music came to an abrupt stop. Unsure of what to do, Tom gave him a thumbs up. The student slowly closed his laptop and got up to leave.\n\n\"Just can't seem to find the right sound for the melody...\" He said. Or thought.\n\n\"I think it's great!\" Tom suddenly said to the student.\n\nThere was another exchange of awkward looks.\n\n\"Weirdo.\" And student grabbed the last of his things and left.\n\nTom took off his headphones and sat back on his spot against the tree to look them over again. There was no brand on them. It was made with a combination of smooth leather and had metallic finishes. They were undoubtedly comfortable and did not weigh too much on his head. But its one feature that Tom couldn't still grasp was what he had just witnessed. Was he really reading the minds of those people?\n\nThen he had another thought. He took the earbuds out of his iPod and plugged in the headphones. He played one of the songs. Nothing out of the ordinary, it was just playing music. But the muffled voices were completely gone as the music played. He played several more songs before turning off the music. He wasn't sure what he expected.\n\nThe muffled sounds came back again and there was one that was louder than the others that he could just barely make out.\n\n\"Should I?...\" It was a female voice.\n\nTom turned to look in the direction of where it was coming from. His eyes were met with a pair of legs and looked up to see the girl from before, the one who he caught 'cute' from her. She wasn't with her friend and she was leaned against the tree just next to him. He quickly got up headphone still in his ears.\n\nShe smiled when she saw him. \"He really is cuter up close. I don't know what Krista is talking about.\" \n\nThe girl then looked off to the side shuffling a little and fiddling with her hair. \"Okay this is awkward, what do I say?\"\n\nTom suddenly realizing how long he had been standing there staring at her, blurted out a \"Hello.\" \n\nHe took off his headphones and placed them around his neck. \"My names Tom.\" He returned a smile and held out a hand.\n\n\"Kylie.\" She took his hand, the air of awkwardness fading. She saw the bulky headphones around his neck and the iPod that sat on the grass. \"Listening to music?\"", "edited": 1491916470.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom sat against a tree on the expansive green lawn of his university&amp;#39;s campus going through his old iPod.

He sighed and lazily tugged the earbuds out of his ears and rested his head against the cool bark of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The day was warm and breezy, the gusts of wind swaying the leaves above him making the soft rustling one heard on quiet mid days like these. &amp;#39;The music of mother nature.&amp;#39; He chuckled to himself at how cheesy that sounded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The iPod in his hand was an old one, a still working first generation.

He was the top of his class and every time a new case popped up on his desk, it would be solved within the week. If only, Jackson thought, Knight would be less eccentric. And infuriating.\n\n\"I work better with music. It gets the gears moving better.\" Knight smirked, winking at the flabbergasted detective. \n\n\"I get that. That's normal. What ain't normal is you putting on a pair of headphones when you're interrogating a suspect!\" It came out louder than he had expected. Truth be told, Jackson couldn't be all that mad at Knight. He got results, and by having him as a partner for the last week, they'd successfully broke into a drug ring in downtown New York, caught themselves not one, but three of the prime suspect's accomplices. Now, one of them sat in the chair in interrogation room #2. \n\nJackson just hated how much he didn't adhere to the rules or, for some reason, completely disregarded protocol.\n\n\"Trust me, I have this under control.\" He nodded. \"Let's start.\" Jackson signaled for the cameras to start rolling. \n\n\"Keep your mic on Knight. We need him to confess.\" \n\n\"Try to keep the mic off me.\" He smiled. Walking into the desolate room, save for a man in his mid-thirties, already balding and eyes red from what he could only conclude was an intense session of crying (or being high the night before), Knight placed his black, brand-less headphones onto the desk. \n\n\"Trevor?\" Knight inquired, trying to start the conversation going.\n\n\"I ain't saying anything.\" He replied, trying his best to look away. He's been in an interrogation room before, Knight noted. The two-way mirror has been the subject of his infrequent stares for the past few minutes.\n\n\"That's alright. I'm not impatient I can wait. But,\" Knight stop mid-sentence, his hands swiftly picking up the headphones and wearing it snugly on his head. \"You'll talk eventually.\"\n\nTrevor scoffed. \n\nThe room was immediately silenced. Nothing but faint whispers could be heard, and the creaky fan that filled the silent space made not a sound. Knight closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. He'd done it before but it took immense focus to harness the power of the headphones to suit his needs. Slowly but surely, a voice filled the speakers of the headphones. Trevor was speaking to him but his lips did not move. \n\n\"*If he thinks I'll rat them out, he's insane.*\" Trevor spoke without speaking. Knight smiled.\n\n\"You're probably thinking that protecting your friends will fix all your problems, don't you?\" Knight said.\n\n\"And you think you're so smart ain't you. Like you can get in my head. It ain't gonna work.\" Trevor spat. \n\nThe inner voice spoke up again. \"*Not like they're my friends. I can't give them up. For Jessie's sake.*\" \n\n\"Now, I've been looking into you. You refused to speak to the officer before me. On file, you've had no record of any living relatives. I know that's a lie, Trevor.\" \n\nTrevor's eyes narrowed. \"You don't know me, detective.\" \n\n\"I think I do. You were a boring, contented blue collar, Trevor. You expect me to believe you got into the drug business just for some extra cash? There has to be a stake in it. Your boss said you had relations with a female coworker.\" \n\nTrevor swallowed a subtle gulp. Knight could picture the knot forming in his interrogated' atheist. \n\n\"*I never told anyone that. Jim doesn't even know about Vanessa and Jessie.*\n\n\"And I know that you only did what you had to do in order to support them.\" Knight looked back to the two-way mirror. \"This is official. We're recording behind that glass right there.\" He clarified, pointing. \"Unless you want to go to jail for the rest of your life for withholding information from the police, do yourself a favor and give the rest up. We'll reduce your sentence.\" \n\n\"*That'll leave Jessie with no one. If I do this, David will take care of her **and** Vanessa.*\" \n\n\"David Grossman can't help you, Trevor. He's as much into this as you are. Jessie and Vanessa will be under witness protection. You have nothing to lose but a few years off your sentence.\" Trevor was taken aback. He had told not one soul about his affair with Vanessa Richardson or about the culmination of a child. He thought he'd never be a father or at least he'd be a bad one. His childhood was terrible to put it lightly, and between the divorce of his parents, the routine beatings from his father and the alcoholism which took over his mother's life, he wanted to do good. For once. \n\nThis was his chance. For some reason, this geeky, unlikely detective had figured his whole life story in a matter of seconds. He was amazed and honestly thankful. Trevor was always a recluse and shared not one bit of detail about the events that played out in his unfortunate life. \n\nAnd now he had an open ticket to be a good man. To be a good father. He had to take it. He couldn't let this opportunity slip by. He wouldn't let allow it.\n\n\"His name is Randy Keller.\" Trevor started to confess resulting in a sincere smile by Knight. Jackson couldn't believe what he was hearing. The rookie detective had done it. **Again**.\n\n\"Good. Tell me everything.\" \n\n-----\n\n\"How do you do it, Knight?\" Jackson asked, gleaming. The break room smelled of sweat and strong coffee. He leaned on the table with one arm, his left hand holding a half drunk cup of black coffee. Janet, his wife, said the beans she used for his flask of coffee were exotic and different. He couldn't taste the difference.\n\nKnight noticed the previous resentment he had for him had disappeared without a trace. He was actually proud. \n\n\"I have my methods.\" He replied. The headphones was tucked safely in his briefcase. \n\n\"Music huh?\" Jackson spoke up after a moment of silence. \"Guess what they say is true. Works wonders.\"\n\nSmiling, the rookie detective looked his superior in the eye. \"Indeed.\" ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;The Detective&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re kidding me, aren&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot; Jackson sighed as he placed his thumb and middle finger on his temple, rubbing as though it would soothe the headache that was slowly reverberating his skull. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was told that Detective Knight could solve any case. He was the top of his class and every time a new case popped up on his desk, it would be solved within the week. If only, Jackson thought, Knight would be less eccentric. And infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I work better with music. It gets the gears moving better.&amp;quot; Knight smirked, winking at the flabbergasted detective. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I get that. That&amp;#39;s normal. What ain&amp;#39;t normal is you putting on a pair of headphones when you&amp;#39;re interrogating a suspect!&amp;quot; It came out louder than he had expected. Truth be told, Jackson couldn&amp;#39;t be all that mad at Knight. He got results, and by having him as a partner for the last week, they&amp;#39;d successfully broke into a drug ring in downtown New York, caught themselves not one, but three of the prime suspect&amp;#39;s accomplices. Now, one of them sat in the chair in interrogation room #2. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jackson just hated how much he didn&amp;#39;t adhere to the rules or, for some reason, completely disregarded protocol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Trust me, I have this under control.&amp;quot; He nodded. &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s start.&amp;quot; Jackson signaled for the cameras to start rolling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Keep your mic on Knight. We need him to confess.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Try to keep the mic off me.&amp;quot; He smiled. Walking into the desolate room, save for a man in his mid-thirties, already balding and eyes red from what he could only conclude was an intense session of crying (or being high the night before), Knight placed his black, brand-less headphones onto the desk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Trevor?&amp;quot; Knight inquired, trying to start the conversation going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I ain&amp;#39;t saying anything.&amp;quot; He replied, trying his best to look away. He&amp;#39;s been in an interrogation room before, Knight noted. The two-way mirror has been the subject of his infrequent stares for the past few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s alright. I&amp;#39;m not impatient I can wait.
