(also once again no paragraphs :p) Ann slapped at a mosquito on her neck, deep in the heart of a dense jungle. The locals here had always told fabulous storied of strange cave formations that were never confirmed and she was keen to find out if the stories where true. She slapped another mosquito. Not keen to find out first hand though. Ann wasn\u2019t the adventurous type she loved sitting quietly in a clean lab, scribbling notes in her little notebook, occasionally peering into a microscope but her boss finally got tired of her. She swung her hand at a third mosquito and missed. The head of the department had sat her down at his office a few days ago and delivered quite a speech. \u201cAnn,\u201d the graying man had said, \u201cYou are one of the best scientists in this department but I fear you\u2019re cooped up in this tiny lab far too often. I think you should be the one to take on this little side project we have planned.\u201d Ann had shuddered at that and quickly declined but the department head was adamant. \u201cIt would be a wonderful opportunity for you to see things in a new perspective. Constantly looking into a microscope is tiring.\u201d She again declined and said she actually quite liked microscopes. That\u2019s when shit got real. \u201cLook Ann, your pale ass has been haunting this lab ever since you got accepted for the position. You sit around here barely speaking to anyone for hours at a time. Last week you managed to give the security guard a heart attack when he was locking up! Goodness, who hangs around a quiet lab at night with all the lights off? You\u2019re getting some sunlight so he doesn\u2019t mistake you for a ghost next time.\u201d He retorted and flopped some files in front of her. She questioned how she could get sunlight in a cave located within a jungle but was shushed and shoved from the room. So she was out here now, slapping at annoying mosquitoes. Probably lost. She checked her phones GPS. It beeped then the whole app crashed and refused to turn on. Ann gritted her teeth and tried to reset her phone. Another mosquito buzzed at her ear. \u201cIs that the same mosquito I missed?\u201d she huffed. In her mind it was so she whipped out a tiny fly swatter and chased it until it landed on a tree. \u201cI\u2019ve got you now.\u201d She slapped at it and missed entirely. \u201cFuck!\u201d she yelled and threw the damn swatter down. She checked her phone again. Still off. Grudgingly she took a map dotted with notes out of her bloated pack and turned it around in her hands. \u201cOkay,\u201d she swung at another mosquito. \u201cI\u2019m probably around\u2026here. If I keep heading north I should see this slight elevation and the cave should be hidden somewhere in the underbrush.\u201d Folding the map carefully she stuffed it into her back pocket. Just then her phone rang startling a melodious cry from her lips. It was her coworker Eric. She picked up and heard the sounds of a cool air being pushed from an AC and sneered at the voice that came though. \u201cANN! How\u2019s life in the jungle? Enjoying the beautiful wea-\u201d She hung up before she could consider smashing her phone and made a beeline for the estimated location of the cave entrance. Just as she had suspected it was obscured by bushes and tall grass but she pushed though it and stepped in. The mouth was just a foot higher than her 5\u20199\u201d frame but it was easily four times as long. She unclipped the small flashlight she had from her pack and flicked it on. The cave walls glistened with moisture and moss that reflected the light as she walked further in. \u201cHeh, I\u2019m just like Laura Croft.\u201d Ann declared quietly to herself, \u201cBut with Jeans.\u201d She looked down at her small chest. \u201cAnd that.\u201d she said even quieter. She stopped periodically to observe the caves natural structures when she noticed that there were no mosquitoes in the cave. \u201cBe grateful for the small things.\u201d She muttered to herself as she continued on. She came upon a bend in the cave that went right. Rounding the corner she saw a strange orange-ish light radiating from around the next left bend. She clicked off her light and let the glow from the corner blaze through the dark. \u201cI guess there were people here after all.\u201d She reasoned as she inched closer to the corner. Poking her head around she saw the cave widened enormously and almost every surface was covered in gold. Ann gasped in response and timidly stepped into the cavern. Gold shone everywhere and large stalactites of twinkling crystal jutted perilously from the ceiling of the cave. \u201cBut where is the light coming from?\u201d Ann asked herself as she spun in place. Her question was answered when she saw a large reptilian beast rise shift from atop a large pile of uncut gems. Its\u2019 underside was completely white. There seemed to be light shining from the underbelly giving it the appearance of heavily fogged glass. The beast reared to its full height and spread its wings further illuminating the room. Ann promptly fell on her ass and scrambled backward but jerked to a stop when the thing spoke.

I\u2019m here to study the cave formation!\u201d The beasts\u2019 wings folded and it quickly leapt to her side. \u201cOh, why didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d Its voice was much less obtrusive to her ears now as it helped her up. \u201cThis cave was discovered by my great grandfather\u2019s cousin. She too had a great fascination with how these caverns were formed.\u201d The beast intoned as slipped on a small pair of glasses from a fold in its wings. It guided a stumbling Ann deeper into the cave oblivious to her abject terror. \u201cShe left quite a bit of her notes filled with her theories about the subject which I have studied endlessly\u2026.\u201d  ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreword: please excuse me, I don\u2019t know shit about geology but I really wanted to write this story. (also once again no paragraphs :p) Ann slapped at a mosquito on her neck, deep in the heart of a dense jungle. The locals here had always told fabulous storied of strange cave formations that were never confirmed and she was keen to find out if the stories where true. She slapped another mosquito. Not keen to find out first hand though. Ann wasn\u2019t the adventurous type she loved sitting quietly in a clean lab, scribbling notes in her little notebook, occasionally peering into a microscope but her boss finally got tired of her. She swung her hand at a third mosquito and missed. The head of the department had sat her down at his office a few days ago and delivered quite a speech. \u201cAnn,\u201d the graying man had said, \u201cYou are one of the best scientists in this department but I fear you\u2019re cooped up in this tiny lab far too often. I think you should be the one to take on this little side project we have planned.\u201d Ann had shuddered at that and quickly declined but the department head was adamant. \u201cIt would be a wonderful opportunity for you to see things in a new perspective. Constantly looking into a microscope is tiring.\u201d She again declined and said she actually quite liked microscopes. That\u2019s when shit got real. \u201cLook Ann, your pale ass has been haunting this lab ever since you got accepted for the position. You sit around here barely speaking to anyone for hours at a time. Last week you managed to give the security guard a heart attack when he was locking up! Goodness, who hangs around a quiet lab at night with all the lights off? You\u2019re getting some sunlight so he doesn\u2019t mistake you for a ghost next time.\u201d He retorted and flopped some files in front of her. She questioned how she could get sunlight in a cave located within a jungle but was shushed and shoved from the room. So she was out here now, slapping at annoying mosquitoes. Probably lost. She checked her phones GPS. It beeped then the whole app crashed and refused to turn on. Ann gritted her teeth and tried to reset her phone. Another mosquito buzzed at her ear. \u201cIs that the same mosquito I missed?\u201d she huffed. In her mind it was so she whipped out a tiny fly swatter and chased it until it landed on a tree. \u201cI\u2019ve got you now.\u201d She slapped at it and missed entirely. \u201cFuck!\u201d she yelled and threw the damn swatter down. She checked her phone again. Still off. Grudgingly she took a map dotted with notes out of her bloated pack and turned it around in her hands. \u201cOkay,\u201d she swung at another mosquito. \u201cI\u2019m probably around\u2026here. If I keep heading north I should see this slight elevation and the cave should be hidden somewhere in the underbrush.\u201d Folding the map carefully she stuffed it into her back pocket. Just then her phone rang startling a melodious cry from her lips. It was her coworker Eric. She picked up and heard the sounds of a cool air being pushed from an AC and sneered at the voice that came though. \u201cANN! How\u2019s life in the jungle? Enjoying the beautiful wea-\u201d She hung up before she could consider smashing her phone and made a beeline for the estimated location of the cave entrance. Just as she had suspected it was obscured by bushes and tall grass but she pushed though it and stepped in. The mouth was just a foot higher than her 5\u20199\u201d frame but it was easily four times as long. She unclipped the small flashlight she had from her pack and flicked it on. The cave walls glistened with moisture and moss that reflected the light as she walked further in. \u201cHeh, I\u2019m just like Laura Croft.\u201d Ann declared quietly to herself, \u201cBut with Jeans.\u201d She looked down at her small chest. \u201cAnd that.\u201d she said even quieter. She stopped periodically to observe the caves natural structures when she noticed that there were no mosquitoes in the cave. \u201cBe grateful for the small things.\u201d She muttered to herself as she continued on. She came upon a bend in the cave that went right. Rounding the corner she saw a strange orange-ish light radiating from around the next left bend. She clicked off her light and let the glow from the corner blaze through the dark. \u201cI guess there were people here after all.\u201d She reasoned as she inched closer to the corner. Poking her head around she saw the cave widened enormously and almost every surface was covered in gold. Ann gasped in response and timidly stepped into the cavern. Gold shone everywhere and large stalactites of twinkling crystal jutted perilously from the ceiling of the cave. \u201cBut where is the light coming from?\u201d Ann asked herself as she spun in place. Her question was answered when she saw a large reptilian beast rise shift from atop a large pile of uncut gems. Its\u2019 underside was completely white. There seemed to be light shining from the underbelly giving it the appearance of heavily fogged glass. The beast reared to its full height and spread its wings further illuminating the room. Ann promptly fell on her ass and scrambled backward but jerked to a stop when the thing spoke. Its open mouth didn\u2019t move but the words roared through clearly. \u201cAnother has come to try to claim what is mine? Fool! It will be your DOOM!\u201d The roaring voice made her wince and she barely managed to squeak her answer out.  \u201cNo I\u2019m a geologist!
