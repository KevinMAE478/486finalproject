He couldn't find a single bug or surveillance device.  Even the computer seemed cleaned.  He could email for help.  \n\nWell, he thought, might as well enjoy the jacuzzi.  HeatStroke wasn't going to do anything for a few days anyways.  It was a bit awkward with his suit on, as he found out the restraints were annoyingly waterproof, but the hot waters did relax his muscles. It had been a long battle that afternoon, so it was damn nice to get some time just for himself.  Even if it was in a villain's lair, he reminded himself.\n\nAfter the soak, he browsed the refrigerator. Well shit, he thought, they had that fizzy water Margaret refused to stock. He cracked one open and enjoyed the carbonated lime flavour.  He sat in the large recliner and turned on the TV.  He grinned.

The man smiled at the superhero.\n\n\"How ya' doin?\" he asked.\n\n\"Uhm... Tomorrow I will stop HeatStroke.  Mark my words.\"  He sounded pretty pathetic even to himself. But he stopped, and cleared his throat.\n\n\"I am going to get out of here!\" he declared.  Much better.\n\n\"Well, you can leave any time,\" Fred pointed down the hall, \"Just take that emergency exit to the back stairs.\"\n\nHyperman shook his head.  \"I can just leave?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"  \n\n\"No,\" he jabbed a finger at Fred's chest, \"I won't let HeatStroke get away from another murder! Not after what he did to the Dancing Tiger.\"\n\nFred started laughing uproariously. Hyperman felt the familiar anger build up in his chest.  It had all been a ruse.  These evil men didn't care at all for the lives they had ruined.  He felt ashamed he had wasted so many hours already.\n\nHe tried to slam the door, but Fred stopped him.  \"No, no,\" he said, \"I'm sorry. It's just.... It's just, I'm Dancing Tiger.\"\n\nHyperman did a double take. \"Pardon?\"\n\n\"Yeah, HeatStroke set me up here a couple of weeks ago, and it was such a relief, that I offered to stay on.\"  Fred shrugged.  \"It's been nice.

No battle going on or big conference table between us.\"\n\nHyperman's eyes narrowed.  \"What did the Gold Falcon wear to the second galactic arena battle?\"\n\nFred chuckled.  \"Nothing.

I got a couch and everything.\"\n\nHyperman looked down the hallway at the emergency exit sign.  Well, HeatStroke could wait until tomorrow to be fair.

On average, lightning struck Dr Death\u2019s headquarters 30 times a minute, generating most of his power needs and also providing just the right amount of ambience for the lair of one of the most deranged supervillains ever to walk the earth.\n\nIn the minute just after midnight, 31 black bolts of heavenly wrath peppered the island, which was slightly above the statistical average, but only if you did not take into account that the final bolt was less a product of natural phenomena, and more a result of Shockbear in teleportation mode, on an infiltration mission, traveling in style.\n\nShockbear had memorized the blueprints, and mere seconds had passed before he had raced through the lightning conductors, past the generators, along the power lines, then popped out of a socket in the largest cell on the prison wing, where Perplexity was most likely being held.\n\nHe landed with a thud, with claws fully extended in assault mode, fangs bared, fur prickling with charged static. He had expected Dr Death\u2019s henchmen to be in the middle of torturing Perplexity, draining secret League information out of her. Or perhaps, she would have been left to rot, wasting away as hunger, disease and helplessness ravaged her.\n\nInstead, it appeared, Perplexity was in the middle of watching *Making a Murderer* on a 80-inch plasma screen, with her feet propped up on an ottoman, as she reclined in an armchair. The oily smell wafting in the air wasn\u2019t Perplexity roasting over a fire, it was the freshly-prepared popcorn at her side.\n\n\u201cShock\u2026 bear?\u201d she said first, a panicked look entering her eyes. \u201cShit, how long have I been gone?\u201d\n\n\u201cSix days,\u201d Shockbear said, in a deadpan voice. His claws remained extended, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cSix days since you and Dr Death disappeared into the wormhole. As per protocol, when you hadn\u2019t returned within five days, Cortena sent me after you.\u201d\n\nCortena, the leader of the League, one of the most powerful spellmasters in years, had stressed the importance of giving Perplexity the opportunity to make her own escape. If you don\u2019t give them the space to grow, she had counselled, how would they ever learn? \n\n\u201cSeems like we were wrong to worry about you, I guess. Must have been hard on you, having to sit here and eat unsalted popcorn. Oh, the humanity!\u201d drawled Shockbear, who had a penchant for retreating into sarcasm whenever he was upset. He turned to leave the way he came.\n\n\u201cNo, no, please, wait! I can explain!\u201d\n\nPerplexity phased behind Shockbear, catching him offguard, then pushed him into the armchair. He raised his paw in anger, ready to protest, but the grouses died in his throat as he realised just how very, exquisitely comfortable the armchair was. Against his will, he snuggled into position.\n\n\u201cI blacked out when I went through the wormhole, I swear,\u201d said Perplexity, as she paced nervously. \u201cWhen I came to, one of Dr Death\u2019s henchmen was next to me, checking to see if I was alright. I didn\u2019t recognise him, so he must have been a new hire.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to tell me next that he asked me just how he could make your stay comfortable, and if madame would like a welcome cocktail too,\u201d said Shockbear, who had not quite given up on his sarcasm yet, though the lushness of the armchair was making it difficult for him to remain affronted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing! He did ask me that! Well, not about the cocktail, I\u2019m never been keen on alcohol, but he explained that when Dr Death held an innovation contest recently, you know, to boost morale and improve productivity amongst the staff, and well, the Hospitality Initiative he entered had won first prize!\u201d\n\nShockbear raised a claw, ready to protest at the inanity of it all, then his ears prickled as he realised smooth jazz tunes were flowing out from the sides of his headrest. The plasma screen had switched channels automatically too, perhaps when he had first taken a seat, and the documentary he had been looking forward to catching up on, *Modern Honeycombing*, was playing.\n\n\u201cGo on, what\u2019s this dastardly\u2026 Hospitality Initiative?\u201d\n\nPerplexity grabbed a thick binder off the coffee-table, then thrust it towards Shockbear. \u201cHe had reasoned, quite correctly, that any member of the League would be strong enough, resourceful enough, to break out of any dungeon Dr Death could fashion. It was only ever a matter of time. So his plan was, if it were comfortable enough here, then we wouldn\u2019t want to leave! It\u2019s\u2026 genius!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 how would they know what we would like? There\u2019s dozens of us!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust look, you\u2019ll see!\u201d said Perplexity, as she flipped open the binder for Shockbear. \u201cThey\u2019ve done their research! They\u2019ve got tabs on all of us! Look at my entry \u2013 they\u2019ve correctly identified the food I like, the shows I have a weakness for, they even got me the foot massager I\u2019ve been saving up for!\u201d\n\nThe tears were already brimming in Perplexity\u2019s eyes, but she was not done.\n\n\u201cAnd look!\u201d she said, flouncing over to a giant crystal globe on the table. \u201cThis button gives me lemongrass, this one lavender, this one honeysuckle! All you need to do is scan your thumbprint here, and they\u2019ll customize a scent for you! I\u2019m sure they have *Raw Salmon No. 2* for you!\u201d\n\nThe bastards, Shockbear thought, as he saw Perplexity close her eyes and draw a deep breath in. Somehow, though it spoke of unimaginable security breaches, Dr Death\u2019s henchman had somehow found out about the Great Scent Wars, the event which nearly split the League right down the middle in bloody, uninhibited civil war.\n\nThe matter had been heavily classified, the full facts privy only to the higher echelons in the League, but Shockbear had been there when it happened. He had seen it begin, when one of the younger superheroes had thought to bring in vanilla extract scents for the common room. It turned out that others didn\u2019t like it, but rather than talk about it like adults, they had brought their own scents, more potent, overpowering. The passive-aggressiveness had escalated until someone sprayed an entire bottle of Vellutian Hellskunk, fleeced from the evidence room, onto the carpet, in an apparent misapplication of scorched earth tactics.\n\nCortena\u2019s timely and magical intervention had saved the League from permanently losing their sense of smell, but since that day, all scents, colognes, perfumes, had been banned on pain of death. It mattered more to some than others, and it was no secret on which side of the line Perplexity fell.\n\n\u201cBut Perplexity,\u201d said Shockbear weakly, struggling to escape the demonic armchair, \u201cwe cannot stay. The world\u2026 it needs us. The longer we remain here, the more Dr Death will be able to run amok outside\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk yourself this! In the time I was gone, did Dr Death rampage outside? Any attacks on innocent civilians, any opening of demonic portals to the dark realms?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 no\u2026 now that you mention it\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this is why! Watch!\u201d\n\nPerplexity intoned Words of Power as her fingers flashed furiously, completing the spellweave which marked her as one of the most accomplished reconnaissance agents the League had ever recruited. A circular, shimmering portal hung in the air, and Shockbear huddled next to Perplexity as they both peered through the incantation.\n\n\u201cIs that\u2026 is Dr Death, the supervillain who once boiled every human in a city alive\u2026 jumping around in a bouncy castle?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! I was curious myself as to why Dr Death had not left this compound in days, and it turns out, after he saw how contented I was in my cell, he ordered that over-achieving henchman to do-over his man cave as well! Dr Death has been so pleased, he\u2019s spent the last six days holed up, right here! Shockbear, he ain\u2019t leaving anytime soon! The world is safe!\u201d\n\nShockbear\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion, as he struggled to make sense of what Perplexity was saying, as his sense of responsibility wrestled against his common sense. \n\nWeakened by the internal turmoil, he tumbled forward, his left claw spearing a side of roast beef from a thoughtfully-placed buffet table, his right claw hooking a mug of honeymead. He landed, by the grace of the heavens, not ungracefully on the soft-carpeted floor, but back on the armchair which Perplexity had yielded to him.\n\n\u201cI must consider our next step carefully,\u201d he said, as he chewed on his catch, savouring the juices as they dribbled down his chin. \u201cVery, very carefully.\u201d\n\n---\n\n/r/rarelyfunny", "edited": 1492440533.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Death, a firm believer in the adage that clothes maketh the man, situated his castle of corruption, his den of depravity, on a modestly-sized island off the western coast, where strong winds and torrential rain assailed it without reprieve all year round. On average, lightning struck Dr Death\u2019s headquarters 30 times a minute, generating most of his power needs and also providing just the right amount of ambience for the lair of one of the most deranged supervillains ever to walk the earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the minute just after midnight, 31 black bolts of heavenly wrath peppered the island, which was slightly above the statistical average, but only if you did not take into account that the final bolt was less a product of natural phenomena, and more a result of Shockbear in teleportation mode, on an infiltration mission, traveling in style.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shockbear had memorized the blueprints, and mere seconds had passed before he had raced through the lightning conductors, past the generators, along the power lines, then popped out of a socket in the largest cell on the prison wing, where Perplexity was most likely being held.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He landed with a thud, with claws fully extended in assault mode, fangs bared, fur prickling with charged static. He had expected Dr Death\u2019s henchmen to be in the middle of torturing Perplexity, draining secret League information out of her. Or perhaps, she would have been left to rot, wasting away as hunger, disease and helplessness ravaged her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, it appeared, Perplexity was in the middle of watching &lt;em&gt;Making a Murderer&lt;/em&gt; on a 80-inch plasma screen, with her feet propped up on an ottoman, as she reclined in an armchair. The oily smell wafting in the air wasn\u2019t Perplexity roasting over a fire, it was the freshly-prepared popcorn at her side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cShock\u2026 bear?\u201d she said first, a panicked look entering her eyes. \u201cShit, how long have I been gone?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSix days,\u201d Shockbear said, in a deadpan voice. His claws remained extended, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cSix days since you and Dr Death disappeared into the wormhole. As per protocol, when you hadn\u2019t returned within five days, Cortena sent me after you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cortena, the leader of the League, one of the most powerful spellmasters in years, had stressed the importance of giving Perplexity the opportunity to make her own escape. If you don\u2019t give them the space to grow, she had counselled, how would they ever learn? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSeems like we were wrong to worry about you, I guess. Must have been hard on you, having to sit here and eat unsalted popcorn. Oh, the humanity!\u201d drawled Shockbear, who had a penchant for retreating into sarcasm whenever he was upset. He turned to leave the way he came.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, no, please, wait! I can explain!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perplexity phased behind Shockbear, catching him offguard, then pushed him into the armchair. He raised his paw in anger, ready to protest, but the grouses died in his throat as he realised just how very, exquisitely comfortable the armchair was.
