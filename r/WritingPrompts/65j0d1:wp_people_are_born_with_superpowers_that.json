She never could get a straight answer out of the circumstances of her birth (they would say it wasn't a hospital, it was a surprise, and it wasn't important since she didn't have a power) but she got a strong suspicion it was on the couch in the office of the very shop she later inherited from them when they passed.\n\n\"So...?\" asked Jess.\n\n\"So what?\" replied Melody, giving her a knowing look and a skeptical brow.\n\n\"So, are we doing the double date or not?

Dinner. No movie, though. If he puts me to sleep, I'd rather it not be in a dark place he can try to cuddle me.\"\n\nThe bell rang again and a rather imposing fellow walked in, dressed in black from head to toe, including a black mask covering half his face. There were a few folks who went through that phase, particularly if their powers came as a result of moonless trysts in pitch black rooms. Shadow walkers, invisibles, and the like. He walked up to the counter.\n\n\"Welcome to Melody's. We've got a special on day old danish if you'd like to take a few off my hands!\"\n\nThe man raised up one hand and said, \"I'd rather take your money.\" His palm started vibrating the air around it and a darkness began to emanate from it.\n\nJess screamed.\n\nThe patrons scrambled and turned over their chairs.\n\nMelody threw up her hands to cover her face and shouted, \"Don't hurt us!\"\n\nIn an instant, a horrifying squelching, ripping, snapping sound filled the room, accompanied by a loud, gut-wrenching, but oddly brief scream from the man. She felt a spray of warm moisture hit her face and hands but she didn't open her eyes for fear of what was going to happen to her and her friend.\n\nA loud thud sounded next and then silence except for the short, heavy breathing of Melody, Jess, and her customers. This, and then a loud cacophony of screams from the other three in the room. Melody opened her eyes and looked at her hands. They were covered in a red liquid. For a brief moment, she almost thought it was strawberry jam like she'd use to fill her donuts. But she quickly realized it was blood.\n\nHer eyes focused in front of her. There, on the ground, surrounded by the splatters of blood covering the tables and floor and the glass of the big, wide window was...\n\nWell...\n\nIt was the man in black. But not him anymore. A torus of human flesh, ripped ebony cloth, bones and viscera and fat. A donut that was once a man but now was that same man, his neck snapped backwards and somehow, grotesquely intertwined with his legs, forming a perfect circle.\n\nThe tip jar crashed to the floor as Melody, grasping for anything to break her fall, crumpled to the ground and fainted.", "edited": 1492281243.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;ll be 4.29, please.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man standing in front of Melody Windsor, well, not standing exactly, but hovering a few inches off the ground pulled a wallet out of some undetectable slit in the spandex underneath his cape and slipped out a five. &amp;quot;You can keep the change,&amp;quot; he said, taking the bag with the pair of chocolate cream donuts and hovering toward the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tapped the cash button on her register and with a pop and a cha-ching, she added the bill to the drawer and pulled out some change, dropping it in the tip jar on the counter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside the wide, glass window emblazoned with a pink, sprinkled donut and the name &amp;quot;Melody&amp;#39;s Munchies,&amp;quot; a giant beast made of moving rock was filling a pothole in the street left over from Mr. Incendiary&amp;#39;s latest tete-a-tete with The Incredible Snowflake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She walked back to the bakery racks and placed a handful of croissants on a tray, transferring them to the display case built into the counter.

If his folks hadn&amp;#39;t banged in the parking lot outside that magic shop, my house wouldn&amp;#39;t be covered in balloons and fake flowers and top hats. We can&amp;#39;t even have sex without him pulling a handerchief out of--&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;AHEM!&amp;quot; Melody said, looking toward the patrons in the shop eating their pastries. &amp;quot;Anyway, look, you&amp;#39;re not going to give this up until I say yes, so yes. Dinner. No movie, though. If he puts me to sleep, I&amp;#39;d rather it not be in a dark place he can try to cuddle me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bell rang again and a rather imposing fellow walked in, dressed in black from head to toe, including a black mask covering half his face. There were a few folks who went through that phase, particularly if their powers came as a result of moonless trysts in pitch black rooms. Shadow walkers, invisibles, and the like. He walked up to the counter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to Melody&amp;#39;s. We&amp;#39;ve got a special on day old danish if you&amp;#39;d like to take a few off my hands!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man raised up one hand and said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d rather take your money.&amp;quot; His palm started vibrating the air around it and a darkness began to emanate from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jess screamed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The patrons scrambled and turned over their chairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Melody threw up her hands to cover her face and shouted, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t hurt us!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In an instant, a horrifying squelching, ripping, snapping sound filled the room, accompanied by a loud, gut-wrenching, but oddly brief scream from the man. She felt a spray of warm moisture hit her face and hands but she didn&amp;#39;t open her eyes for fear of what was going to happen to her and her friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A loud thud sounded next and then silence except for the short, heavy breathing of Melody, Jess, and her customers. This, and then a loud cacophony of screams from the other three in the room. Melody opened her eyes and looked at her hands. They were covered in a red liquid. For a brief moment, she almost thought it was strawberry jam like she&amp;#39;d use to fill her donuts. But she quickly realized it was blood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her eyes focused in front of her. There, on the ground, surrounded by the splatters of blood covering the tables and floor and the glass of the big, wide window was...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the man in black. But not him anymore. A torus of human flesh, ripped ebony cloth, bones and viscera and fat. A donut that was once a man but now was that same man, his neck snapped backwards and somehow, grotesquely intertwined with his legs, forming a perfect circle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tip jar crashed to the floor as Melody, grasping for anything to break her fall, crumpled to the ground and fainted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgaxll0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492307311.0, "created_utc": 1492278511.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j0d1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgatu1x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hellsr", "parent_id": "t3_65j0d1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "For my entire life I've wondered what my super power was.
