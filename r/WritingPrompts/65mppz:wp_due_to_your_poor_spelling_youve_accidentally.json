Maybe you should learn how to spell.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cartman sputtered in anger several times before shouting, &amp;quot;Stop interrupting my work, god dammit!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stan just shook his head before wandering off. &amp;quot;Whatever, dude. I&amp;#39;m going home.  I was in the middle of watching VH-1&amp;#39;s Behind the Music on Carlos Santana.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, well, screw you too, hippie! I don&amp;#39;t need your pee-drinking ass anyway!&amp;quot; Cartman scuffed out Stan&amp;#39;s name with his boot and, using his bloodied wand, carved a new name into the mud. &amp;quot;Ess-ay-enn-tee-ay-enn-ay. There we go.&amp;quot; He retrieved his book and held it aloft over his head. &amp;quot;Dark spirits! Bring me the one I have named in the circle! Yes! Yes! Yes! &lt;em&gt;Oh, my god, yes!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was another flash of light, a gust of wind, and deafening thunder. This time, another taller Latino-looking figure appeared in the magic circle. &amp;quot;Hey, man, how&amp;#39;d I get here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cartman once again threw his spellbook to the mud. &amp;quot;Carlos Santana?!
