You'd be so absorbed in the i phone, you wouldn't really feel the cold, until you stopped moving, when you'd finished the Pokemon Go Anon meeting, and it was time to have light supper, of chocolate chip biscuits and go to sleep.\n\nHe looked up from his phone, hoping he'd see a church. When he returned there was a rat looking Pokemon on his phone.\n\nThis time, he thought.\n\nHe caught the rat looking Pokemon with a net, and celebrated heartily, with a stupid, goofy jig. He felt and explosion of relief. He felt a strange up-turning of his lips. He realized it was a smile.\n***\nHe saw a church and rushed towards it. It was minus 13 cee. \"No,\" he muttered, to himself, \"I must classify my Pokemon, the one that looks like a rat.\"\n\nHe opened the book he'd bought off the hipster. \"Rattata,\" he said, \"I have caught a Rattata.\"\n***\n\"My name is Joey,\" said Joey, \"and I have been a Pokemon Go hobo for 2.92 years, and I have one Pokemon.\"\n\nEveryone hushed in the room, trying to repress smug smiles.\n\nCindy was a loud mouth around Pokemon circles, known for smart alec responses and sharp, cutting wit. She had red hair, cut in a bob. She work leather, and denim.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"What did you catch?\"\n\n\"Um,\" said Joey, flicking through his book, \"I've caught something called a Rattata.\"\n\nThe crowd was silent. Then it started - the laughter. It rocked the very foundations of the church. It wasn't mirthful laughter, it was mean laughter, and directed at Joey, and the irony of how hard Joey had worked, only to catch a meagre Pokemon. Now, laughter like that is never pleasant, even to someone who beheld it from a distance, say in the 100 meters surrounding the church.\n\nIt was more than unpleasant for Joey. For, he felt the laughter directed at him. He walked out of the church, through his i phone in the bin, and entered a McDonald's for the Job paper. He was joining the other side. He was going to research group accommodation, and get a job. Maybe I'll work in a factory, he thought.\n\nHe saw a half box of fries, and snatched at them and ate.

The bar tender looked up with a look of resignation; the boys in the corner looked like they were going to try it, with their Electivire and Claydol.  There was always some young punks that thought they could beat that thing...\n\n\"The name's Joey.  I need a room for the night, and the stiffest drink you have.\"\n\nThe boy added a ring to the top; the black crystal set in the ring glimmering faintly.\n\n\"And that's for keeping... our secret.

You're about as good as hiding being a demon as you are when that \"girl\" inevitably comes in here and beats the crap out of you.\"*  \"No-one suspects, as per usual.\"\n\nJoey sipped his drink as the bartender thought about the one time he'd gotten the demon drunk enough to reveal why he did only ever keep those two Rattata. \n\nIt had been a darker night than usual.  The Champion had done the usual when there was a disturbance down at the local pub; send his Latias down in human form (who denied being a Pokemon, which kinda fell apart when she started talking and you realized it was telepathy) to Psyshock half the town.  The kind of thing that tends to happen when you put eleven year olds in charge of an entire country because he can use his pets to hit other pets and then expect them to govern half sensibly.  These days he sent down one of those fancy new pink snowy Ninetales too for the new Rattata that Joey had picked up on holiday.\n\nJoey had once been a brilliant trainer.  Not the \"I got one of my Pokemon to evolve\" kind of good, the \"I took down the old Champion's Landorus in one hit\" kind of good.  And once he'd done that, he had nothing else to do.  His Victini once destroyed half of Nimbasa Town in one V-Create.  His Serperior took down a castle tower with one strike of its tail.  Champion Joey, was in every sense, unbeatable.\n\nSo of course, where to go but to fight the hordes of Hell?  After all, he could beat a Houndoom with his Mienshao any day of the week.  Hell couldn't be that much harder.  So he built a portal, sacrificed a Mareep to the gods and drew a pentagram, and he and his six were transported to Hell itself.\n \nIt turns out that beating Hell is substantially harder than beating a Houndoom.  Even one with a Mega Stone. Joey hadn't given many details but he'd been utterly annihilated by Satan's Sharpedo and given a choice; be cast into one of Hell's many fire pits like his six Pokemon had just been, or be cursed for evermore.  Joey, in his wish to rebuild and crush Satan on his own turf, had chosen the second. \n\nHis curse was to in the Devil's own words: \"Use the most useless excuses for Pokemon that you've ever seen\" forevermore, or until he grew as a person and learned his lesson... or something.  Joey had been rather concerned with his skin getting third degree burns from being dangled over a fire pit and all.\n\nHe both hated his Rattata and loved them; Rodrick and Tracey could be annoying critters, and a liability half the time, but he was impressed by how far they'd come in five hundred years.  The Rattata with maxxed stats wouldn't do a thing against an Elite Four member, but he'd gotten his badges with them, being a good seventy levels above most of the gyms and all.\n\nAnd then Joey had fainted from all the drink he'd taken, and the bartender had set about the business of calling down the champion so his thrice-cursed bird could fix the giant crater that was once a pub.\n\n---\n\nBack in the present, the idiots were going to try it.  Joey and the young punks had cleared out not nearly enough room for a Doubles match in the centre of the pub without putting holes in the establishment they were in.  Fuelled by drink and in the punks' case, their father's trust fund, they were ready.  The bar tender figured he may as well minimise the damage and be the referee.\n\n\"Right, you all know the rules, right?  No fighting on behalf of your Pokemon, no killing, and no touching of the hair or face.\"\n\n\"This is a Doubles battle between Ace Trainers Chad and Brad, against-\"That gay kid\"- Youngster Joey.\"\n\n*Go, Roderick and Tracey!*\n\n*Fucking ruin this kid, Claydol and Electivire!*\n\n*Claydol used Extrasensory!

He'd never been much for battling the things, but it was funny to see Joey at work.

He'd allowed Joey to keep his favourite, his most powerful mon.  After all, it at least *looked* like a Rattata.\n\nThe kids dirty rabbit and flying wrestler thing got taken down in one hit too, and the bartender moved in to clean up before someone worked out that it was a Zoroark, the punks tried fighting Joey hand to hand, he took two souls, Latias destroyed half the pub again and he had to file *another* claim to get it all fixed again.
