Jesus was sitting in the living room, his tools sprawled across the coffee table in front of him. He was building a wood box from scratch. As he tinkered, drilled, hammered, and sanded, I could see the box becoming more refined. *He's good,* I thought to myself before glancing at my water bottle. \n\nIt was blood red, smelling strongly of alcohol. I was in disbelief when I found it earlier this morning, and was even more shocked when I hesitantly tasted it. *Wine?! How could it be wine? I haven't had wine in forever. This makes no sense.* The thought had crossed my mind about Jesus, but I couldn't believe it to be true. Could it really be that Jesus existed here and now, sitting on my couch making a wooden box and paying for half of the utilities? \n\nIt was crazy. Too crazy to be true. But I had to figure it out. \n\nI looked down at the lunch I was fixing: a tuna sandwich on white bread. An idea then crossed my mind, as I took a single piece of bread and covertly tossed the rest of the loaf back into the cabinet. \n\n\"Oh no,\" I said.\n\n\"What?\" I heard Jesus call from the living room.\n\n\"I don't have enough bread to finish my sandwich,\" I said.\n\n\"That sucks.\" \n\n\"Wouldn't it be useful if I could multiply this somehow? It would save me a trip to the store.\" I held my breath, my heart pounding slightly in my chest.\n\n\"That would be useful,\" Jesus replied numbly, his focus attached solely to his box. I exhaled disappointedly. That was anticlimactic. But then another idea crossed my mind, and I threw open the fridge door to grab two water bottles. \n\nI walked into the living room and sat next to Jesus on the couch. I opened a bottle and took a nice, deep sip of the chilled water. Jesus glanced over to me, and I outstretched the hand holding the other bottle. \n\n\"Here, you look like you're thirsty,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, no, I'm good,\" Jesus said quickly. Was it just me, or did he seem nervous? \n\n\"I insist. You're working pretty hard.\" \n\nJesus sighed, and looked at the bottle apprehensively. This time there was no mistaking it. He looked askance, and he knew that he would have to think of some excuse to not take the water. Moments passed, and slowly, he reached his hand out to take the water. Eager, I dropped the bottle in his hand. The water turned blood red the moment the bottle made contact with his skin.\n\n\"Yes! I knew it!\" I said excitedly as I jumped from the couch with triumph. \n\n\"So wait,\" I said, coming back to earth, \" why are you here? Is it going to be your second coming?\"\n\n\"No,\" Jesus replied, smiling slightly. \"We just don't get Netflix in heaven.\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I stood in the kitchen fixing up my lunch, I watched him out of the corner of my eye. Jesus was sitting in the living room, his tools sprawled across the coffee table in front of him. He was building a wood box from scratch. As he tinkered, drilled, hammered, and sanded, I could see the box becoming more refined. &lt;em&gt;He&amp;#39;s good,&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself before glancing at my water bottle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was blood red, smelling strongly of alcohol. I was in disbelief when I found it earlier this morning, and was even more shocked when I hesitantly tasted it. &lt;em&gt;Wine?! How could it be wine? I haven&amp;#39;t had wine in forever. This makes no sense.&lt;/em&gt; The thought had crossed my mind about Jesus, but I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it to be true. Could it really be that Jesus existed here and now, sitting on my couch making a wooden box and paying for half of the utilities? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was crazy. Too crazy to be true. But I had to figure it out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down at the lunch I was fixing: a tuna sandwich on white bread. An idea then crossed my mind, as I took a single piece of bread and covertly tossed the rest of the loaf back into the cabinet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh no,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I heard Jesus call from the living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have enough bread to finish my sandwich,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That sucks.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be useful if I could multiply this somehow? It would save me a trip to the store.&amp;quot; I held my breath, my heart pounding slightly in my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That would be useful,&amp;quot; Jesus replied numbly, his focus attached solely to his box. I exhaled disappointedly. That was anticlimactic. But then another idea crossed my mind, and I threw open the fridge door to grab two water bottles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked into the living room and sat next to Jesus on the couch. I opened a bottle and took a nice, deep sip of the chilled water. Jesus glanced over to me, and I outstretched the hand holding the other bottle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here, you look like you&amp;#39;re thirsty,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, no, I&amp;#39;m good,&amp;quot; Jesus said quickly.
