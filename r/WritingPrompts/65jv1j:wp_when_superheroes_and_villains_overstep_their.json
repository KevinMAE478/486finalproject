Did you know that your aura didn't extend to indirect photos of you?\" Big eyes. \"No, I guessed not. But that's all a moot point now, isn't it?\"  \n  \nAs he admired his trophy, his intercom buzzed. \"What!

The woman gave a look to the window with Jane Doe. But not *at* Jane. In the blink of an eye, the volcano stopped spewing magma and the constant droning that had always permeated Syber's fortres boiled down to a disappointed gurgle. \"Ugh.

You're the boy that has interrupted my monthly online-shopping moment. You know how hard it is to find time for yourself with you youngsters running around and messing things up?\" She paused a moment and took a glance at Jane, who's aura of unidentification completely melted away. \"And you! Snooping away all the best deals in such a way that nobody even knows what they missed? That's just *rude*, young lady!\" Her attention went back to the boy in the way too large chair. \"*Very* disappointed. Your mothers raised the both of you to know better!

Aunt Margaret? But... Mom said you didn't speak anymore? Why didn't you come visit?\"  \n  \nJane Doe shook her head. \"No, there never was an \"Aunt Margaret\". You still don't understand you dumb... \" Silence. More big eyes. The lady had done it again. She had looked at Jane and she started shivering a bit. \"Mind your tongue young lady! No, there never was an \"Aunt Margaret\". If mothers have problems, they come to me for advice, not some silly long lost relative.\"  \n  \nSyber swallowed. \"But... Who are you then? I'm... I'm sorry I had to interrupt your shopping day... Can't we... make a deal... Or...\"  The words left him. The lady was now a mere meter removed from him. Stern, with grey hair and a pair of half glasses on her nose, through which she threw him \"that look\" that made him want to swallow his own tongue and crawl away with his favorite teddy.  \n  \n\"No, you can't. Trying to make a deal *after* you've done naughty is never going to work.\" She grabbed his ear (aa*aauch*) and dragged him to his computer.
