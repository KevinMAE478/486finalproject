Her eyes flicked from blocky headlines to the crowded offset words underneath them. She flipped through page after page and tsked when she saw a name she recognized.\n\nAll those boys were never going to be the same. \n\nShe moved from newspaper to book, curling the arms of her spectacles around her ears and looking down at the pages. For long hours there was nothing but the soft slipping of pages as they turned. Outside, rain slid down grass and wind rattled the window. Flames lowered on their wicks and shadows stretched across the room. With shuddering breath, she finished the book and pushed it across the table away from her. She rose and left the room to seek solace in the dancing light of the fireplace in the study.\n\nErnst sat in his chair, staring into the flames. He looked up as she entered but said nothing. \n\n\"It's worse and worse,\" she said, \"I have not read such vile inhuman words since my training centuries ago. But this is worse than those dark magics. Man has made far more dangerous machines than the waving of a simple wand.\"  She turned to the bookshelves that engulfed the walls of the room.\n\n\"They claim the same technology that churned the bodies of their comrades on the front is the only progress worthy of the name. That humanity has only advanced through violence, that only those who survive the grim embrace of death can ever be prepared for the modern society. A new age.\" She spit the last words from her mouth.\n\n\"Only power and death can remake the world. Only great violence can achieve great change. Only total adherence to their values can purify it.\" Her fingers brushed against the leather binding of one of her spellbooks.\n\n\"They might as well be reading from necronic theory,\" she whispered. \"What have I done, Ernst? What have I done?\"  He was silent.\n\nThe Great War had been such a terrible time.  Germany - surrounded by enemies - had no choice but to fight back. She had thought at first it would be like every other war she had seen in her meandering lifetime. Men would die, lives would be destroyed, and one side would win.  But never before had she seen such terrible slaughter. She still woke up remembering the impossible stream of broken wailing men at the hospital near Verdun.

Her eyes flicked from blocky headlines to the crowded offset words underneath them. She flipped through page after page and tsked when she saw a name she recognized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All those boys were never going to be the same. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She moved from newspaper to book, curling the arms of her spectacles around her ears and looking down at the pages. For long hours there was nothing but the soft slipping of pages as they turned. Outside, rain slid down grass and wind rattled the window. Flames lowered on their wicks and shadows stretched across the room. With shuddering breath, she finished the book and pushed it across the table away from her. She rose and left the room to seek solace in the dancing light of the fireplace in the study.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ernst sat in his chair, staring into the flames. He looked up as she entered but said nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s worse and worse,&amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot;I have not read such vile inhuman words since my training centuries ago. But this is worse than those dark magics. Man has made far more dangerous machines than the waving of a simple wand.&amp;quot;  She turned to the bookshelves that engulfed the walls of the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They claim the same technology that churned the bodies of their comrades on the front is the only progress worthy of the name. That humanity has only advanced through violence, that only those who survive the grim embrace of death can ever be prepared for the modern society. A new age.&amp;quot; She spit the last words from her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Only power and death can remake the world. Only great violence can achieve great change. Only total adherence to their values can purify it.&amp;quot; Her fingers brushed against the leather binding of one of her spellbooks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They might as well be reading from necronic theory,&amp;quot; she whispered. &amp;quot;What have I done, Ernst? What have I done?&amp;quot;  He was silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Great War had been such a terrible time.  Germany - surrounded by enemies - had no choice but to fight back. She had thought at first it would be like every other war she had seen in her meandering lifetime. Men would die, lives would be destroyed, and one side would win.  But never before had she seen such terrible slaughter. She still woke up remembering the impossible stream of broken wailing men at the hospital near Verdun.  Two died for every one she could even begin to examine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally she would have discretely applied her magics to the corpses where she could spirit them away to her laboratories.

In short, modern medicine was needed to keep the subject alive long enough for them to be infused with the fire of life. Cabal had access to a nearly infinite supply of the first - being the star physician had its perks - but the escalation of fighting on the front lines meant he had little time outside of his makeshift clinic to gather the latter. The death of others were substitutes, of course, as he could always borrow his own energy, but he was nearing his 50th birthday and still intended to retire into old age.\n\nA voice broke through Cabal's reverie, \"Doc, we've got another one for you, lost part of his leg when his friend stepped on a landmine. We didn't manage to find any of the parts though...\"\n\nLooking up, Cabal saw Harry - Lieutenant Harry Miles, born on the west coast, age 21 - carrying the bleeding and battered form of a younger boy. The boy was missing a leg, a mess of gauze and field bandages wrapped around the stub to stop him from bleeding out. \n\nCabal looked up at Harry, frowning, \"Harry, I-\"\n\n\"Lieutenant.\" Harry snapped back, out of reflex, before blushing \"Er, sorry. It's been rough out there and I... I kind of had everyone fall into line- had to get them into order so they'd make it through the morning.\"\n\n\"That's perfectly fine, Lieutenant.\" Cabal smiled back at the kid, shaking his head, \"I understand. None of you should be here anyway, there isn't a country in the world worth sending kids to die for it.\"\n\nHarry's back straightened and his face turned hard, \"It's an honour to die for my country, Cabal, you should know that.\"\n\nThe old necromancer sighed to himself, turning to the medical cabinet behind him and taking out several poultices and a clean set of bandages.\n\n\"But, you should also know, I feel like it's my duty to get the rest of these boys home. Right, you old grump?\"\n\nCabal chuckled as he turned back to the wounded the boy, nodding at Harry's smiling face and pointing to an empty cot to the right of the tent. Harry carried the boy over and placed him down with a grunt.\n\nThe wound was bad. The leg was missing from the knee down, but the shrapnel from the landmine was scattered all the way up to his waist, spots of deep red staining his army fatigues. Cutting away the fabric, Cabal shook his head. The flesh underneath was purple and bleeding around the boy's hip and waist, dozens of pieces of metal lodged in a shotgun pattern. The flesh by the knee was green - infected - and quickly going septic, as much bone as metal pierced what remained of the skin and muscle at odd angles.\n\n\"How long did it take for you to find him?\" Cabal said, standing up to face Harry.\n\nThe lieutenant shuffled nervously, \"I-it was a while until my squad hit that part of the line... The kid was in the first wave and we were in the third, so, two or three hours?\"\n\nCabal looked down at the boy again, he was pale and had started shaking violently, sweat pouring off of him as he gasped in breath.\n\nTrying to keep his voice calm and gentle, Cabal sighed, \"There's only one thing I can do with someone like this, Harry.\"\n\n\"You mea- You mean there's nothing you can do to save him? There's only... That?\" Harry paled, swallowing hard as he looked at Cabal, eyes pleading.\n\nHarry knew what Cabal could do - what he was - as did most of the soldiers stationed in the surrounding area. Even his CO knew that what Cabal practiced wasn't traditional medicine. No one cared. In the thick of it all, officers wanted results and soldiers wanted their friends - their brothers - back. It didn't matter that what their medic did was unnatural or wrong, that it made every soldier uneasy to see the old necromancer make his way through the battlefield every night, silencing the moans and screams of friend and foe alike. The ones that made it back always came back kicking, by virtue of medicine or magic, and whatever he did by the pale light of the moon had to be better than dying in agony, alone.\n\nThat's what the soldiers told themselves, at least, while the officers turned a blind eye.\n\nExpression grim, Cabal turned back to the medicine cabinet, \"I'm afraid so, Lieutenant. It's your choice, as much as it can be, though.\"\n\nHarry's shoulders fell, the weight of the decision pressing on him. Cabal hated making the kid choose, but it felt wrong to take a life in the camp when he'd spent so many days, so much sweat and, sometimes, blood, bringing people back from the brink. \n\nCabal had no illusions that it was a cheap move to make someone not even half his age bear that guilt. It didn't stop him from doing it.\n\nThe lieutenant straightened as Cabal returned with materials of necromancy instead of medicine, steeling himself as he made his decision.\n\n\"If you think it will save someone else, do it.\"\n\n\"It's not about what I thi-\"\n\n\"Damn it Cabal! Do it, take his life so you can give someone else theirs back!\" Harry shouted as he turned, too late to hide his tears, and stalked out into the camp.\n\nFor a moment, Cabal remained motionless, staring out the tent flap after the young lieutenant. The dying soldier's gasps turned to cries as the adrenaline and shock lapsed into real, tangible pain, pulling Cabal back to the present. He pulled a knife from the bundle he'd gotten from the medicine cabinet and plunged it into the soldier's chest, face carefully stoic as he spoke.\n\n\"I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:\n\nI will respect the hard-won knowledge of those in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.\n\nI will remember that there is art to my practice as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh my hand, as the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.\n\nI will not be ashamed to say \"I can do no more,\" nor will I fail to call in my contemporaries when the skills of another are needed for a subject's recovery.\n\nI will respect the privacy of my subject's final moments, for their death is not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life. Above all, I must not play at neither God nor the Reaper.\n\nI will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family - by blood or by bond.\n\nI will prevent decay whenever I can but I will always look for a path to a cure for Death, as such is the force that I would control.\n\nI will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.\n\nIf I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected or feared while I live and forgotten though I may become thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest practices of my calling and may I long experience the trials of helping those who seek it.\"\n\nThe cries died as he recited his makeshift oath, life flooding into him through the knife as it left the soldier's body.

Not that anyone talked to *me* about it\u2014I merely put my good ear to the minute cracks of the roof of the cathedral where I had been squatting.  (No, not THAT kind of squatting...although I suppose a man must relieve himself now and again.)  Come Sunday morning, everyone liked to prattle to each other as loudly as they could up to the organist's first shrieking note, and the cathedral's acoustics were most superb!\u3000There was, however, a much greater perk to scaling the church's exterior every night and sleeping atop it every day: the bodies.\n\n\u3000That a cemetery occupies the rear of a cathedral's property is common knowledge.  Of course, grave-robbers had to ruin much of the fun by prompting the reverent to erect metal cages over the caskets.  Still, the cadavres' tosses and turns in their coffins thudded quite clearly through the cast-iron bars.  There remained a few bell systems attached to some of the Enlightenment-Period graves; though I much desired to awake said graves' occupants and soil the pants of the resident clerics at the sound of the tinkly little gadgets, I knew better than to arouse their attention.\n\n\u3000So I restricted myself to digging close enough to the bellless sepulchres to hear the thuds of the properly dead.  It still gave me an incomparable high: knowing something one shouldn't, and putting that knowledge to use.  Girls are given dolls and tea cups, but boys are often left to the outdoors and their imagination.  Should you give us nothing to play with, sooner or later, we'll play with you instead.\n\n\u3000Such is how this former boy became a necromancer.\n\n\u3000Let us advance to the day of one of the most gruesome battles of the war.  (I know there are plenty to choose from; I won't divulge which, seeing as I rather like my spot atop the cathedral and wish to be neither disturbed nor detained.)  The guns' blaze was heard kilometres away.  Every civilian had already retreated to their domestic sanctuaries: indeed, I stayed prostate on the roof for many days at a time as gargoyles ate many a bullet.  I was starving and parched, but not desperate enough to open my mouth to crossfire!\n\n\u3000Once one side retreated and the other side finished raking their hands through the church's coffer (truly the first time this heathen pitied those pious fools), they, too vacated our war-torn hometown.  We were left with deep trenches in the mud and hundreds of the losing side's late troops strewn about, lying lopsided.  Once I peeked my head up to view the carnage, an indignant rage boiled within me as I observed a two-meter trench that snaked its way through *my* precious graveyard.\n\n\u3000My ears blown from the repercussions, I could not hear but could only feel my unrestrained cries of grief, set to the mere word \"no.\"  I scaled down the church in plain sight, and I felt the townsfolk's shell-shocked yet mildly curious gaze.  I didn't care who was watching as I stormed into the trench and wailed over the disorder.  I took *great* pride in knowing my puppets' names and exact placements.  Now, a bunch of nameless p\u00e6ons were about to fill the serpentine pattern at the hands of the undertaker.  Furthermore, with all the funerary ceremonies of dropping in the bodies, covering them over, and praying for their souls and loved ones, I would not have access for a while to my instruments of play.\n\n\u3000Somewhere along the line, I must have expanded my vocabulary past \"no.\"  In fact, I must have experienced what they call a \"Freudian slip,\" and raised all the dead at once by an unintended incantation.  Every single man of uniform, be he Central or Allied, headshot or bled-out, rose at my subconscious's command.  The world was going to feel my wrath through my arm of the dead, if I had any say in it...that is, until I found my arms raised in the air and the dead standing, and realized I did *not* have a say in it, overall.\n\n\u3000Everyone's jaws dropped, if not their whole bodies in a nervous fainting spell.  Their eyes fluttered back and forth between me and the functional necrotic flesh.  *O, merde!* I screamed internally (and this time I kept it inside me).  I vigorously flipped through the tome of my mind, hoping to find some way to avoid being lynched by the pious folk, or at least being captured and experimented upon by the government's branch of intelligence.\n\n\u3000The page I landed on was quite a half-baked idea, but in hindsight, I gather it worked well enough.  *Just feign surprise*, I boasted; *don't know what to do with yourself, and they won't know what to do with you, either.*\n\n\u3000Next thing I know, I waved my arms about much like a flustered chicken would its wings.  My gawking, I imagine, was not unlike a chicken, either: \"O!  O!  OOOOO!\"  Once I recomposed myself *un peu*, I ran to the equally bemused-looking corpses, their faces contorted in a slight grimace, but their dull eyes (for those who had any) fixed on every of my slightest movements.  My hands furiously padded the clothed, rotting meat, as if I were rushing to find and treat a mortal wound.  I removed pieces of their clothing to wrap around the most apparent areas of damage.  After pulling a menagerie of dubious examination techniques from my sleeves, I finished each \"patient\" by smudging their top eyelids out of the way and glancing over their pupils.  I turned my gaze back to the crowd and said, \"They're just shell-shocked.\"\n\n\u3000And they *bought* it.  Perhaps with a little hesitation, they gently clapped their hands and softly whooped in celebration.  They came and wrapped their arms around me, although they dared not come closer to the wounded soldiers\u2014doing so might have broken the illusion of their own making.  I felt cramped and a tiny bit agitated as they embraced me, but I simply grinned and bore it, as the new town hero would.\n\n\u3000Of course, not even knowing of my residence in their town, they have since barraged me with the usual questions: my name, my occupation, my alma mater where I received my all-too-credible medical training.  As a ninth-generation necromancer, I was taught never to tell my true name to anyone unless I plan to wed them.  One's true name is a source of power over them; the Hebrews have known this, in their refusal to pronounce the Tetragrammaton.  Thus, in an instant, I became *[redacted for anonymity]*, farmer's son taught in medicine at l'University de *[name of saint to whom my cathedral was dedicated]* because of a fortunate run-in with a generous would-be patron; unable to establish a medical practice out of poverty due to the planned closure of our financial agreement.\n\n\u3000Of course, the franc-pinchers never offered to donate money towards establishing a practice.  (Well, the clergy proposed it, but many an excuse was made by the laypeople.)  They were instead quick to suggest I join the medical corps of the French Republican army, and despite some demurring of my own, they persisted until I rather stupidly said \"yes.\"\n\n\u3000So now, I come to a crossroads: do I pose as a medic to resurrect the newly deceased and keep them fighting after brain-death, or do I continue to spy on the churchgoers every Sunday morning and squat upon their holy house?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u3000I remember it like it was yesterday.

Thus, in an instant, I became &lt;em&gt;[redacted for anonymity]&lt;/em&gt;, farmer&amp;#39;s son taught in medicine at l&amp;#39;University de &lt;em&gt;[name of saint to whom my cathedral was dedicated]&lt;/em&gt; because of a fortunate run-in with a generous would-be patron; unable to establish a medical practice out of poverty due to the planned closure of our financial agreement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u3000Of course, the franc-pinchers never offered to donate money towards establishing a practice.  (Well, the clergy proposed it, but many an excuse was made by the laypeople.)  They were instead quick to suggest I join the medical corps of the French Republican army, and despite some demurring of my own, they persisted until I rather stupidly said &amp;quot;yes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u3000So now, I come to a crossroads: do I pose as a medic to resurrect the newly deceased and keep them fighting after brain-death, or do I continue to spy on the churchgoers every Sunday morning and squat upon their holy house?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg8ryai", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492174067.0, "created_utc": 1492145267.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655cnn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9i8xu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jquiz1852", "parent_id": "t3_655cnn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Another 105 men returned to the front this morning.
