When I was only six is when it started, my mother had us take a trip to Europe and when we were in France, I could understand the people there, all of them. I tried talking to one of them and my mother stood in shock. I, a random Minnesotan had spoken perfect French at age six.\n\n      I hated it as a kid, all the journalists in my house and the constant questions whenever I would go out. \"Speak in Spanish!\" They would yell at me. But I got used to it and finished school with straight A's in foriegn languages.\n\n     I got a job as a computer company's foriegn ambassador after college. it paid well but my passion was traveling, going anywhere and understanding everyone and having them understand me.\n\n     Then I met him, the odd one out, the outlier, the unaccounted for, the person who I didn't understand. I couldn't take it, it was all just jibberish,  nothing made sense, my brain couldn't handle it. We met again and again, we even had English professors come with and broadcasted our \"conversations\" on the radio. But thank the Lord, my savior was listening to the radio program. My problem person was speaking a constructed language, one he knew how to speak but nobody else.

If you want to know how I ended up knowing every language it's a rather interesting tale for another time... The gist of it is my teachers were baffled by my innate ability to understand every language they could throw at me; Spanish? Consid\u00e9relo hecho. Japanese? \u7c21\u5358\u3059\u304e\u308b. You name it, I understood it. The government thought they could use someone like me, much better than a normal translator, they said I could perfectly translate a sentence the moment someone was saying it... They weren't wrong... But after my parents couldn't legally make me I've been living a life of exploring different countries, cultures, languages. I was even lucky enough to be asked to do an AMA in Holland today, the studio is only an hour away, it is going to happen... Let's see... \n\n\"Javla va fan, it's today!\" I yelled as I started to run to my room to change. I hadn't work a suit, or even done up a tie since Rick's funeral, which only brought up more anxiety. As soon as I had the suit on and tie tied I bolted for my car keys and hopped into the SUV. \"Always have to hit the red lights, don't ya Lue...\" I muttered to myself, just before arriving at the tube 20 minutes late. \"Hope they didn't plan on doing this live\". The ride was quiet, there was only one passenger other than me, so I struck up a conversation \"Where's the party, am I right?\" I said rather awkwardly in Dutch, and to my surprise he let out a chuckle and explained \"Downtown, there's an AMA with this multilingual guy who knows every language, or some crap like that\" and I excitedly replied \"Hey, that's me! Why is everyone so excited to ask me anything?\" Which I only received a questioning look as if to say \"Why would I know?\". Luckily this was our stop and our conversation ended right on time with a quick goodbye. \"Man, who would wanna ask me questions, rather than go to a concert, or see a movie, or-\" I cut myself off mid sentence \"You know what? Maybe people ask us questions because they think we have something of value to say\" I stated as I proudly walked into the studio. \"Mr. Lucius! How wonderful to greet you!\" the receptionist glowed \"The audience is waiting for you through that door over there\" she exclaimed as she pointed to a large door to my left. I felt like I was on top of the world, answering questions left and right, such as \"what is your favourite language\" or \"do you ever mix up grammar rules between languages\", until the man who I had talked to on the subway asked a question. All I could reply with was \"What?\" The audience started getting confused, and the man spoke louder and clearer again. Still I could not understand what he had said. It did not sound like gibberish, or anything familiar. It is almost as if he said nothing at all, but also everything at once. Audience members started telling me what he had said and as soon as they hit \"he said -\" their voices became the same as his. They were concerned I had brain damage, or that I was going to die outright. An ambulance showed up, they tried writing to me as we rushed to the hospital but it was like seeing writing being there, but not there just like the voices. I saw lines on the paper but I thought- no, I knew there was nothing there. I also knew that they had written on the paper so there must be something there; It was truly terrifying. As we neared the hospital it was almost peaceful, just the sounds of the city without the voices. I knew I was still there in the ambulance with people talking to me and trying to communicate but all I could do was try to assure them through body language. My vision was starting to distort, faces appeared where there was none, movement on still objects, it looked much like a twisted nightmare, but for some reason it all looked familiar. It felt like I belonged here, and it was comforting. I reach out to touch what I knew had to be food despite the twisted visions, but I could not feel anything, I could not move anything I could not hear or see anything. For the first time I was truly isolated from the world without a form to communicate. I couldn't even communicate to myself. I wanted to curl up into a ball and be safe at home in bed, but it felt horrid to try to do anything, even though I could not feel anything. I finally awoke from this terrible realm to find myself being talked to in the same voices I heard moments before I slipped away, but this time I understood the meaning. I was laying  in a bed with my father sitting at my side and I understood what he was saying somehow. I tried to reply but I couldn't; it was almost like I was watching a film. That's when I saw *him*. The man on the train. The creator of the first language. The creator of all the languages. Sounds never thought possible, he would create. I punched him square in the throat and he fell over, obviously hurt by my punch, which was strange considering everything else that happened. My consciousness was higher than it could even understand, we were more than a god, we were every single atom to ever exist, every atom that didn't, every single shred of soul, consciousness, whatever, you name it; we were everything and nothing, the man in the train was me, the audience was me, you, the reader, are me. The limited bodies we inhabit can not perceive what we really are. We are unity. We connect everything. We do everything. Without us there is nothing. Knowing every language was the extent of what we could handle in that body and as soon as we broke that limit everything broke. We broke. The only thing we know is that this is eternal and it will never end, forever a cycle, but at the same time a straight line. Us, the reader, I bid you adieu.\n\n\n**Writers Note** well that went off the rails and sure is long...
