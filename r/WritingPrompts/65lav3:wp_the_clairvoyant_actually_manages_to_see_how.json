It was miles away and the darkness\u2014\n\nI let go of her hands, my heart pounding. \"Can we\"\u2014I cleared my throat\u2014\"try the bracelet?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Livia dug around in her designer purse, pulled out a silver box, and opened it with a soft *click*. A pearl bracelet sat inside. She gingerly lifted it up and passed it to me.\n\nOne touch and sparks jumped through my fingers. I drew back, shaking my hand.\n\n\"I just want to know how she is.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" I let out an exasperated breath. \"Sorry, ma'am, I'm working on it.\" Gently, I wrapped my fingers around the pearls, ignoring the electric pain shooting through my spine. \"Why don't you\u2014 God.\" My head was spinning. \"Sorry. Could you tell me a little about your grandma, then?\"\n\nThe woman was holding a blood soaked tissue. I blinked, and it cleared into a Kleenex. \"She was just such a wonderful lady. Brilliant, too, always telling the most whimsical stories of her home back in Italy.\"\n\n\"Italy,\" I whispered, my voice scratchy. \"Nice.\" The walls trembled before falling into dust around me as the ceiling was swept into oblivion. Shadowy hands reached out, brushing my ankles, and flames licked my hair.\n\nThen it was gone. My chair was shoved back from the table, the bracelet on the floor. \"This is quite a show,\" the woman said, checking her delicate wristwatch, \"but I\u2014 \"\n\n\"Your grandma's in Hell.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"What?\" I cleared my throat. \"Italy. Did she by chance live near a vineyard?\"\n\nHer forehead furrowed. \"Yes, she did. She visited it as a little girl.\"\n\nLucky guess. I grabbed the bracelet and the world fell away screaming. Shrieks came from the cracks in the earth, and a rippling figure emerged from the blackness.\n\nIt was a thin old lady, a cashmere coat hanging on her shoulders. Black sunglasses were perched on her prominent nose, swallowing up her small face. Her skin was a surprisingly unwrinkled tan; her grey hair was pulled into a wispy bun.\n\nA cigarette dangled between her fingers, and she brought it to her bright red lips before beckoning me forward.\n\nI walked towards her cautiously, looking over my shoulder, then at my surroundings.\n\nThe old lady gave me a disapproving look. \"Livia sent you, no?\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\"\n\n\"Tell that dumb *puttana* to stay out my money. I never liked her or her *coglione* husband.\" She waved her hand and I fell sideways off the edge of Hell.\n\nI gasped, back in the room.\n\n\"Did you see her?\" Livia questioned anxiously. \"My dear grandmother?\"\n\n\"She called you a bitch.\"\n\n\"*Excuse* me?\"\n\n\"Huh? She was very rich. She said *rich*.\"\n\nAn arched eyebrow lifted. \"Did she?\"\n\n\"Livia,\" I said gently. \"I know this is very hard for you.\"\n\n\"Hard?\"\n\n\"It's always difficult to lose someone you care about.\"\n\nThe woman nodded. \"Of course. Thank you for understanding.\" \n\n\"Did your grandma wear cashmere?\"\n\n\"Actually, she did have this one coat. Very nice; I\u2014 after her death, well, we never could find it.\"\n\n\"Was it resistant to fire?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Nothing, nothing.\" I sighed, leaning back in my chair. \"What about Prada? Handbags, shoes, whatnot?\"\n\nShe gave me a curious look. \"I'm sorry, what does this have to do with\u2014 \"\n\n\"Please.

It was miles away and the darkness\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I let go of her hands, my heart pounding. &amp;quot;Can we&amp;quot;\u2014I cleared my throat\u2014&amp;quot;try the bracelet?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course.&amp;quot; Livia dug around in her designer purse, pulled out a silver box, and opened it with a soft &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;. A pearl bracelet sat inside. She gingerly lifted it up and passed it to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One touch and sparks jumped through my fingers. I drew back, shaking my hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I just want to know how she is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah.&amp;quot; I let out an exasperated breath. &amp;quot;Sorry, ma&amp;#39;am, I&amp;#39;m working on it.&amp;quot; Gently, I wrapped my fingers around the pearls, ignoring the electric pain shooting through my spine. &amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t you\u2014 God.&amp;quot; My head was spinning. &amp;quot;Sorry. Could you tell me a little about your grandma, then?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman was holding a blood soaked tissue. I blinked, and it cleared into a Kleenex. &amp;quot;She was just such a wonderful lady. Brilliant, too, always telling the most whimsical stories of her home back in Italy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Italy,&amp;quot; I whispered, my voice scratchy. &amp;quot;Nice.&amp;quot; The walls trembled before falling into dust around me as the ceiling was swept into oblivion. Shadowy hands reached out, brushing my ankles, and flames licked my hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it was gone. My chair was shoved back from the table, the bracelet on the floor. &amp;quot;This is quite a show,&amp;quot; the woman said, checking her delicate wristwatch, &amp;quot;but I\u2014 &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your grandma&amp;#39;s in Hell.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I cleared my throat. &amp;quot;Italy. Did she by chance live near a vineyard?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her forehead furrowed. &amp;quot;Yes, she did. She visited it as a little girl.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucky guess. I grabbed the bracelet and the world fell away screaming. Shrieks came from the cracks in the earth, and a rippling figure emerged from the blackness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a thin old lady, a cashmere coat hanging on her shoulders. Black sunglasses were perched on her prominent nose, swallowing up her small face. Her skin was a surprisingly unwrinkled tan; her grey hair was pulled into a wispy bun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A cigarette dangled between her fingers, and she brought it to her bright red lips before beckoning me forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked towards her cautiously, looking over my shoulder, then at my surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old lady gave me a disapproving look. &amp;quot;Livia sent you, no?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes ma&amp;#39;am.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell that dumb &lt;em&gt;puttana&lt;/em&gt; to stay out my money. I never liked her or her &lt;em&gt;coglione&lt;/em&gt; husband.&amp;quot; She waved her hand and I fell sideways off the edge of Hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gasped, back in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did you see her?&amp;quot; Livia questioned anxiously. &amp;quot;My dear grandmother?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She called you a bitch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Excuse&lt;/em&gt; me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Huh? She was very rich. She said &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An arched eyebrow lifted. &amp;quot;Did she?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Livia,&amp;quot; I said gently. &amp;quot;I know this is very hard for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hard?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s always difficult to lose someone you care about.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman nodded. &amp;quot;Of course. Thank you for understanding.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did your grandma wear cashmere?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Actually, she did have this one coat. Very nice; I\u2014 after her death, well, we never could find it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Was it resistant to fire?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing, nothing.&amp;quot; I sighed, leaning back in my chair. &amp;quot;What about Prada? Handbags, shoes, whatnot?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She gave me a curious look. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, what does this have to do with\u2014 &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please. Humor me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She had an... extensive collection, one might say.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shook my head, smiling in disbelief. &amp;quot;Have you ever\u2014 Ma&amp;#39;am, have you ever heard that the Devil wears Prada?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgc0ujf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492378058.0, "created_utc": 1492349258.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
