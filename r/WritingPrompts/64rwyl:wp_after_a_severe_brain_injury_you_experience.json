The doctor had come to check on me and was amazed that I was awake.  He had just been conversing with my mother, or I assumed he was.  Time seemed to move at different increments for me.  He had said I had an Aneurysm. Which at my age was rare, but not unheard of.  The prognosis, hell my survival, even functional survival, was quite low.  He had asked her about organ donations.\n\nThe doctor had come back into the room at some point to check on me and found me with my eyes open.  I had been staring at what I assumed to be a grease stain on the wallpaper.  There was a chair up against the wall and the stain would have been at head level for an unknown number of people that had sat in that chair.  I wondered how many had sat there and banged their heads against the wall in frustration.  \n\nThe doctor pulled a chrome pen light from his white lab coat and shined the light directly into my eyes.  He pulled the beam away, only to repeat the process three or four more times.  \n\n\"...avid?  Can you hear me?\"  He said.  His face was inches from mine. \n\nMy eyes focused on the stethoscope that was draped over his shoulder.  I could tell that his name tag was black plastic with his name carved into a lower white layer, but I couldn't seem to focus on the name.  \n\n\"Thirsty,\" I mumbled.\n\n\"Yes, quite.\" \n\nAdjacent to the bed was a pitcher of ice chips that had partially melted.  The doctor poured the icy water into a clear plastic cup.  My lips felt dried and cracking, my mouth was gummy, almost dry to the point where my lips didn't want to part.  I felt like a man lost in a desert that just found a palm tree lined oasis.  I felt my tongue moisten in anticipation.   \n\nThe doctor loomed over the side of the bed with the cup in hand.  He tilted it back, and drained the cup down his throat.  He grabbed the pitcher and removed the plastic lid.  With his head tilted back the doctor held the pitcher up to his mouth and started to bang against the bottom of it in order to dislodge any of the melt water or weak ice into his gullet.  \n\n\"Doctor Ryan?\"  A nurse with a pink and purple floral scrub top said.  She walked in as the doctor began digging out a piece of ice that was stuck along the bottom wall of the pitcher with his fingers.\n\n\"Hmm?\" \n\n\"Are you-, are you all right doctor?\"\n\n\"Oh, what?  Yes.  I'm fine, just thirsty really.  We seem to be all out of water.\"\n\n\"The patient is awake?\"\n\nClarity seemed to return the doctor as soon as he set the pitcher back on the counter top.  His focus turned back to me and then to the machine that was monitoring my heart beat.  \n\n\"You're truly an amazing fellow, David.  Not many people survive the type of head trauma that you've had.  Can you tell me how you feel?\"\n\nI know my mouth moved, but I didn't really feel anything leave it. At least not in my own voice.  It felt hollow, almost like there was an echo to my words.  I muttered \"Swell.\"\n\n\"That's great noose Davib.  I'd blike to bun someb ests on ooo.\"\n\nMy eyes came further into focus.  I watched as the doctor's face began to swell up around his lips and eyes.  He looked like a man that just took a punch from Tyson and then asked for another.  \n\n\"Doctor Ryan!\"  The nurse shouted.  \"Are you alright?  You look like you're having an allergic reaction.\"\n\n\"Ooo, I'b fibe.\"\n\n\"You most certainly are not!\"  \n\nThe young nurse dragged the doctor out of the room by his wrists, leaving me alone with my thirst.  I tried to crawl out of bed, slowly I placed my right foot against the cold linoleum followed by my left foot.  There was a wobble in my legs that ran from my ankles to my knees.  I felt heavy and my legs felt like jello.  The gave out on me and I fell to the floor.  By the grace of God or some saint that took pity on me, I didn't rip out the catheter but I did spill the bag across the floor.  \n\nAn orderly rushed into the room at the sound of me hitting the floor.  To his credit he was quick to move.  He was by my side and tried to help me back into the bed.  I lifted my wet hand up to my face and I could smell it.  What ever drugs they had given made me urine smell worse than a night of eating nothing but asparagus. \n\n\"Aww, piss,\" I said in disgust. I flicked the liquid from my hands.  \n\nThe orderly stood there for a moment and the front of his trousers turned a darker shade of blue.         \n\nAt first I figured it was just a coincidence.  But something in my brain seemed to click on.  If my brain was an engine it had never fired on all the cylinders before this point.  But now it was.  \n\n\"Jump,\" my echo voice said.  I watched as the man jumped up and then splashed down onto the mess below his feet.  \n\nIt didn't take long for me to understand.  Complete sentences didn't matter, but the final word did.  It was like I was issuing an order that people obeyed without realization.  They seemed to fill in the context of my command but it wasn't always what I wanted.  When I asked if someone could get me a car, the attending doctor held out the key fob to his Mercedes.   \n\nI thought long and hard about what I was experiencing.

I wasn't sure if I should post it as a top thread or as a comment to my original story.  I hope I chose correctly.  \n\nPart 2, The Story of David.\n\nI don't think I ever really abused my new found gift, but I won't lie, mistakes were made. And perhaps the US may have tried to kill me, twice.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Stop clucking and sit down, I'll tell you the next chapter of my story.\n\nI spent three more weeks in the hospital until the doctors were ready to let me go home.  I had stopped speaking almost all together out of fear that I might say something snarky, only to have the people around me take it seriously.  The last thing I wanted to do is watch someone literally try and stick their head up their ass.  I started to rely more on the written word to convey my needs and feelings.  The hospital staff passed it off as changes in my brain chemistry following my aneurysm.  The few times I would speak it would be something benign that I wanted. Something that would be within reason for a patient to ask for.  Things like chocolate cake or a soda.  I learned very early to ask for soda and not Coke after a very eager phlebotomist pulled a tiny baggy of nose candy out of his waist band.  \n\nAlso, to everyone here, I want you to listen very closely to me.  It's called soda, not pop.  If you ever say pop again you are to immediately flick your right ear until it hurts.  Got that?  Soda, okay?\n\nRight, where was I?  Right, right, the day I was discharged.  The doctors and nurses all gathered around me to wish me well, they congratulated themselves and patted each other on the back.  I can't blame them, they saved me and then they survived me, they deserved a check or two in the old win column.  \n\nIt was my first night home when I found that my new gift had begun to manifest itself to a greater extent.  I could add simple, non-complex, phrases to my growing power.  Sure you could say it was a blessing, I could have more control over my gift, but the learning curve was steep on this one.  I was at my mother's house, sitting on the corner of the twin bed that was in my old bedroom.  My eyes had fixated on a poster tacked to the wall, I think it may have been Carmen Electra from her days back at MTV. And I was thinking about what it would take to drive out to LA and find the person responsible for replacing music videos with thirty-three seasons of the Real World when my mom walked in the room.  She asked me how I was doing and I said three words that I've regretted every day since they left my mouth.\n\n\"Leave me alone.\"\n\nShe walked out of the room, grabbed her keys and drove as far away from me as possible.  I'd pay good money to go back and say something like \"Have a good life,\" or \"Invest in Amazon.\"  Anything other than accidentally banishing her from my life.   \n\nSo there I was.  A twenty something college drop out with no career aspects who just ruined his mother's life.  In the hope that she'd return one day, I decided I couldn't stay at her house.  My apartment lease was canceled at some point during my hospital stay, so I would need to find a place to live.  But to do that I needed money.\n\nNow I could have simply walked up to strangers and asked for their wallets, but honestly, I'd like to see my Mom again someday and I'd rather she didn't think of me as a petty criminal.  \n\nI found that my new voice could do more than order people to carry out my whims.  There was a kid, I don't know who, just some kid.  And he had fallen off of his bike right next to my car.  His knee was scraped pretty bad and the boy was crying at the sight of his blood.  \n\nI had a first aid kit behind the bench seat of my El Camino so I grabbed it and set out to help the kid.  \n\n\"Let's stop that bleeding,\" I said.  \n\nThe blood, it listened to me.  The trickle from his knee stopped. I wanted to try something, what's the worst that could happen?\n\n\"Heal,\" I commanded his knee.  The scraped layer of skin was quickly replaced by a new, pink, layer.  \n\nNow I know what you're thinking.  Never do something for free, right? No, only me?  I bet you are now.\n   \nWell my own hospital bills were nearly three hundred thousand dollars and I needed the money and I loathed the idea that the hospital had charged me $700 for a bottle of aspirin. So I set out to take a little business away from the hospital.  While I couldn't accept insurance, I could heal a person for pennies on the dollar compared to the hospital.  And lets face it, when you're about to start your fifth round of chemo and some wise guy hands you a card that says 'I will heal you for $5000, Money Back Guarantee!\" you might just be willing to part with the cash.  \n\nNow, I'm not saying things got out of hand, but I think you might all have heard of my stint as a faith healer?  I set up a big top tent, the kind that circuses pack with eager kids that want to see a troupe of twenty clowns file out of a tiny car.\n\nThere were signs set up all over the county offering a healing touch to those in need.  Of course there was a cover charge.  Nothing that was exploitative.   But if you had suffered with arthritis or even heart disease, what was two hundred dollars in order to walk again or eat another cheese burger?\n\nThe first person I healed was an old lady, kind as a kitten, but with a spine as crooked as wall street.  She leaned her weight against her walker and with a shaking hand she reached out to me and took me by the hand. I could see it in her eyes, she wanted to believe in me.  She needed some hope, some relief from the pain that was everyday life for her.\n\n\"You're healed,\"  I said in a whispered voice. That old lady stood up straight for the first time in thirty years and did a jig in front of an audience of five hundred.  \n\nMy crowd went wild with cheers and applause.  The next was a man who had lost the use of his right arm after a stroke.\n\n\"You're healed!\"  I shouted as I placed my hand over his face.  \n\nPeople pushed their way towards the stage and I closed my eyes.  I started shouting and pointing at random.  \"You get a heal, and you get a heal, and you get a heal!  Everyone gets to be healed today!  Pah-Raise David!\"\n\nOkay, you're right.  Things did get out of hand.  I can admit that.  I took things a step to far.\n\nEveryone in the tent stopped pushing and shoving for the stage and in unison, like an army of robots, every person under that tent began to chant \"Praise David\" over and over again.\n\nThe chanting only ended after I told everyone to go home and go back to living their lives.  \n\nIt was the third stop on my tour, just outside of Charlotte when someone with authority and enough push to send the military figured I needed to be stopped.  The crowd had gone home for the night and I was standing on my stage just taking in the view of those five hundred empty chairs.  Three flash bang grenades rolled into the tent and exploded.  The rubber pellets of the grenades peppered the side of my face and arms.  The flash forced my eyelids shut.  And a team of Navy Seals rushed the stage with their weapons drawn and half a dozen red laser dots pointed at my heart and head.\n\nThere was a feedback loop running through the speakers.  The sound system was still on.  I shouted as loud as I could and hoped that my voice would reach the microphone.  \n\"Heeeeeeeeeey!\"  I shouted as the Seals rushed me.  \"Macarena!\"\n\n\"Aight!\"  Twelve Seals sounded off as one.  \n\nMy vision returned in time to watch a dozen of the most highly trained warriors on the planet drop their weapons and place their hands on their shoulders and then hips.  They jumped to face sideways and began to gyrate before they began to repeat the dance moves.\n\nIt was at this point that I knew it was time to lay low.  The kindly helicopter pilot that flew the strike team to my tent had enough fuel to get me to New York and from there I jumped the border into Canada.   It was somewhere in Nova Scotia when the second attempt was made on me.  Her name was Claire Fontaine.  She was an assassin, deaf since birth, and possibly the best chance that anyone had to silence me.  But that's a story for another time and it's about time you all forget about me.\n    \n\n", "edited": 1492010232.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People asked for a part 2, so I wrote a part 2.

I'd even have settled for civil discourse or even 'Yo mama,' jokes.\n\nBut the sound system was still on.  Cranked up to eleven if there ever was a setting.  And it was loud enough to overcompensate the noise canceling headphones they wore.  I didn't shout Macarena.  I shouted something that should have been on my list of words to never say.\n\n\"Stop!\" I called out.  \n\nThe words left my throat not as a command but as a summation of my fears.
