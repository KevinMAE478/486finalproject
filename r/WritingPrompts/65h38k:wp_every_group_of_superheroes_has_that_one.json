It was all I could do, I told myself, all I could ever do.\n\n**\n\n'Joe - please take a seat.'

If any one - any other one - of your team-mates had been so close to Jenny...\"\n\nHe stopped, sensing the spike in my heart-rate. Arturo's senses were like no other, literally, and he used them to good effect as a team leader.\n\n\"I am sorry, Joe, but you know it is true.

Jenny could have taken the shot herself for all we know.\" he stood up, grabbing a file and a stamp from his shelf \"I am placing you on temporary leave while we figure this out. You are dismissed.\"\n\nWithout saying anything else, I stood up, saluted and left. I kept my head down until I reached the front entrance of headquarters, all too aware of my recent reputation. Nobody would understand, but more importantly, nobody could know. As I walked down the steps to the main square, my mind raced with possibilities and I struggled to shut them out. The future was constantly in flux. Like threads of a spider web with the present at the center, alternative timelines branched out in every direction, crossed over in complicated ways, vanished into the distance. Constantly, in my minds eye - I could see them; visions of the future, or, more accurately, possible futures. I only wish that had been the extent of my 'gift', that I had ignored it from the very start and never learned its power. But from a young age, I began to realize that I could select them at will. Not just futures that affected me, but everyone around me. The decision was irreversible. The pressure was constant. At any waking moment, I had it in my power to change the outcome of the near future. To pick a new timeline, transition to an alternative. Like the philosophical problem of the runaway cart - inaction becomes action. How could I ignore a looming future full of terror and pain? To look away and change nothing is to decide on that future. To decide on another future is to make that decision with incomplete information. Jenny's death was a choice between evils; my choice. By the time I was able to make a decision, only one of a few distinct possibilities were going to happen - and her death was the least destructive option. \n\nNobody knows the influence I have had on their lives. Nobody knows the decisions I have made, or the power I have. If they did - they would hate me, fear me, maybe they'd expect me to save them from everything. Maybe they'd just kill me. Who knows? Maybe that would be for the best.\n", "edited": 1492237088.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world seemed to grind to a halt when the bullet hit Jenny&amp;#39;s chest.

As I walked down the steps to the main square, my mind raced with possibilities and I struggled to shut them out. The future was constantly in flux. Like threads of a spider web with the present at the center, alternative timelines branched out in every direction, crossed over in complicated ways, vanished into the distance. Constantly, in my minds eye - I could see them; visions of the future, or, more accurately, possible futures. I only wish that had been the extent of my &amp;#39;gift&amp;#39;, that I had ignored it from the very start and never learned its power. But from a young age, I began to realize that I could select them at will. Not just futures that affected me, but everyone around me. The decision was irreversible. The pressure was constant. At any waking moment, I had it in my power to change the outcome of the near future. To pick a new timeline, transition to an alternative. Like the philosophical problem of the runaway cart - inaction becomes action. How could I ignore a looming future full of terror and pain? To look away and change nothing is to decide on that future. To decide on another future is to make that decision with incomplete information. Jenny&amp;#39;s death was a choice between evils; my choice. By the time I was able to make a decision, only one of a few distinct possibilities were going to happen - and her death was the least destructive option. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows the influence I have had on their lives. Nobody knows the decisions I have made, or the power I have. If they did - they would hate me, fear me, maybe they&amp;#39;d expect me to save them from everything. Maybe they&amp;#39;d just kill me. Who knows? Maybe that would be for the best.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgadcec", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492265568.0, "created_utc": 1492236768.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 116}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h38k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65h38k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaqbj4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Emazug", "parent_id": "t1_dgai3sz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wow, that was dark.
