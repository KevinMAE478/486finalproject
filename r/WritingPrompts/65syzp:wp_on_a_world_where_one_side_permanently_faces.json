We have to hold out ten days.\u201d\n\n***\n\nDay 2. \n\nI couldn\u2019t accept what the General was saying.

They\u2019ve overrun the outer wall at all points and are approaching the middle wall at speeds that are nearly outpacing our retreating units. We expect the mine fields to slow them down but there is a massive thrust from sectors 2 o\u2019clock and 3 o\u2019clock. Estimates are enemy units in those sectors will hit the middle wall in less than two days time and, I\u2019m afraid, overwhelm the defense.\u201d The man slumped back in his chair, wiping sweat from his head. \n\n\u201cGen-eral,\u201d I said with a bit of a stutter, \u201cyou must hold the middle wall. Half our sites are between the middle wall and the inner sanctum. Hold them for eight more days.\u201d \n\nThe man looked haggard but nodded into the camera before reaching forward and thumbing the connection off. \n\nDay 5. \n\n\u201cDr. Kasas,\u201d I didn\u2019t know this man. Dressed in military fatigues he looked as if he hadn\u2019t slept in days. \u201cDr. Kasas, I\u2019m sorry to report that the middle wall was breached in sector 3 o\u2019clock over an hour ago. Enemy units are now heading toward Sanctum. We want to contain the breakout but right now we\u2019re just trying to hold sectors 2 and 4.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is General Hammad?\u201d I asked, already missing the sweaty faced man. \n\n\u201cDead,\u201d the man replied. \u201cHis convoy was hit soon after the breakout by a unit of wraiths. I\u2019ve assumed command.\u201d \n\nThe man looked up and off to the side of the screen. Then reached down for his holster, drew his weapon, and fired at something to the side. Men around him were doing the same. Their bolts of white energy blotting out the screen like a hundred flashbulbs. Then a herd of black shadows swept through the room, through the white blasts, and through the men holding the guns. Though some shadows vanished in the light the room was soon overcome with a deep darkness. \n\nWhere the officer had been now stood a thing of inky blackness. I could tell it looked at me but it didn\u2019t have eyes. It reached out a dark, thick, tendril toward the screen and blotted out my view of the room. A moment later I could see something black and thick begin to ooze out of my monitor and spill downward toward my desk. I mashed the off button and it dissolved in the air. \n\nDay 10\n\n\u201cRun for the shelter!\u201d I screamed to her and turned back toward my lab.\n\nShe turned to look back at me \u201cI\u2019ll wait for\u2026\u201d  \n\nI slammed the door behind her and locked it. Running back to my desk I pulled out my tablet and double checked the status of the science center\u2019s prototype laser protection grid. It hadn\u2019t been breached yet but the cameras showed wave after wave of demons throwing themselves against it. It wouldn\u2019t be long before they found a weak spot or it failed. \n\nSanctum had fallen. All that remained above ground was my lab, me, and my rocket. I looked at the fuel gauge and saw it tick to 100%. Now would be the time for a speech, a stern, memorable, inspiring speech about how the night would never take the light. There was no one left to listen so I didn\u2019t bother. I just hit the red button. \n\nThe security cameras showed that the beasts attacking my laser fence stopped. They looked up in awe, or wonder, or terror, - if they felt such things - as the night was pierced by a rising pillar of light. The rocket, and its plume of light, vanished into the night sky and after a few minutes darkness flooded back in. \n\nMaybe it was the momentary pause that gave them strength because as they assailed the laser fence again it collapsed. The creatures were through and came flying, leaping, running, and gliding toward me. I didn\u2019t care about them anymore. As I heard them breach the outer doors I saw the second stage release its payload. A few minutes later my entrance, a meter of solid steel, bent inward and collapsed. \n\nBefore me stood the inky black thing that I had seen on the video screen. It raised a tendril at me and waved it about. I could see it was missing the tip as it brought it toward my face. \n\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d I cried at it and pointed at the video screen. \u201cI think you\u2019ll want to see this before you do me in.\u201d More fear then I would have liked in my voice but I meant every word of it. \n\nThe creature must have understood on some level as it halted its progress toward me and turned a bit to see the screen. On it was an image of something resembling a ball of aluminium foil. It was unraveling itself and spreading outward to fill the void.\n\nThe creature turned back and seemed unimpressed. The tendril resumed its forward movement. \n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d I said and shrunk back in my chair. \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss the best part!\u201d\n\nThe tendril paused for a moment and the creature glanced at the screen just as the aluminum square blotted out the video feed with a piercing white light. \n\nFrom outside I could hear the howls and the screeching as millions of demons burst into ash and foam. I like to think the dark thing in front of me halted in fear. It lowered it\u2019s tendril and stood firm. I picked out where I thought it\u2019s eyes were and looked into them. \n\n\u201cYou will trouble us no longer. In a decade my mirror will burn you and your kind from the surface of this world. In a hundred years you\u2019ll be nothing but a story, a legend, we use to scare our children away from dark places!\u201d I sneered at it. \n\nIt could have killed me, I expected it to. Instead it floated over toward the utility closet and stood for a moment above the floor drain looking back at me. Then, quick as lightning, it slipped a tendril into the drain and vanished into the sewer below. \n\nDay 11\n\n\u201cDo we really need to sleep with the skylight open?\u201d She asked, her hand upon my chest. \nMy heart beat a bit faster and she pulled her hand away. \u201cJust for tonight, darling.\u201d", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou know this may be the dumbest idea we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she said as her fingers gently stroked my chest under the covers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned to her, keeping the contact but pushing the covers off.

I mashed the off button and it dissolved in the air. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRun for the shelter!\u201d I screamed to her and turned back toward my lab.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She turned to look back at me \u201cI\u2019ll wait for\u2026\u201d  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slammed the door behind her and locked it. Running back to my desk I pulled out my tablet and double checked the status of the science center\u2019s prototype laser protection grid. It hadn\u2019t been breached yet but the cameras showed wave after wave of demons throwing themselves against it. It wouldn\u2019t be long before they found a weak spot or it failed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sanctum had fallen. All that remained above ground was my lab, me, and my rocket. I looked at the fuel gauge and saw it tick to 100%. Now would be the time for a speech, a stern, memorable, inspiring speech about how the night would never take the light. There was no one left to listen so I didn\u2019t bother. I just hit the red button. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The security cameras showed that the beasts attacking my laser fence stopped. They looked up in awe, or wonder, or terror, - if they felt such things - as the night was pierced by a rising pillar of light. The rocket, and its plume of light, vanished into the night sky and after a few minutes darkness flooded back in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was the momentary pause that gave them strength because as they assailed the laser fence again it collapsed. The creatures were through and came flying, leaping, running, and gliding toward me. I didn\u2019t care about them anymore. As I heard them breach the outer doors I saw the second stage release its payload. A few minutes later my entrance, a meter of solid steel, bent inward and collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before me stood the inky black thing that I had seen on the video screen. It raised a tendril at me and waved it about. I could see it was missing the tip as it brought it toward my face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust a moment!\u201d I cried at it and pointed at the video screen. \u201cI think you\u2019ll want to see this before you do me in.\u201d More fear then I would have liked in my voice but I meant every word of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The creature must have understood on some level as it halted its progress toward me and turned a bit to see the screen. On it was an image of something resembling a ball of aluminium foil. It was unraveling itself and spreading outward to fill the void.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The creature turned back and seemed unimpressed. The tendril resumed its forward movement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, no,\u201d I said and shrunk back in my chair. \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss the best part!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tendril paused for a moment and the creature glanced at the screen just as the aluminum square blotted out the video feed with a piercing white light. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From outside I could hear the howls and the screeching as millions of demons burst into ash and foam. I like to think the dark thing in front of me halted in fear. It lowered it\u2019s tendril and stood firm. I picked out where I thought it\u2019s eyes were and looked into them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou will trouble us no longer. In a decade my mirror will burn you and your kind from the surface of this world. In a hundred years you\u2019ll be nothing but a story, a legend, we use to scare our children away from dark places!\u201d I sneered at it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could have killed me, I expected it to. Instead it floated over toward the utility closet and stood for a moment above the floor drain looking back at me. Then, quick as lightning, it slipped a tendril into the drain and vanished into the sewer below. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 11&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo we really need to sleep with the skylight open?\u201d She asked, her hand upon my chest. \nMy heart beat a bit faster and she pulled her hand away. \u201cJust for tonight, darling.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgd4m6k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492433385.0, "created_utc": 1492404585.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1185}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65syzp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65syzp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65syzp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdsrm9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LivingstoneInAfrica", "parent_id": "t1_dgdny9a", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If only I could be so grossly incandescent!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only I could be so grossly incandescent!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgdsrm9", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492478870.0, "created_utc": 1492450070.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdny9a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "genericname__", "parent_id": "t1_dgd4mzw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "PRAISE THE SUN! \\[T]/", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRAISE THE SUN!

The other side was writhe with abominations and vampires. Humanity was never at risk of being invaded, however, just because of one simple thing. The horrors of the dark side were melted in the sun. One day, the monsters vowed, they would exact their revenge upon the humans. And that day, they promised would be total solar eclipse day. \n\nIn the days that humanity had to prepare, they were certainly thorough. A wall, dividing Europe in two, was constructed. It was called the Second Iron Curtain. Africa was a mess of barbed wire, trenches and land mines. And the two poles, it was said, would be neutral territory. \n\nIn anticipation for the fateful day, all cities with in 100 miles of the wall were evacuated. Berlin, Rome, and many others were ghost towns on the day before. And when the day came, the world could be compared to a barrel dynamite. Someone just had to throw a match, and the world would explode.\n\n\"Men, we will take up defensive positions on the skyscrapers and aim down towards the wall. When they start coming through, we have a F-18 on standby for CAS. Remember General Ross' speech. And defend our country.\" Lieutenant Schadenfr\u00fcde said. \"Oorah?\" His platoons voice reverberated through the skyline while he gave a speech on a building overlooking the curtain. \"Defensive positions, men! T- 4 minutes until Operation Sundown is a go!\" Sundown was the name of the operation for defending the human's world. On the other side of the curtain, a horde of vampires and other assorted beasts were amassed at the wall. Although it was a unorganized group, one man stood out. He was standing on a raised scaffold. \"We will take back what is ours! We will live as the dominant race of the planet! We will destroy humanity piece by piece, limb by limb, until the beg for mercy! And will we give it to them?\" The vampire prompted. \"NO!\" The crowd roared. \"Our time to is now!\" He said. \"Sergei! Come, blow this wall to pieces!

The other side was writhe with abominations and vampires. Humanity was never at risk of being invaded, however, just because of one simple thing. The horrors of the dark side were melted in the sun. One day, the monsters vowed, they would exact their revenge upon the humans. And that day, they promised would be total solar eclipse day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the days that humanity had to prepare, they were certainly thorough. A wall, dividing Europe in two, was constructed. It was called the Second Iron Curtain. Africa was a mess of barbed wire, trenches and land mines. And the two poles, it was said, would be neutral territory. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In anticipation for the fateful day, all cities with in 100 miles of the wall were evacuated. Berlin, Rome, and many others were ghost towns on the day before. And when the day came, the world could be compared to a barrel dynamite. Someone just had to throw a match, and the world would explode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Men, we will take up defensive positions on the skyscrapers and aim down towards the wall.

T- 4 minutes until Operation Sundown is a go!&amp;quot; Sundown was the name of the operation for defending the human&amp;#39;s world. On the other side of the curtain, a horde of vampires and other assorted beasts were amassed at the wall. Although it was a unorganized group, one man stood out. He was standing on a raised scaffold. &amp;quot;We will take back what is ours! We will live as the dominant race of the planet! We will destroy humanity piece by piece, limb by limb, until the beg for mercy! And will we give it to them?&amp;quot; The vampire prompted. &amp;quot;NO!&amp;quot; The crowd roared. &amp;quot;Our time to is now!&amp;quot; He said. &amp;quot;Sergei! Come, blow this wall to pieces!

Good luck!\"   \n*Justin turns around and sees two vampires stalking towards him at a leisurely pace*  \nJustin: \"Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh my god, I'm gonna die here...\"  \n*The vampire wearing a 'Brad' tank-top arrives to Justin and takes off his shades*  \nBrad: \"Sup muchacho, mind if we ask you a question?\"  \nJustin: \"Oh for the love of god, please just spare me!\"  \nJanine: \"Oooooooh, he thinks we're gonna suck his blood!\"  \nBrad: \"Sheeit, what? Nah brah, we don't dick around with human blood anymore.\"  \nJustin: \"Uh...what?\"  \nJanine: \"Well, ever since my boyfriend and I decided to switch over to animal blood, we've been feeling less lethargic. We decided that this was a healthier lifestyle for us.\"  \nBrad: \"Yeah, plus we saw what happened to Steve. Went on a massive human binge one day and got AID's from like 5 different people. That's when I said 'No thank you, brah'.\"  \nJustin: \"Yeah, we kind of have a problem with our sex education. We'll try to keep that on tabs for you guys.\"  \nJanine: \"It's cool, we found other alternatives like cow blood. We were actually going to ask you where we can find some cows because we're awfully famished.\"  \nJustin: \"Oh yeah, there are some ov-\"  \n*To the left of Justin, a werewolf wearing a 'Chad' tank-top materializes out of a bush and walks up to Brad*  \nChad: \"Sup, brah? You think you can walk all over our turf?\"  \nBrad: \"Your turf? Look who you talking to brah! Imma beat the shit out of you!\"  \nJanine: \"Leave him alone Brad! We need to get going before the sun comes back up!\"  \nChad: \"What you gonna do now? Puss out?\"  \nBrad: \"You're lucky brah. I wouldn't hit another piece of shit in front of my chick.\"  \nJustin: \"Uh, hey Chad. You don't happen to eat humans as well, right?\"  \nChad: \"What? Oh yeah, I don't fuck with that shit anymore.\"  \nJustin: \"Why are you guys so reluctant to prey on us now?\"  \nChad: \"Bruh, it's not worth it! I have to eat like 25 shotgun shells to get to you guys, and when I do devour you, boom! AID's! Y'all are fucked up and need to get yo shit together.\"  \nJustin: \"So, uh, what's the consensus on consuming humans back at your guys' place?\"  \nBrad: \"Eh, it's fifty-fifty. The younger generation are like, 'Oh, they're innocent animals and we need to protect them' or 'They're ridden with disease and are unhealthy for us!'. Meanwhile, the older generation are like, 'Back in my day, we were lucky to have human blood on the Eclipse!' and 'You should be grateful for consuming humans!'.\"  \nJustin: \"Well, that's a relief. Where you guys heading anyways?\"  \nBrad and Chad: \"DANKCHELLA!\"  \nChad: \"Whoa, bro, you going to Dankchella?\"  \nBrad: \"Yah, muchacho, only time of the year!\"  \n*Brad and Chad chest bump and high five each other*  \nChad: \"Let's book it brah!\"  \nBrad: \"Yeah, let's go. By the way human, we'll tell our peeps to watch out for you. You can depend on us!\"  \nJustin: \"Uh, thanks. I'll really need that.\"  \nBrad: \"See ya later brah!\"  \n*As the vampires and werewolf leaves, a door opens from the cabin*  \nCory: \"What the fuck, how are you not dead?\"  \nJustin: \"I dunno bro. Now please let me in.\" \n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I&amp;#39;ve decided to go for a dialogue format for this excerpt  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the woods, there is a cabin where a man named Justin is trying to get in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nJustin: &amp;quot;Dude!
