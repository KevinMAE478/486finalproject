One 12 year old brat bitted (posted and shared with me) on Bitter (social network where you can post 140 character long messages) that his uncle was Navy Seal operative and fought in WW2 (lol, really bro?) and he was going to find and kill me. Well, no 90 year old geezer knocked on my door that day. I bitted to him to learn history and go back to school after he finished crying to his mommy. After that I decided to ruin time of battle arena \"League of Lag Ends\" players. It was full of toxic players so I wanted them to rage. Minute after I paused LoLE, my Racebook page was spammed by Trussian kids (Trussia is largest by landmass country in my world). One of them even told me he was going to find me and destroy my life. HAHAHA! LIKE IF I EVEN HAVE A LIFE! Yep. That was my response. Anyways, I continued pausing popular online games.

They rioted in streets but that's it. It wasn't long enough until I was declared as criminal, outlaw. There was bounty on my computer (not head, get it? No? Ok.). You may ask why I decided to pause most games I came across and ruin people's time. Answer is simple. I am former gamer myself, I got bored by playing games and now I play with people using games.
