I&amp;#39;ll check in on Carmilla too if you want.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Geez man, I don&amp;#39;t know what to say. Thanks, I knew it was right coming to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perry swept the Polaroids into his bag, changed to his casuals, then was gone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello? You there? Perry asked me to check in on you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, yea I&amp;#39;m here. He&amp;#39;s gone, didn&amp;#39;t tell me where he was heading to, just said he needed to be out of town for a couple of days.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Some security scare, I think. Look, I&amp;#39;m going to just come over, make sure you&amp;#39;re fine anyway, OK?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carmilla laughed, her rich, dusky tones drumming right into my ear. She sounded so much happier than before. Guess Perry at home was not very different from Perry at work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure, but babe? Take back your damned camera please? It&amp;#39;s not going to work again next time, we&amp;#39;ll have to find something else.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/rarelyfunny\"&gt;/r/rarelyfunny&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5i3xc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492002312.0, "created_utc": 1491973512.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vka3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg620k3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DoverHawk", "parent_id": "t3_64vka3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The bag was heavy \u2013 too heavy.  It probably should have been double-bagged, but nobody cares about doing that much anymore.  The bag rips and hundreds of polaroid photos scatter into the street, into the gutter, under the truck and everywhere else.  The wind carries some of them further down the street and you consider them losses.  You begin to pick up the photos, and you realize something strange about these photographs.  They all seem to be taken in the same room.  At first, for a second, you don\u2019t recognize it, then realization crashes down on you like a tidal wave \u2013 the pictures are from your bedroom.\n\nThey\u2019re all different angles.  Some are from the corner, some are from the hallway, some are in the window, and still others seem to be taken from the ceiling.  Your heart begins to beat faster as understanding and eventually panic pulse into your chest.  These pictures aren\u2019t just of your bedroom, but of YOU.\n\nOn the corner of each picture you see numbers.  The ones in your hand have large numbers, like 564 and 398, but as you clean them up, quickly now, you find the numbers beginning to diminish.  Soon, you have the last picture in hand, one of the ones that was carried by the wind that you decided to pursue after all, and it has the number 1.  Instantly you know when the picture was taken.  It was from last night.\n\nClutching the picture tightly in your hands, you look up and down the street, expecting to see someone watching you, some pair of eyes in the bushes or around the corner, but the only sign of life anywhere around you is the barking of a dog a few houses down.\n\nYou look up at the house in front of which you found the bag of pictures.  It\u2019s old, dilapidated, and the lawn is overgrown.  The house has been long forgotten.  It reminds you of the houses in scary movies, like the one in the Amityville Horror or the Myers house in Halloween, but that seems silly, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nYou take a step forward, then pause.  You were going to knock on the door to see if any squatters were inside that may know where the pictures came from, but you stop yourself.  You haven\u2019t seen anyone in that house at all during the six years you\u2019ve been running this route.  The chances are far better of someone dropping the bag off there than someone in the house leaving the pictures there for you to find.\n\nYou collect the pile of photographs and put them into the cab of the truck.  You want to go through these to see if you can find out who\u2019s been taking these pictures.  You think about going to the police, but decide that you\u2019d rather try to figure it out yourself first.  The police won\u2019t let you know anything about an open investigation and if you get a chance, you\u2019d rather catch the creep in the act.\n\nOn the way back to the dump, you swing by your house and drop off the pictures, then finish your shift and go home.\n\nThe further you dive into the photographs, the more nervous you get.  There is absolutely nothing in any of the pictures that give even the slightest idea of who is behind the camera.  Each picture varies in angle, from the floor to the ceiling and everywhere in between. \n\nMidnight passes, then one o\u2019 clock.  You aren\u2019t finished looking through all the pictures and you\u2019re afraid to go to bed.  The picture from last night sits on the corner of the table, reminding you that the numbers are out and that if anything was going to happen, it was going to happen tonight.\n\nYou stay at your place in the table, shuffling through the pictures, but eventually sleep begins to set in.  It starts slow at first, but eventually you find yourself in a losing battle.  Your head slumps forward and your eyes shut.\n\nYou sit bolt upright.  You didn\u2019t fall asleep, you just shut your eyes for a second, but your kitchen table is gone.  You\u2019re sitting at a table, but in an entirely unfamiliar room.  The room is dark and your eyes take a moment to adjust, but when they do, you see that you\u2019re sitting in a dirty, dusty kitchen.  Food sits on the table, long forgotten, as if it were simply left there in a hurry and never cleaned up.\n\nYou blink and look down at a plate sitting in front of you, expecting wildly to find a half-eaten meal of your own, but instead, two pictures stare back at you.\n\nThe one on the left is of you stooped over, cleaning up a pile of photographs by the curb.  That one is labeled with the number 682 in the bottom corner.  The second picture, labeled 681, is of the back of your head as you sit at your kitchen table, filing through a pile of photographs in front of you.\n\nYou begin to scream.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor more of my writing, check out r/DoverHawk", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bag was heavy \u2013 too heavy.
