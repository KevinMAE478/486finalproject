Behind a one way mirror in a quarantined room, she knew that a team of medical experts were observing her curiously. She had no idea if they wanted her to try to activate the symptoms, or to simply sit there and wait. No one had spoken to her since she had arrived at the emergency room three days ago, wheeled in on a bent and broken stretcher being pushed by the biggest men that the hospital could gather up.\n\nIn direct contrast to the sweat she began to shiver as the sterile air, that smelled heavily of disinfectants and cleaners, gently flowed over her exposed skin and cut through the paper thin hospital gown. Ashley glanced around the room, and silently thought that the look of the place matched the smell. If the air had a look, it would be the same as the pristine white walls of the room, with the tiled floor and offensive lights. \n\nLights flashed in her vision as Ashley felt her eyes shaking and rolling in their sockets. The lights disappeared as her vision gave way to black, and gravity appeared to increase ten fold as every muscle in her body became as immobile and heavy as a block of lead. She collapsed with what she thought was a heavy thud on to the table, and began to writhe uncontrollably.\n\nThen, just as suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Her vision returned, and as if being lifted by some invisible force she raised herself off the table feeling light as air. Now the gentle circulation of the sterile hospital air felt stronger, as if she would suddenly become airborne.\n\nFor just a brief moment Ashley felt pure bliss, before she shivered again from the cold air. A deep vibration originating from a deep place within her bones followed the shiver like a wave through her body, and when it finished she felt...normal. No longer light or heavy.\n\nShe turned around, and felt something deep inside her soul break as she saw the imprint of her body in the solid metal of the table.\n____________________________\nBehind the one way mirror, Doctor Quincy Winniman watched the woman writhe on the examining table with curious, worried eyes. Around him the muggy, warm air was filled with foggy breaths and distinct, mingled mutters of excitement and worry. It was a small room, filled over capacity with \"experts\" to determine what the hell was going on with this girl. Quincy felt more trapped than their subject, and that was saying something.\n\n\"Was that it?\" The geologist asked, \"The phase change?\" \n\nNo one knew why they had brought in a geologist, or the astrophysicist, or the rocket scientist, but they were there. Many seemed to see it as a humorous thing, but their presence had only deepened Quincy's worry.\n\nIt meant they had no idea what this was, and therefore no one did. Maybe these experts *were* the most useful ones here, and all these medical specialists were the useless ones.\n\nThere was only one person here who would be truly useful regardless, and that was Quincy himself. The nation's leading expert on infectious diseases, his dissertation that had earned him his doctorate, and wide acclaim, had been on the rise of violent, and uncontrollable diseases that gave the victim powers that edged on the level of catastrophic. \n\nYou had common sicknesses like the flu that gave you the ability to speak a random language for a few days, or the cold that made you run a bit faster. Basic stuff that everyone dealt with. Sometimes it was even beneficial\n\nThen you had the bad ones. Disease that were so rare that they were unnamed, and gave the victims dangerous powers. The power to vaporize whoever they looked at, along with the inability to closer you eyes, or the power to blow over entire buildings with one breath, and no way to control it short of not breathing.\n\nIn his dissertation, Quincy had predicted that if no action was taken to stop the growing trend, eventually one of these diseases would give some unlucky soul powers that threatened the very existence of humanity and life itself.\n\nAnd now here he stood, in a tiny observation room surrounded by dozens of other experts, watching what Quincy had realized was the fulfillment of his prediction.\n\n\"That first phase change increased her density beyond that of lead,\" some analyst spoke as he read from a computer screen. \"The second changed her density to that of paper. The third returned her to normal levels.\"\n\n\"Is there a pattern?\" The statistician asked from somewhere in the back.\n\n\"In the timing? No, but in the density, yes.\"\n\n\"Well why don't you tell us?\" The biologist asked, \"I feel like that is important information.\"\n\n\"I really don't have the knowledge to put these numbers into perspective,\" the analyst admitted, \"I just recite the data.\"\n\nThe astrophysicist sighed, and walked towards the monitor. As he glanced over the data, the color drained from his face.\n\n\"What?\" Quincy asked as everyone in the room grew silent.\n\n\"There isn't any pattern to the timing of the changes,\" he repeated what the analyst had said earlier, \"But the densities. These patterns are growing exponentially. She's not too far away from reaching critical mass...\"\n\n\"What?\" Quincy was dumbfounded.\n\n\"She's one or two episodes away from...becoming a singularity,\" The astrophysicist spoke as if he was in a dream, as if the words themselves were trying to lure him into insanity with the preposterous meaning behind them.\n\n\"What's the transmission rate?\" One of the many medical specialists asked, and all eyes on the room turned on to Quincy.\n\n\"As far as my trials showed,\" he swallowed hard, \"One hundred percent. Even...even the smallest exposure is one hundred percent effective.\"\n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" a few of them muttered in unison.\n\n\"We need to find out who she was in contact with,\" another person added on, as an uproar began to fill the room.\n\n\"We quarantined the entire hospital she was in, and all the staff who transported her there,\" the facility director yelled out, as if trying to absolve himself of responsibility.\n\n\"Quiet!\" Quincy called out, tired of the uproar, \"I'll suit up and talk to her. Just try to find out whatever you can in the meantime. And get someone important on the phone, we can't waste any more time.\"\n_________________________\nAshley's eyes were still locked on to her imprint in the metal, when one of the doors in the room slid open with a hiss. A thick fog-like gas rolled gently along the floor as someone dressed up in a full quarantine suit entered. Their visor was tinted, and the silent air was filled with the idle hum of a respirator as the person took sterile, disease free breaths.\n\nBehind were two guards in similar suits, and armed with sleek, black rifles. They took positions by the door as it sealed shut, and stood at attention. The other one, the person who had entered first, approached her.\n\n\"Ashley,\" his voice did not come directly from him, but from all directions as it blared over the intercom system in the room. \"I'm Doctor Quincy Winniman. I have just a few questions from you, and then we can get a move on with treatment and-\"\n\n\"Am I going to be okay?\" Ashley blurted out.\n\nSilence was the immediate answer, as Quincy thought over his response.\n\n\"I'm not going to promise anything,\" he began, \"But I'm sure we can-\"\n\n\"Don't lie to me,\" Ashley's voice broke, \"Just tell me.\"\n\n\"No,\" Quincy answered in a flat tone, \"You are going to die, Ashley. There is nothing we can do. But you on the other hand can save countless lives by answering my questions. Can you do that?\"\n\nAshley felt empty, as if someone had turned every bone in her body into air. She wasn't sure if this was the disease, or her reaction to the news.\n\n\"Okay,\" she finally said, her voice was chilled and empty.\n\n\"First,\" Quincy soldiered forward, sweating profusely inside the hot suit, \"We found out you're from Maine. Why are you here in California?\"\n\n\"I traveled here on business,\" Ashley answered.\n\n\"How long ago?\" Quincy asked.\n\n\"I arrived one day before I entered the hospital.\"\n\nQuincy felt light headed. A cold fear gripped at his gut as he shakily asked the next question.\n\n\"How did you travel here? How many people did you have contact with up to two weeks before admittance to the hospital?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I'd have to think for a bit.\"\n\n\"What about travel?\" Quincy asked again.\n\nAshley was silent, her eyes filled with tears as she looked at him. She was not a dumb woman, Quentin realized, and probably knew the implications.\n\n\"How did you travel?\" Quincy repeated, his voice breaking.\n\n\"Air,\" she whispered, \"On a plane. Three connecting flights, twenty-seven hours total.\"\n\nQuincy nodded. Or Ashley thought he did, she couldn't tell. If he said anything, she didn't hear it.\n\nBut she thought for just a moment she could feel the fear and panic coming off of him in waves. And it terrified her.\n\nSilently he turned his back on her, and walked away. Quincy made a simple gesture to the guards, and they raised their rifles towards her. The sound they made was heard throughout the facility, and the era they ushered in was felt around the world.\n_______________________\nQuincy entered the observation room to find a group of stunned men and women awaiting him. By now the examination room had been cleaned up, they were all simply waiting for him.\n\n\"Doctor,\" one spoke up, \"What was that?\"\n\n\"Don't lose any sleep over it,\" Quincy advised, \"We'll be making harder decisions soon.\"\n\n\"What do we do now?\" The geologist asked.\n\n\"Call someone,\" Quincy waved them away, \"The President, the U.N, or the Kremlin. I don't give a shit, just call someone.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"Tell them we have to run.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nQuincy smiled then, and glanced over at the astrophysicist who was speaking in a whisper with the biologist and the rocket scientist. He pointed at them, \"That seems like a question more fit for them.\"\n______________________________\nDid you like this story? Check out my other stuff over at r/Niedski!

No one had spoken to her since she had arrived at the emergency room three days ago, wheeled in on a bent and broken stretcher being pushed by the biggest men that the hospital could gather up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In direct contrast to the sweat she began to shiver as the sterile air, that smelled heavily of disinfectants and cleaners, gently flowed over her exposed skin and cut through the paper thin hospital gown. Ashley glanced around the room, and silently thought that the look of the place matched the smell. If the air had a look, it would be the same as the pristine white walls of the room, with the tiled floor and offensive lights. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lights flashed in her vision as Ashley felt her eyes shaking and rolling in their sockets. The lights disappeared as her vision gave way to black, and gravity appeared to increase ten fold as every muscle in her body became as immobile and heavy as a block of lead. She collapsed with what she thought was a heavy thud on to the table, and began to writhe uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, just as suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Her vision returned, and as if being lifted by some invisible force she raised herself off the table feeling light as air. Now the gentle circulation of the sterile hospital air felt stronger, as if she would suddenly become airborne.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For just a brief moment Ashley felt pure bliss, before she shivered again from the cold air. A deep vibration originating from a deep place within her bones followed the shiver like a wave through her body, and when it finished she felt...normal. No longer light or heavy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She turned around, and felt something deep inside her soul break as she saw the imprint of her body in the solid metal of the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Behind the one way mirror, Doctor Quincy Winniman watched the woman writhe on the examining table with curious, worried eyes. Around him the muggy, warm air was filled with foggy breaths and distinct, mingled mutters of excitement and worry. It was a small room, filled over capacity with &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; to determine what the hell was going on with this girl. Quincy felt more trapped than their subject, and that was saying something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Was that it?&amp;quot; The geologist asked, &amp;quot;The phase change?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one knew why they had brought in a geologist, or the astrophysicist, or the rocket scientist, but they were there. Many seemed to see it as a humorous thing, but their presence had only deepened Quincy&amp;#39;s worry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It meant they had no idea what this was, and therefore no one did. Maybe these experts &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; the most useful ones here, and all these medical specialists were the useless ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was only one person here who would be truly useful regardless, and that was Quincy himself. The nation&amp;#39;s leading expert on infectious diseases, his dissertation that had earned him his doctorate, and wide acclaim, had been on the rise of violent, and uncontrollable diseases that gave the victim powers that edged on the level of catastrophic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You had common sicknesses like the flu that gave you the ability to speak a random language for a few days, or the cold that made you run a bit faster. Basic stuff that everyone dealt with. Sometimes it was even beneficial&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you had the bad ones. Disease that were so rare that they were unnamed, and gave the victims dangerous powers. The power to vaporize whoever they looked at, along with the inability to closer you eyes, or the power to blow over entire buildings with one breath, and no way to control it short of not breathing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In his dissertation, Quincy had predicted that if no action was taken to stop the growing trend, eventually one of these diseases would give some unlucky soul powers that threatened the very existence of humanity and life itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now here he stood, in a tiny observation room surrounded by dozens of other experts, watching what Quincy had realized was the fulfillment of his prediction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That first phase change increased her density beyond that of lead,&amp;quot; some analyst spoke as he read from a computer screen. &amp;quot;The second changed her density to that of paper. The third returned her to normal levels.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is there a pattern?&amp;quot; The statistician asked from somewhere in the back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the timing? No, but in the density, yes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well why don&amp;#39;t you tell us?&amp;quot; The biologist asked, &amp;quot;I feel like that is important information.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I really don&amp;#39;t have the knowledge to put these numbers into perspective,&amp;quot; the analyst admitted, &amp;quot;I just recite the data.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The astrophysicist sighed, and walked towards the monitor. As he glanced over the data, the color drained from his face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; Quincy asked as everyone in the room grew silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There isn&amp;#39;t any pattern to the timing of the changes,&amp;quot; he repeated what the analyst had said earlier, &amp;quot;But the densities. These patterns are growing exponentially. She&amp;#39;s not too far away from reaching critical mass...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; Quincy was dumbfounded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s one or two episodes away from...becoming a singularity,&amp;quot; The astrophysicist spoke as if he was in a dream, as if the words themselves were trying to lure him into insanity with the preposterous meaning behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the transmission rate?&amp;quot; One of the many medical specialists asked, and all eyes on the room turned on to Quincy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As far as my trials showed,&amp;quot; he swallowed hard, &amp;quot;One hundred percent. Even...even the smallest exposure is one hundred percent effective.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jesus Christ,&amp;quot; a few of them muttered in unison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We need to find out who she was in contact with,&amp;quot; another person added on, as an uproar began to fill the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We quarantined the entire hospital she was in, and all the staff who transported her there,&amp;quot; the facility director yelled out, as if trying to absolve himself of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Quiet!&amp;quot; Quincy called out, tired of the uproar, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll suit up and talk to her. Just try to find out whatever you can in the meantime. And get someone important on the phone, we can&amp;#39;t waste any more time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley&amp;#39;s eyes were still locked on to her imprint in the metal, when one of the doors in the room slid open with a hiss. A thick fog-like gas rolled gently along the floor as someone dressed up in a full quarantine suit entered. Their visor was tinted, and the silent air was filled with the idle hum of a respirator as the person took sterile, disease free breaths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Behind were two guards in similar suits, and armed with sleek, black rifles. They took positions by the door as it sealed shut, and stood at attention. The other one, the person who had entered first, approached her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ashley,&amp;quot; his voice did not come directly from him, but from all directions as it blared over the intercom system in the room. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Doctor Quincy Winniman. I have just a few questions from you, and then we can get a move on with treatment and-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Am I going to be okay?&amp;quot; Ashley blurted out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence was the immediate answer, as Quincy thought over his response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not going to promise anything,&amp;quot; he began, &amp;quot;But I&amp;#39;m sure we can-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t lie to me,&amp;quot; Ashley&amp;#39;s voice broke, &amp;quot;Just tell me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; Quincy answered in a flat tone, &amp;quot;You are going to die, Ashley. There is nothing we can do. But you on the other hand can save countless lives by answering my questions. Can you do that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley felt empty, as if someone had turned every bone in her body into air. She wasn&amp;#39;t sure if this was the disease, or her reaction to the news.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay,&amp;quot; she finally said, her voice was chilled and empty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;First,&amp;quot; Quincy soldiered forward, sweating profusely inside the hot suit, &amp;quot;We found out you&amp;#39;re from Maine. Why are you here in California?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I traveled here on business,&amp;quot; Ashley answered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How long ago?&amp;quot; Quincy asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I arrived one day before I entered the hospital.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quincy felt light headed. A cold fear gripped at his gut as he shakily asked the next question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How did you travel here? How many people did you have contact with up to two weeks before admittance to the hospital?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know, I&amp;#39;d have to think for a bit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What about travel?&amp;quot; Quincy asked again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley was silent, her eyes filled with tears as she looked at him. She was not a dumb woman, Quentin realized, and probably knew the implications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How did you travel?&amp;quot; Quincy repeated, his voice breaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Air,&amp;quot; she whispered, &amp;quot;On a plane. Three connecting flights, twenty-seven hours total.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quincy nodded. Or Ashley thought he did, she couldn&amp;#39;t tell. If he said anything, she didn&amp;#39;t hear it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she thought for just a moment she could feel the fear and panic coming off of him in waves. And it terrified her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silently he turned his back on her, and walked away. Quincy made a simple gesture to the guards, and they raised their rifles towards her. The sound they made was heard throughout the facility, and the era they ushered in was felt around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quincy entered the observation room to find a group of stunned men and women awaiting him. By now the examination room had been cleaned up, they were all simply waiting for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Doctor,&amp;quot; one spoke up, &amp;quot;What was that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t lose any sleep over it,&amp;quot; Quincy advised, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll be making harder decisions soon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do we do now?&amp;quot; The geologist asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Call someone,&amp;quot; Quincy waved them away, &amp;quot;The President, the U.N, or the Kremlin. I don&amp;#39;t give a shit, just call someone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell them we have to run.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quincy smiled then, and glanced over at the astrophysicist who was speaking in a whisper with the biologist and the rocket scientist. He pointed at them, &amp;quot;That seems like a question more fit for them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you like this story?

I felt bits of it catch in my hair as I screamed and curled into a ball on the exam table.  When I came to the doctor's office I thought I may have had a mild case of telepathy, or maybe even a real illness, considering the fever and mild hallucinations. I had NOT planned on getting shot.\n\nThe doctor's hands shook as he moved to fire again, only to be tackled by a large male nurse.  \n\n\"Sir what are you doing?!\"  Another doctor ran in, a young woman and she moved to check on me.  \n\n\"DO NOT TOUCH HER!\"  The older male doctor struggled on the floor, the gun  had been lost under the exam table somewhere.  \"SHE'S HIGHLY INFECTIOUS!\"\n\nHe wriggled his way out from under the much larger man and lunged for the gun, only to be dragged back and restrained like an unruly drunk.  \n\n\"Nonsense, she came in with mild symptoms. Nothing that we know of...\"  Her voice droned on.  I was lost in my now swimming thoughts, the panic had released adrenaline and sped my heart  rate considerably. My fever was burning and I heard the whispering and felt motion behind my eyes.\n\n*Touch her.*  Involuntarily I reached out and brushed the young doctor's hand.    For a moment she went rigid, then almost immediately relaxed.  The doctor that had tried to shoot me was screaming, and foaming at the mouth trying to get away from the man who held him, who had watched our exchange with mild interest.\n\nI felt it instantly, the forced connection between her and I, and how my consciousness immediately shredded hers away.  Now I had two bodies, it felt very very strange, and still I felt the itching thought to gently touch strangers.  This definitely registered as weird, but I had to admit to myself that I felt much better now that the kind young doctor had given me her body.\n\n\"Stop before you kill us all! RELEASE ME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!\"  My additional body moved swiftly, she must work out, and her hand gently brushed the arm of the large male nurse.  And thus added a third room for my steadily expanding consciousness.  In my arms the doctor went still, at this point my clothing was separating us, and so, as long as he remained calm, he would not be consumed.\n\nMy original form stood from the exam table, I felt lighter on my feet, happier, even.  I approached the doctor who had tried to kill me and stood on my toes to meet his eyes.\n\n\"Out of curiosity Doc, what do I have?\"  \n\nHe was trembling in fear, and bloody spittle flew from his shaking mouth.\n\"Assimilation.\"\n\n\"Hmm. And what does this ultimately do to the host?\"  His pupils were enormous in the florescent  lights, I could smell him sweating and feel his body shaking against my nurse body's chest. \n\n\"We d-don't know.\" \n\n\"Huh.\" I touched him, he screamed, and was gone forever. \n\n---\n\nBy the time I returned home my mind was a buzz of activity, it was like I was changing the channels on the television and being on all the shows, as all of the characters.  It was very cool, and very confusing, part of me wondered about the morality, but mostly I didn't care.  Realistically that was the power talking, but again, because of it, I didn't mind.  Also, I didn't have time, what with making the bustling city function.  \n\n\"Baby I'm home!\"\n\n*Oh God I forgot about Daniella.*  I peeked my head out of the living room to spy my beautiful girlfriend putting groceries away.\n\n*touch her.*  The suggestion was subtle, and I pushed it away as I thought about how to touch everyone but my most beloved. \n\n*Touch her.*  This time the persistence pushed me into the kitchen, mere feet from the love of my life.\n\n\"Hey Baby!\"  She moved to kiss me and I sprang away, even while my mind was screaming approval. Her blue eyes were hurt and I gave her a sheepish smile.  \n\n\"Sorry Babe, doctor's orders, I'm infectious.\"  She pouted unhappily, God she was beautiful. \n\n*TOUCH HER.*\n\n*NO!*  A hand that was mine and not mine reached out.  I heard thousands of my voices city wide shouting for Daniella's assimilation.\n\n\"please...\"  She nuzzled her face into my outstretched hand, and immediately her eyes went blank.  I felt the power tear her apart, I thought I would care more.  But as she vanished the part of me that had any remorse vanished too, absently I noted that feeling had been slowly trickling out of me all day.  \n\nThe more my consciousness expanded, the less everything mattered. Though, seeing Daniella's face with my eyes and being behind it with my mind was still strangely sad.  It also bordered on disrespectful I felt.\n\nSo as I cleaned the dishes I took Daniella for a walk from our fifth story balcony.   I couldn't have that host distracting the central hub of my focus.  Besides, one of the waste disposal employees I was inhabiting, who was currently eating dinner, would be by to pick the shell up in the morning.\n\nI didn't bother with television, by this time the only thing on was me. My reach had expended out of the city.  Almost everyone was assimilated within my direct radius.  Tendrils shot out into the night on planes, trains, in trucks and in cars, there were even a few of me on bicycles.  The fever was starting to return, in force.  I needed to touch more people.  \n\nWith that thought in mind I stood and walked to my room to lay down, this body needed to rest.  When it was too tired to go on, I would focus my consciousness into a better husk and destroy this one.  But for now it was satisfactory, pretty, athletic sort-of, and most of all, completely average.  \n\nI flipped the light switch and snuggled down into my blankets. Closing my eyes to partially dream of touching the whole world.\n\nThe other million parts were very busy.\n\n---\n\n\nThanks for reading!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BANG&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plaster exploded from the wall behind me.

My fever was burning and I heard the whispering and felt motion behind my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Touch her.&lt;/em&gt;  Involuntarily I reached out and brushed the young doctor&amp;#39;s hand.    For a moment she went rigid, then almost immediately relaxed.  The doctor that had tried to shoot me was screaming, and foaming at the mouth trying to get away from the man who held him, who had watched our exchange with mild interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt it instantly, the forced connection between her and I, and how my consciousness immediately shredded hers away.  Now I had two bodies, it felt very very strange, and still I felt the itching thought to gently touch strangers.  This definitely registered as weird, but I had to admit to myself that I felt much better now that the kind young doctor had given me her body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stop before you kill us all! RELEASE ME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!&amp;quot;  My additional body moved swiftly, she must work out, and her hand gently brushed the arm of the large male nurse.  And thus added a third room for my steadily expanding consciousness.  In my arms the doctor went still, at this point my clothing was separating us, and so, as long as he remained calm, he would not be consumed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My original form stood from the exam table, I felt lighter on my feet, happier, even.  I approached the doctor who had tried to kill me and stood on my toes to meet his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Out of curiosity Doc, what do I have?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was trembling in fear, and bloody spittle flew from his shaking mouth.\n&amp;quot;Assimilation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hmm. And what does this ultimately do to the host?&amp;quot;  His pupils were enormous in the florescent  lights, I could smell him sweating and feel his body shaking against my nurse body&amp;#39;s chest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We d-don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Huh.&amp;quot; I touched him, he screamed, and was gone forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I returned home my mind was a buzz of activity, it was like I was changing the channels on the television and being on all the shows, as all of the characters.  It was very cool, and very confusing, part of me wondered about the morality, but mostly I didn&amp;#39;t care.  Realistically that was the power talking, but again, because of it, I didn&amp;#39;t mind.  Also, I didn&amp;#39;t have time, what with making the bustling city function.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Baby I&amp;#39;m home!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh God I forgot about Daniella.&lt;/em&gt;  I peeked my head out of the living room to spy my beautiful girlfriend putting groceries away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;touch her.&lt;/em&gt;  The suggestion was subtle, and I pushed it away as I thought about how to touch everyone but my most beloved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Touch her.&lt;/em&gt;  This time the persistence pushed me into the kitchen, mere feet from the love of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Baby!&amp;quot;  She moved to kiss me and I sprang away, even while my mind was screaming approval. Her blue eyes were hurt and I gave her a sheepish smile.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry Babe, doctor&amp;#39;s orders, I&amp;#39;m infectious.&amp;quot;  She pouted unhappily, God she was beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TOUCH HER.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NO!&lt;/em&gt;  A hand that was mine and not mine reached out.  I heard thousands of my voices city wide shouting for Daniella&amp;#39;s assimilation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;please...&amp;quot;  She nuzzled her face into my outstretched hand, and immediately her eyes went blank.  I felt the power tear her apart, I thought I would care more.  But as she vanished the part of me that had any remorse vanished too, absently I noted that feeling had been slowly trickling out of me all day.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more my consciousness expanded, the less everything mattered. Though, seeing Daniella&amp;#39;s face with my eyes and being behind it with my mind was still strangely sad.  It also bordered on disrespectful I felt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as I cleaned the dishes I took Daniella for a walk from our fifth story balcony.   I couldn&amp;#39;t have that host distracting the central hub of my focus.  Besides, one of the waste disposal employees I was inhabiting, who was currently eating dinner, would be by to pick the shell up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t bother with television, by this time the only thing on was me. My reach had expended out of the city.  Almost everyone was assimilated within my direct radius.  Tendrils shot out into the night on planes, trains, in trucks and in cars, there were even a few of me on bicycles.  The fever was starting to return, in force.  I needed to touch more people.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that thought in mind I stood and walked to my room to lay down, this body needed to rest.  When it was too tired to go on, I would focus my consciousness into a better husk and destroy this one.  But for now it was satisfactory, pretty, athletic sort-of, and most of all, completely average.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I flipped the light switch and snuggled down into my blankets. Closing my eyes to partially dream of touching the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other million parts were very busy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgb9ft2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492323485.0, "created_utc": 1492294685.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k7i8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k7i8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k7i8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k7i8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb9w6i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ademisk", "parent_id": "t1_dgb98ca", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Don't sweat it, I have the same problem.

Oddly enough, my curiosity got the better of me and I involuntarily squinted my eyes a little trying to discern where the bullet was. Bad news, the barrel was too dark to see the bullet. Good news, the bullet didn't exit the barrel for closer inspection.\n\nA throat cleared and my gaze shifted along the gun, to the hands, the arms, the shoulders, finally resting on the face of the man who held my life upon the tip of his itchy trigger finger. He was balding, middle-aged, slightly overweight, and his hair had decided that color was no longer in vogue, though an expensive wig covered most of the issue. Between the pearly teeth, the too-perfect nose, and the freshly tazed expression that only copious amounts of botox treatments could bless you with, he was a shoe in for the \"Most Attempts to Look Younger\" section of whatever high school reunion he would be no doubt attending.\n\n\"Yes?\" I asked, \"Is there a problem doctor?\" The man's hands were sweating profusely, and he took one off the gun to wipe it on his bone white coat. \"You're damn right there's a problem!\" He growled, \"You've been subjected to the Surge. You've gotten categorized as a level five!\" Blink. Stare. Repeat. \"SAY SOMETHING!\" He screamed. \n\n\"Something!\" I screamed back. A water buffalo entered the room bellowing hideously, no...wait, it was the doctor never mind. He raked his hands through his wig knocking it off, and then dragged them down the face, muscles too slow to pull the baggy skin up, turning him temporarily into a pudding monster. \"For the love of-What is wrong with you?\" I frowned, \"I don't know. That's why I came here isn't it? You poked me with the needles, put me in the box, and pulled a gun. Are you perhaps having memory issues?\"\n\nMister Doctor hung his head, \"Look, just stay right here. I need to pee.\" He got up to leave and looked over his shoulder. \"Okay?\" I nodded. \"Okay.\" He opened the door to the small office room, it looked like wood, but it was probably made of cheap cardboard fastened between thin sheets of laminate. He slid out of the room slowly, eyeing me while he did so. I licked my lips, I was getting a little thirsty. Time passed, I got distracted, I looked at a picture of some unusually large stool on the wall, but maybe it could have been Mister Doctor's child. The door opened and it was Mister Doctor again, this time he looked taken aback, \"Wait seriously? I just handed pulled a gun on you and handed you a death sentence. The military will take you away! They are already on their way! I left the room! It was your out!\" \n\nI cocked my head to the side, a little puzzled, \"Why does any of that matter?\" Mister Doctor groaned, \"Did it change your brain? Are you on the spectrum? Why are you acting like this? Don't you feel any sense of self-preservation?\"\nI pondered this momentarily. \"Nope.\" \n\n\"Get out.\"\n\n\"But I haven't gotten any pills or anything.\"\n\n\"I can give you sugar pills.\"\n\n\"Will they taste good?\" \n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then it will be real medicine.\"\n\n\"Just...get out of my office, I don't want you to die any more than I want to pay the damage-\" The door was split open by a black boot. I told you it was made of cardboard. Mister Doctor slid to the side of the room as a figure wearing an ad for the tacticool mail order catalogue broke through the rest of the door. \"Is my appointment done?\" I asked. He leveled a SUPER HIGH POWER SIXTY MAGAZINE CAPACITY CLIP KILL RIFLE at me, and in a deep voice said, \"Yes.\" \n\nI stood up, apparently there was a firecracker in mallninja's pocket because it was really loud. I don't know what happened, but all of a sudden the doctor's room was redecorated in a REALLY vibrant red. It went with the d\u00e9cor. Our new friend wasn't anywhere to be seen though, and Mister Doctor was crying softly in the corner muttering about \"The Face of Insanity\" or something. So I just walked out, the nurse lady who showed me in wasn't anywhere to be seen either so I took a left wen I exited the room. I wasn't sure if it was the way home or not, because I had only been to the clinic here once. And it was a BIG clinic, more of a hospital. \n\nAs I crossed a hallway I heard a scream, so I turned to help. I was getting very confused because people were starting to disappear. And the repainting was progressing at a rapid pace. My chest was starting to feel funny though, but the doctor said my appointment was over to I kept walking and tried to find an elevator. I took a right, then a left, I stopped to use the toilet. When I left I saw them, the elevators, staring at me seductively with their silvery doors, begging me to push their buttons. So I did.\n\nIt took me a very long time to get down to the first floor. The elevator kept stopping and people kept showing up, but they didn't stick around long. I was beginning to suspect that a case of teleport was making the rounds in the office. By the time I made it to the first floor though, I was starting to feel a little woozy, and it was probably best that I get my sugar pills so I headed towards the door.\n\nWhen I reached the door, it quickly became apparent that the city was starting a new traffic experiment, where big black vehicles would block all the roads and force commuters to think of ingenious routes home. And it was working, because there was a big convention happening out there. And they were all climbing over each other and screaming. One of them decided he was feeling a bit peckish so he stopped to sample some of the local flavor. But I don't think it tasted very good because he started screaming out about, \"The Dreadlord has come! The Surge will devour us all!\" \n\nI tried to talk to him, because I had lost my car keys, but I couldn't reach him in time...my vision was starting to get a little hazy, and the thoughts weren't forming proper. So I decided I would sit down for a moment to close my eyes.\nAnd that's how I ended up here.\n\nThe man staring at me from across the desk is smiling at me. \"Well thank you for visiting today. I think you will fit in quite nicely here in hell. We have many exciting job opportunities for you here.\" I don't really have anything better to do...so I just say, \"Sure thing Mr. Devil.\"\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forgive the oddity.

Between the pearly teeth, the too-perfect nose, and the freshly tazed expression that only copious amounts of botox treatments could bless you with, he was a shoe in for the &amp;quot;Most Attempts to Look Younger&amp;quot; section of whatever high school reunion he would be no doubt attending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes?&amp;quot; I asked, &amp;quot;Is there a problem doctor?&amp;quot; The man&amp;#39;s hands were sweating profusely, and he took one off the gun to wipe it on his bone white coat. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re damn right there&amp;#39;s a problem!&amp;quot; He growled, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve been subjected to the Surge. You&amp;#39;ve gotten categorized as a level five!&amp;quot; Blink. Stare. Repeat. &amp;quot;SAY SOMETHING!&amp;quot; He screamed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Something!&amp;quot; I screamed back. A water buffalo entered the room bellowing hideously, no...wait, it was the doctor never mind. He raked his hands through his wig knocking it off, and then dragged them down the face, muscles too slow to pull the baggy skin up, turning him temporarily into a pudding monster. &amp;quot;For the love of-What is wrong with you?&amp;quot; I frowned, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. That&amp;#39;s why I came here isn&amp;#39;t it? You poked me with the needles, put me in the box, and pulled a gun. Are you perhaps having memory issues?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mister Doctor hung his head, &amp;quot;Look, just stay right here. I need to pee.&amp;quot; He got up to leave and looked over his shoulder. &amp;quot;Okay?&amp;quot; I nodded. &amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot; He opened the door to the small office room, it looked like wood, but it was probably made of cheap cardboard fastened between thin sheets of laminate. He slid out of the room slowly, eyeing me while he did so. I licked my lips, I was getting a little thirsty. Time passed, I got distracted, I looked at a picture of some unusually large stool on the wall, but maybe it could have been Mister Doctor&amp;#39;s child. The door opened and it was Mister Doctor again, this time he looked taken aback, &amp;quot;Wait seriously? I just handed pulled a gun on you and handed you a death sentence. The military will take you away! They are already on their way! I left the room! It was your out!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cocked my head to the side, a little puzzled, &amp;quot;Why does any of that matter?&amp;quot; Mister Doctor groaned, &amp;quot;Did it change your brain? Are you on the spectrum? Why are you acting like this? Don&amp;#39;t you feel any sense of self-preservation?&amp;quot;\nI pondered this momentarily. &amp;quot;Nope.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I haven&amp;#39;t gotten any pills or anything.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can give you sugar pills.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Will they taste good?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then it will be real medicine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just...get out of my office, I don&amp;#39;t want you to die any more than I want to pay the damage-&amp;quot; The door was split open by a black boot. I told you it was made of cardboard. Mister Doctor slid to the side of the room as a figure wearing an ad for the tacticool mail order catalogue broke through the rest of the door. &amp;quot;Is my appointment done?&amp;quot; I asked. He leveled a SUPER HIGH POWER SIXTY MAGAZINE CAPACITY CLIP KILL RIFLE at me, and in a deep voice said, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stood up, apparently there was a firecracker in mallninja&amp;#39;s pocket because it was really loud. I don&amp;#39;t know what happened, but all of a sudden the doctor&amp;#39;s room was redecorated in a REALLY vibrant red. It went with the d\u00e9cor. Our new friend wasn&amp;#39;t anywhere to be seen though, and Mister Doctor was crying softly in the corner muttering about &amp;quot;The Face of Insanity&amp;quot; or something. So I just walked out, the nurse lady who showed me in wasn&amp;#39;t anywhere to be seen either so I took a left wen I exited the room. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if it was the way home or not, because I had only been to the clinic here once. And it was a BIG clinic, more of a hospital. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I crossed a hallway I heard a scream, so I turned to help. I was getting very confused because people were starting to disappear. And the repainting was progressing at a rapid pace. My chest was starting to feel funny though, but the doctor said my appointment was over to I kept walking and tried to find an elevator. I took a right, then a left, I stopped to use the toilet. When I left I saw them, the elevators, staring at me seductively with their silvery doors, begging me to push their buttons. So I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took me a very long time to get down to the first floor. The elevator kept stopping and people kept showing up, but they didn&amp;#39;t stick around long. I was beginning to suspect that a case of teleport was making the rounds in the office. By the time I made it to the first floor though, I was starting to feel a little woozy, and it was probably best that I get my sugar pills so I headed towards the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I reached the door, it quickly became apparent that the city was starting a new traffic experiment, where big black vehicles would block all the roads and force commuters to think of ingenious routes home. And it was working, because there was a big convention happening out there. And they were all climbing over each other and screaming. One of them decided he was feeling a bit peckish so he stopped to sample some of the local flavor. But I don&amp;#39;t think it tasted very good because he started screaming out about, &amp;quot;The Dreadlord has come! The Surge will devour us all!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to talk to him, because I had lost my car keys, but I couldn&amp;#39;t reach him in time...my vision was starting to get a little hazy, and the thoughts weren&amp;#39;t forming proper. So I decided I would sit down for a moment to close my eyes.\nAnd that&amp;#39;s how I ended up here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man staring at me from across the desk is smiling at me. &amp;quot;Well thank you for visiting today. I think you will fit in quite nicely here in hell. We have many exciting job opportunities for you here.&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t really have anything better to do...so I just say, &amp;quot;Sure thing Mr. Devil.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgbc4eq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492327405.0, "created_utc": 1492298605.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k7i8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k7i8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc5vue", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ademisk", "parent_id": "t1_dgbs674", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think punctuation would be your best place to start.
