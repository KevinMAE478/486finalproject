The sun peeked in through the leaves and freckled my blanketed form with light. \n\n\"The fuck.\"  I tried to sit up and immediately regretted it, the room before me spinning within my vision.\n\n\"You really should rest, today has been quite a shock for you.\"  The young woman from the train was standing in front of me, holding a large glass of water.\n\n\"Where's your twin?\" I muttered and nodded her my thanks before gulping the water down.  \n\nShe chuckled.  \"Anton isn't my sibling, he's my partner, and he is currently attending Mrs. Roesel.\"  \n\nI took another sip of water, she was staring at me and it was freaking me out.\n\n\"And you are?\"  \n\n\"Oh!\"  She blushed darkly.  \"How rude of me, my name is Isla.\"  Her smile was beautiful, bright, and full of perfect teeth.  She made me very self conscious, with my pin straight red hair and hazel eyes.  My hands moved to cover my stomach that pooched out a bit more than I would have liked. \n\nIsla took my empty glass and I looked around the room I was in.  White walls were covered with windows and plants.  Vegetables grew on the vines that splayed across the walls of a spacious kitchen in the corner.  Small, well trimmed fruit trees and bushes seemed to actually be planted around a beautiful white tea table with a green marble top.  The matching white chairs were covered in soft green cushions. \n\nThere was a cushy looking couch in a pale gray, potted plants dotted the large central room, and there were several items I was unfamiliar with.  However in front of the couch was very clearly a television, except the images were projected from the floor. \n\nThe room I was in seemed to have a divider between it and the central room. I was sitting on a soft bed, the sheets were pale green and the comforter was sprayed with delicately embroidered flowers.  Simple white furniture was placed around the room, along with a few panels of buttons I was very unsure of. An entire wall of the room was windows, and the city sprawled before me.\n\nEverything was forgotten as I pulled myself from the bed, barely noting that my clothes had been changed into a long gray shift that felt like butterfly wings. \n\nThis place, was amazing. \n\nPlants grew from almost every surface, but they integrated with the brilliant lights and bright, sterile white of the architecture.  Neon advertisements spotted the skyline, but they were offset by man-made waterfalls and rivers that moved through the city like liquid diamonds.  Sleek gray/green trains skimmed through the city, and floating cars scuttled along the roads like sparkling bugs, people swarming every inch of the area I could see. \n\nIt was a marvel of nature and technology, and I felt myself hyperventilating as I tried to take it all in.  My vision was blurry with tears as I thought about my mom, and I subconsciously looked for her apartment building in the detritus that surrounded the shining Arbor. \n\n\"I know it's a lot to take in.\"  I screamed at the top of my lungs for the second time in twenty-four hours, and Isla dropped the bowl of fruit she had been carrying. \n\n\"Oh crap, I'm sorry Isla.  You just, startled me a bit.\" My smile was sheepish as I bent down to pick the fruit up from the floor, popping a raspberry in my mouth.  It was the best thing I had ever eaten.  Isla smiled knowingly at me and offered me a glass of bright green liquid, which was also delicious, and extremely hydrating. \n\n\"SO, what is this place?\"  I took another sip of the juice and motioned to the room I was in.\n\n\"Your apartment of course.\" The juice almost exploded out of my mouth, there was no way this beautiful place was mine.  A caramel colored hand gently grasped my wrist.\n\n\"It's real Kara, all of it.  Breathe.\"  I sucked in a deep breath, and forgot my mouth was full of juice.  This left me in a gasping, coughing heap, and Isla in hysterics.  Her laughter was musical and she grabbed a towel from a closet she had opened with one of the small wall panels. \n\n\"You need to change.\"  She managed to breathe out as she handed me the towel.  \"Clothing is in here.\"  Her fingers danced across another panel and an enormous closet opened.  \n\n\"And the bathroom, is here. I think!\"  Isla pressed on a third panel and a door opened to a gorgeous master bath, hanging vines from a windowed ceiling providing a flowered shower curtain. \n\nHer smile was blinding and she looked me up and down in a predatory way.\n\n\"I can't wait to see you in some new clothes. Hurry up and get ready Mrs. Roesel will be waiting for us.\"  With that she pressed a button, and a dimly lit, yet opaque divider appeared out of the ceiling, cutting her off from view. \n\n---\n\nUltimately I had needed help getting into the complex garments that were now my wardrobe.  Isla had chuckled at me, but had ended up marveling at my hair and my freckles as she helped me dress. \n\nAfter I had finished changing, and brushed my unruly hair, we made our way to the lobby of the building.  Mrs. Roesel was waiting for me in the enormous atrium that served as the first floor.  Her long blue robes fluttered behind her as she moved smoothly across the spotless marble. \n\n\"Welcome Kara, come, I will show you to the Library. \" She offered me her arm and I took it gently, her wisp covered head barely reaching my shoulder.    \n\nAs we exited the building into the sun, the smell of flowers was the first thing that registered.  Then I noticed, that every, single, pair of blue eyes was fixed on me. \n\n\"Why are they staring at me?\"  Mrs. Roesel chuckled and patted my hand softly. \n\n\"Don't be worried dear, they have just never seen someone that looks like you.\"  \n\n\"What do you mean?\" She looked up at me without breaking stride.\n\n\"Do you see anyone here who looks like you?\"  I shook my head.\n\n\"Everyone in the world looks very similar now. Interracial breeding led to the amalgamation of our features over time.  It was an inevitability.\"  She shrugged her shoulders and waved to a passing woman who waved happily back. \"And that means, that you my dear are one of a kind.\"  \n\nI looked around at the passing people and suddenly felt very uncomfortable again.  The pale lilac colored dress I wore was lovely, but now felt very revealing to the eyes of a thousand strangers.  Their lack of diversity both interesting and frightening at the same time.\n\n\"We're here.\"   I was pulled from my thoughts as huge double doors opened before me.  The scent of old books erupted from the Library and I immediately felt at home.  Here was something that I remembered, books.  \n\nI burst into the entrance way and made my way to the first shelf I saw.  Ancient Chinese History.

The sun peeked in through the leaves and freckled my blanketed form with light. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The fuck.&amp;quot;  I tried to sit up and immediately regretted it, the room before me spinning within my vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You really should rest, today has been quite a shock for you.&amp;quot;  The young woman from the train was standing in front of me, holding a large glass of water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;s your twin?&amp;quot; I muttered and nodded her my thanks before gulping the water down.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She chuckled.  &amp;quot;Anton isn&amp;#39;t my sibling, he&amp;#39;s my partner, and he is currently attending Mrs. Roesel.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took another sip of water, she was staring at me and it was freaking me out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And you are?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh!&amp;quot;  She blushed darkly.  &amp;quot;How rude of me, my name is Isla.&amp;quot;  Her smile was beautiful, bright, and full of perfect teeth.  She made me very self conscious, with my pin straight red hair and hazel eyes.  My hands moved to cover my stomach that pooched out a bit more than I would have liked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isla took my empty glass and I looked around the room I was in.  White walls were covered with windows and plants.  Vegetables grew on the vines that splayed across the walls of a spacious kitchen in the corner.  Small, well trimmed fruit trees and bushes seemed to actually be planted around a beautiful white tea table with a green marble top.  The matching white chairs were covered in soft green cushions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a cushy looking couch in a pale gray, potted plants dotted the large central room, and there were several items I was unfamiliar with.  However in front of the couch was very clearly a television, except the images were projected from the floor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room I was in seemed to have a divider between it and the central room. I was sitting on a soft bed, the sheets were pale green and the comforter was sprayed with delicately embroidered flowers.  Simple white furniture was placed around the room, along with a few panels of buttons I was very unsure of. An entire wall of the room was windows, and the city sprawled before me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything was forgotten as I pulled myself from the bed, barely noting that my clothes had been changed into a long gray shift that felt like butterfly wings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This place, was amazing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plants grew from almost every surface, but they integrated with the brilliant lights and bright, sterile white of the architecture.  Neon advertisements spotted the skyline, but they were offset by man-made waterfalls and rivers that moved through the city like liquid diamonds.  Sleek gray/green trains skimmed through the city, and floating cars scuttled along the roads like sparkling bugs, people swarming every inch of the area I could see. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a marvel of nature and technology, and I felt myself hyperventilating as I tried to take it all in.  My vision was blurry with tears as I thought about my mom, and I subconsciously looked for her apartment building in the detritus that surrounded the shining Arbor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know it&amp;#39;s a lot to take in.&amp;quot;  I screamed at the top of my lungs for the second time in twenty-four hours, and Isla dropped the bowl of fruit she had been carrying. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh crap, I&amp;#39;m sorry Isla.  You just, startled me a bit.&amp;quot; My smile was sheepish as I bent down to pick the fruit up from the floor, popping a raspberry in my mouth.  It was the best thing I had ever eaten.  Isla smiled knowingly at me and offered me a glass of bright green liquid, which was also delicious, and extremely hydrating. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;SO, what is this place?&amp;quot;  I took another sip of the juice and motioned to the room I was in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your apartment of course.&amp;quot; The juice almost exploded out of my mouth, there was no way this beautiful place was mine.  A caramel colored hand gently grasped my wrist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s real Kara, all of it.  Breathe.&amp;quot;  I sucked in a deep breath, and forgot my mouth was full of juice.  This left me in a gasping, coughing heap, and Isla in hysterics.  Her laughter was musical and she grabbed a towel from a closet she had opened with one of the small wall panels. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You need to change.&amp;quot;  She managed to breathe out as she handed me the towel.  &amp;quot;Clothing is in here.&amp;quot;  Her fingers danced across another panel and an enormous closet opened.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And the bathroom, is here. I think!&amp;quot;  Isla pressed on a third panel and a door opened to a gorgeous master bath, hanging vines from a windowed ceiling providing a flowered shower curtain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her smile was blinding and she looked me up and down in a predatory way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t wait to see you in some new clothes. Hurry up and get ready Mrs. Roesel will be waiting for us.&amp;quot;  With that she pressed a button, and a dimly lit, yet opaque divider appeared out of the ceiling, cutting her off from view. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I had needed help getting into the complex garments that were now my wardrobe.  Isla had chuckled at me, but had ended up marveling at my hair and my freckles as she helped me dress. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I had finished changing, and brushed my unruly hair, we made our way to the lobby of the building.  Mrs. Roesel was waiting for me in the enormous atrium that served as the first floor.  Her long blue robes fluttered behind her as she moved smoothly across the spotless marble. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome Kara, come, I will show you to the Library. &amp;quot; She offered me her arm and I took it gently, her wisp covered head barely reaching my shoulder.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we exited the building into the sun, the smell of flowers was the first thing that registered.  Then I noticed, that every, single, pair of blue eyes was fixed on me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why are they staring at me?&amp;quot;  Mrs. Roesel chuckled and patted my hand softly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be worried dear, they have just never seen someone that looks like you.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot; She looked up at me without breaking stride.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you see anyone here who looks like you?&amp;quot;  I shook my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone in the world looks very similar now. Interracial breeding led to the amalgamation of our features over time.  It was an inevitability.&amp;quot;  She shrugged her shoulders and waved to a passing woman who waved happily back. &amp;quot;And that means, that you my dear are one of a kind.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked around at the passing people and suddenly felt very uncomfortable again.  The pale lilac colored dress I wore was lovely, but now felt very revealing to the eyes of a thousand strangers.  Their lack of diversity both interesting and frightening at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re here.&amp;quot;   I was pulled from my thoughts as huge double doors opened before me.  The scent of old books erupted from the Library and I immediately felt at home.  Here was something that I remembered, books.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I burst into the entrance way and made my way to the first shelf I saw.  Ancient Chinese History.  Each shelf full of books was labeled differently, ranging from history and science, to cooking and art. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slowly made my way through the shelves, pausing to touch the spine of a book, or flip through the first few pages.

Old newspapers with faded, or stained print blew past my feet, only there was no breeze on the otherwise empty platform.  There weren't even any benches to sit on. The only things nearby were a ticket stand with glass made opaque by years of neglect, and the ancient ticket-master, who seemed to be asleep. \n\n\nI shuffled my feet nervously, it was getting dark and I had never been in this part of the city before.  With a sigh I checked the letter and the ticket for the hundredth time.  Nothing had changed, the beautiful swirling penmanship still offered me a job, the curious iridescent ink changing color in the flickering lights of the train station.   \n\nThe ticket was a standard train ticket, marked for 6:30 p.m. on Friday, April 4th, 2017.  However, the destination was a totally unfamiliar city, the name unreadable and painful to look at.  Above this was the ticket-master's stamp, identifying it as a legitimate ticket.  He may have been old, but when his eyes were open they had been very sharp, and he had moved with practiced, smooth motions.  \n\nI had been so distracted by the ticket and my letter, that the train had arrived without me even realizing.  Surprise was my first response, the train was unlike any I had ever seen.  The cars overlapped like plates of armor, and shone an odd green-gray in the fading light.  There were no visible wheels, or doors, there were only small circular windows covered in pink tinted glass.  \n\nSlowly, I approached the side of the train and ran my hand along the smooth side.  At my touch the metal began to hum slightly and as my fingers traced along the car, a seam appeared and split open to reveal the interior of the train. \n\nIt was beautiful, lit with flowing blown glass lamps of unintelligible make, and filled with dark wooden furniture upholstered in forest green and calming neutrals.  Living plants I was not familiar with hung in front of each of the pink windows, which strangely, seemed a lot larger on the inside. Paintings depicting beautiful landscapes hung on the leafy wallpapered walls and soft violin music played over unseen speakers.\n\n\"Hello Miss!\"  I screamed and fell off the train onto the platform, my luggage exploding as I went.  \n\nBefore me stood a middle-aged gentleman in a very sharp suit.  His blue eyes crinkled in a chuckle and he bent to help me collect my personal items, which were now strewn about the platform.\n\n\"I am SO sorry Miss, pardon me for my suddenness.\"  He didn't look as he shoved a bra into my bag, and I felt a blush creep up my neck.  \n\n\"Come now!\" The man offered me his well manicured hand. \"You will be late!\"  \nHe helped me onto the train and to a seat, a glass of wine sat at the table in front of me.\n\n\"Oh no, I couldn't, you see I have sort of a job interview? I think?\"  The man laughed again.  \n\n\"Yes I know, and your employers are the ones who insisted you try this very rare vintage.\"  My look was skeptical as I took a sip. \n\nIt was the most delicious wine I had ever tasted, definitely very old indeed, and it immediately spread warmth throughout my chest.  \n\n\"Thank you.\"  The man returned my smile of thanks and bowed deeply.\n\n\"Of course Miss, and now that you have settled in, we can begin our trip.  It shouldn't take long.\"  He smiled a wide, knowing smile and it made me a bit uneasy.  But he seemed nice enough, and I doubt anyone would go to such lengths to kidnap/poison an unemployed twenty something with a master's in history. \n\nI looked up from the wine to ask him about the strangeness of the train, and comment on it's internal beauty, but he had vanished as quickly as he had appeared.  With a shrug I sat back into the soft green cushion and looked out the window at the fading light of the sun.  \n\nThe skyline of the city was so familiar, and I was leaving it behind for a place I had never heard of.  But really, I had nothing to lose. No friends, no pets, no lovers.  I hadn't even been able to keep a steady place there for a while, until I moved in with my mother.  \n\nThat's why this job offer was so perfect. I was going to be working for a private library, doing extra work for a University apparently.  My room and board were paid for by the library, and I would have access to all kinds of new resources I was sure, if the train was any indication of what was to come.\n\nLike a bullet the train took off, I was forced deeper into the green upholstery for a moment, and the world outside sped past me in an indistinct gray/brown blur.  And then it seemed to slow, and out the window there was nothing but vegetation. Green as far as I could see, flowering trees, grass, vines, moss.  It was like in that brief moment of speed the train had taken me from downtown Dallas, to the middle of the Amazon. \n\nThen I saw it, the Reunion tower, only, not how it was ten minutes ago.  This Reunion tower was broken, and covered with vines, but it was unmistakable.  \n\n\"What the fuck?\" I muttered to myself and eyed the empty glass of wine before turning back to the rosy window. \n\nOnly then did I notice the winding overpasses and vegetation covered buildings, shells of their former selves crumbling to waste in an uncontrolled forest. \n\n\"What. The. Fuck.\"  My nose was pressed into the glass when the train came to an abrupt stop, throwing me violently to the floor.  \n\nWith an understated whoosh the doors opened, revealing a man and a woman, both of above average height, with light caramel skin, wavy brown hair, and bright blue eyes.  Their clothes were familiar but foreign, seeming to be an amalgamation of multiple cultures.  Tiny lights sparkled in the woman's jewelry and on her clothes, and silently I wondered how they managed to do that without any visible wiring.  In short, the two were stunning, and weird, and they looked at me as if I had grown three spare heads.\n\n\"Uh hello.\" I stood and brushed myself off, catching a glimpse of a shining bright platform behind them. \n\nThey blinked out of their stares and smiled beautiful smiles.\n\n\"Hello.\" They spoke in unison, I noticed they were holding hands. Weird. \n\n\"So uh, I'm just going to be a little rude here....but...WHAT THE FUCK?!\" I motioned out the window to the dilapidated Magnolia Hotel, which had crumbled in upon itself and was sprouting a tree or seven. \n\n\"Come, she will explain!\"  Their voices were happy, and in unison, and I was tempted to break the stem off of my wine glass to make a shiv. \n\n\"Move you two! SHOO! SHOO!\"  The young man and woman smiled at me again and bolted away from the door, still holding hands. In their place stood a stooped old woman, with nut brown skin and wispy white hair, her glacier colored eyes shone from behind thick glasses, and she smiled a toothy grin. \n\n\"Ah I see you've made it in one piece. I am Mrs. Roesel, your new employer.  Did you like the wine?\" I nodded to her, very confused.  \"Come, come. There is much to see and do.\"  She offered me a gnarled hand and I took it, stepping out into the daylight.  \n\nWait. Daylight?  \n\nI hadn't questioned it before now, but it had suddenly become early afternoon, one more thing to add to the growing confusion that was my life.  \n\nThe platform was blindingly white, and covered with flowering vines.  There were plants everywhere, and people.  What was strange though, was how they all looked very similar, they all had light brown skin, blue eyes, and wavy brown hair.  Their height and weight and features varied, but these three things were constant.  \n\n\"Excuse me, Mrs, Roesel.\"  The old woman had been standing silently beside me.\n\n\"Yes dear?\" I looked down into her wrinkled face, her blue eyes twinkling at me.\n\n\"Where the fuck am I?\"  She burst out laughing, I thought her little body would shake apart with the motions.  When she had collected herself she wiped a tear from her eye.\n\n\"Well, you see dear, this is The Arbor, or New Dallas as some call it, I think the more appropriate question would be WHEN is it?\"  I felt my eyes widen and I looked around me at the sprawling city of colored glass, vegetation, and marble, the sleek, wheel-less cars moving silently along the pristine streets.  Unknown but familiar birds flew overhead and I struggled to control my breathing.  \n\n\"Wh-when is it?\"  Her eyes were on me and I felt her grin.\n\n\"April 14th, 3801 a.d.\"  I saw blackness as I crumpled to the ground. \n\n\n---\n\nThanks for reading!", "edited": 1492212684.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little train station was filthy.

And then it seemed to slow, and out the window there was nothing but vegetation. Green as far as I could see, flowering trees, grass, vines, moss.  It was like in that brief moment of speed the train had taken me from downtown Dallas, to the middle of the Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I saw it, the Reunion tower, only, not how it was ten minutes ago.  This Reunion tower was broken, and covered with vines, but it was unmistakable.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What the fuck?&amp;quot; I muttered to myself and eyed the empty glass of wine before turning back to the rosy window. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only then did I notice the winding overpasses and vegetation covered buildings, shells of their former selves crumbling to waste in an uncontrolled forest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What. The. Fuck.&amp;quot;  My nose was pressed into the glass when the train came to an abrupt stop, throwing me violently to the floor.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With an understated whoosh the doors opened, revealing a man and a woman, both of above average height, with light caramel skin, wavy brown hair, and bright blue eyes.  Their clothes were familiar but foreign, seeming to be an amalgamation of multiple cultures.  Tiny lights sparkled in the woman&amp;#39;s jewelry and on her clothes, and silently I wondered how they managed to do that without any visible wiring.  In short, the two were stunning, and weird, and they looked at me as if I had grown three spare heads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uh hello.&amp;quot; I stood and brushed myself off, catching a glimpse of a shining bright platform behind them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They blinked out of their stares and smiled beautiful smiles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello.&amp;quot; They spoke in unison, I noticed they were holding hands. Weird. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So uh, I&amp;#39;m just going to be a little rude here....but...WHAT THE FUCK?!&amp;quot; I motioned out the window to the dilapidated Magnolia Hotel, which had crumbled in upon itself and was sprouting a tree or seven. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Come, she will explain!&amp;quot;  Their voices were happy, and in unison, and I was tempted to break the stem off of my wine glass to make a shiv. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Move you two! SHOO! SHOO!&amp;quot;  The young man and woman smiled at me again and bolted away from the door, still holding hands. In their place stood a stooped old woman, with nut brown skin and wispy white hair, her glacier colored eyes shone from behind thick glasses, and she smiled a toothy grin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah I see you&amp;#39;ve made it in one piece. I am Mrs. Roesel, your new employer.  Did you like the wine?&amp;quot; I nodded to her, very confused.  &amp;quot;Come, come. There is much to see and do.&amp;quot;  She offered me a gnarled hand and I took it, stepping out into the daylight.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait. Daylight?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#39;t questioned it before now, but it had suddenly become early afternoon, one more thing to add to the growing confusion that was my life.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The platform was blindingly white, and covered with flowering vines.  There were plants everywhere, and people.  What was strange though, was how they all looked very similar, they all had light brown skin, blue eyes, and wavy brown hair.  Their height and weight and features varied, but these three things were constant.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Excuse me, Mrs, Roesel.&amp;quot;  The old woman had been standing silently beside me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes dear?&amp;quot; I looked down into her wrinkled face, her blue eyes twinkling at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where the fuck am I?&amp;quot;  She burst out laughing, I thought her little body would shake apart with the motions.  When she had collected herself she wiped a tear from her eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, you see dear, this is The Arbor, or New Dallas as some call it, I think the more appropriate question would be WHEN is it?&amp;quot;  I felt my eyes widen and I looked around me at the sprawling city of colored glass, vegetation, and marble, the sleek, wheel-less cars moving silently along the pristine streets.  Unknown but familiar birds flew overhead and I struggled to control my breathing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wh-when is it?&amp;quot;  Her eyes were on me and I felt her grin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;April 14th, 3801 a.d.&amp;quot;  I saw blackness as I crumpled to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg9qtp4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492232390.0, "created_utc": 1492203590.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e78f", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65e78f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9xy2b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mickdeb", "parent_id": "t1_dg9po9o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Awesome i liked that one !", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awesome i liked that one !&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg9xy2b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492241721.0, "created_utc": 1492212921.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9po9o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hairiest_Tubman", "parent_id": "t3_65e78f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good day to you lad\n\nWe think you'll be glad\n\nWhen you think of all the fun to be had\n\n\nGames to play and games all day.
