Needing to clear his head he strolled through the stacks when a dusty tome caught his eye. \u201cThe Names Of All Things\u201d glittered in golden print from his leather facade. Eager to avoid his impending deadline, he paged through searching for the name of his pen, hoping that he could get it to write the rest of his essay for him. After an hour of frantic searching, he found it, he found the name he was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He rushed quickly to his pen and uttered the name: \u201cSnizzfrazzle.\u201d The pen awoke ready to answer it\u2019s master\u2019s call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWrite the rest of my essay,\u201d he barked. The pen hovered motionless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWrite the rest of my essay.\u201d Again the pen would not budge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sifted through the tome wondering why it wasn\u2019t working. He found his explanation, the objects would obey the master&amp;#39;s whims but it would not do what it was not capable of on its own. Realizing the error of his ways he rushed back to finish his essay. Just then, his phone vibrated, \u201cMidnight: Hope You Finished.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell that sucks.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dga1nz1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492246671.0, "created_utc": 1492217871.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
