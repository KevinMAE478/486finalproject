In the three days the stray has been here, Mitten's human has placed several odd pieces of machinery on the wooden platform.\n\n\"You'll get used to it just like I did, Snowball.\" He replied, now perched on the Grand black piano. \n\nThe interior of the house was truly a feat to behold. Snowball hadn't been in many human houses before, especially one that had a domesticated individual of his species. It bewildered him, then, that the American Shorthair was fond of introducing his owner's various possessions in the guise of a documentary announcer. \n\nMittens leaped from the edge of the piano, claws protruding from his paws to latch nicely onto the shelf. It was sturdy to say the least, Snowball's guide wasn't exactly the thinnest cat in the world. He assumed this would be him in a couple of years; fat, domesticated, and completely contented with lazing around in the warm and cozy living room by the fireplace. It was a definite step up from living on the streets.\n\n\"Hold on while I grab the thing from the bigger thing.\" Mittens meowed from the shelf, as his snout went to work on an object that Snowball was very well acquainted with which brought back terrible memories of a kitten trying to survive in a world that showed him no love. It was a cardboard box.\n\nSnowball pushed the desolate memories aside and inquired his guide of the object he was searching for. \"What thing?\" \n\n\"Oh, it's just used to keep other things inside. I don't know what it's called.\" The Shorthair misunderstood, his tail now wagging lazily in the air as he pawed the content of the box.\n\n\"It's called a box.\" The white cat clarified. \n\n\"Is that so? I never would've guessed.\" \n\n\"What are you searching for?\" Snowball asked, now getting impatient.\n\n\"It's a small, black thing you clip on your fur. It makes your voice extra loud! My owner likes to play with sounds.\" Mittens gleamed. It was only then that Snowball realized how much admiration his guide had for his human. Would this be him in several months' time? A proud, loving cat that enjoyed every waking moment of its carefree days? To be appreciative of having nine lives? He could not fathom it.\n\n\"Here we go!\" His guide piped up. In an instant, Mitten's voice grew to be louder than it ever was before. A wonderfully compact, (but much oversized) clip on microphone decorated the front of his chest. It blended in splendidly with the patch of black fur on his usual ginger.\n\n\"If you'd just follow me, the first sight awaits us!\" Mittens declared, happily hopping from the shelf, down to where Snowball currently sat. \n\nAs it was in his best interest, Snowball merely nodded, stifled a rather warranted but bored yawn, and followed behind his eager guide. \n\n\"On our right, is the coffee table that my human simply adores working on. It's also where she ignores me the most. Damned, infernal machine!\" Mittens let out a slight hiss albeit a playful one.\n\n\"A machine?\" Snowball asked, completely intrigued.\n\n\"Oh, yes. It opens up to have a screen and keys you can tap on. Whenever she uses this, I am devoid of all attention.\" \n\n\"I think it would be great to have some free time if she were to use it every now and then.\"\n\nMittens mouth was agape in horror.\n\n\"I am a very high maintenance cat! Besides, she uses it too often.\" \n\n\"How often is often?\"\n\n\"Every fifteen minutes. When she's not distracted by me, that is! It's my job to make sure she doesn't spoil her beautiful green eyes of hers. I think of it as my sacred duty -oh yes I do!\" He emphasized. There was no way you could ever change the Shorthair's mind. \n\n\"Now if you'll kindly follow me,\" The exasperated feline continued. \"We shall feast our eyes on the wondrous thing called television.\" \n\n\"What's a tear-lee-vee-shuon?\" Snowball exaggerated the pronunciation.\n\n\"It's only the most magical -what did you call the thing I found this thing earlier in?\" Mittens motioned to the clip-on mic.\n\n\"A box?\"\n\n\"Yes! The most magical box you'll ever see in our nine lives.\" He jumped onto the table, pressing wildly on the TV remote. The TV sprang to life, revealing a news broadcast on sprinkled donuts.\n\n\"It shows pictures from all over the world.\"\n\n\"I don't think I'd be interested in that. I'd rather play with the playthings you have.\" \n\n\"When Sara is distracted by that infernal machine, this is our only solace.\" Mittens shook his head in disgust. \"Don't knock it before you try it, believe me!\"\n\n\"Can we go take a look at your playthings now, please?\" The new inhabitant of this quaint house pleaded. He was aching to play with the catnip and the cat tree he often sees Mittens play in. He wanted to scale up to the highest pole, and sit in the hole for a while, taking in the sites of the great room. \n\n\"Why not? Right this way!\"\n\nIt took them up many flights of stairs and through two awkward corridors, but finally the entrance to the room consisted of everything Smowball ever dreamed of when he was a stray. Cat toys for as far as his little beady eyes could see were sprawled across the room. \n\n\"This is...\" He began to speak, but no words could describe how he was feeling.\n\n\"It's great isn't it? Sara spoils me, that's for sure.\" His guide said nonchalantly, like it was commonplace. \n\nSnowball always imagined a life for himself. He didn't make any exceptions to his fits of fantasy. He'd live in the most grand of places, have much more to eat than just garbage from a trash can and playthings as far as he eyes could see.\n\nHe was standing right before the very proof that it was all worth something.
