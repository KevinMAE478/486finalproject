It was as if someone had taken a can of purple paint, and set it on top of an oven. The colors roiled, bubbled, and twisted as if boiling. As he basked in the heat of it, beads of sweat turned into continuous streams that rolled down his face. The lights in his home were flickering at this point, and in the intermittent periods of dark he was still able to see by the light of the portal.\n\nThe ground below Frank vibrated, and loose dust fell from his basement's ceiling. It seemed as if the entire house was lightly shaking, and judging by the cracks that were beginning to appear in the walls of his house's foundation, it was only getting worse.\n\nIn his sweaty palms, Frank held a crumpled piece of paper. As it became damp and mingled with his body's moisture, the ink began to run as the physical message on it was lost. But it remained in his memory, the simple words and incantation that had set him on this ten year long mission.\n\nFrank had destroyed the incantation long ago, once he had been sure he understood the mechanics behind it. This was something he alone was meant to have, and the knowledge would die with him.\n\nBut the words he had kept to the very moment. The words drove him forward.\n\n\"The past exists, always. Time is not a line, but a place. Like a far off destination, you may not be there, but it still exists. Waiting for your arrival. All around you, the future you seek, and the past you'd change, wait for you. Now, try to perceive them.\"\n\nThe heat and the radiation that Frank knew to be coming off of it combined into a powerful punch that made his lesser self want to flee. Like some sort of unthinking animal.\n\nHe took a deep breath, and the smell of *something* burning. It tugged at his memory, and visions filled his mind. Frank shuddered, a single tear mixed in with the rivers of sweat that flowed down his face, and he leapt forward.\n\nThere was no grand journey, no tunnel for him to travel or grand sights to see. He did not spend an eternity in transit, only to end up mad on the other side. No, Frank saw the purple as if it was replacing the black of his pupils, and then he was there.\n\nFire licked into the sky. Towers of smoke rose like black heralds, beckoning death to the place where he would find his next victims. The acrid odor of burning oil filled his lungs as Frank took a deep breath, breathing in air that had not touched his lungs for twenty years. Above him a blue, cloudless sky curved around the endless plains and the lonely highway. The only break in it's color was the brilliant summer sun, a fierce white orb that hovered directly above and whose heat was rivaled only by the intense flames.\n\nThis was the day. The day he had decided to put it all behind him, to leave his troubles in the past. If only he'd known how unsafe anything was in the past.\n\n\"Brother,\" Andrew whispered. A shiver ran down Frank's spine, the voice still elicited such a fearful response even after all these years. \"Save me, Frank, please.\"\n\nFrank turned away from the wreckage, and saw the live version of the memory that had haunted his waking moments for years. Two bodies burnt to a dark red crisp, their features melted and unrecognizable. He had forgotten what his parents had actually looked like long ago, the black charred remains were all he thought of when he cared to recall them. This trip would not change that, nothing ever would.\n\nThen there was his younger self, a boy who at fifteen was just beginning to tap into his potential. He had thought himself so strong and mature at the age, but now he saw that he was but a child, who now held the fate of everything in his hands.\n\nHis older brother lay burnt and dying in the hands of his younger self. It was a body beyond repair, but the soul was still there. It was a forbidden spell, one that he and Andrew had learned together. Even back then, his brother's attraction to the dark magics was a strong one.\n\nHis younger self placed a single hand on Andrew's chest, and began the incantation. This was the moment he had forgiven his brother, and decided a broken family, one with two dead parents and a maniacal older brother was better than none. This was the moment he had destroyed everything, the moment he had become weak.\n\nFrank summoned all his might, and cried out an old but basic incantation. As he finished the phrase he focused his gaze upon his younger self's hand, and it vanished in a violent, red mist.\n\nThe boy cried out in terror filled pain, and rolled off Andrew as he fell deathly silent. His older brother's soul departed the world, instead of being captured. He would never find a new home, or new body, and would never rise to power.\n\nA crack like lightning split the air, and a hand fell on Frank's shoulder. He turned to see a more grizzled, and even older version of himself appear. He was missing a hand, and cried out a dark, evil incantation. Frank barely managed to summon a shield, and was blown back toward the wrecked vehicles that burned with even more intensity.\n\n\"Andrew,\" the older version of himself cried out in anger, \"I'm too late!\"\n\nThe older version yelled another incantation, and the fires swirled around Frank trapping him in a prison of flames. He writhed and twisted in the heat of it, and the older Frank approached the prison.\n\n\"You killed my brother,\" the older Frank yelled, as the younger version watched in terror, \"He was all I...we had. And you killed him!\"\n\n\"I had to,\" Frank yelled back through the burning pain, \"He...AHH...he was a...Mo-monster!\"\n\n\"You're a fool,\" the older Frank grew near silent, \"Andrew was evil, but he was the lesser. He stopped an even greater evil, that was his only purpose. And you robbed the world of that small salvation.\n\nFrank's clothes ignited, and the fire clawed and climbed all over his exposed skin just as it had his parents. But there was no pain, his constant incantations protected him from burning.\n\n\"You can't afford to ask,\" the older Frank nodded, \"You'll burn to death. But you're wondering...what could possibly be worse? I saw your timeline, and it wasn't a good one. But it was far better than mine.\"\n\nThe younger Frank stared on, his eyes darting back and forth between the charred bodies of his family, and the two older versions of himself.\n\nThe older Frank gripped at his ragged, black shirt with both hands and ripped it open. Frank saw that it was completely red, as if painted. But as he gazed closer, he realized they were soul scars, millions of them that ran together to paint his body. They were tiny little red lines, and each represented a soul that this Frank had destroyed.\n\n\"Andrew stopped *me*,\" the older Frank cried out, his eyes wide and insane, \"And while I'm not a good man, I am just. All of this happened because of you, and you will pay the price.\"\n\nThen the older Frank glanced at the youngest, and smiled. \"We will all pay the price for my crimes.\"\n\nSuddenly the flames exploded into a mighty heat, the kind of which rivaled the heart of a star. Frank's incantations were too weak, and his skin began to char, boil, and melt under them.\n\nHe screamed in pain, and as he took his last heat filled breath, he stuck a hand out to the youngest version of himself. With on final push as the heat fried his lungs, he cried out the incantation to open a time portal.\n\n\"Run,\" was the last thing he managed to say before the fire destroyed him.\n\nAnd so the young Frank ran through the portal and on to a new timeline. Unknowingly continuing the cyclical tragedy that played out through every feasible timeline in the multi-verse.\n\nHe would be chased, and would chase. The war fought by himself, against himself would never end. Maybe it was never meant to. But that was the only certainty, there would be no victory, there was only the war, and the search for one non-existing timeline in which he would not suffer.\n_______________\nDid you like this story?

Now, try to perceive them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The heat and the radiation that Frank knew to be coming off of it combined into a powerful punch that made his lesser self want to flee. Like some sort of unthinking animal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He took a deep breath, and the smell of &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; burning. It tugged at his memory, and visions filled his mind. Frank shuddered, a single tear mixed in with the rivers of sweat that flowed down his face, and he leapt forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no grand journey, no tunnel for him to travel or grand sights to see. He did not spend an eternity in transit, only to end up mad on the other side. No, Frank saw the purple as if it was replacing the black of his pupils, and then he was there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fire licked into the sky. Towers of smoke rose like black heralds, beckoning death to the place where he would find his next victims. The acrid odor of burning oil filled his lungs as Frank took a deep breath, breathing in air that had not touched his lungs for twenty years. Above him a blue, cloudless sky curved around the endless plains and the lonely highway. The only break in it&amp;#39;s color was the brilliant summer sun, a fierce white orb that hovered directly above and whose heat was rivaled only by the intense flames.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was the day. The day he had decided to put it all behind him, to leave his troubles in the past. If only he&amp;#39;d known how unsafe anything was in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Brother,&amp;quot; Andrew whispered. A shiver ran down Frank&amp;#39;s spine, the voice still elicited such a fearful response even after all these years. &amp;quot;Save me, Frank, please.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frank turned away from the wreckage, and saw the live version of the memory that had haunted his waking moments for years. Two bodies burnt to a dark red crisp, their features melted and unrecognizable. He had forgotten what his parents had actually looked like long ago, the black charred remains were all he thought of when he cared to recall them. This trip would not change that, nothing ever would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there was his younger self, a boy who at fifteen was just beginning to tap into his potential. He had thought himself so strong and mature at the age, but now he saw that he was but a child, who now held the fate of everything in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His older brother lay burnt and dying in the hands of his younger self. It was a body beyond repair, but the soul was still there. It was a forbidden spell, one that he and Andrew had learned together. Even back then, his brother&amp;#39;s attraction to the dark magics was a strong one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His younger self placed a single hand on Andrew&amp;#39;s chest, and began the incantation. This was the moment he had forgiven his brother, and decided a broken family, one with two dead parents and a maniacal older brother was better than none. This was the moment he had destroyed everything, the moment he had become weak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frank summoned all his might, and cried out an old but basic incantation. As he finished the phrase he focused his gaze upon his younger self&amp;#39;s hand, and it vanished in a violent, red mist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boy cried out in terror filled pain, and rolled off Andrew as he fell deathly silent. His older brother&amp;#39;s soul departed the world, instead of being captured. He would never find a new home, or new body, and would never rise to power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A crack like lightning split the air, and a hand fell on Frank&amp;#39;s shoulder. He turned to see a more grizzled, and even older version of himself appear. He was missing a hand, and cried out a dark, evil incantation. Frank barely managed to summon a shield, and was blown back toward the wrecked vehicles that burned with even more intensity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Andrew,&amp;quot; the older version of himself cried out in anger, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m too late!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The older version yelled another incantation, and the fires swirled around Frank trapping him in a prison of flames. He writhed and twisted in the heat of it, and the older Frank approached the prison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You killed my brother,&amp;quot; the older Frank yelled, as the younger version watched in terror, &amp;quot;He was all I...we had. And you killed him!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I had to,&amp;quot; Frank yelled back through the burning pain, &amp;quot;He...AHH...he was a...Mo-monster!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a fool,&amp;quot; the older Frank grew near silent, &amp;quot;Andrew was evil, but he was the lesser. He stopped an even greater evil, that was his only purpose. And you robbed the world of that small salvation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frank&amp;#39;s clothes ignited, and the fire clawed and climbed all over his exposed skin just as it had his parents. But there was no pain, his constant incantations protected him from burning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t afford to ask,&amp;quot; the older Frank nodded, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll burn to death. But you&amp;#39;re wondering...what could possibly be worse? I saw your timeline, and it wasn&amp;#39;t a good one. But it was far better than mine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The younger Frank stared on, his eyes darting back and forth between the charred bodies of his family, and the two older versions of himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The older Frank gripped at his ragged, black shirt with both hands and ripped it open. Frank saw that it was completely red, as if painted. But as he gazed closer, he realized they were soul scars, millions of them that ran together to paint his body. They were tiny little red lines, and each represented a soul that this Frank had destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Andrew stopped &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; the older Frank cried out, his eyes wide and insane, &amp;quot;And while I&amp;#39;m not a good man, I am just. All of this happened because of you, and you will pay the price.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the older Frank glanced at the youngest, and smiled. &amp;quot;We will all pay the price for my crimes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the flames exploded into a mighty heat, the kind of which rivaled the heart of a star. Frank&amp;#39;s incantations were too weak, and his skin began to char, boil, and melt under them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He screamed in pain, and as he took his last heat filled breath, he stuck a hand out to the youngest version of himself. With on final push as the heat fried his lungs, he cried out the incantation to open a time portal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Run,&amp;quot; was the last thing he managed to say before the fire destroyed him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so the young Frank ran through the portal and on to a new timeline. Unknowingly continuing the cyclical tragedy that played out through every feasible timeline in the multi-verse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He would be chased, and would chase. The war fought by himself, against himself would never end. Maybe it was never meant to. But that was the only certainty, there would be no victory, there was only the war, and the search for one non-existing timeline in which he would not suffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you like this story?

I think about the raging depression and the quiet depression and the other kinds of depression, the anxiety that was not really anxiety, the fear, oh, God, the fear, the way being bombed at 12 can really mess with your mind.

If stopping then didn't work, I was going to follow them. I turned my device on, equipped my suit, packed my tools and headed to sphere portal I opened with my wrist-mounted time machine. Before I went in, someone grabbed me by the shoulder. I turned around and saw a man. He had silver hair, but he looked young and pale, and exactly like me. He was wearing different suit though and was at least 10 years older than me. \n\n\"You must be future me. Why did you come here?\".\n\n\"To stop you\", he said.\n\n\"\"Time travel is complex thing. If you go back in time and change past, your present and future will change too. Maybe you will change past so badly, present where you can time travel will not even occur, nullifying your time travel and resulting in only one change, nonexistence of time travel. Probably that's why no one else have found time travel before.\" - Is this what you want to tell me? I already thought about this and I know how to avoid this result. I will tell my kid self how to live and what to research! He will do it too! I won't change much... But as you are my future self, maybe you know more than me. Tell me, why did you stop me?\" - I told him exactly this words. You know, I thought I knew myself better than anyone else, but...\n\n\"I am not you. You are not me. You don't understand what you're doing and I am here to explain in order to avoid another disaster.\"\n\n\"Disaster... time... I DON'T UNDERSTAND! I just invented time machine, let me go!\". \n\nI jumped into the portal, he followed me. We ended up in forest. It was familiar place.\n\n\"One more time, I am not you. We are different people\".\n\n\"I know, I know... you are from future and you changed. But you're still ME!\".\n\nHe grinned after I told him that. \"You don't get it. I'm not from future. We're not in past. We didn't time travel. We simply went in another universe, where time passes differently compared to your and my one. Here is still 2018 and you just assume it's your past, but it's not. You're about to see it yourself.\". \n\nI was frozen in motion. \"But... no way! I tried my best to change my trash past!\".\n\n\"You tried, but failed. Trying and success are different. Traveling back in time is simply impossible.\".\n\nI realized he was right. I stopped raging and decided to go back in my universe. \"But this familiar forest... Wait... did you just say 2018?. I remember everything. This forest was where I ran off to from orphanage in my 2018. I spent week here until police found me.\" \n\n\"This is forest you ran off to, yes. In my reality, I built real nice house when I was 13 and I lived here with my dogs, until my house caught fire and all my loyal friends died.\" told my alternate self. \"Guess some stuff is shared in all realities, like this place, for us, hah?\".\n\nWe heard footsteps, so we cloaked ourselves to avoid being detected. There was a kid and a man, carrying tents on backpacks. It was me and my dad... I mean alternate self and his dad. They were camping in this forest, in 2018... \"I see... At least that's good sight.\" me and my \"future\" self said silently at the same time, then we looked at each other and smiled. That brought back my memories from past, I remembered someone with silver hair gave me water and sandwich when I was hiding in forest as orphanage runaway... You know, now I know who it was and it wasn't hallucination or false memory.\n\n\"Anyways, what disaster were you talking about earlier?\" I asked Silver (I gave him that nickname).\n\n\"Do you know how my house got burned? From other universe, our alternate self came to my home. In his reality, his dogs were killed by thieves. This criminals remained at his home for several hours and then left, he ran off to forest during this time. He came to my reality, thinking it was past, exactly on time thieves were in his house and shot my house with flamegun, thinking he roasted criminals, but actually he murdered my loyal friends...\".\n\n\"I see... Now I understand. Thank you for everything.\"\n\nWe parted our ways. I went back to my reality and kept on living. He went back to his universe, or maybe in another one to help another person. \n\nI learned one important thing. You might not be able to change past, but your future has infinite outcomes.
