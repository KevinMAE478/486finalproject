Some argue that it improves your life if you unlock meaningful and positive achievements. Others counter that with stating that even one negative achievement can ruin your life for good. Take the old janitor at my school for example. He was cleaning the girls' dressing room at the gymnasium when he stumbled upon one of the girls still dressing at a moment everyone should have been gone. She never saw him because he hurried out but he got the achievement 'Perv Alert' by seeing a teenage girl in her panties without her knowing. And as you all know, all achievements are uploaded to a database controlled by the government. The poor man could never find a job after the incident and he ended up killing himself. Giving himself the achievement 'Spiralling Down', taking your life because of an achievement.\n\nSo people have to watch out, because there literally exist achievement for everything. Thomas, my best friend, got 'Wrong Hole' after trying anal with his girlfriend for the first time. We ridiculed him for days until he got 'Ain't Gay if it's in a Threeway'. I got some embarrassing ones myself, but let's not talk about that. Let's talk about the rare ones. The achievements that require such a long process or dozens of steps in correct order to unlock them. There's no real reward with unlocking those except for the prize you get for finding new achievements. Why it's so important to the government I'll never know, but I don't care. I enjoy chasing those rare ones.\n\nMy luck has been running out lately though. It's been 8 months since my last rare, 'Game of Patience', not reading Game of Thrones spoilers until I finished A Dream of Spring with all the books published for over a year. Apparently there are only like 52 people who got that achievement so far. I still can't believe Tyrion was a time-travelling fetus.\n\nSo for 8 months I've been looking for a new rare one. The ultimate achievement would of course be finding a complete new one that has existed for a longer period of time. I climbed the Himalayas, I submerged myself in the Mariana Trench, I dove from Niagara Falls, I explored caves deeper than anyone had ever been (or so I thought, turns out there's always some idiot Neanderthal stumbling into those caves).\n\nYesterday though. Yesterday was my lucky day. I finally unlocked a new achievement, one never before unlocked by anyone. It's a bit ironic though. I didn't do anything special specifically to unlock it. It's all the things I did that accumulated and eventually unlocked 'Awakening'. It randomly popped up when I woke up one day to the new achievement 'Eight a Year'. Apparently I had swallowed a spider in my sleep and that was achievement number 1.000.000 I unlocked. One million achievements. That was an achievement on its own and a unique one at that. I looked it up in the database. The A-list. I scrolled down to AW - AX and there it was;\n\n&gt; **Awakening:**\n\n* First unlock: June 25, 2054\n\n* First claimer: Fred Thompson\n\n* Times unlocked: 1\n\n* Rarity: Extremely Rare\n\n* Requirements: Unlock 1.000.000 achievements\n\n* Description: Awakens the dormant power in a person's body.\n\nI read the database entry a few times before I started processing what it said. *The dormant power in a person's body.* What the hell was that. I didn't feel any different.\n\nJust as I was about to call Thomas about my new achievement, there was a knock on the door.\n\n&gt; More over at /r/Neite", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achievements are a treacherous thing.

He was cleaning the girls&amp;#39; dressing room at the gymnasium when he stumbled upon one of the girls still dressing at a moment everyone should have been gone. She never saw him because he hurried out but he got the achievement &amp;#39;Perv Alert&amp;#39; by seeing a teenage girl in her panties without her knowing. And as you all know, all achievements are uploaded to a database controlled by the government. The poor man could never find a job after the incident and he ended up killing himself. Giving himself the achievement &amp;#39;Spiralling Down&amp;#39;, taking your life because of an achievement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So people have to watch out, because there literally exist achievement for everything. Thomas, my best friend, got &amp;#39;Wrong Hole&amp;#39; after trying anal with his girlfriend for the first time. We ridiculed him for days until he got &amp;#39;Ain&amp;#39;t Gay if it&amp;#39;s in a Threeway&amp;#39;. I got some embarrassing ones myself, but let&amp;#39;s not talk about that. Let&amp;#39;s talk about the rare ones. The achievements that require such a long process or dozens of steps in correct order to unlock them. There&amp;#39;s no real reward with unlocking those except for the prize you get for finding new achievements. Why it&amp;#39;s so important to the government I&amp;#39;ll never know, but I don&amp;#39;t care. I enjoy chasing those rare ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My luck has been running out lately though. It&amp;#39;s been 8 months since my last rare, &amp;#39;Game of Patience&amp;#39;, not reading Game of Thrones spoilers until I finished A Dream of Spring with all the books published for over a year. Apparently there are only like 52 people who got that achievement so far. I still can&amp;#39;t believe Tyrion was a time-travelling fetus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for 8 months I&amp;#39;ve been looking for a new rare one. The ultimate achievement would of course be finding a complete new one that has existed for a longer period of time. I climbed the Himalayas, I submerged myself in the Mariana Trench, I dove from Niagara Falls, I explored caves deeper than anyone had ever been (or so I thought, turns out there&amp;#39;s always some idiot Neanderthal stumbling into those caves).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday though. Yesterday was my lucky day. I finally unlocked a new achievement, one never before unlocked by anyone. It&amp;#39;s a bit ironic though. I didn&amp;#39;t do anything special specifically to unlock it. It&amp;#39;s all the things I did that accumulated and eventually unlocked &amp;#39;Awakening&amp;#39;. It randomly popped up when I woke up one day to the new achievement &amp;#39;Eight a Year&amp;#39;. Apparently I had swallowed a spider in my sleep and that was achievement number 1.000.000 I unlocked. One million achievements. That was an achievement on its own and a unique one at that. I looked it up in the database. The A-list. I scrolled down to AW - AX and there it was;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awakening:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First unlock: June 25, 2054&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First claimer: Fred Thompson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Times unlocked: 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rarity: Extremely Rare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requirements: Unlock 1.000.000 achievements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description: Awakens the dormant power in a person&amp;#39;s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read the database entry a few times before I started processing what it said. &lt;em&gt;The dormant power in a person&amp;#39;s body.&lt;/em&gt; What the hell was that. I didn&amp;#39;t feel any different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as I was about to call Thomas about my new achievement, there was a knock on the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More over at &lt;a href=\"/r/Neite\"&gt;/r/Neite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg8yngd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492191266.0, "created_utc": 1492162466.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659kx9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8ndb3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CosmicIce05", "parent_id": "t3_659kx9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They call it the \"Agape Achievement\"\n\nI had to research into it.\n\nTurns out that \"agape\" means unconditional love.\n\nThere's a song about it.\n\nHave no idea what I did to deserve the achievement but I guess I did it.\n\nHuh.\n\nNever mind, looked at the description.\n\n*Go against \"You can only love others if you love yourself first\" for 25 years by hating yourself and loving people.*\n\nTfw I'm a therapist.\n\nTfw I check and also have the pseudo-narcissist badge.
