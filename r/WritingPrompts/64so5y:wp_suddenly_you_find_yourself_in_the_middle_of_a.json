And where the hell am I?\"\n\nThe kid flipped through the tome. Blood from his hands got onto the pages, they stuck together, and it got so he couldn't find whatever he was looking for. \"This sucks!\" he said, and slapped at the book, except he missed and hit the bowl of salt beside him and it spilled onto the book, the incense, and the candles surrounding the heptagram I was standing on. \"This book is terrible! Magic sucks!\"\n\n\"Hold on, did you summon me here?\" I was still dressed in my Dota nightshirt and plaid PJ pants. \"Like as in you did a spell with chicken's blood and newt's eye and you made me appear here?

My name is Alexander. You got halfway there.\"\n\nFor a second it looked like he was about to cry. His eyes watered and the tips of his mouth curled downward. Then he let out a little scream, punched the book, threw a handful of herbs at me, and ran over to his computer. \"There's no way, now.\"\n\n\"Hey, little dude, hold on.\" I stepped toward him, then caught myself. I'd seen enough supernatural TV to know not to mess around with the borders of a heptagram. \"Tell me, can I step out of this thing?\"\n\nHe'd brought up some chat program and was typing and reading aloud to himself. \"Scrub, gonna get pwned,\" he said. \"I'll show you who's a scrub.\" He breathed heavily. Even from behind, I could tell his face was bright red.\n\nIt was with a whole lot of nervy worry that I inched a toe toward the salt circle surrounding me. But then I saw a break in the circle.

Maybe I can help.\"\n\nOn the screen, username *leetleetleet* wrote, \"brad your a scrub your gonna get pwnd\"\n\n*leetleetleet* added, \"nub\"\n\n\"You're the nub!\" the kid said. He typed \"youre the nub\" into the chatbox, which didn't strike me as the best comeback. Still, now I knew his name.\n\n\"Is this about a game, Brad?\" I asked. \"I know a lot about games. I'm good at games.\"\n\nBrad pulled his hands off his keyboard and stuffed them into his armpits. \"It's a tournament. To see who's the best in the school videogame club.\"\n\n\"And this leetleet kid is giving you a hard time?\"\n\n\"The game for the last round is this really old game. Age of Empires 2. It's, like, totally bad.

He was only the best general ever.\"\n\nI nodded my head real slow. \"That's... true. I'm not sure I see how that applies to....\" I knelt beside his chair. \"Look, dude. Brad. You've lucked your way into something good here. I played AoE2 a whole lot when I was your age. I still play it sometimes when I'm bored. I'll wipe the floor with this Chris kid, no matter how good his older brother is.\"\n\n\"You?\" Brad's eyes left the screen for the first time. \"You look like a total loser. You're way old and you wear Dota shirts.\"\n\n\"K, ouch. I'm 26. But that aside, me being a loser is our ticket to victory here. Set the game up.\"\n\nAfter Brad and Chris trashtalked poorly for another fifteen minutes, they got the game up and running. I took Brad's seat, and, with him hovering anxiously over my shoulder, proceeded to embarrass Chris and his big brother. I aged up much faster, built a bigger, more advanced army, and destroyed their base at my leisure.\n\nOnce it was all over, Brad spent some time typing things like \"haha scrub youre bad\" and \"lol wait til every1 heres abou t this\"\n\nThen he signed off, looked around his room, smiled at the heptagram, and said, \"Alright, you can go now.\"\n\n\"Go? Go where?\"\n\n\"Home.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Just leave. Go out the door.\"\n\n\"Can't you send me there? Don't you have any spells for that?\"\n\nHe went over to the tome. The pages were still stuck together. He shrugged. \"I don't have any spells for that.\"\n\n\"So I'm supposed to catch a bus? I don't even know what city we're in.\"\n\n\"My parents are gonna be home soon and if they see you they'll call the cops.\"\n\nI stood there, in this little witch's bedroom, in my pajamas, running through my options.

The boy was also dressed to impress, wearing a shirt and long black trousers, the smartest outfit you have as a kid. The man looked like he was the boy\u2019s father. They looked Italian.\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d The father asked.\n\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know!\u201d The kid answered, worried.\n\nThey were talking about me.\n\n\u201cWell, are you sure the spell worked?! Did you do it exactly as I showed you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Papa, I even checked the spell guide just to be sure!\u201d He revealed a small brown book from behind his back. \u201cPapa\u201d took it from him, flicking through the pages until he stopped.

Maybe it wasn\u2019t flour.\n\n\u201cAnd when you saw him, was he awake?\u201d The father asked again.\n\n\u201cNo. He was unconscious. He must of fell when he came through.\u201d\n\nI had. I felt the bruise on my bum.\n\n\u201cWell, we need to find him! We need a meal to eat, the guests must be starving!\u201d\nShit. They were going to eat me. They were cannibals. Italian cannibals. I started looking around, looking for any way out. There was only the wall which they came through, but they were blocking it! I started hyperventilating.\n\n\u201cDo you hear that?\u201d They boy asked.\n\n\u201cHear what?\u201d \n\n\u201cShh, listen.\u201d\n\nMy breathing. They could hear my breathing. I was panicking, doing my best to quiet down, but then in turn was making me breath out much louder.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s over there!\u201d The father shouted, pointing towards the pillar I was hiding behind.\n\nBy this point I was praying under my breath, wishing for a miracle.\nThe kid ran in front of me.\n\n\u201cGot \u2018im!\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d, I whispered, looking up towards the sky. \u201cJust give me something.

Don\u2019t eat me!\u201d I cried out.\n\nThe confusion on his face got even bigger.\n\n\u201cNononono, no.

I went to a restaurant. With my Mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, can your Mom cook it?\u201d The father asked.\n\n\u201cNo, I just meant that she came with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d \nI could see both of them thinking of what they should do.\n\n\u201cWell, can you make anything else?\u201d The father finally asked.\n\nI thought for a long time. What could I make? Eventually, I had an answer.\n\n\u201cHello everyone.\u201d Marco said, welcoming all the guests. \u201cI know you all have been waiting for a long time for food, but don\u2019t worry, because boy, do we have a meal for you tonight. But the meal wouldn\u2019t be possible without a special someone. I would like to introduce you to our chef, and my dear friend, Jason!\u201d\n\nI stepped forward. \n\n\u201cHey guys.\u201d I said nervously.\n\n\u201cHi Jason.\u201d Everyone responded together.\n\nWasn\u2019t expecting that.\n\n\u201cI have-uh, worked hard to give a meal tonight. But I also need to thank Marco and Lorenzo\u201d I announced, pointing to the father and son. \u201cfor being such great hosts for us all.\u201d\n\nEveryone cheered. \n\n\u201cAnd the dish I present to you is..\u201d I paused for dramatic effect. \u201cBoiled spaghetti!\u201d\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was confused. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, this wasn\u2019t real, this couldn\u2019t be happening.

You could see his eyes scanning the words. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHmmm. And you\u2019re sure he was here?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI swear he was just there 10 minutes ago!\u201d The boy pointed to the small circle of flour that I had sat in. The father knelt by it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGood heptagram son. I\u2019m proud.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. Maybe it wasn\u2019t flour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd when you saw him, was he awake?\u201d The father asked again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo. He was unconscious. He must of fell when he came through.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had. I felt the bruise on my bum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, we need to find him! We need a meal to eat, the guests must be starving!\u201d\nShit. They were going to eat me. They were cannibals. Italian cannibals. I started looking around, looking for any way out. There was only the wall which they came through, but they were blocking it! I started hyperventilating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo you hear that?\u201d They boy asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHear what?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cShh, listen.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My breathing. They could hear my breathing. I was panicking, doing my best to quiet down, but then in turn was making me breath out much louder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe\u2019s over there!\u201d The father shouted, pointing towards the pillar I was hiding behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By this point I was praying under my breath, wishing for a miracle.\nThe kid ran in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGot \u2018im!\u201d He said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPlease.\u201d, I whispered, looking up towards the sky. \u201cJust give me something. I\u2019m sorry about not going to church. Please just give me something.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The father stepped out from behind the pillar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAha. What do we have here?\u201d He was smiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPlease, don\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not tasty.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The father\u2019s smile turned to a look of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTasty?\u201d he asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m not tasty! Don\u2019t eat me!\u201d I cried out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The confusion on his face got even bigger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNononono, no. We aren\u2019t gonna eat you, friend.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A wave of relief swopped over me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh thank god. What are you going to do with me then?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re just hosting a dinner party, and we want to impress people, but we don\u2019t know how to cook that well. We saw that you know how to make Chicken Parmigiana, and we thought,\u201d He said, looking at the boy, \u201cThat you could help us cook it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I paused. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI-uh, I don\u2019t know how to make Chicken Parmigiana.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They froze. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut you just ate it?\u201d The boy questioned. \u201cI just thought because you just ate it you must of made it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah, because.. I went to a restaurant. With my Mom.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, can your Mom cook it?\u201d The father asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, I just meant that she came with me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh.\u201d \nI could see both of them thinking of what they should do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, can you make anything else?\u201d The father finally asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought for a long time. What could I make? Eventually, I had an answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHello everyone.\u201d Marco said, welcoming all the guests. \u201cI know you all have been waiting for a long time for food, but don\u2019t worry, because boy, do we have a meal for you tonight. But the meal wouldn\u2019t be possible without a special someone. I would like to introduce you to our chef, and my dear friend, Jason!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped forward. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey guys.\u201d I said nervously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHi Jason.\u201d Everyone responded together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wasn\u2019t expecting that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI have-uh, worked hard to give a meal tonight. But I also need to thank Marco and Lorenzo\u201d I announced, pointing to the father and son. \u201cfor being such great hosts for us all.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone cheered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd the dish I present to you is..\u201d I paused for dramatic effect. \u201cBoiled spaghetti!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5ly5c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492011289.0, "created_utc": 1491982489.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
