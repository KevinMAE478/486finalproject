Let me tell you a story, the story of my early career in medicine,\u201d  She responded as she set dinner down on the table.  My stomach grumbled- I had skipped school lunch that day, preferring to deposit it in the waste bin rather than my mouth.  Though he tried his hardest, our school chef had little control of his own powers, weak as they were.  He claimed he was from Rome, one of the cities that produced the greatest chef power types, and that our meal was Chicken Parmesan, but neither of those statements held much merit.  As I started shoveling food into my mouth, my mother continued to speak, her chair squeaking as she shifted.\n\n\u201cBefore you were born, I was a nurse, specializing in the delivery of children.  This was back in the north, near my home.  But unless your power has a direct medical effect, hospitals fear the effect it can have on children, so I was eventually removed from service.  But by that time, I\u2019d seen enough to make me want to leave.\n\n\u201cNot everyone is lucky enough to have powers, Starchild.  But those who are, their power is altered depending upon where they are born.  Think of it like the seasoning in the meal you are eating- the food holds energy, but with the right spices, it can become enhanced.  Similarly, a location can make a power *pop*.  And people are willing to pay dearly for the locations.\n\n\u201cThe fee my hospital charged was three times my personal salary per child.  If there were twins, the couple was stuck with double the bill.  And if there were no powers, the bill was still due.  This particular hospital was high in the northern mountains, in an area statistically proven to produce the best powers of snow, ice, and weather.  If your child had a power, here they would be the strongest.  And if they didn\u2019t, well, I\u2019ve heard too many stories of children entering orphanages after the parents wasted a fortune. \n\n\u201cThe name of every child born in our hospital was placed on a list submitted to the police, who tracked them for the next two decades.  Should a child commit a petty crime and have their name on the list, it was the same as committing a felony since these children were considered high risk. Unless you were still wealthy, of course.  And it was strange, those names identified as having strong powers but belonging to a lower class, it seemed like they *always* committed a crime, without fail.  That the police just happened to be waiting, watching them for when it happened.  Ready to take them in, and to send them to rehabilitation camps, where they would enter the military or the guard, after several years of conditioning, to sacrifice their lives on the front lines.  And the more powerful you were, the more likely you were to be classified as a delinquent.\n\n\u201cSo listen to me, Starchild.  The hospital I worked at was a level three facility out of five.  Level two\u2019s are even more dangerous, and level ones require a massive fortune to even step in the door.  And as you know, having a baby in an unauthorized location is a crime punishable by death.  Where you were born, that would be off the scales, a level zero location.  Fortunately, you\u2019ve been overlooked, but my power can only do so much.  They\u2019d use you, or kill you, as a weapon or as a precaution.  And you are destined for neither fate.  You were fortunate enough that the space program that employed me ended early, due to solar flare activity, otherwise you would already be in the hands of the government.  So you listen to me, and you tell no one, do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d  I answered, sighing as I finished my plate, and her hand rested heavy upon my shoulder.  And that night, when I retired for bed, I pulled out the first book I had ever stolen from underneath my bed.  Opening my palm, I called forth the small black orb from where I had kept it hidden, in a small pocket just above my wrist.  Not an actual pocket, but almost like the space under my tongue, or behind my ear.  A place where it almost felt as if I had turned the space inside out, and could reach inside with my pinky. \n\nTaking the orb, I unwrapped it slowly, letting the light trapped within escape in a small beam.  Over time, it would grow smaller, until eventually with a flash it would collapse, and I would have to make a new one during the day.\n\n*A Directory of Known Powers*, the book was titled, *Capabilities and Locations*.\n\n*Introduction*\n\n*Little is known in what, precisely, determines the chance that a child will develop any abilities. Conversely, the factors playing into the type of power innate in a child are well studied, and well documented within the pages of this directory.*\n\n*There are many dimensions in which a child\u2019s power can be documented, but for simplicity the following shall be mentioned due to their high correlation with outcomes: locations, power strength, and power type.  Other minor effects include genetics, location and passion of conception, and diet during pregnancy.  Environmental factors at the time of birth are also known to play a role in power development, though less documentation exists to confirm claims.*\n\nYawning, I flipped through the pages to the pictures section, where a compilation of artists had depicted powers in use.  Some were copies of pictures over a hundred years old, documenting powers that had not been seen in so long they were rumored to be myth.  Others had so many occurrences that I skipped them, having seen them so often in real life they now bored me.\n\n*Entry 348, Speaking in Tongues*, read the title, while the picture showed a girl surrounded by people of all ethnicities, their ears tilted towards her.\n\n*Description: A condition in which languages no longer bond speach.  Those born with this power have the ability to converse in multiple languages at the same time to multiple audiences.*\n\n*Strength:  Typically a lower level, measured by number and variety of languages that can be spoken, and whether the power can be extended to the written word.  Owners of this power are also susceptible to side effects of Silver Tongue (see entry 427) and Pied Piper (see entry 201), which can increase the power by an order of magnitude.*\n\n*Location: Documented cases occur in hospitals near border regions or in countries with multiple spoken languages.*\n\n\nI flipped backwards to an earlier entry, and read another, yawning again as I felt sleep coming soon.\n\n*Entry 56, Diamond Exterior* This picture was of a glinting man, half his skin sparkling, the other half normal flesh.\n\n*Description: The ability to change portions of the body to rock or diamond, often razor sharp.*\n\n*Strength:   Typically a medium to high power level. Power is measured by mobility after transformation, as well as ability to change objects outside of their own body.  Nearly indestructible and difficult to contain, those with high abilities of this power are weighted extremely high.*\n\n*Location: Documented cases occur in volcanic regions, with high frequencies at Magmar hospital (LVL 1), located just above an active Hawiian volcano.  Prior to civilization, it is documented that entire islands once held this ability.*\n\nWith a small *pop* my orb exploded, illuminating my room like a camera for a split second before immersing me in darkness. I frowned - I was just getting to the section where hospitals of all levels were listed, but I\u2019d only stored one orb today, as I had used most of mine reading the night before.  \n\nI lay back on my pillow, dreaming about the academy despite my mother\u2019s words.  Where I could maybe even see some of the rarer powers, where I\u2019d be able to share my secret.  Just like the other special children.\n\nBut before I had the chance, the academy moved.\n\n****\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/65k67y/star_child_part_3/)\n\nPart 3 coming tomorrow, on here and my subreddit.  [While you wait, check out my other science fiction story about a starship struck by an asteroid on its way to colonize a distant planet.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/5ons87/you_can_now_add_the_bridge_to_you_shelf_on/)\n", "edited": 1492279316.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy can\u2019t anyone else know?\u201d  I asked my mother after school, when I was ten, \u201cIs something wrong with me?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cQuite the opposite, Starchild.  Let me tell you a story, the story of my early career in medicine,\u201d  She responded as she set dinner down on the table.  My stomach grumbled- I had skipped school lunch that day, preferring to deposit it in the waste bin rather than my mouth.  Though he tried his hardest, our school chef had little control of his own powers, weak as they were.  He claimed he was from Rome, one of the cities that produced the greatest chef power types, and that our meal was Chicken Parmesan, but neither of those statements held much merit.  As I started shoveling food into my mouth, my mother continued to speak, her chair squeaking as she shifted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBefore you were born, I was a nurse, specializing in the delivery of children.  This was back in the north, near my home.  But unless your power has a direct medical effect, hospitals fear the effect it can have on children, so I was eventually removed from service.  But by that time, I\u2019d seen enough to make me want to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot everyone is lucky enough to have powers, Starchild.  But those who are, their power is altered depending upon where they are born.  Think of it like the seasoning in the meal you are eating- the food holds energy, but with the right spices, it can become enhanced.  Similarly, a location can make a power &lt;em&gt;pop&lt;/em&gt;.  And people are willing to pay dearly for the locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe fee my hospital charged was three times my personal salary per child.  If there were twins, the couple was stuck with double the bill.  And if there were no powers, the bill was still due.  This particular hospital was high in the northern mountains, in an area statistically proven to produce the best powers of snow, ice, and weather.

An accident from director of engineering fucking the fat janitor after hours when the rest of the shuttle team had retired, the odds that my mother had been able to hide her baby bump for nine months, the chances that she had been a nurse before being selected from the program and knew how to give birth herself, in a maintenance closet, mere days before the mission was to return to earth.  Keeping me hidden was difficult in the small confines of the ship, but the other hundred and fifty crew members had been too busy to pay a maid much attention.  After all, many insisted that it had not been worthwhile to bring her along, that a maid had been a waste of tax dollars.  I suppose that makes me a waste of tax dollars as well.\n\nBut there were those that spoke to her unique abilities as a maid.  For she had been born deep in the snow of the north, during the first blizzard of winter, that like the first snowfall she could smooth over any differences in her environment and make it appear uniform.  As a maid, it meant that she had an extraordinary sense of cleanliness.  As a mother, it meant she could ensure I was overlooked, that my crying was muffled, and later in life, that I appeared no different than anyone else.\n\nStarchild, she had called me as she smuggled me back into the atmosphere, tucked deep in her suit like a kangaroo would carry her young.  Starchild, she whispered to me when the project disbanded, and she took me back to the inner city apartment where I spent my early life.  Starchild, she reprimanded, whenever I started pushing and pulling at the equilibrium of our apartment, when she would arrive home from work and all the furniture would be clustered at the center of the room, pulled together by a force point.\n\n\"When will I go to school?\"  I asked her when I was eight, watching the uniformed children marching up the street through the wrought iron gates of the academy, one of them flicking flames across his fingers like a coin while another left footprints of frost in the grass.\n\n\"You already go to school, Starchild.\"  She said, \"And your teachers say you've been learning your numbers well, and your reading has been progressing.\"\n\n\"Not *that* school,\" I had said, pulling a face, \"I want to go to the academy.  The special school, for the others like me!\"  I held up a fist, and items on the desk in front of me flew towards it, pens and papers and pencils that stuck out like quivering quills out of my skin.\n\n\"Starchild, listen, and stop that at once\"  She had said, her eyes level with mine, \"There *are* no others like you.  Those children, they are all classified, they are all known. You are *not* like them, you never will be.  And they can't know, do you understand me?\"\n\n\"I guess,\"  I said, with a huff, watching as one of the children cracked a joke and the others laughed, \"But I don't like my school.  Everyone there knows we can't be like them, we can't be special.\"\n\n\"Starchild, you *are* special. One day, they'll know that too.  But not now- if they knew, they wouldn't take you to the academy.  They'd take you somewhere else, somewhere terrible.\"\n\nAnd as I grew older, I realized that she was right.  That when our neighbor started developing powers, a police squad showed up at her front door, and classified her on the spot.  That they left her with a tattoo on her shoulder, a tattoo of a lightning bolt, symbolizing the storm she had been born during.  Just like the tattoo of a snowflake on my mother's shoulder, colored dull grey, to indicate a low threat potential.\n\nSo instead of going to the academy, I created an academy of my own, in my room. Mother made me turn the lights out at ten, so during the day I collected light outside, keeping it in one of the dark holes I could create when I closed my fist hard enough, and letting it loose at night to read books I had stolen from the library.  From the section for the special children, that I could only access if the librarians were distracted.\n\nBut distractions came easy to me.\n\nAs I grew older, the city streets became more populated with the blue uniforms of police.  The academy became increasingly harder to attend, the gifted girl next door disappeared one night without a note.  Mother stopped letting me outside after dark, and the lines for the soup kitchens grew longer. The skies grew darker, the voices accustomed to speaking in whispers, and the television news seemingly had less and less to report.  It was as if there was a blanket thrown upon us, but no one dared look who had thrown it.\n\nBut I would. And when I did, I realized the earth needed a Starchild.\n\n*** \n\nBy Leo.  **[Part 2 Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/65hl73/star_child_part_2/)**\n\nPart 3 coming soon.

Just like the tattoo of a snowflake on my mother&amp;#39;s shoulder, colored dull grey, to indicate a low threat potential.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So instead of going to the academy, I created an academy of my own, in my room. Mother made me turn the lights out at ten, so during the day I collected light outside, keeping it in one of the dark holes I could create when I closed my fist hard enough, and letting it loose at night to read books I had stolen from the library.  From the section for the special children, that I could only access if the librarians were distracted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But distractions came easy to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I grew older, the city streets became more populated with the blue uniforms of police.  The academy became increasingly harder to attend, the gifted girl next door disappeared one night without a note.  Mother stopped letting me outside after dark, and the lines for the soup kitchens grew longer. The skies grew darker, the voices accustomed to speaking in whispers, and the television news seemingly had less and less to report.  It was as if there was a blanket thrown upon us, but no one dared look who had thrown it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I would. And when I did, I realized the earth needed a Starchild.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By Leo.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/65hl73/star_child_part_2/\"&gt;Part 2 Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part 3 coming soon.  &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/5ons87/you_can_now_add_the_bridge_to_you_shelf_on/\"&gt;While you wait, check out my other science fiction story about a starship struck by an asteroid on its way to colonize a distant planet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg9weo6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492239680.0, "created_utc": 1492210880.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4591}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaqs2n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iamcave76", "parent_id": "t1_dgai5e2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Isn't it weird how, depending on the point of view, either answer could work?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t it weird how, depending on the point of view, either answer could work?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgaqs2n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492297833.0, "created_utc": 1492269033.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgai5e2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Arturs1670", "parent_id": "t1_dga64qh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I thought that he meant that he could generate massive amounts of energy with that matter.

The parts about the wars, the mistrust of others, the weird tribalism, that's the stuff that really stuck.  As soon as that wave hit us, it was game over for society as we knew it.  They told us it was a 'wave of distortion in our local space-time bleeding the fabric of one reality over ours', but all we needed to know was the wave came, and all of us became benders.  Not the same as the show mind you, we originally just found the joke funny.  \n\nWhat they told us is the wave unlocked something inside all of us from when we were born.  The older you were, the weaker it was, but kids born right around the wave were insane.  And it wasn't cut-and-dry like that show either; you didn't just get one of the original \"Earth, Wind, Fire, Water\" powers; you got something based a little messier.  Get born in Ohio?  You got earth and some wind.  Desert?  Heat, which with enough will applied became fire, wind, very minute earth.  Rain forests were the luckiest, full spectrum of water, earth, wind, and fire.  \n\nWhat they *didn't* tell us was somebody was born outside the norm.  Right at the point when the wave crashed over Earth, someone was exiting the womb in space.  It took awhile for the repercussions of this to take effect, but once he hit the age where powers start to manifest, it was chaos.  \n\nIt took a few years for things to really break down.  At first the world governments wanted to try to keep the peace, keep things the way they had been; but when your mother country starts to realize the young quads (all four elements) were capable of leveling cities in tornadoes of rocky-fire, things went kinda nuts.  Solos became outcasts.  Nobody wanted to try their luck with just one ability, especially after it became apparent the effects were genetic and would pass down.  However strong you were when the wave hit, that's how strong your line would be, the only way to make things better was to get in good with someone stronger and hope they'd make a baby with you.  \n\nBut that space kid.  Man, he really fucked things up.  \n\nNASA was really the only group that knew he was there.  Well, them and the crew of the ISS.  He was actually expected up there, he was going to be the first human born off-world.  Little did they know, that connection to Earth that was missing was the single-most important feature that kid had.  They called his power 'the void'.  Singularities would open up and throw people into space at the drop of a hat.  He had the power to search space, finding debris and bringing it crashing down.  Gravity manipulation was especially bad.  Turns out, cities are kind of reliant on being, ya know, stuck to the ground.  \n\nHis teenage years were a blur of wanton destruction and utter silence.  He'd pop up in some earth-powerful stronghold and it would suddenly cease to exist.  A group of quads wanted to get him to join them, help them secure their spot in the US heartland, but they didn't even stand a chance when he floated above them watching their bodies spiral into the abyss he made materialize under them.  \n\nThat was years ago at this point.  Now the only quads left are in service to the warlords and tyrants that managed to convince some population to follow them.  We've started to get some of the tech back that we lost, and we've identified the gene sequence that changes so we can detect what abilities people have.  You'll hear jokes about the guy that came up blank in the local militia check point, but nobody ever sees him anymore.  \n\nHe's still out there.  Some say he regretted his actions and went to hide and meditate.  Others say he's just biding his time, waiting for the perfect moment to try to dominate all the others.  The truth?  He found my mom, a quad from an oasis in the desert, and they had me.  Nobody knew what he was, he was able to fake enough that they thought maybe he was just a solo, but boy were they wrong.\n\nNow, it's my turn.  The world's my oyster as they say...\n\nTime to start having some fun. \n\n\nEdit: First time posting in here, I know it's rough.  The thought just came to me and I wanted to run with it.

Rain forests were the luckiest, full spectrum of water, earth, wind, and fire.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What they &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; tell us was somebody was born outside the norm.  Right at the point when the wave crashed over Earth, someone was exiting the womb in space.  It took awhile for the repercussions of this to take effect, but once he hit the age where powers start to manifest, it was chaos.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took a few years for things to really break down.  At first the world governments wanted to try to keep the peace, keep things the way they had been; but when your mother country starts to realize the young quads (all four elements) were capable of leveling cities in tornadoes of rocky-fire, things went kinda nuts.  Solos became outcasts.  Nobody wanted to try their luck with just one ability, especially after it became apparent the effects were genetic and would pass down.  However strong you were when the wave hit, that&amp;#39;s how strong your line would be, the only way to make things better was to get in good with someone stronger and hope they&amp;#39;d make a baby with you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that space kid.  Man, he really fucked things up.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NASA was really the only group that knew he was there.  Well, them and the crew of the ISS.  He was actually expected up there, he was going to be the first human born off-world.  Little did they know, that connection to Earth that was missing was the single-most important feature that kid had.  They called his power &amp;#39;the void&amp;#39;.  Singularities would open up and throw people into space at the drop of a hat.  He had the power to search space, finding debris and bringing it crashing down.  Gravity manipulation was especially bad.  Turns out, cities are kind of reliant on being, ya know, stuck to the ground.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His teenage years were a blur of wanton destruction and utter silence.  He&amp;#39;d pop up in some earth-powerful stronghold and it would suddenly cease to exist.  A group of quads wanted to get him to join them, help them secure their spot in the US heartland, but they didn&amp;#39;t even stand a chance when he floated above them watching their bodies spiral into the abyss he made materialize under them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was years ago at this point.  Now the only quads left are in service to the warlords and tyrants that managed to convince some population to follow them.  We&amp;#39;ve started to get some of the tech back that we lost, and we&amp;#39;ve identified the gene sequence that changes so we can detect what abilities people have.  You&amp;#39;ll hear jokes about the guy that came up blank in the local militia check point, but nobody ever sees him anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s still out there.  Some say he regretted his actions and went to hide and meditate.  Others say he&amp;#39;s just biding his time, waiting for the perfect moment to try to dominate all the others.  The truth?  He found my mom, a quad from an oasis in the desert, and they had me.  Nobody knew what he was, he was able to fake enough that they thought maybe he was just a solo, but boy were they wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;#39;s my turn.  The world&amp;#39;s my oyster as they say...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time to start having some fun. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: First time posting in here, I know it&amp;#39;s rough.

Maybe I\u2019ll just rip you limb from limb at the speed of light.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sirens blared in the background. Silently, the man cursed \u2013 they had taken too long, been caught too early. Every instinct he had urged him to run - but he didn\u2019t dare make a break for it. Not while that terror stared him down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOr maybe, the vacuum of space does something else.\u201d The boy said, grinning triumphantly. \u201cMaybe, so far from everything else\u2026you get nothing at all, and I\u2019ve just been bluffing the entire time.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The men blinked. Before they could react, the police cars swerved into view, sirens deafening. The boy turned and ran, vanishing into the darkness as the criminals cried out in surprise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOr maybe,\u201d He whispered, \u201cyou two are just really, really gullible.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg9xsyt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492241533.0, "created_utc": 1492212733.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 145}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga2vli", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "XcessiveSmash", "parent_id": "t1_dga131y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No immediate plans, but I'm glad you liked the story!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No immediate plans, but I&amp;#39;m glad you liked the story!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dga2vli", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492248339.0, "created_utc": 1492219539.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga131y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Benivav", "parent_id": "t1_dg9wf3h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Come man, gimme MOAR", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come man, gimme MOAR&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dga131y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492245887.0, "created_utc": 1492217087.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga7dt6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheInsaneWombat", "parent_id": "t1_dga3nwp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "still a shitload of radiation, especially near planets", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;still a shitload of radiation, especially near planets&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dga7dt6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492254784.0, "created_utc": 1492225984.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga3nwp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kancho_Ninja", "parent_id": "t1_dga3fct", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yup.

It was something I couldn't change. I tried.\n\nWhen I first found out they were captured I tried rescuing them. Being able to stop time made it easy to find them. I just searched the whole country till I found them, in Area 63. \n\nEveryone's heard of Area 51. That's just a front. Area 52 is another facility beneath LAX. In fact theres like a hundred different Areas. But Area 63 is quite possibly the most secretive of them all.\n\nIt's the home base of a Faction of government called FAME, the Force Against Meta Entities, which is what they started calling people with powers. I managed to infiltrate their entire facility with relative ease, again its pretty easy when the guards aren't even aware of you. But their leader was. She made a point of acquiring a sample of my DNA when she captured my parents. \n\nSo when I finally found them in some basement of a basement in Sayerville, NJ (Area 63 resides in an abandoned Lowes off a major highway, by the way), she was not only aware of me, but able to completely negate my temporal abilities with her machines. She shot both my parents right in front of me to prove a point. I should have seen it all coming then but being so devastated I just ran, kept running, cried my eyes out in Neptune's orbit, only collecting myself when the loss of concentration nearly cost me my life.\n\nThat was when I considered turning back the clock. I had never tried it previously, but it shouldn't be impossible, right? I'd just go back in time and stop Her from kidnapping my parents. (You're probably wondering who She is by now, we'll get to that.) How little did I know.\n\nFirst off, going back was easier than I thought it would be, but controlling it was a lot harder. I simply made my body dense enough to have more local gravity than the sun, and then bounced photons around my own orbit and rotated at several thousand light years per second. My mistake was doing this in orbit of another planet. I was thrown halfway across the universe. In the 6 minutes it took me to get back to the Sol system I found out I had destroyed Neptune in my time and sent myself to the pre-Cambian era. \n\nI tried my second attempt in intergalactic space and ended up altering the gravitational constant of the universe. The big bang played out in slow motion and I was nearly annihilated by gamma rays.\n\nAfter several tries I was able to correct all my mistakes and go back to the moment my parents were kidnapped. But after all that trial and error She had come prepared for the possibility of me altering the timeline. So She just killed my parents then instead. Then She attempted to capture me alive, and it took every ounce of my abilities to escape Her.\n\nThe only thing worse than seeing your parents die right in front of you is seeing your parents die right in front of you twice. I gave up for a while after that. I let time pass naturally. I left the solar system the slow way. Exploring didn't really interest me. To most of the tiny civilizations in the universe I would be considered a God, and I honestly had no desire to do that. So I just drifted, somewhere between space and time, and thought about a lot of things.\nIt was during this time that I found I don't actually need to eat, nor do I age like other people.\n\nEventually I worked up the resolve to come home, avenge my parents, and take Her and FAME down. It was the right thing to do. Like I told you before though, when I got back, things were very, very different.\n\nMy first idea was to go to NYC, blend in and gather some intel.\nThe non-superpowered population had taken over most of the planet, incarcerated the metas they could and killed those they could not. Rumors of a few stragglers permeated the masses, and I set out to find these people. I knew I couldn't fight FAME alone. But I also knew that if FAME hadn't already found these people then I wouldn't have much luck either. Scouring the entire country for my parents took weeks of paused time, and even though I don't need to eat it was still exhausting, so I wasn't about to scour the entire planet. So I decided to break into FAME again.\n\nWhen I got back to Sayerville the place was just as I'd left it: a suburban Jersey town with little notoriety except being the hometown of Bon Blow Me (was never a fan). The Lowes bunker was, however, completely vacated. I guess I should've expected in hindsight that they'd've moved their base after basically taking over the planet. Despite this, I did find a lead there: Valerie. I didn't give you her name before but she was my old girlfriend, who made storms. There was a dossier someone must've forgot to file, it was left behind. Turns out she's part of the Meta Resistance. I decided to track down her parents in Hawaii.\n\nI managed to track them down, a water and wind pair who lived a very peaceful, now secretive life. They told me the resistance made their home in Hong Kong. I spent a few days with them, and they asked me to give Valerie their love should I find her, as they hadn't seen her in months. I promised them I would.\n\nSo off I took across the Pacific.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PART 2: I decided to post it here in lieu of making another thread, I use the mobile app. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I got back to Earth about a year had passed since my parents deaths.

I can create pockets of air for myself and keep my body stabilized in the vacuum of space. I warp spacetime to explore the universe and can be home in time for dinner. But I couldn't remain hidden forever. \nRemember those government factions I told you about?\n\nAbout a year ago they convinced world leaders that my power was too great, that I was too dangerous to be free. I became public enemy no. 1. My parents were incarcerated and killed. I left Earth for a while.

I tried to get him down, and when I stretched out my hand, he started to wail until he couldn&amp;#39;t anymore, and his body crumbled in on itself. Then the tree did. Then a good chunk of my backyard. I was so freaked out I broke down crying, and my parents did their best to console me. But gravity manipulation was only the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first girlfriend controlled storms. I remember when I met her she was upset, her best friend had been in a car accident. It was raining terribly, and lightning struck everywhere. I instinctively touched her face, I don&amp;#39;t know why, but it instantly calmed her, and when it did the light of the sun shone brighter than any natural occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By now, my full range of powers consists of not only controlling gravity, but also light, tides, and through combined use, the passage of time. I can create pockets of air for myself and keep my body stabilized in the vacuum of space. I warp spacetime to explore the universe and can be home in time for dinner. But I couldn&amp;#39;t remain hidden forever. \nRemember those government factions I told you about?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a year ago they convinced world leaders that my power was too great, that I was too dangerous to be free. I became public enemy no. 1. My parents were incarcerated and killed. I left Earth for a while. I came back yesterday to avenge their deaths, and things have really changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PART 2 IN COMMENTS&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dga93tw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492257548.0, "created_utc": 1492228748.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 50}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgafzki", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "essete", "parent_id": "t1_dga6vub", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, I got a little carried away with the introduction.

You were born in space?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. My mom met my d \u2013\u201c\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a doctor, not your biographer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo need to apologize. It\u2019s just been a long day. I just spent the last 8 hours recreating all my records from nothing because little Jimmy decided now was the time to lose control of his powers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was born near a volcano,\u201d the doctor replied bluntly.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said stupidly.\n\nI knew enough about our powers to know what that meant.\n\n31 years ago, an individual called John Timens developed superpowers. He had gained the ability of flight. It was a pretty mild and non-destruction ability. It was fortunate: his case was widely studied and it was decided that Timens was not a threat to humankind. Not long after, more and more individuals were born with superpowers. \n\nWe started to notice a pattern: the powers were based on their place of birth. Born out at sea? You\u2019ll develop superpowers like underwater breathing or the ability to control water.\n\nBorn out at a volcano? Well, the only possibility was to develop lava or fire-based powers.\n\n\u201cDo you feel anything?\u201d the doctor asked.\n\n\u201cNot particularly. I mean, what powers would I develop? The power to create vacuums? The power *to suck*?\u201d\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. My job has shifted over the years from healthcare to predicting what superpowers teenagers like you would develop, but I really don\u2019t know. I guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what do we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cConcentrate. Try to feel it in you.\u201d\n\n \u201cWow, that\u2019s vague.\u201d\n\nHe laughed again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have powers, so I can\u2019t tell you what \u2013 wait, you know what? I haven\u2019t tried this before, but it might work\u2026\u201d\n\nHe turned towards the door behind him, slid it open and shouted into it. \n\n\u201cHey, ALICE! Come out here for a moment!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Alice?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s my nurse. She also has powers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAaand\u2026 her power is to discover powers?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer power is of molecular disintegration, *but* she can describe to you what your powers should feel like.\u201d\n\n\u201cMolecular\u2026 disintegration? How does that even work? She was born near a molecule?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can ask her yourself.\u201d\n\nHe stood up and beckoned a 30s-looking lady over. She was slightly shorter than I was, and looked a little bored. Her bob-hair looked like they defied gravity. I choked back a laughter.\n\nI shook her hands and introduced myself, before diving straight into my question.\n\n\u201cMolecular disintegration?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere.\u201d\n\nShe placed one of the doctor\u2019s pens on the table, joined the index finger and thumb of both her hands together to form a triangle, then closed her eyes. Right before my eyes, the pen disintegrated. It looked as though it just turned into dust.\n\n\u201cWha? Wow! Where were you born?\u201d\n\n\u201cNear a molecule.\u201d\n\nI gave her a puzzled look.\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI heard you say it. I was born in a molecular lab.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d I said slowly. It still didn\u2019t make much sense, but I just rolled with it. Molecules are everywhere. Just because a lab is designated for experimenting with things on a molecular level, it\u2019s a \u201cmolecular lab?\u201d\n\n\u201cTry this. Close your eyes and picture a purple background. Now, visualize a red and a blue dot spiraling in the center of your vision. The dots should be a decently big size. The dots are slowly developing their own streaks of light. Now, they\u2019re spiraling quicker and quicker and they\u2019re turning into an orange mass of colour.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026 and? I don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever colours you just visualized should be what you see when you\u2019re concentrating on using your powers. As you can imagine, everyone\u2019s imagined colour will be different.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d I said. This is not making any sense whatsoever. But none of this powers thing should anyway.\n\n\u201cNow, visualize the colour and concentrate on an object. Any hand gestures that you think may help are fine. Here, try this pen. Let\u2019s put it on the floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, Alice! You\u2019re paying for those pens!\u201d the doctor shouted from behind me.\n\nI did as she said. I visualized the purple background, the two dots, and the blob of orange. I held out one hand and pointed it in the general direction of the pen. Suddenly, the colours disappeared.\n\nI opened my eyes. \u201cWha?\u201d I blurted out, confused at what just happened. The pen was gone. \n\n\u201cHey, where\u2019s the pen?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, Anthony,\u201d the doctor started. \u201cI think you somehow developed the power over the space continuum. Alice and I were observing. The pen simply ceased to exist.\u201d\n\nI gave a confused look. That sounded incredibly dangerous and nonsensical. \n\n\u201cBecause I was born in space?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know\u2026 I believe it\u2019s not actually where you were born that matters,\u201d the doctor explained, \u201cBut what you understand it to be. You can believe that were born in the middle of the sea right now, and you will develop powers related to the sea. Of course, if you believe that space is an ocean, your powers that we term \u201csea-related\u201d won\u2019t actually be relating to water, because your understanding of the sea is already fundamentally different.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is, it doesn\u2019t matter where we were born, but what we associate our birthplace with?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember my molecular disintegration?\u201d Alice piped up. \u201cNow that the doctor mentioned it, I think it fits the pattern for my powers. Because the labs were already associated with the idea of molecules, and I knew about that, I developed powers related to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, now that we\u2019ve gotten that out of the way, we have reasons to believe your powers are incredibly dangerous, so we\u2019ll be letting you run a few more, um, special tests.\u201d\n\nThe way he emphasized \u201cspecial\u201d wasn\u2019t lost on me. I started visualizing the colours again, and pointed it at the doctor.\n\n\u201cWait! What are yo \u2013\u201c and the colours disappeared.\n\n\u201cAnthony,\u201d Alice said. \u201cThat was uncalled for.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem shocked. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did that to my own doctor.\u201d\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo, Anthony.

That sounded incredibly dangerous and nonsensical. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBecause I was born in space?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou know\u2026 I believe it\u2019s not actually where you were born that matters,\u201d the doctor explained, \u201cBut what you understand it to be. You can believe that were born in the middle of the sea right now, and you will develop powers related to the sea. Of course, if you believe that space is an ocean, your powers that we term \u201csea-related\u201d won\u2019t actually be relating to water, because your understanding of the sea is already fundamentally different.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is, it doesn\u2019t matter where we were born, but what we associate our birthplace with?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYes.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRemember my molecular disintegration?\u201d Alice piped up. \u201cNow that the doctor mentioned it, I think it fits the pattern for my powers. Because the labs were already associated with the idea of molecules, and I knew about that, I developed powers related to it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAlright, now that we\u2019ve gotten that out of the way, we have reasons to believe your powers are incredibly dangerous, so we\u2019ll be letting you run a few more, um, special tests.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way he emphasized \u201cspecial\u201d wasn\u2019t lost on me. I started visualizing the colours again, and pointed it at the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWait! What are yo \u2013\u201c and the colours disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnthony,\u201d Alice said. \u201cThat was uncalled for.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou don\u2019t seem shocked. Why?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI did that to my own doctor.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgalb9h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492288059.0, "created_utc": 1492259259.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaew0i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IReallyHateLifern", "parent_id": "t3_65f88x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My life was an accident.

They couldn't have me, they were supposed to be doing groundbreaking scientific work! So they only told the other crew members and they all agreed to keep it quiet. \nThe trip back to Earth was a long one. My mother birthed me and I spent my infant hood and one toddler year on that space station.

Everyone agreed and did just that as they were walking. They managed to get out of there safe and my mother immediately took me back to her home in Ireland.

That day something strange happened.\n\nI was on the bus going home from school. As I sat by the window watching the scenery pass by, I noticed a few plains-born gliding through the wind, enjoying their powers. That didn't help my mood. I think I fell asleep after that, because the next thing I remembered was waking up to the bus driver shaking my shoulder. We were at my stop, and the bus was empty. The bus driver must have skipped my stop and dropped me off last, probably almost forgot about me. I got off the bus and, well, you know that feeling you get when you eat a lot of beans at lunch? Yeah, it was fajita day at school, and the people who sat by me never ate their beans, so I got all of their beans. First mistake. I kind of scurry into the house, and I'm instantly blasted with an \"Oh my God honey, where were you? Where have you been?\", ugh, the overbearing atmosphere alone could have squashed me like a bug. I ran past her, dodging an incoming hug, \"The bus had a flat!\" I lied, as I v-lined for the bathroom. As I opened the door I heard a \"Wait, honey!-\" before slamming the door. I flicked on the light switch, nothing, still dark. \"The lightbulb's out\" I heard my Mother say through the door as I fumbled to drop my pants and find the toilet. After a few 'miscalculations', I landed safely, and without hesitation let out a huge rip. I blinked. Then I blinked again. The lights were back on? No.. the shadows are all wrong. It seems like the light was.. \"It's coming through the toilet?\" I thought to myself. \"No, that's absurd\" I tried to tell myself, but I looked down and.. well. Yeah. There was light coming from within the toilet bowl. I jumped up immediately, and turned around, shadows. There was no light in the toilet, it was behind me. I turned again, nothing, still behind me. I looked behind me once more, but this time only turning my neck. Yes, it was still there, it was on my back? No, it was down a bit more. It, it seemed like it was coming from my butt? Yes, wait.. \"Why is there light shining from my ass?!\" I screamed in my head. That's when I heard my Mother through the door, \"Do you have a flashlight in there, sweety?\". I was in shock, confused, and the only thing running through my mind at that moment was \"How do I turn this off?\" I tried everything, and I mean everything: I'm not proud to admit it, but it's the truth. After a few minutes it wore off (I think), and I was able to walk out of the bathroom to a confused Mother. I guess you could say that up until that point my life was horrible, but now? Now that I found my power, it's safe to call it miserable.\n\n Once word got out, well, you can imagine the names. \"Lightning-bug\", \"Butt-light\", \"Shiny-Cheeks\", but the one that stuck with me throughout my middle school and high school years was \"Full Moon\". Yeah, eventually I could control which part of my body I could light up, but for the longest time it was always my butt that lit up, and at the strangest times, too. Like everyone else my powers grew as I did. I started to learn how to make other things light up, and I also learned how to take away light from other spots, kind of creating darkness. I wish that's how my power bloomed, me accidentally making a ball of darkness. Then my nickname would be something cool, like Shadow or Shade, or maybe even Darkstar. That would have been cool, \"Darkstar\". But here I am now, \"Full Moon\", your local electrician coming to save the day! In other words, I change lightbulbs now; a job for a Space-born.

Where have you been?&amp;quot;, ugh, the overbearing atmosphere alone could have squashed me like a bug. I ran past her, dodging an incoming hug, &amp;quot;The bus had a flat!&amp;quot; I lied, as I v-lined for the bathroom. As I opened the door I heard a &amp;quot;Wait, honey!-&amp;quot; before slamming the door. I flicked on the light switch, nothing, still dark. &amp;quot;The lightbulb&amp;#39;s out&amp;quot; I heard my Mother say through the door as I fumbled to drop my pants and find the toilet. After a few &amp;#39;miscalculations&amp;#39;, I landed safely, and without hesitation let out a huge rip. I blinked. Then I blinked again. The lights were back on? No.. the shadows are all wrong. It seems like the light was.. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s coming through the toilet?&amp;quot; I thought to myself. &amp;quot;No, that&amp;#39;s absurd&amp;quot; I tried to tell myself, but I looked down and.. well. Yeah. There was light coming from within the toilet bowl. I jumped up immediately, and turned around, shadows. There was no light in the toilet, it was behind me. I turned again, nothing, still behind me. I looked behind me once more, but this time only turning my neck. Yes, it was still there, it was on my back? No, it was down a bit more. It, it seemed like it was coming from my butt? Yes, wait.. &amp;quot;Why is there light shining from my ass?!&amp;quot; I screamed in my head. That&amp;#39;s when I heard my Mother through the door, &amp;quot;Do you have a flashlight in there, sweety?&amp;quot;. I was in shock, confused, and the only thing running through my mind at that moment was &amp;quot;How do I turn this off?&amp;quot; I tried everything, and I mean everything: I&amp;#39;m not proud to admit it, but it&amp;#39;s the truth. After a few minutes it wore off (I think), and I was able to walk out of the bathroom to a confused Mother. I guess you could say that up until that point my life was horrible, but now? Now that I found my power, it&amp;#39;s safe to call it miserable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once word got out, well, you can imagine the names. &amp;quot;Lightning-bug&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Butt-light&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Shiny-Cheeks&amp;quot;, but the one that stuck with me throughout my middle school and high school years was &amp;quot;Full Moon&amp;quot;. Yeah, eventually I could control which part of my body I could light up, but for the longest time it was always my butt that lit up, and at the strangest times, too. Like everyone else my powers grew as I did. I started to learn how to make other things light up, and I also learned how to take away light from other spots, kind of creating darkness. I wish that&amp;#39;s how my power bloomed, me accidentally making a ball of darkness. Then my nickname would be something cool, like Shadow or Shade, or maybe even Darkstar. That would have been cool, &amp;quot;Darkstar&amp;quot;. But here I am now, &amp;quot;Full Moon&amp;quot;, your local electrician coming to save the day! In other words, I change lightbulbs now; a job for a Space-born. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgadt91", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492266617.0, "created_utc": 1492237817.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga8305", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "condomann4", "parent_id": "t3_65f88x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I find myself here a lot more than I'd care to admit.

Please do be serious if something bad happens, though.\"\n\nA pod was jettisoned out from the station, as it floated towards Grant. He grabbed it and used the cable linking him to the station to stop its momentum. The timer on the pod's case expired, and it opened up to reveal a new suit. It looked identical to the old one.\n\n\"Ah... black again. My favourite.\"\n\n\"It's a neutral colour, Grant.\"\n\n\"Yeah, say that to the supremacists.\"\n\nHe took the suit, allowing the remains of the pod to harmlessly float off. As he did so, Doc was making calls to the other nearby stations and satellites, informing them of the incoming procedure. Everyone knew, since it was a well-known date, but this was standard protocol.\n\n\"... Hey, Doc? You sure I can't, like... get a feel for what it's really like, even for just a few seconds?\"\n\n\"We can't risk that, Grant. Remember when you were born... your parents-\"\n\n\"Yeah yeah yeah... jeez, you gotta bring that up all the time, huh.\"\n\nOne could say the reason his parents weren't there to see their child all grown up was because of the fact that he could exist and live his life at this very moment. Indeed, if his parents were there today, then he would not be.\n\nThe following procedure was always a risky one... who knew what could happen once the suit came off. It had worked many times before though, that was the sole reason it could go on without any incidents at control. If even the slightest error were to come up, then they'd be all over it. Thus, it was prudent for Doc to ensure that everything was in place. He didn't want a recreation of that event from 24 years ago... no, wait. 25 now, since it was Grant's birthday.\n\n\"I'm taking it off, Doc.\"\n\nThere was an anxious silence, as the Doc gripped onto a safety bar within his base. He chose to allow Grant his privacy as he closed his view port. In the next few seconds, a sharp tug was felt on the entire base. Doc's body was shaken along with it, since he was holding onto something as safety measure. A few small objects clanked from the sudden movement and started floating around.\n\n\"It's done, Doc. I feel like a million bucks.\"\n\nAnd that was that. Another standard procedure completed. After one last chat about their lives, it was time for Grant to return to the surface. He thanked Doc for his hard work before he set off via shuttle. The orbit-ridden Doc watched the shuttle float away out of his view port as he received an incoming transmission... a private uplink from an unknown source.\n\n\"... Is that you, Director?\"\n\n\"Indeed. How goes it, Dr. Gainsborough? Was the assignment successful without incident?\"\n\n\"Relatively.\"\n\n\"... Relatively?\"\n\n\"Yes. It seems like he's growing a bit restless inside of that suit... I can only imagine what it's like. There must be something we can do...\"\n\n\"Ambitious thoughts like that are what drive us forward... but they are also dangerous if mishandled. Do keep that in mind, Dr. Gainsborough. We are handling a dangerous product, after all.\"\n\n\"I know, sir. I shall keep committing myself to such research... but please, do not call him a 'product'.\"\n\n\"He is a product of our endeavours, you cannot deny that. He is also an international... no, dare I say, galactic hazard if not properly secured. If that suit has even the slightest rupture in an insecure environment... well, we need not worry ourselves over that, so as long as it remains contained.\"\n\n\"And protected, sir.\"\n\n\"Precisely. We live in a strange world filled with strange powers... yet we are saddled with the responsibility of the strangest. We shall continue expecting great things, Dr. Gainsborough. Central out.\"\n\nThe line went silent. Doc groaned and stretched his arms over his head as he idly floated around in the examination room, all alone. He pushed off a wall gently and reached for something in his personal cabinet... he pulled out a photo. It was a younger version of him, next to a young couple. They were all in space suits, ready to take off into space with the shuttle in the background...\n\n\"The nerve of that man... calling my nephew a 'product'...\"\n\nHe stowed the photo away safely before he collected his documents and resumed his work.

Everyone knew, since it was a well-known date, but this was standard protocol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;... Hey, Doc? You sure I can&amp;#39;t, like... get a feel for what it&amp;#39;s really like, even for just a few seconds?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We can&amp;#39;t risk that, Grant. Remember when you were born... your parents-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah yeah yeah... jeez, you gotta bring that up all the time, huh.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One could say the reason his parents weren&amp;#39;t there to see their child all grown up was because of the fact that he could exist and live his life at this very moment. Indeed, if his parents were there today, then he would not be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following procedure was always a risky one... who knew what could happen once the suit came off. It had worked many times before though, that was the sole reason it could go on without any incidents at control. If even the slightest error were to come up, then they&amp;#39;d be all over it. Thus, it was prudent for Doc to ensure that everything was in place. He didn&amp;#39;t want a recreation of that event from 24 years ago... no, wait. 25 now, since it was Grant&amp;#39;s birthday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m taking it off, Doc.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was an anxious silence, as the Doc gripped onto a safety bar within his base. He chose to allow Grant his privacy as he closed his view port. In the next few seconds, a sharp tug was felt on the entire base. Doc&amp;#39;s body was shaken along with it, since he was holding onto something as safety measure. A few small objects clanked from the sudden movement and started floating around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s done, Doc. I feel like a million bucks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that was that. Another standard procedure completed. After one last chat about their lives, it was time for Grant to return to the surface. He thanked Doc for his hard work before he set off via shuttle. The orbit-ridden Doc watched the shuttle float away out of his view port as he received an incoming transmission... a private uplink from an unknown source.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;... Is that you, Director?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Indeed. How goes it, Dr. Gainsborough? Was the assignment successful without incident?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Relatively.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;... Relatively?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes. It seems like he&amp;#39;s growing a bit restless inside of that suit... I can only imagine what it&amp;#39;s like. There must be something we can do...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ambitious thoughts like that are what drive us forward... but they are also dangerous if mishandled. Do keep that in mind, Dr. Gainsborough. We are handling a dangerous product, after all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know, sir. I shall keep committing myself to such research... but please, do not call him a &amp;#39;product&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He is a product of our endeavours, you cannot deny that. He is also an international... no, dare I say, galactic hazard if not properly secured. If that suit has even the slightest rupture in an insecure environment... well, we need not worry ourselves over that, so as long as it remains contained.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And protected, sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Precisely. We live in a strange world filled with strange powers... yet we are saddled with the responsibility of the strangest. We shall continue expecting great things, Dr. Gainsborough. Central out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The line went silent. Doc groaned and stretched his arms over his head as he idly floated around in the examination room, all alone. He pushed off a wall gently and reached for something in his personal cabinet... he pulled out a photo. It was a younger version of him, next to a young couple. They were all in space suits, ready to take off into space with the shuttle in the background...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The nerve of that man... calling my nephew a &amp;#39;product&amp;#39;...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He stowed the photo away safely before he collected his documents and resumed his work. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgaitjl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492281161.0, "created_utc": 1492252361.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaf4c2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "spartan_317", "parent_id": "t3_65f88x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The stories here are amazing and I would love to see more.

Single handedly I threw the solar system into disarray, nobody can see the beauty of two stars colliding and nobody, but me, ever will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First time doing this, please let me know how to improve!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgb2ug3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492314394.0, "created_utc": 1492285594.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f88x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbmw0o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AcePhoenixGamer", "parent_id": "t3_65f88x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Everyone has a kinesis, a power determined by their place of birth.
