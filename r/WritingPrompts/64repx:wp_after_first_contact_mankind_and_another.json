I honestly wasn't expecting to get much of a response with this, but I'm glad that some of you guys liked it! I still couldn't conclude it in Part II (it just didn't feel like the kind of thing I could just cut off), but I would be interested in working on this some more in the future!\n\n--\n   \n\nPart II\n\nMy heart dropped in my chest, accompanied by a surge of nervous adrenaline that tore through my body. \u201cArtemis, what the hell is going on?!\u201d I finally managed to say, pulse pounding in my ears. She didn\u2019t answer me for a few seconds, though her crying quieted down to sobs, barely audible from behind the hands that covered her face. \n\n\u201cArtemis-\u201c I began, but stopped short as her holographic manifestation winked out. She reappeared moments later, looking grim and resigned, but with no evidence of her previous tears. A year and a half later and I still sometimes forgot that she was an artificial construct and not another person. She had the emotional range of a human being, sure, but she could easily compartmentalize things like sadness or anger for the sake of efficiency. I tried to follow suit, taking a deep breath, and motioning for her to speak.\n\n\u201cEarth is gone, Connor.\u201d \n\nI found myself shaking my head. \u201cGone?\u201d\n\n\u201cGone. Destroyed.\u201d I felt the bile rise in the back of my throat. Artemis stood still in her display, giving me time to catch my breath.\n\n\u201cHow? How the hell? I mean, what could even have\u2026\u201d The rest of the sentence died in my throat.\n\nArtemis held up a hand to stop me further rambling. \u201cI received the emergency broadcast shortly after we arrived on the station. It\u2019s bad, Connor.\u201d \n\nWithout a sound, her tiny form winked out of existence once again, this time replaced by a vidscreen. The projection flickered for a second, before displaying a play button. Tentatively, I pressed it.\n\nFor a second there was only silence and the changing of the timestamp at the bottom of the screen, and then the piercing sound of a Space Command emergency alert tone rang out into the abandoned terminal around me. \n\n\u201cThis is a Level 1 Emergency Alert.\u201d The vidscreen itself remained black, with the words of the alert appearing in red as they were spoken.\n\n\u201cSpace Command FTL Foundries 1-10,12, and 13 have been compromised. The FTL Drives of the Earth-Orbit defense fleet have also been compromised. Catastrophic slipspace ruptures have been detected. Evacuate via spaceport or space elevator if possible.\u201d\n\nThe message began to repeat then, and Artemis cut it off. Numbness was spreading rapidly from my chest to my arms and legs. An image of my family flashed into my mind, and I couldn\u2019t contain it any longer. Running to a nearby waste bin, I doubled over and emptied the contents of my stomach. I slumped to the ground afterwards feeling completely, wholly empty.\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one, Connor.\u201d Artemis\u2019 voice broke the oppressive silence suddenly. \u201cThere are other survivors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe colonies,\u201d I managed, feeling my heart kicking in my chest once again. \u201cThe stations! Wait, what about *this* station? Where are the people?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure. My ability to interface with the station's systems is severely limited while I am confined to this console. If you can find a security terminal, or better yet, an administrator\u2019s office, I should be able to find out more.\u201d\n\nWordlessly, I flipped the portable console shut and threw it over my shoulder. The illuminated signs overhead pointed out the direction to the nearest security station, and I wasted no time in heading straight for it. \n\n\u201cJust detach my central module and plug it into the terminal, and then I can\u2014\u201c Artemis\u2019 voice was cut off abruptly as I pulled the disc-shaped core out of the portable console and slipped it into the security station\u2019s computer.\n\nThe console in front of me sprung to life suddenly, with images and screens flashing in front of my eyes at astonishing speeds. Artemis was part of an extremely advanced A.I. series with a mind-boggling capacity for computation and information processing, allowing her to roar through the terminal\u2019s contents faster than I could ever hope to think.\n\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d Her voice crackled slightly over the terminal\u2019s speakers. \u201cIt was Badgon-4.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did this.\u201d\n\nI clenched my fists in frustration. \u201cThe fucking exchange citizen? The one that was living with my fucking family?\u201d I could not believe it.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? How could he do that? Wasn\u2019t he a shaper, or an architect, or whatever they call them? This couldn\u2019t have been him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was, Connor. Space Command Intelligence was analyzing the data right up until the last second. He employed some sort of Cyberwarfare Construct to infect the Foundries. It was him.\u201d\n\nMy disbelief quickly became rage. Without thinking I grabbed the nearest thing, a snow globe sitting on the security desk, and whipped it at the wall with all of my might. The spray of water and glass did nothing to soothe me.\n\n\u201cPull me out, now. We need to head for the central body of the Superstation. That\u2019s where the others are.\u201d\n\n\u201cOthers?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rest of the people on this station. They are shutting down the arms that they don\u2019t need to conserve resources. So we need to hurry, before they turn off the oxygen supply and the power to the doors.\u201d\n\nI nodded, returning her core to the portable console before taking off at a sprint in the direction of the station\u2019s body.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s Part II for anyone interested!

I still couldn&amp;#39;t conclude it in Part II (it just didn&amp;#39;t feel like the kind of thing I could just cut off), but I would be interested in working on this some more in the future!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part II&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart dropped in my chest, accompanied by a surge of nervous adrenaline that tore through my body. \u201cArtemis, what the hell is going on?!\u201d I finally managed to say, pulse pounding in my ears. She didn\u2019t answer me for a few seconds, though her crying quieted down to sobs, barely audible from behind the hands that covered her face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cArtemis-\u201c I began, but stopped short as her holographic manifestation winked out. She reappeared moments later, looking grim and resigned, but with no evidence of her previous tears. A year and a half later and I still sometimes forgot that she was an artificial construct and not another person. She had the emotional range of a human being, sure, but she could easily compartmentalize things like sadness or anger for the sake of efficiency. I tried to follow suit, taking a deep breath, and motioning for her to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cEarth is gone, Connor.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found myself shaking my head. \u201cGone?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGone. Destroyed.\u201d I felt the bile rise in the back of my throat. Artemis stood still in her display, giving me time to catch my breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow? How the hell? I mean, what could even have\u2026\u201d The rest of the sentence died in my throat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Artemis held up a hand to stop me further rambling. \u201cI received the emergency broadcast shortly after we arrived on the station. It\u2019s bad, Connor.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without a sound, her tiny form winked out of existence once again, this time replaced by a vidscreen. The projection flickered for a second, before displaying a play button. Tentatively, I pressed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a second there was only silence and the changing of the timestamp at the bottom of the screen, and then the piercing sound of a Space Command emergency alert tone rang out into the abandoned terminal around me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is a Level 1 Emergency Alert.\u201d The vidscreen itself remained black, with the words of the alert appearing in red as they were spoken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSpace Command FTL Foundries 1-10,12, and 13 have been compromised. The FTL Drives of the Earth-Orbit defense fleet have also been compromised. Catastrophic slipspace ruptures have been detected. Evacuate via spaceport or space elevator if possible.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The message began to repeat then, and Artemis cut it off. Numbness was spreading rapidly from my chest to my arms and legs. An image of my family flashed into my mind, and I couldn\u2019t contain it any longer. Running to a nearby waste bin, I doubled over and emptied the contents of my stomach. I slumped to the ground afterwards feeling completely, wholly empty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one, Connor.\u201d Artemis\u2019 voice broke the oppressive silence suddenly. \u201cThere are other survivors.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe colonies,\u201d I managed, feeling my heart kicking in my chest once again. \u201cThe stations! Wait, what about &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; station? Where are the people?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m not sure. My ability to interface with the station&amp;#39;s systems is severely limited while I am confined to this console. If you can find a security terminal, or better yet, an administrator\u2019s office, I should be able to find out more.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wordlessly, I flipped the portable console shut and threw it over my shoulder. The illuminated signs overhead pointed out the direction to the nearest security station, and I wasted no time in heading straight for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust detach my central module and plug it into the terminal, and then I can\u2014\u201c Artemis\u2019 voice was cut off abruptly as I pulled the disc-shaped core out of the portable console and slipped it into the security station\u2019s computer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The console in front of me sprung to life suddenly, with images and screens flashing in front of my eyes at astonishing speeds. Artemis was part of an extremely advanced A.I. series with a mind-boggling capacity for computation and information processing, allowing her to roar through the terminal\u2019s contents faster than I could ever hope to think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh my god.\u201d Her voice crackled slightly over the terminal\u2019s speakers. \u201cIt was Badgon-4.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe did this.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I clenched my fists in frustration. \u201cThe fucking exchange citizen? The one that was living with my fucking family?\u201d I could not believe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYes.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat? How could he do that? Wasn\u2019t he a shaper, or an architect, or whatever they call them? This couldn\u2019t have been him.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was, Connor. Space Command Intelligence was analyzing the data right up until the last second. He employed some sort of Cyberwarfare Construct to infect the Foundries. It was him.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My disbelief quickly became rage. Without thinking I grabbed the nearest thing, a snow globe sitting on the security desk, and whipped it at the wall with all of my might. The spray of water and glass did nothing to soothe me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPull me out, now. We need to head for the central body of the Superstation. That\u2019s where the others are.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOthers?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe rest of the people on this station. They are shutting down the arms that they don\u2019t need to conserve resources. So we need to hurry, before they turn off the oxygen supply and the power to the doors.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded, returning her core to the portable console before taking off at a sprint in the direction of the station\u2019s body.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5au2o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491991081.0, "created_utc": 1491962281.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 148}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64repx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64repx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64repx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4y6am", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Conformityeverywhere", "parent_id": "t1_dg4mxuw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Very impressive.

As I sat up in the cramped bunk, all I could remember of the dream I\u2019d been having was glimpses of family and friends, and of course, Earth. \u201cArrival in five minutes. This shuttle will disengage it\u2019s FTL Drive in four minutes.\u201d A pang of nervous excitement shot through my stomach.\n\nI\u2019d been gone for a Standard Year, about one and a half times longer than an Earth year, and about half as long as a full year on the planet which I had lived. It\u2019s hard to describe the longing for home that had built up over my time among the Immolorans, save that it was powerful and painful. The \u201caliens\u201d themselves had mostly attempted to make my stay as comfortable as possible, but I ended up feeling like more of a travelling museum exhibit than anything else. \n\nFor months, I had been paraded about at all of the most important events in what equated to high society among the Immolorans. At first, it was exhilarating, seeing things that no human had ever seen. I had been fitted with a special eye lens that recorded everything I saw and stored the data on a secure computer terminal, which itself was equipped with an advanced Artificial Intelligence construct that handled sorting and curating the information. \n\nRather early on in my extrasolar trip, that A.I., which called itself Artemis, had become my closest confidante and friend, as I was making none amongst the Immolorans. After only a few months, Artemis and I had jointly concluded that Immoloran society was nowhere near as diverse as that of Earth. Where the Earth\u2019s people were many, belonging to various religions, cultures, ideologies, and geographic locations, the citizens of Immolore were of a singular cultural background, having long ago subsumed diversity. As they went to great lengths to assure me, this had created what they viewed to be the perfect society.\n \nI disagreed. To me, it was clear that their culture was stagnant. Everything was so uniform, devoid of any unique characteristics, and frankly, their art was *fucking terrible*. \n\n\u201cDisengaging FTL systems. Beginning docking procedure with Earth Waystation 5-E.\u201d\n\nBy this point, I was pacing back and forth in the tight interior of the shuttle. When I had first boarded for my return trip, its windowless interior and human design had felt like home, but now I was thirsty for the real thing. \n\u201cError. Docking procedure failed. Re-attempting.\u201d\n\nI shook my head, sitting back down on my bunk. Space Command was clearly not overly-enthused at the idea of having me back.\n\n\u201cError. Docking procedure failed. Initializing secondary protocol. Docking with Lunar Superstation.\u201d As the shuttle\u2019s drives kicked in once more, I began to feel a little bit uneasy. I\u2019d been worried all along that my trip home would be delayed by a never-ending period of debriefings and discussions with government scientists, and now that seemed a reality rather than a likelihood.\n\n\u201cDocking procedure successful.

As I sat up in the cramped bunk, all I could remember of the dream I\u2019d been having was glimpses of family and friends, and of course, Earth. \u201cArrival in five minutes. This shuttle will disengage it\u2019s FTL Drive in four minutes.\u201d A pang of nervous excitement shot through my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d been gone for a Standard Year, about one and a half times longer than an Earth year, and about half as long as a full year on the planet which I had lived. It\u2019s hard to describe the longing for home that had built up over my time among the Immolorans, save that it was powerful and painful. The \u201caliens\u201d themselves had mostly attempted to make my stay as comfortable as possible, but I ended up feeling like more of a travelling museum exhibit than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For months, I had been paraded about at all of the most important events in what equated to high society among the Immolorans. At first, it was exhilarating, seeing things that no human had ever seen. I had been fitted with a special eye lens that recorded everything I saw and stored the data on a secure computer terminal, which itself was equipped with an advanced Artificial Intelligence construct that handled sorting and curating the information. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather early on in my extrasolar trip, that A.I., which called itself Artemis, had become my closest confidante and friend, as I was making none amongst the Immolorans. After only a few months, Artemis and I had jointly concluded that Immoloran society was nowhere near as diverse as that of Earth. Where the Earth\u2019s people were many, belonging to various religions, cultures, ideologies, and geographic locations, the citizens of Immolore were of a singular cultural background, having long ago subsumed diversity. As they went to great lengths to assure me, this had created what they viewed to be the perfect society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I disagreed. To me, it was clear that their culture was stagnant. Everything was so uniform, devoid of any unique characteristics, and frankly, their art was &lt;em&gt;fucking terrible&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDisengaging FTL systems. Beginning docking procedure with Earth Waystation 5-E.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By this point, I was pacing back and forth in the tight interior of the shuttle. When I had first boarded for my return trip, its windowless interior and human design had felt like home, but now I was thirsty for the real thing. \n\u201cError. Docking procedure failed. Re-attempting.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shook my head, sitting back down on my bunk. Space Command was clearly not overly-enthused at the idea of having me back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cError. Docking procedure failed. Initializing secondary protocol. Docking with Lunar Superstation.\u201d As the shuttle\u2019s drives kicked in once more, I began to feel a little bit uneasy. I\u2019d been worried all along that my trip home would be delayed by a never-ending period of debriefings and discussions with government scientists, and now that seemed a reality rather than a likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDocking procedure successful. Equalizing interior and exterior pressure. You may now exit the shuttle.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart was pounding away in my chest, and I steeled myself for the inevitable crowd of journalists and camera-drones.

Only the Earth was missing.\n\nI was on a student exchange program with Oakrion, a planet around our friendly neighboring Galaxy a few light-year blocks away. I had a good time there, I like the people, the food and their culture. I made lots of friends there to a point I almost didn't miss home. Only until I saw the Earth was missing, I realized how untrue that was.\n\n\"Don't panic,\" said the Oakrion spaceship captain.\n\n\"But this is the perfect time to panic!\" I scurried around like chicken little under a falling sky, \"Earth is missing. It's time to press the panic button. Where is the panic button? We must call the galaxy police! We must call the Search and Rescue!\"\n\n\"Lunch time, don't panic,\" the Oakrion captain repeated nonchalantly.\n\n\"Earth is missing!\" I told the captain. \"We don't have time for lunch.\"\n\n\"Earth is missing!\" I repeated to every crew member on the spaceship.

You must have lunch, if you want to see Earth soon.\"\n\nI sat on the chair opposite to him, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Have you heard of the Galactic Lunch Time Theorem by Dr. Bibble Jucie from PL31415?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"The theorem stated that every matter in the galaxy must obey the lunch time phenomenon. No matter what planet, what creatures, living or none-living must assign a specif space and time for lunch. Lunch is sacred and is a basic human right for all the living things in the galaxy. All works, entertainment, travel or physical reality must stop during lunch time.\" \n\n\"I still don't understand.\"\n\nHe pointed at the big screen. The screen zoom in to a sign on the moon.

My life, my memory, everyone I ever known and all the computer games I ever bought on Steam was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mars was there, so was Venus, even the moon was still there orbiting around an empty space like an abandoned dog barking at a car long gone. Only the Earth was missing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was on a student exchange program with Oakrion, a planet around our friendly neighboring Galaxy a few light-year blocks away. I had a good time there, I like the people, the food and their culture. I made lots of friends there to a point I almost didn&amp;#39;t miss home. Only until I saw the Earth was missing, I realized how untrue that was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t panic,&amp;quot; said the Oakrion spaceship captain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But this is the perfect time to panic!&amp;quot; I scurried around like chicken little under a falling sky, &amp;quot;Earth is missing. It&amp;#39;s time to press the panic button. Where is the panic button? We must call the galaxy police! We must call the Search and Rescue!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lunch time, don&amp;#39;t panic,&amp;quot; the Oakrion captain repeated nonchalantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Earth is missing!&amp;quot; I told the captain. &amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t have time for lunch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Earth is missing!&amp;quot; I repeated to every crew member on the spaceship. Nobody seemed to be in any panic mode, I was the only one jumping around like a headless chicken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a perfectly normal phenomenon,&amp;quot; the captain explained patiently. Meanwhile he took out an Oakrion Mystery Meatloaf from his lunch bag and asked me to joined him for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I see it&amp;#39;s your first time traveling in space,&amp;quot; he said, cutting off a big piece of meatloaf to his plate. &amp;quot;Come, sit down. You must have lunch, if you want to see Earth soon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat on the chair opposite to him, &amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Have you heard of the Galactic Lunch Time Theorem by Dr. Bibble Jucie from PL31415?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shook my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The theorem stated that every matter in the galaxy must obey the lunch time phenomenon. No matter what planet, what creatures, living or none-living must assign a specif space and time for lunch. Lunch is sacred and is a basic human right for all the living things in the galaxy. All works, entertainment, travel or physical reality must stop during lunch time.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I still don&amp;#39;t understand.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He pointed at the big screen. The screen zoom in to a sign on the moon. The sign said, &amp;quot;Earth is out for lunch, return soon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But earth is not a living thing,&amp;quot; I protested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everything is alive. How do you think the Earth get to run around the sun without eating lunch? It must go to lunch everyday.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I never heard of it when I lived on Earth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lunch time is a special time-space reality.

Now, they huddled together in small groups on the bridge of the starship, bracing themselves against the emotional tidal waves gushing out from the Earthling in the centre. Every sob, every whimper was a raking gash across their fragile psyches, unused as they were to the concept of sorrow.\n\nIt had been three hours since they discovered that the Earth had been destroyed, and still the Earthling grieved. \n\nFinally, Captain Lenaforte approached the Earthling, and placed a webbed hand over his shoulder, in what he understood to be an Earthling gesture of sympathy. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure if it will make you feel better, Jerry, but would you like to contact your family again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what do you mean? Can\u2019t you see for yourself? Earth is gone!\u201d\n\nCaptain Lenaforte plunged ahead, hardly keen to rekindle the debate of whether Earth had truly been destroyed. So much time had been spent checking and re-checking the coordinates, making sure they were at the right place, and it had taken a herculean effort to get Jerry this far. \n\n\u201cYes, it is, but as I told you, our technology allows us to convert energy into a form that can be transmitted faster than light. That\u2019s what we used to travel here, and that can also allow you to exchange electronic signals across timezones.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 you mean, like make a call to the past? Before the Earth was destroyed?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you put it that way\u2026 I suppose so.\u201d\n\nJerry took the device with trembling hands, then clutched it close to his chest. \u201cHow long? How long will I get to speak with them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe spoke to Lunadrowe, and it appears that we were talking to her about four months before the Earth was destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour months!\u201d yelled Jerry, the anger returning to his voice. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much to talk to them about! My parents, my brother, my friends\u2026 Sara, most of all, Sara! I have a lifetime I want to share with them, four months isn\u2019t going to cut it!\u201d\n\nCaptain Lenaforte sat next to Jerry in silence, soaking in all the ambient grief as stoically as he could. When he thought that Jerry was ready again, he said, \u201cIt depends on what you want to say, Jerry. You\u2019ll have to trust that they already know what you want to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about you? What did you tell Lunadrowe? She\u2019s your daughter, for goodness sakes. Aren\u2019t you even a little bit sad that she\u2019s gone too?\u201d\n\nBriefly, a sharp pang jolted Captain Lenaforte, but he steeled himself, and the moment passed. Of course he was sad that his own daughter, Jerry\u2019s counterpart on the exchange program the Luscians had with Earth, had perished as well. But Luscians had, after all, millennia of experience more than humans at dealing with loss, and they had picked up a lot along the way.\n\n\u201cWe spoke too, just five minutes ago. I told her that it seemed that she had about four months to live, and I told her to make the most of it. She thanked me for all that I had done for her, I thanked her for being a wonderful daughter, then we ended the call.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 impossible! I want more time, I need more time!\u201d\n\nCaptain Lenaforte smiled. Jerry may have spent a year on their planet, learning their ways, but he had a long journey ahead before he would be fully immersed in their philosophies.\n\n\u201cTrust me, your loved ones have known you for long enough already. Together, you\u2019ve laughed at the mirthful, wept at the somber, yearned for new beginnings, rued sunsets with a vengeance\u2026 but, and we\u2019re rarely wrong about this, you\u2019ve probably spent very little time thanking each other for being the experiences you are to each other. And that, that takes just a little time. Four months to say \u2018thank you\u2019, that is an eternity for those who never got the chance.\u201d\n\nHe left Jerry then, and signalled for the other Luscians to give him space. Jerry would take some time still to process it all, but he recognised the calm settling across Jerry\u2019s face, and he knew his words had found its mark.\n\n---\n\n/r/rarelyfunny", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Luscians were normally a loud, rambunctious lot, given to easy laughter, quick excitement, and warm effervescence.
