My eyes must have doubled in size as I flicked from tab to tab, hammering out searches on all the major news outlets. Each one featured an equally low resolution copy of my profile picture accompanied by a caption invariably including my name, age and a appeal for more information. \n\t\nAt this point my eyes were darting around in their sockets, my mind a neural spaghetti of thoughts, primarily focusing on how I could possibly have gotten myself into this situation, and secondarily on what I should do next. Should I go to a friend? The Police? Run!?

I only half registered the fact that it had slipped out of my hand as I fixated on the scene transpiring out on the street. Yellow and white sedans topped with blue beacons, three in total, jumped the curb and came to an abrupt halt outside my townhouse. \n\t\nCommon sense had been all but driven from my mind, replaced by pure adrenaline and the flickering visions of scenes from action movies I\u2019d watched one too many times. With a sudden focus I snapped my laptop closed, shoved it into my backpack and slung it over my shoulder in one motion. I grabbed my coat which was for once conveniently strewn over the sofa and started for the glass door that lead to the fenced-in back garden, leaving my phone to continue it\u2019s pointless bid for my attention on the floor. \n\t\nClosing the door behind me, it\u2019s frame shook from the front door being shattered, it\u2019s remains ignored by the armour-clad men that rushed in. I broke into a sprint and vaulted over the waist high fence surrounding the garden and made for the next street across; I had made the right decision.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBeen way too long since I've written anything like this so of course I ran out of time on my flight to get anywhere near finishing. \n\nI've never done a writing prompt before but enjoyed reading so many that I thought I'd give it a go when I had some time to kill.

My eyes must have doubled in size as I flicked from tab to tab, hammering out searches on all the major news outlets. Each one featured an equally low resolution copy of my profile picture accompanied by a caption invariably including my name, age and a appeal for more information. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point my eyes were darting around in their sockets, my mind a neural spaghetti of thoughts, primarily focusing on how I could possibly have gotten myself into this situation, and secondarily on what I should do next. Should I go to a friend? The Police? Run!?

You\u2019ve got to put it on now! I d\u2026\u201d The voice of my editor, the only person up at this time in the morning, trailed off as I lowered the phone from my ear. I only half registered the fact that it had slipped out of my hand as I fixated on the scene transpiring out on the street. Yellow and white sedans topped with blue beacons, three in total, jumped the curb and came to an abrupt halt outside my townhouse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Common sense had been all but driven from my mind, replaced by pure adrenaline and the flickering visions of scenes from action movies I\u2019d watched one too many times. With a sudden focus I snapped my laptop closed, shoved it into my backpack and slung it over my shoulder in one motion.

He&amp;#39;s not a runner, but when your life&amp;#39;s on the line, your not the same person. FBI agents flood out the back door, some around the side yard, but Brad is in the open field now. Agents aim and fire, trying to pick him off from a distance. No luck. Some men pursue on foot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brad glimpses behind him, seeing agents on his tail.
