Her eyes would also study her next meal, first with eyes of curiosity, then as if she was being exhorted her eyes would look at her meal with preying eyes. \n\nShe was by no means an ordinary girl, that much was obvious. Most people would be repulsed by her, fusing him into a fits of rage; though he wasn't stupid nor was he blind of the facts. \n\nHer lithe body was endearing and cute, it was small and it could be compared to that of a malnourished street rat - her condition was better now though, as healthy and happy as she was now. But her little body would also bear two estranged appendages, just behind her and if one would trace their eyes down her back they would be met with a bestial tail, that of a cat's. It was, like herself, slender and with fur as dark as night. It would be longer than her legs themselves and so the little girl required to bring that strange appendage of hers in a constant lift. \n\nRaising ones eyes now towards her head she would always sport that lopsided smile of hers, it was strangely endearing no matter how one would look at it. It was as if you were looking at kitten's cute and warm features before they turn into that of the detached, regal pride of an adult cat's. Looking further up, it wasn't so questionable to think that this analogy couldn't be more apt for her. Black ears not unlike a cats were perched proudly atop her head, pointed and worthy of being patted - if he didn't have anything better to do he would gladly be petting those ears of hers all day long. \n\n\"Dad, can I have your soup?\" She kept her voice low, bashfully swaying her legs underneath the table and batting her eyes. From that alone he knew that the little kit would be quite the looker and perhaps quite the minx, too. \n\nHe knew inciting her by giving her his soup would only enforce the idea that the coquettish way she was acting right now was something that was acceptable. But as her father - well, adoptive father - he couldn't help but feed her desires and cave into her decidedly cute mannerisms.\n\n\"Of course, sweety\" He smiled, at her in a most fatherly manner.

His smile made way for a thoughtful expression as he brought his hands to swipe at his phone's screen, opening the device. \n\n\"In a few week's time-\" He said, looking at the schedule he had written in his phone \"-yes, your aunty's coming. What will you do when she comes?\"\n\n\"Be petted by her! Then, then, then I'll give her the luck charm I made for her!\" \n\n\"Ohh?\" This caught his attention.

There was many things that could've brought that on and his mind was pacing to find exactly what that was.\n\n\"We got off in a wrong foot\" as if reading his mind she mused, \"I want to give her my apologies. When daddy gave my a gift I felt so happy! So maybe if I give something to her she'll also be happy.\" \n\n\"Very good, Alice, very good\" She smiled at her, pleased. She was sure smart and quick to read between the lines, maybe teaching her to act properly coquettish and to properly read the moods of people would serve her well in the future. He knew better than anyone that she wouldn't abuse that set of skills - he had that much faith in her.\n\n\"Can daddy see what your gift for aunty Amy is?\" He asked, propping his head against his hand. She nodded, closing her eyes and opening them once more to the sight of slighted irises glowing an angry red color and even radiating an ominous, if not a chilling atmosphere with them.\n\nHis face still kept that ever present smile of his, fatherly and caring as they were but his eyes . . . the way he painted them now were a melancholic frown. He didn't hate the oddity and mystics surrounding his daughter, what he hated was the side effects that and misfortune that it brought her.\n\nHe hated that he hit her when she knocked on his door - when they first met,.\n\nHe hated that he treated her with scorn when she knocked on his door again.\n\nHe hated it the most when he spat on her face. It tore his heart apart to remember those memories. \n\nHe didn't deserve her and she sure as hell deserved better. But . . . \n\nShe knocked for the forth time . . . he'd given her another chance, though begrudgingly, he'd given her his time of day, he learned about her, about who she was and what she was. He moved her heart after before long and he'd taken her in and gave her a new name: Maine Luther, adoptive daughter of Alex Luther. \n\n\"Daddy?\" \n\n\"Ah? oh. Yes honey?\" \n\nLooking at her worried face, he gave her a blank smile, if only to alleviate her from worry. She smiled back, if she learned one thing from her father it was that he regret treating her like he used to and that it still gnawed at him, so all she could give was a reassuring smile, seeing through him. \n\n\"Dad, here it is!\" Though that conversation was left as quickly as it began a new one took its place, thankfully for the both of them.\n\nQuickly, her hands pushed into his face a black cat doll \"Can't say I didn't expect *that* but its nice\"\n\nShe giggled \"OH! dad I also made an accompanying dress to go with it\" She puffed her chest out proudly.\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Here it is!\" She ran back to her room, there was some tumbling and ruckus following her wake but when she came back she wore a long flowing black long sleeved dress and pointed hat.\n\nHe smirked, impressed \"Come here\" He hugged the adorable little kit, though he supposed right now she was his adorable little witch. \n\nHe held her hand as they parted spinning the girl like a ballerina as he does so \"There goes my little witch!

It tore his heart apart to remember those memories. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t deserve her and she sure as hell deserved better. But . . . &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She knocked for the forth time . . . he&amp;#39;d given her another chance, though begrudgingly, he&amp;#39;d given her his time of day, he learned about her, about who she was and what she was. He moved her heart after before long and he&amp;#39;d taken her in and gave her a new name: Maine Luther, adoptive daughter of Alex Luther. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daddy?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah? oh. Yes honey?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at her worried face, he gave her a blank smile, if only to alleviate her from worry. She smiled back, if she learned one thing from her father it was that he regret treating her like he used to and that it still gnawed at him, so all she could give was a reassuring smile, seeing through him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dad, here it is!&amp;quot; Though that conversation was left as quickly as it began a new one took its place, thankfully for the both of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quickly, her hands pushed into his face a black cat doll &amp;quot;Can&amp;#39;t say I didn&amp;#39;t expect &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; but its nice&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She giggled &amp;quot;OH! dad I also made an accompanying dress to go with it&amp;quot; She puffed her chest out proudly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here it is!&amp;quot; She ran back to her room, there was some tumbling and ruckus following her wake but when she came back she wore a long flowing black long sleeved dress and pointed hat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He smirked, impressed &amp;quot;Come here&amp;quot; He hugged the adorable little kit, though he supposed right now she was his adorable little witch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He held her hand as they parted spinning the girl like a ballerina as he does so &amp;quot;There goes my little witch! You. are. so. adorable!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two shared a giggle before it devolved into full on laughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgc53xl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492384915.0, "created_utc": 1492356115.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
