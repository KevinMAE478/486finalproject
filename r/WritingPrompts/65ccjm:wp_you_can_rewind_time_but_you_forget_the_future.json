Got a warning from my future self!\"\n\n\"... right.  Listen, I  know you don't like sprint planning, but we need to put this together...\"\n\nDammit, Kunal clearly knew where I was.  The other seven people at the table probably had a good idea, too.  The computer still on the table above me was likely giving away my position.  This hiding spot wasn't going to work at all.\n\nI ran from the room.  Well, first I crashed into the door because it was 'pull' rather than 'push', but then I opened it and *then* I ran from the room.  I needed a better spot.\n\nA half hour later, I thought I'd found one, but it was not to be.\n\n\"David, are you hiding under your desk?\"  Kunal asked.\n\n\"Dammit, Kunal, you're giving me away here!\"  I hissed.  \"I need to hide!\"\n\n\"I'm going to have Eli send you the notes from the meeting,\" Kunal said.  \"Also, if you're trying to hide, maybe the desk you work at every day isn't the best of ideas.  Also your computer is on top of it, so that's kinda a giveaway.\"\n\nDammit!  I should have left the computer in the meeting room.  I needed to find somewhere to hide, and fast!  But where?\n\n\"So... you're just going to be under there all day?\"  Kunal asked.\n\nHe had a point, this wasn't going to work.  I burst from under the desk and ran down the hallway.  I'd been struck by inspiration and, shortly before that, two other people who were trying to walk in the other direction.  My car!\n\nIt was brilliant.  The car had ample hiding space, but if I were discovered I could use it to escape!  There was no downside to this plan.\n\nWhen I got to the car and surreptitiously slipped inside, I immediately discovered the downside to this plan.  It turns out that the greenhouse effect, for all the controversy it has generated on a global scale, remains an undeniable fact on a local scale.  In this case, that scale is my car, the inside of which was an estimated four hundred degrees.  It probably wasn't a very good estimation, but it certainly felt that hot.\n\nAs I hunched under the dashboard in front of the passenger seat, I began to re-think the brilliance of my plan.  Not only was it unbearably hot in here, but I couldn't turn the car on in order to start the air conditioning:  I'd stand out like a sore thumb.  But where else could I go?  I couldn't go back into work, Kunal had demonstrated the futility of that.  I certainly couldn't go home, because whoever I was supposed to be hiding from would definitely be there-\n\nFear gripped me.  I wasn't the only one at stake here.  If whoever I was hiding from had found my home, they'd be watching my wife *right now*.  She ran a small online crafts business from out of the house, and unless she'd gotten a message like I had - very unlikely - then she'd be in danger too.  I had to go to her!\n\nAn hour and a half of traffic later - which, paradoxically, I felt pretty good about given that I was well hidden in the vast sea of unmoving cars - I'd traveled the ten miles from my job to my home.  The only other car there was my wife's, but I'd kept a close and careful watch as I'd neared the place where my unknowable malefactors were no doubt closing in.\n\nThe only people I'd seen had been the postman and old woman Josie.  Or, perhaps that's what I'd been *meant* to see.  It wouldn't be the first time that people I thought I'd known all my life had been replaced by their doppelg\u00e4ngers in order to lure me into a false sense of security.\n\nActually, now that I thought about it, it would.\n\nStill, I was wary, on edge, and prepared as I entered my house, ready to face whatever challenges awaited me.\n\n\"Hey honey!\"  My wife said, \"You're home early!\"\n\n\"Traffic was lighter than usual,\" I said.  \"Listen, we need to-\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"that reminds me.  I got an order in for a leather jacket but it needs to be filled quickly.  Can you do that time-message thing you do and remind yourself to pick up some cow hide?\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And we&amp;#39;re on track to finish the sprint in-&amp;quot; Kunal was saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dove under the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Um... you okay there, David?&amp;quot;  Kunal asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shh!&amp;quot;  I said.  &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m hiding!

I needed a better spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A half hour later, I thought I&amp;#39;d found one, but it was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;David, are you hiding under your desk?&amp;quot;  Kunal asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dammit, Kunal, you&amp;#39;re giving me away here!&amp;quot;  I hissed.  &amp;quot;I need to hide!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to have Eli send you the notes from the meeting,&amp;quot; Kunal said.  &amp;quot;Also, if you&amp;#39;re trying to hide, maybe the desk you work at every day isn&amp;#39;t the best of ideas.  Also your computer is on top of it, so that&amp;#39;s kinda a giveaway.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dammit!  I should have left the computer in the meeting room.  I needed to find somewhere to hide, and fast!  But where?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So... you&amp;#39;re just going to be under there all day?&amp;quot;  Kunal asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had a point, this wasn&amp;#39;t going to work.  I burst from under the desk and ran down the hallway.  I&amp;#39;d been struck by inspiration and, shortly before that, two other people who were trying to walk in the other direction.  My car!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was brilliant.  The car had ample hiding space, but if I were discovered I could use it to escape!  There was no downside to this plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got to the car and surreptitiously slipped inside, I immediately discovered the downside to this plan.  It turns out that the greenhouse effect, for all the controversy it has generated on a global scale, remains an undeniable fact on a local scale.  In this case, that scale is my car, the inside of which was an estimated four hundred degrees.  It probably wasn&amp;#39;t a very good estimation, but it certainly felt that hot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I hunched under the dashboard in front of the passenger seat, I began to re-think the brilliance of my plan.  Not only was it unbearably hot in here, but I couldn&amp;#39;t turn the car on in order to start the air conditioning:  I&amp;#39;d stand out like a sore thumb.  But where else could I go?  I couldn&amp;#39;t go back into work, Kunal had demonstrated the futility of that.  I certainly couldn&amp;#39;t go home, because whoever I was supposed to be hiding from would definitely be there-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear gripped me.  I wasn&amp;#39;t the only one at stake here.  If whoever I was hiding from had found my home, they&amp;#39;d be watching my wife &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;.  She ran a small online crafts business from out of the house, and unless she&amp;#39;d gotten a message like I had - very unlikely - then she&amp;#39;d be in danger too.  I had to go to her!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An hour and a half of traffic later - which, paradoxically, I felt pretty good about given that I was well hidden in the vast sea of unmoving cars - I&amp;#39;d traveled the ten miles from my job to my home.  The only other car there was my wife&amp;#39;s, but I&amp;#39;d kept a close and careful watch as I&amp;#39;d neared the place where my unknowable malefactors were no doubt closing in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only people I&amp;#39;d seen had been the postman and old woman Josie.  Or, perhaps that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;d been &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to see.  It wouldn&amp;#39;t be the first time that people I thought I&amp;#39;d known all my life had been replaced by their doppelg\u00e4ngers in order to lure me into a false sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, now that I thought about it, it would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, I was wary, on edge, and prepared as I entered my house, ready to face whatever challenges awaited me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey honey!&amp;quot;  My wife said, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re home early!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Traffic was lighter than usual,&amp;quot; I said.  &amp;quot;Listen, we need to-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh,&amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot;that reminds me.  I got an order in for a leather jacket but it needs to be filled quickly.  Can you do that time-message thing you do and remind yourself to pick up some cow hide?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg958oc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492206448.0, "created_utc": 1492177648.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 177}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ccjm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ccjm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ccjm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9crwm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DoverHawk", "parent_id": "t1_dg9bvfe", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for the prompt!

Oh wait, I'm an adult. I'll just pretend to go to the restroom. \n\nI wait near the elevator expecting a crazed gunman or a bomb to go off in the office. A man in a dark trench coat with random bulges here and there sets off the alarms in my head; also, the red splotches he leaves with each step seem suspicious. \n\nI slip past the man, take the elevator down, and leave the building. It's doubtful anyone will survive what he has planned, past future self included. I call the police outside and head home. Finding the right word probably won't take long. \n\nThe newscaster states that the killer entered the building  around 2:34 pm and began slashing people with what looked like a machete. Apparently, my floor was his third stop.

A man in a dark trench coat with random bulges here and there sets off the alarms in my head; also, the red splotches he leaves with each step seem suspicious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slip past the man, take the elevator down, and leave the building. It&amp;#39;s doubtful anyone will survive what he has planned, past future self included. I call the police outside and head home. Finding the right word probably won&amp;#39;t take long. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The newscaster states that the killer entered the building  around 2:34 pm and began slashing people with what looked like a machete. Apparently, my floor was his third stop.
