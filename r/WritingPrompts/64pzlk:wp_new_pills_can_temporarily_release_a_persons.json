The place had an energy to it and he could feel it coming. The barrier was breaking, dissolving into the past where all the hours of practice and pain were.

The barrier that was a rite of passage, was gone.\n\n\nHe had always looked up to the greats: Plant, Dylan, Jagger, Bon Jovi, and sometimes, though he would never admit it, Smash Mouth. Now the crowd looked up to him. The sweat in his eyes masked the sea of faces but their joy broke through. He run his hand through his hair. He felt the outside of his tight jeans' pocket.\n\n\n*\"Oh mama, don't you see? How your sweet hips do to me.\"*\n\n\nThe crowd was eating it up. His voice was on key. The band was tight. And the best part was that it was all him. He felt his pockets again. All the pills were there. He was a superhero without any pharmaceutical help.\n\n\n*Well without that kind of help,* he thought.\n\n\nThe show was good and he was tired. He looked in the mirror and was proud of himself. His hair was thick and long, and he felt he looked like a young Robert Plant.\n\n\nHe took out the pills and wondered what they did. Many people took them at an early age to find out what their powers were. But he was different. He had never taken any. He always wanted to see if he could make it on his own.\n\n\n*And I did.*\n\n\nThe months passed and they had a record deal. They called themselves The Blue Buttons and they had their first hit with Mama Don't You Know. The world was looking up. And so it could only one way.\n\n\nMama Don't You Know charted well but blues just wasn't in anymore. After a month it fell off the Earth and so did The Blue Buttons. Guitar bands were on the way out and besides, the press had started calling them reductive.\n\n\nThe crowds grew smaller and smaller and he was aware of the encroaching barrier. Like a shark in the water, gaining, smelling blood.\n\n\n*No,* he thought.\n\n\nHe had worked so hard.\n\n\nTheir newest song Just Like Dilly Dylan's Blues was called an outright copy and a mess.\n\n\n*\"Great bands steal, yes,\"* Pitchfork wrote, *\"but great bands know not to mix Stairway to Heaven and Livin' on a Prayer and then call it a completely unrelated song.*\n\n\nTheir label dropped them. The drummer started heroin and he got fat from taking his pills and gaining the ability to survive any chemical substance. The bassist quit from feeling ignored and underappreciated. They hardly noticed when he left.\n\n\nNow only he remained. Lead guitarist and singer and he had no fans. The Blue Buttons were history, and forgotten history at that.\n\n\nHe played bars and then coffee shops. Even Mama Don't You Know didn't get applause anymore. His options were dim and time was against him. He had to do it.\n\n\n*Now is the time,* he thought. *My power will save me.*\n\n\nHe did not know what it would be but he had faith. It was his destiny to be a star. Surely his power would reflect as much.\n\n\nSo he took the pills. It was the night before the big show. He had begged and pleaded with the owner of The Lightbulb, a popular bar, to let him perform. It was a Friday and there were over forty people there.\n\n\n*This is it,* he thought.\n\n\nHe got out there by himself and felt the pills working. He scanned the crowd and waited for the magic to happen.\n\n\nHe grabbed the mic and put it near his lips.\n\n\n*\"Oh oh mama why you gotta move so slow. Oh oh mama dear you gotta know...\"*\n\n\nBut the words were croaked. His voice was breaking like a child and then he lost it. He tried to drop the mic but couldn't. It was stuck to his fingers and his fingers were growing and turning green.\n\n\nHis eyes turned yellow and his tongue was thin. His long hair fell and everyone was silent and then started to laugh. He shrunk and shrunk and then he was a lizard and he stared at the crowd with fear and embarrassment.\n\n\n\"If I sung like that I'd turn into a lizard too!\" someone shouted. \n\n\nSomeone threw a beer at him and he nearly drowned. He ran away as lizards do and hid in the corner until the pills wore off and then he was naked and bald and in the corner of the bar.\n\n\nMore laughter came and someone threw another beer at him and it hurt his head for it was sensitive.\n\n\n\"You look like a dick mate!\" someone shouted.\n\n\n\"A small one too!\" another said.\n\n\nHe ran out of The Lightbulb and into the night.

He always wanted to see if he could make it on his own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And I did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The months passed and they had a record deal. They called themselves The Blue Buttons and they had their first hit with Mama Don&amp;#39;t You Know. The world was looking up. And so it could only one way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mama Don&amp;#39;t You Know charted well but blues just wasn&amp;#39;t in anymore. After a month it fell off the Earth and so did The Blue Buttons. Guitar bands were on the way out and besides, the press had started calling them reductive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The crowds grew smaller and smaller and he was aware of the encroaching barrier. Like a shark in the water, gaining, smelling blood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No,&lt;/em&gt; he thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had worked so hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their newest song Just Like Dilly Dylan&amp;#39;s Blues was called an outright copy and a mess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Great bands steal, yes,&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Pitchfork wrote, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;but great bands know not to mix Stairway to Heaven and Livin&amp;#39; on a Prayer and then call it a completely unrelated song.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their label dropped them. The drummer started heroin and he got fat from taking his pills and gaining the ability to survive any chemical substance. The bassist quit from feeling ignored and underappreciated. They hardly noticed when he left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now only he remained. Lead guitarist and singer and he had no fans. The Blue Buttons were history, and forgotten history at that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He played bars and then coffee shops. Even Mama Don&amp;#39;t You Know didn&amp;#39;t get applause anymore. His options were dim and time was against him. He had to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now is the time,&lt;/em&gt; he thought. &lt;em&gt;My power will save me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did not know what it would be but he had faith. It was his destiny to be a star. Surely his power would reflect as much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he took the pills. It was the night before the big show. He had begged and pleaded with the owner of The Lightbulb, a popular bar, to let him perform. It was a Friday and there were over forty people there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is it,&lt;/em&gt; he thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He got out there by himself and felt the pills working. He scanned the crowd and waited for the magic to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He grabbed the mic and put it near his lips.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Oh oh mama why you gotta move so slow. Oh oh mama dear you gotta know...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the words were croaked. His voice was breaking like a child and then he lost it. He tried to drop the mic but couldn&amp;#39;t. It was stuck to his fingers and his fingers were growing and turning green.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes turned yellow and his tongue was thin. His long hair fell and everyone was silent and then started to laugh. He shrunk and shrunk and then he was a lizard and he stared at the crowd with fear and embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If I sung like that I&amp;#39;d turn into a lizard too!&amp;quot; someone shouted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone threw a beer at him and he nearly drowned. He ran away as lizards do and hid in the corner until the pills wore off and then he was naked and bald and in the corner of the bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More laughter came and someone threw another beer at him and it hurt his head for it was sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You look like a dick mate!&amp;quot; someone shouted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A small one too!&amp;quot; another said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He ran out of The Lightbulb and into the night. The barrier of mediocrity embraced him and just as he had done with his dignity, he left his music career at its door.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg45eyk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491940347.0, "created_utc": 1491911547.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
