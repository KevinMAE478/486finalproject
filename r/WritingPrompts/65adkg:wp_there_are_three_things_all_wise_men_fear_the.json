We were visiting friends who lived on a small island in the middle of a lake vast in size, a thousand feet deep, a hundred leagues long and fifty leagues across. The water was calm, small waves lazily caressed the small sand beach I stood on and the water as far as I could see was like a soft mirror of the black sky, broken up with specks of white froth and reflections of moon and star. \n\nAs often is the case, I was alone. I didn't think twice about wading into the chilly waters until I was waist deep before I let myself slide forward into a small wave, like collapsing into a bed, and began to slowly swim out. Though I was still young and physically small I was a strong swimmer, growing up on a lake I've always been very comfortable in the water. \n\nBy the time I stopped my relaxed swim and stopped, treading water and catching my breath I had gone much farther than intended and carried laterally by the current. I could still see the island, though I could barely spy the lights from the cabin windows it was enough, I had my bearings. I spun myself back around, back turned to the island and marveled at the beauty of the cloudless night sky and nothing but rolling water as far as I could see. \n\nI flipped over on my back and stared at the stars as I swam eastward, correcting the drift from the current, completely overwhelmed with beauty I wondered if the miracle of my life was as meaningful as the miracle of this lake. How would you even measure such a thing, the value of a miracle? I laughed and got a mouthful of water, stopping my backstroke I tread water once more and spit the water out. \n\nI very quickly noticed I was bobbing up and down much more as I scissored my legs and waved my arms. Turning myself back to face the island, it took a few moments to spot the light from the cabin window. The light. There was only one on, my family would soon be in bed and there would be no lights. You can understand this is a troubling realization to someone who's only begun to live their life. The wind and waves steadily increasing in severity did little to calm this realization.\n\nI began swimming in earnest, telling myself I had to get home before the lights went out or it would take forever to find the beach again. I subconsciously knew I was actually swimming for my life, but I suppose I was trying to keep that fact in denial to stay calm; even at that age I knew the disasters panic can cause. I'm not sure if you've ever tried to swim any great distance at night but it becomes quite difficult to maintain your direction when the waves are larger and stronger than you, I frequently had to stop or slow and push myself up out of the water to see the island. \n\nI stopped to catch my breath and give my now aching muscles a break, gauging my distance and direction home. I squinted for a moment and wiped some water from my eye with the back of my hand, when I opened my eyes again the light from the window was gone, the island nothing more than a blurred silhouette only noticeable because it was stationary and darker than the reflective water. \n\nMy mental denial of the danger I was in went out with that bedroom light and I felt all the elements of panic start to set in. My already racing heart was now beating against my chest, my measured breathing turned instantly to deep gasps that often got bits of water from the waves in my mouth, my hands and arms began trembling and my stomach started to crawl up my throat. I closed my eyes and heard my Father's voice in my head, \"No, breathe. That's it, just breathe nice and easy. In. And out.\" My stomach settled, my heart decided it wanted to stay in my chest, and I knew what I had to do, just breathe and swim. \n\nTreading water with my eyes closed and taking those few careful breaths, I saw a bright light through my eyelids and immediately opened them to catch a glimpse of everything in perfect clarity, fully illuminated by a bolt of lightning miles behind me, then with my pupils shocked from the light everything was dark. I felt the reverberation from the thunder in my body before I heard it but when I did hear it, it was as though the sky split open and dumped all it's water back into the lake. I was already swimming, frantically toward the mental afterimage of the island.\n\nI thought to myself I was over halfway home, and then I thought I was just reassuring myself. The fast moving storm clouds made the moon and start light chaotic and ethereal. I started wondering if the silhouette I was swimming towards was the island or just that clear picture of it I've been holding in my mind. \n\nDespite the adrenaline, my legs were aching and felt as if they were pumping pure fire through their veins. I knew if I got a muscle cramp it would probably be the end of me. I stopped swimming and looked to make sure I was still heading toward the island and not just fooling myself and I was indeed. I tread water with my arms only for just a few breaths, letting my legs rest while I waited for a wave to propel me forward. \n\nI thought about surfing, I had never done it but I understood the concept well enough. I started feeling the waves with a different mindset, learning how to join with them and stiffen my body to let them carry me with little effort on my part. As I got the hang of it I became excited, the heavy rain and sporadic thunderclaps now background noise. I felt I learned to be one with the water, I had mastered the waves and with that mastery was swimming faster than I ever have before!\n\nAs I drew nearer and nearer to the island it grew larger and became clearer. I had drifted off course again, I was closer to the western point than the beach on the east where the cabin slumbered. I swam eastward again, though I couldn't see the beach I had a good idea of where it was relative to the point and it was a small island. It certainly wasn't as easy to swim across the waves as it was to swim with them, but my muscles had rested some and I still stiffened my body for moments to let the waves carry me closer to shore. \n\nThen the sky light up again, another lightning bolt to the north, I took another clear reckoning of the island with the brief illumination. I could see the beach and I couldn't be more than a hundred yards from it! I turned to face it and with the next wave I used my arms and legs to launch myself forward with it, stiffening my body and letting it carry me as I periodically kicked or fanned my arms to stay with it or on course. Then I lost it, the whole world rumbled with the thunderous boom of the last lightening bolt as I waited for the next wave I would harness.\n\nI was racing toward the beach, I could see the sand clearly and the darkness of the vegetation behind it. When I fanned my arms forward I was surprised to feel air and, looking down, I realized I was a full 5 feet above the surface of the water riding the crest of a huge wave.

We were visiting friends who lived on a small island in the middle of a lake vast in size, a thousand feet deep, a hundred leagues long and fifty leagues across. The water was calm, small waves lazily caressed the small sand beach I stood on and the water as far as I could see was like a soft mirror of the black sky, broken up with specks of white froth and reflections of moon and star. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As often is the case, I was alone. I didn&amp;#39;t think twice about wading into the chilly waters until I was waist deep before I let myself slide forward into a small wave, like collapsing into a bed, and began to slowly swim out. Though I was still young and physically small I was a strong swimmer, growing up on a lake I&amp;#39;ve always been very comfortable in the water. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I stopped my relaxed swim and stopped, treading water and catching my breath I had gone much farther than intended and carried laterally by the current. I could still see the island, though I could barely spy the lights from the cabin windows it was enough, I had my bearings. I spun myself back around, back turned to the island and marveled at the beauty of the cloudless night sky and nothing but rolling water as far as I could see. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I flipped over on my back and stared at the stars as I swam eastward, correcting the drift from the current, completely overwhelmed with beauty I wondered if the miracle of my life was as meaningful as the miracle of this lake. How would you even measure such a thing, the value of a miracle? I laughed and got a mouthful of water, stopping my backstroke I tread water once more and spit the water out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I very quickly noticed I was bobbing up and down much more as I scissored my legs and waved my arms. Turning myself back to face the island, it took a few moments to spot the light from the cabin window. The light. There was only one on, my family would soon be in bed and there would be no lights. You can understand this is a troubling realization to someone who&amp;#39;s only begun to live their life. The wind and waves steadily increasing in severity did little to calm this realization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began swimming in earnest, telling myself I had to get home before the lights went out or it would take forever to find the beach again. I subconsciously knew I was actually swimming for my life, but I suppose I was trying to keep that fact in denial to stay calm; even at that age I knew the disasters panic can cause. I&amp;#39;m not sure if you&amp;#39;ve ever tried to swim any great distance at night but it becomes quite difficult to maintain your direction when the waves are larger and stronger than you, I frequently had to stop or slow and push myself up out of the water to see the island. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped to catch my breath and give my now aching muscles a break, gauging my distance and direction home. I squinted for a moment and wiped some water from my eye with the back of my hand, when I opened my eyes again the light from the window was gone, the island nothing more than a blurred silhouette only noticeable because it was stationary and darker than the reflective water. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mental denial of the danger I was in went out with that bedroom light and I felt all the elements of panic start to set in. My already racing heart was now beating against my chest, my measured breathing turned instantly to deep gasps that often got bits of water from the waves in my mouth, my hands and arms began trembling and my stomach started to crawl up my throat. I closed my eyes and heard my Father&amp;#39;s voice in my head, &amp;quot;No, breathe. That&amp;#39;s it, just breathe nice and easy. In. And out.&amp;quot; My stomach settled, my heart decided it wanted to stay in my chest, and I knew what I had to do, just breathe and swim. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Treading water with my eyes closed and taking those few careful breaths, I saw a bright light through my eyelids and immediately opened them to catch a glimpse of everything in perfect clarity, fully illuminated by a bolt of lightning miles behind me, then with my pupils shocked from the light everything was dark. I felt the reverberation from the thunder in my body before I heard it but when I did hear it, it was as though the sky split open and dumped all it&amp;#39;s water back into the lake. I was already swimming, frantically toward the mental afterimage of the island.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself I was over halfway home, and then I thought I was just reassuring myself. The fast moving storm clouds made the moon and start light chaotic and ethereal. I started wondering if the silhouette I was swimming towards was the island or just that clear picture of it I&amp;#39;ve been holding in my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the adrenaline, my legs were aching and felt as if they were pumping pure fire through their veins. I knew if I got a muscle cramp it would probably be the end of me. I stopped swimming and looked to make sure I was still heading toward the island and not just fooling myself and I was indeed. I tread water with my arms only for just a few breaths, letting my legs rest while I waited for a wave to propel me forward. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about surfing, I had never done it but I understood the concept well enough. I started feeling the waves with a different mindset, learning how to join with them and stiffen my body to let them carry me with little effort on my part. As I got the hang of it I became excited, the heavy rain and sporadic thunderclaps now background noise. I felt I learned to be one with the water, I had mastered the waves and with that mastery was swimming faster than I ever have before!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I drew nearer and nearer to the island it grew larger and became clearer. I had drifted off course again, I was closer to the western point than the beach on the east where the cabin slumbered. I swam eastward again, though I couldn&amp;#39;t see the beach I had a good idea of where it was relative to the point and it was a small island. It certainly wasn&amp;#39;t as easy to swim across the waves as it was to swim with them, but my muscles had rested some and I still stiffened my body for moments to let the waves carry me closer to shore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the sky light up again, another lightning bolt to the north, I took another clear reckoning of the island with the brief illumination. I could see the beach and I couldn&amp;#39;t be more than a hundred yards from it! I turned to face it and with the next wave I used my arms and legs to launch myself forward with it, stiffening my body and letting it carry me as I periodically kicked or fanned my arms to stay with it or on course. Then I lost it, the whole world rumbled with the thunderous boom of the last lightening bolt as I waited for the next wave I would harness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was racing toward the beach, I could see the sand clearly and the darkness of the vegetation behind it. When I fanned my arms forward I was surprised to feel air and, looking down, I realized I was a full 5 feet above the surface of the water riding the crest of a huge wave. Like the roadrunner realizing he ran straight off a cliff, I dropped down into the water, half in the wave and half in the air as I fell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I immediately began doing the breast stroke to keep direction, though I was barely moving my arms and legs my momentum was carrying me to the shore faster than any human could swim. I felt the sand and small rocks scrape my face and mash my nose, then my chest and arms and the rest of my body was being dragged across the coarse ground.

And forgive me again if what I\u2019m about to say upsets you, but I remember my last night here was a moonless one.\u2019\n\nThe close packed villagers can be seen to bristle. The memory forms physical ripples through the crowd. \n\n\u2018And that night could not have brought more fear, my child.\u2019 The aelderman steps forward as he talks and raises his hands out low from his sides. \u2018We remember the night you and the other young ones were taken every year on the night where there is no moon and the days are shortest. And we beg the gods have mercy on us and our other children.\u2019 He was nearly shouting now. \u2018What happened to you was the greatest evil this village has ever suffered, but we must put it to bed if we wish to live in the present, here, among the living, rather than continually mourn with you and our dead.\u2019\n\nNow he was shouting. A speck of saliva grazed Taryn\u2019s girded dress. The villagers looked away to deny the sight of the aelder angry. Taryn took another step. The two were mere yards apart now.\n\n\u2018With respect, aelder, the reason we might fear a moonless night is because we cannot see. But there is another reason why we could not see that night, Llewel. There were no fires. The raiders always brought fire before. Their lord Virrik called for it. Fire to burn our houses when they slaughtered us and stripped us and took what little we had. But that night there were no fires. No slaughter and no robbery.\u2019\n\n\u2018THEY STOLE OUR CHILDREN. WHAT MATTER IS THERE IF THERE WAS FIRE OR NOT?\u2019 One of the village men broke into loud sobs at this point. His wife draped her arms around to comfort him but he batted her away and for a long time only his mad sobs broke the silence in the hall.\n\n\u2018It was not robbery,\u2019 Taryn continues \u2018it was sale. You sold us. Your own children. All of you, all of your children. There may not have been light, aelder,\u2019 she hissed the word out \u2018but I could hear you talking to him, telling him about how soundly the village slept when you had been the one to fill the mixing bowl.\u2019\n\n\u2018THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS.\u2019\n\n\u2018They left you the crops, is that it? And whatever small treasures you had? Maybe they swore they wouldn\u2019t come again? And you believed them?\u2019\n\nThe aelderman took a breath, then, firmly \u2018I will talk to this girl alone now\u2019. The villagers were driven out by the aelderman\u2019s two main men, who then came to stand behind him while the villagers lingered outside the hall in anticipation and torpor. \n\nAelder Llewel spoke to her quietly now, for fear, justified fear, that the village might still be listening.\n\n\u2018I did what was best for the village. We could not survive another raid. If they had burnt our granary again we would all be dead. You of all people should understand a person\u2019s instinct to survive.\u2019 And with that he gave a nod to his men that could only mean one thing, and walked past Taryn to the stand under the great hall\u2019s doorway, turning to watch his men at work.\n\nAs Taryn crossed the floor towards the aelderman\u2019s first man and with a swift two-handed thrust of her spear pierced his neck, his jugular, before he could even draw his sword, she could have told him about the other, the many other moonless nights over many years, which she had spent in misery and slavery and Lord Virrik\u2019s bed, when she could only talk to the other stolen children through whispers and glances and coded messages through passed objects. \n\nThen Taryn wrenched back her spear from the corpse she had made, and lunged with it, piercing the second man\u2019s leg through, pinning him to the floor as he fell. A visceral yelp of pain echoed in the chamber and as Taryn circled the pinned man, who though fading fast was jabbing at the air with his sword, she could have told him about the storm at sea that had killed most of her crew of stolen siblings, after she had slit Lord Virrik\u2019s throat while he slept and commandeered the very ship that once stole them.\n\nAt last she found the right time to dive upon the man, lithe and strong from years of frenzied practice for this day, and she wrestled the sword from his man and with one swift move took his head from his shoulders.\n\nShe took sword and spear with her as she ran from the hall, in pursuit of the aelderman, who found himself once again ringed in by villagers, angry now, baying for blood to expiate the blood of their sons and daughters. Her spear thrust up under his ribs and found his lungs and heart, and as his soul fled his useless body she thought his saying had been wrong. Fear the storm at sea, and the moonless night, yes.

As she stared up at the moonless night, she tried to make sense of what had just happened. \n\nShe was just about to go to a show with her friend Ron when they ran in to Ben on the way. Everything seemed fine, Becky did her best to keep her cool around him, but when she introduce Ron he just lost it. It didn't make any sense, one minute they were about to shake hands and right around when she said \"Ron\" he just pounced on him. All she could see was blood and screams and...\n\nBecky calmed herself. \"It's okay Becky, breathe. This isn't real. This *can't* be real. Hehe, I bet those guys met beforehand and this is just some prank meant to scare me.\" She began slowly walking back, only half believing herself. As much as she wanted to, something about it just seemed so real and sudden, but it couldn't be real, Ron was one of the nicest guys she knew, he couldn't hurt a fly. As she turned around the corner to where they had been standing in the southern courtyard she was shocked to see, nothing. Nobody was anywhere to be seen. She began calling out for Ben, or Ron, or anybody, and was answered with only a breeze, a breeze with a slightly odd smell to it. \n\n\"Oh god\" Becky said covering her face, as the breeze changed direction the smell became more intense, from an ambiguous stink to a putrid stench. It smelled like the cafeteria had dumped their bad meat at the same time that the schools septic tank had burst. Becky headed for her dorm content with never encountering this smell again, \"I'm sure Ben and Ron are fine, I'll just check in on them tomorrow\". However as she walked she had a troubling realisation: The smell had gotten *stronger*. Practically filling her nose at this point, she decided she had had *enough* of tonight, covered her nose and started running towards her dorm. Down the stairs, left around the lower atrium and two buildings past the eastern gymnasium and she would finally be... be... \n\nBecky dropped to her knees. She wanted to look away but she needed to take it all in, to find any way it could be not real.As the intense sound of blood rushing through her head faded she heard a soul curdling scream only to realize it was hers, as were the tears running down her face. Strung up against the A in gymnasium, was Ben, bloody, beaten and most notably dissembowelled. As Becky wept and scream to the air for help she felt a hand on her shoulder and jumped up so fast she felt as though she may very well leave her skin behind. As she turned she saw Ron, bloody and disheveled. \"RON! Ron oh my god Ron please help, first that whole thing before and now...\" She could barely speak as she helplessly choked on her tears. \" Oh my god Ron what happened to you *WHAT HAPPENED TO BEN* oh my god are you okay?\" \n\nRon grabbed her shoulders to steady her \"Hey now, it's fine, I'm fine, **everything is fine**\". Becky began to calm down even if only a little \"But, but BEN\". Ron pulled her into his shoulder and pet her hair as comfort \"Shhhhh shh, it's okay, what's important is that you and I are both fine, and now there's nobody in the way anymore, you should be *happy*.\" Ron responded. Becky pushed off his chest \"Happy?! Ron, BEN IS DEAD!!\", Her disgust was only furthered by his smile at that remark \"Exactly! Now there's no one to come in between us, Ben tried to take you away from me *but now Ben's gone*, we can finally be together, forever.\"\n\nRon reached in to embrace her again but Becky was quick enough to avoid it, she still hadn't made sense of **any** of this and things kept getting crazier by the second. Just trying to break things down made her thoughts sound like Grand Central Station during rush hour. All she knew was that she had to get away from Ron *now*. \"Don't you want us to be together forever?\" Ron said, his arms outstretched, creeping forward. All Becky could muster was \"Please don't follow me!\" Before taking off in a mad dash for her dorm house. She looked back for a moment to see nothing behind her before she crashed into something soft, something wet, something Ron. \"Oh come on now, I've been chasing after you for months, doesn't that earn me something?\" His facial features were odd, caricatures of what they were, his eyes seemed smaller, yet his mouth seemed larger, but all Becky could think of was his *speed* \" Wha- how did- when-.\" Reasoning was beyond her now, the only thing her brain would let her focus on was survival as she ran down the nearest alley.

As she stared up at the moonless night, she tried to make sense of what had just happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was just about to go to a show with her friend Ron when they ran in to Ben on the way. Everything seemed fine, Becky did her best to keep her cool around him, but when she introduce Ron he just lost it. It didn&amp;#39;t make any sense, one minute they were about to shake hands and right around when she said &amp;quot;Ron&amp;quot; he just pounced on him. All she could see was blood and screams and...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Becky calmed herself. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s okay Becky, breathe. This isn&amp;#39;t real. This &lt;em&gt;can&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; be real. Hehe, I bet those guys met beforehand and this is just some prank meant to scare me.&amp;quot; She began slowly walking back, only half believing herself. As much as she wanted to, something about it just seemed so real and sudden, but it couldn&amp;#39;t be real, Ron was one of the nicest guys she knew, he couldn&amp;#39;t hurt a fly. As she turned around the corner to where they had been standing in the southern courtyard she was shocked to see, nothing. Nobody was anywhere to be seen. She began calling out for Ben, or Ron, or anybody, and was answered with only a breeze, a breeze with a slightly odd smell to it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh god&amp;quot; Becky said covering her face, as the breeze changed direction the smell became more intense, from an ambiguous stink to a putrid stench. It smelled like the cafeteria had dumped their bad meat at the same time that the schools septic tank had burst. Becky headed for her dorm content with never encountering this smell again, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure Ben and Ron are fine, I&amp;#39;ll just check in on them tomorrow&amp;quot;. However as she walked she had a troubling realisation: The smell had gotten &lt;em&gt;stronger&lt;/em&gt;. Practically filling her nose at this point, she decided she had had &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; of tonight, covered her nose and started running towards her dorm. Down the stairs, left around the lower atrium and two buildings past the eastern gymnasium and she would finally be... be... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Becky dropped to her knees. She wanted to look away but she needed to take it all in, to find any way it could be not real.As the intense sound of blood rushing through her head faded she heard a soul curdling scream only to realize it was hers, as were the tears running down her face. Strung up against the A in gymnasium, was Ben, bloody, beaten and most notably dissembowelled. As Becky wept and scream to the air for help she felt a hand on her shoulder and jumped up so fast she felt as though she may very well leave her skin behind. As she turned she saw Ron, bloody and disheveled. &amp;quot;RON! Ron oh my god Ron please help, first that whole thing before and now...&amp;quot; She could barely speak as she helplessly choked on her tears. &amp;quot; Oh my god Ron what happened to you &lt;em&gt;WHAT HAPPENED TO BEN&lt;/em&gt; oh my god are you okay?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ron grabbed her shoulders to steady her &amp;quot;Hey now, it&amp;#39;s fine, I&amp;#39;m fine, &lt;strong&gt;everything is fine&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. Becky began to calm down even if only a little &amp;quot;But, but BEN&amp;quot;. Ron pulled her into his shoulder and pet her hair as comfort &amp;quot;Shhhhh shh, it&amp;#39;s okay, what&amp;#39;s important is that you and I are both fine, and now there&amp;#39;s nobody in the way anymore, you should be &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; Ron responded. Becky pushed off his chest &amp;quot;Happy?! Ron, BEN IS DEAD!!&amp;quot;, Her disgust was only furthered by his smile at that remark &amp;quot;Exactly! Now there&amp;#39;s no one to come in between us, Ben tried to take you away from me &lt;em&gt;but now Ben&amp;#39;s gone&lt;/em&gt;, we can finally be together, forever.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ron reached in to embrace her again but Becky was quick enough to avoid it, she still hadn&amp;#39;t made sense of &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; of this and things kept getting crazier by the second. Just trying to break things down made her thoughts sound like Grand Central Station during rush hour. All she knew was that she had to get away from Ron &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t you want us to be together forever?&amp;quot; Ron said, his arms outstretched, creeping forward. All Becky could muster was &amp;quot;Please don&amp;#39;t follow me!&amp;quot; Before taking off in a mad dash for her dorm house. She looked back for a moment to see nothing behind her before she crashed into something soft, something wet, something Ron. &amp;quot;Oh come on now, I&amp;#39;ve been chasing after you for months, doesn&amp;#39;t that earn me something?&amp;quot; His facial features were odd, caricatures of what they were, his eyes seemed smaller, yet his mouth seemed larger, but all Becky could think of was his &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot; Wha- how did- when-.&amp;quot; Reasoning was beyond her now, the only thing her brain would let her focus on was survival as she ran down the nearest alley. She could still hear Ron&amp;#39;s voice echoing behind her &amp;quot;You know, it really hurt my feelings when you said I was your friend^ I mean I&amp;#39;ve always been nothing but a gentleman and thats all I get?^ I guess it&amp;#39;s true what they say about nice guys.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Becky stopped around a corner to catch her breath, her heart was racing after running what seemed like half the campus.

In the winter, he wore a different sweater each day.\n\nEvery day, Bob went into the Grayson Middle School, took a cup of coffee from the teacher's lounge, checked his mailbox, and went to his room.  He taught Middle School Science.  Each day, his students arrived eager to see what Bob had planned for the day.  His voice was soft-spoken, not particularly exciting, but the things he said with that voice made the science come alive.  \n\nAt least twice a week, there were laboratory experiments or demonstrations.  Chemicals made showers of sparks and colored smoke and terrible smells.

No, it was something else entirely.  You see, though Bob was in his late forties, he'd never married.  He had no children of his own, but all of the children that came through Grayson Middle School became his.  Though there were inevitably a few difficult students who caused problems, but for the most part, they loved Bob.  And they love him for one reason: Bob loved them.\n\nAs a result, Bob was trusted by administrators, parents, and students alike.  Students would often come and talk to him after school.  He was often alone with them, and many times over his twenty-six years, students, both male and female, had cried while he helped wipe their tears, offered a sympathetic ear, or a shoulder to cry on.\n\nThe closeness he had with so many would have been cause for alarm with most teachers.  After all, an aging man who has never married alone with young teenagers so often?  Surely something insidious was happening?\n\nBut there wasn't.  Not even a rumor.  Not even once.

Please, come in.  What can I do for you today?\"\n\n\"I need to talk to someone Mr. Johns.  I don't know who to go to.\"\n\nThere were tears in Suzette's eyes.\n\n\"Please, sit down,\" Bob said, handing her the box of tissue from his desk.\n\n\"What seems to be the matter?\"\n\nNo one knows what Suzette told Bob that day.  What is known is that Suzette and her little sister and brother went to Bob's house that evening and they went to live with foster parents that weekend.\n\nThat evening, Bob went to Suzette's parent's home after dropping her and her siblings at his own.  Like the conversation with Suzette, no one knows what was said.  Bob never spoke of it.  Not when he called the local sheriff, not when the sheriff arrived at the Terrence residence, not when he was booked into the system, not when he stood trial, and not when he went to prison.  \n\nThe papers reported on that evening.  The television news channels covered it. People burned up the local message boards with talk.  \n\nWhen the sheriff had arrived, Daniel and Linda Terrence had been found in their home, lying in the kitchen floor.  Their bodies had been cleanly decapitated.  A sharp carving knife was laid on the table, yet covered in blood.\n\nBob was calmly sitting on the sofa with blood on his light blue sweater whenever there sheriff arrived.\n\nThe process of decapitation had likely taken a while given the weapon used.\nAn autopsy would later show that they had been given a strong paralyzingly agent.  They'd been awake the entire time, but unable to move, unable to scream.  \n\nWhen searching the residence, the sheriff's department found videos and pictures.  The television news did not show clips.  The newspapers did not run the pictures.  The words\"Child Pornography\" were used often in the reports.  \n\nNo one could believe what had occurred, the crime that the Terrence's had been involved in.  And moreso, people of the small town could not reconcile the man they had known for so long with the brutality of the Terrence couple's death.  When asked by the news reporters, the sheriff only ever gave one statement:\n\n\"Beware the wrath of a gentle man.\"", "edited": 1492225019.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob was a quiet man.

I don&amp;#39;t know who to go to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were tears in Suzette&amp;#39;s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please, sit down,&amp;quot; Bob said, handing her the box of tissue from his desk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What seems to be the matter?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one knows what Suzette told Bob that day.  What is known is that Suzette and her little sister and brother went to Bob&amp;#39;s house that evening and they went to live with foster parents that weekend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That evening, Bob went to Suzette&amp;#39;s parent&amp;#39;s home after dropping her and her siblings at his own.  Like the conversation with Suzette, no one knows what was said.  Bob never spoke of it.  Not when he called the local sheriff, not when the sheriff arrived at the Terrence residence, not when he was booked into the system, not when he stood trial, and not when he went to prison.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The papers reported on that evening.  The television news channels covered it. People burned up the local message boards with talk.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the sheriff had arrived, Daniel and Linda Terrence had been found in their home, lying in the kitchen floor.  Their bodies had been cleanly decapitated.  A sharp carving knife was laid on the table, yet covered in blood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bob was calmly sitting on the sofa with blood on his light blue sweater whenever there sheriff arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The process of decapitation had likely taken a while given the weapon used.\nAn autopsy would later show that they had been given a strong paralyzingly agent.  They&amp;#39;d been awake the entire time, but unable to move, unable to scream.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When searching the residence, the sheriff&amp;#39;s department found videos and pictures.  The television news did not show clips.  The newspapers did not run the pictures.  The words&amp;quot;Child Pornography&amp;quot; were used often in the reports.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one could believe what had occurred, the crime that the Terrence&amp;#39;s had been involved in.  And moreso, people of the small town could not reconcile the man they had known for so long with the brutality of the Terrence couple&amp;#39;s death.  When asked by the news reporters, the sheriff only ever gave one statement:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Beware the wrath of a gentle man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg9gal9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492219788.0, "created_utc": 1492190988.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65adkg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8y2lr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Trowawaycausebanned4", "parent_id": "t3_65adkg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There's an old saying that goes:\n\n\u201cThere are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.\u201d\n\nA normal man would take that at face value.

As he waked down the hallway to the other side of his apartment, the corner of his eye caught something. It was the portrait of his deceased grandfather. With his mind still in a groggy state he just continued on his quest to relieve his bladder. As he was standing over the toilet his mind wondered to the portrait. He remembered that he always told him that a wise men must always fear only three things: the sea in a storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh how right you were.\u201d mumbled Chris to himself. As he walked back to his bedroom, past his grandfather, his mind recalled a memory from when he was just about 13 years old. He was sound asleep in his childhood bedroom and was out of nowhere woken up by his father \u201cChris, Chris, wake up! Chris!\u201d The child looked at his father and saw a worried face. \u201cThe cows got scared by something and they ran away. We need to go and get them.\u201d explained his father. Chris shot up from his bed, got dressed as quickly he could and followed his father outside. Both of them grabbed a flashlight on their way out and looked for clues for where the scared animals ran off to.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll evidence pointed to the forest right next to the patch of grass the cows were supposed to be. Father and son headed into the forest, on a night like the one they were supposed to fear. The only light came from the flashlight they were holding in their hands. Without hesitation, the young boy and his father entered the dark forest and followed the road the farm animals took. About 5 minutes in, the road split and so did the tracks left by the cows. Chris followed the road to the right and his father went straight ahead.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdrenalin was pumping through Christopher\u2019s heart as his only companion were the trees around him. As he followed the road and the cow prints on the ground, he heard a noise on his right side, he swiftly pointed the flashlight to the origin of the sound. However there was just a tree motionlessly standing. Chris shuck his head and continued deeper into the forest. The noises around him got \u00a0lauder and more frequent. His flashlight wasn\u2019t focused on the cow tracks, but on his surrounding. The combination of a forest and the moonless night made him scared and his focus was all over the place. He looked up into the air and for the first time since he was woken up realized that the moon was hiding.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was lying on his back and staring at the ceiling and remembering that night. Even 20 years later he could still feel the fear in his bones. \u201cWell there goes my sleep!\u201d he proclaimed lauder then he first intended. Chris stood up and made his way to the kitchen. Again he passed his grandfathers painting and once again he remembered what he always used to say. He tried to think of the book he once read about a ship caught in a storm.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was the HMS York. The ship set sail in an Indian port town and was supposed to go all the way to England. The queens ship was equipped by state of the art canons with the finest gun powder the British had in their arsenal and the captain and all the sailors were veterans of the sea. However all the weapons and all the years of experience between the crew has no effect on mother nature.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFour days have passed since their departure and unknowingly to anyone they would not make it to the 5th one. The storm came out of nowhere and it also disappeared as quickly as it came. It was like all the gods from all the religions in the world decided to unleash their power onto the HMS York. It was a bright day with just a few clouds that divided the sky. The captain was on the deck giving orders to his sailors, when out of nowhere a razor sharp wind appeared. Just a few seconds later, Poseidon and Zeus cursed the clouds and made them black with thunder raining upon the unsuspected Englishmen. A dread filled the hearts of the sailors below the thunderclouds. The wind, the thunder and the waves were enough to send the bravest man running in fear.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou only realise how small and unimportant you are when you are face to face with the power of a god. The waves hugged the ship and water was spilling into it, the lightning was dancing to the melody of death and even the prayers of all the sailors couldn\u2019t give them the courage to move and try to save the ship. There was over 400 years of experienced combined between them and every one of them stood still shaking in fear.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe sea swallowed the ship before the captain could even give his first order. The storm lasted only 20 minutes, but it was enough to destroy everything it encountered in its path. Out of the 45 sailors on the boat, only one of them survived. He was holding onto dear life, but he was experience enough to know that survival was not an option. He took his knife out and carved into the wooden plank he was holding on \u201cHere lie the remains of the HMS YORK. P.S. The sea is a fickle bitch!\u201d As he finished his message, he let go of the plank and accepted the deep abyss of the sea as his last resting place.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat was the third one?\u201d asked Christopher as he was making himself a midnight snack. \u201cOh, of course, it is the anger of a patient man. You know grandpa, you thought me many thing, but I never understood this one. Why would you be afraid of the anger of a patient man? However, I had to learn this one the hard way. Pops, I am a patient man and I am extremely proud of this, but \u00a0there is nothing more that I fear then when someone pushes me to the edge.\u201d Christopher eyes started to water and a few tears dripped from them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt has been two years since he last felt this fear and he promised himself this would also be the last time. It was just a typical day, he woke up, showered, ate breakfast, kissed his beautiful Maggie goodbye, went to work and came home. However everything that happened afterwards was anything but ordinary. As he opened the door he was greeted by a thrashed house, he ran inside and saw his wife in the living room having one of her mood swings. He tried to calm her down, but none of the usual tricks helped. She just kept screaming, crying and swearing at him. Her words still echo through his mind \u201cIT IS ALL YOUR FAULT!\u201d. This was the moment he for the first time felt the fear of an angry patient man.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe tried to unclench his fist, but her screaming just made it tighter and that is when all the fear, when all the anger was released in one swing. This was the first time he ever punched her or anybody else for a matter, but it wasn\u2019t the last. His anger was burning and nothing could have stopped him in this moment.

His massive form was shredded and bulging; straining against the bulk of food he was bringing to town (and the added weight of his daughter on the cart). It would have taken most men using an ox to pull that cart but Raj...well he's Raj.

When he got close enough to see his face I couldn't recognize him- his smile had melted away and a scowl twisted by rage had replaced it. His eyes which were normally filled with light and love were cold and inhuman, his beard normally well kept was twisted and wild.

As he closed the door the tall man walked down the stairs while checking his pocket watch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Lord wishes to pack his things alone, but he will join you afterwards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man showed way to the dining hall and pulled out a chair at one of the ends of the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you want any wine with the eggs, Sir?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The General nodded as the man poured.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If I may ask, how was the road down here, Sir?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There were...&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The General paused, closed his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;..issues. While on the ship we met a storm, large portions of the crew passed while it fought on, when we finally crossed we had a easy road. However, there were problems with some of my men. Such gullible people, they even thought that a moonless night meant trouble for us.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The General paused to laugh, and toasted to the man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;On the way we actually went through a village. The tavern was nice, cant remember the name though. The people there were scared of us, that&amp;#39;s what war does to you, but your Lord wont face those issues, he&amp;#39;ll be coming with us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And how did the village treat you, Sir?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man sat down at a fitting distance and looked at the General.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It treated me well, lots of taxes to collect you know. Do you know what happens to those who dont pay taxes, butler? Well, the married lot there looked terrible; rugged and loose. But the little ones....&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The General smiled and closed his eyes, remembering the screams some of them uttered. When he opened his eyes the man was out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No more of the wine, butler, it had an awful taste.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man sat down at the end of the table, folding his hands as he looked over at the General.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Quite so... it seems like I&amp;#39;ll have to travel into town later today. We&amp;#39;re out of rat poison, terrible thing these rats.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man pulled out a ring and put it on his right ring finger, the ring carried the sigil of the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Rats running around, ruining everything in its way. Disgusting creatures they are.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The General tried to move.

They adventured together, friends and comrades, loyal to one another until the end. Theirs was an unspoken accord, damn near a sacred creed. Lunas had spent so much time on her own, mourning those she'd lost, trying not to acknowledge the fact that she feared losing even more.\n\nThe way she'd lost Blair.\n\nHe'd been one of them. He'd fought fiercely, with a boisterous heart, a warmth that drew people to him, and a gentleness that kept them close. Lunas most of all. But he was tempermental, in spite of his intentions and better nature. She'd been warned of that. And she'd ignored the warnings. When it all came crashing down, and the jilted and fallen came for Blair's blood, Lunas had felt regret and embarassment, withdrawing from the debacle for her own survival. It broke her heart, and left her mourning yet again, with nobody to share the burden of her grief.\n\nShe found herself thinking of him as they sat over their brunch with their drinks, trying to ignore the empty place at the table and in her heart with her dry wit and appreciation for the others there.\n\nAnd then Blair walked in.\n\nHe didn't seem to notice them; if he did, he wasn't going to engage them. He made his way to the far end of the bar, alone, and he sat. Even now, after everything, there was a gentleness to him; he avoided those between him and the bar, clearly making apologies to others, smiling kindly at the barkeep. Others had accused him of such things being a false front; Lunas had never seen him as being false. But, she had to admit, her own bias might have gotten in the way, projecting onto Blair what she wanted to see, both in a dear friend, and in herself.\n\nAnders and Waren followed her sightline. Waren, for his part, drained his tankard and got to his feet.\n\n\"No,\" said Lunas, grabbing Waren by the wrist. \"Leave it be. We already got our justice. We already won. Why do anything more?\"\n\n\"Aw, just let me gloat a little.\" Waren sneered. \"I want to see how pathetic he's become. We stripped him, whipped him, and drove him out of town, remember? I want to see if he still has trouble walking. Besides, I need another.\"\n\nHe twisted out of her grip and ambled towards the bar. Lunas sat back. Discomfort roiled in her stomach. This was such a bad idea. She turned to Anders, who shrugged. He wasn't about to get up. He'd already done his part, said his piece, inflicted his damage a long time ago. He was content to let it lie. That sort of discretion is why Lunas had always had Anders' side, and why she'd chosen that one over Blair.\n\nBlair didn't turn to face the approaching Waren. The shaggy-haired veteran leaned over the bar to leer at the outcast.\n\nThe noise of the tavern swallowed what they were saying. Anders watched with concern. Lunas couldn't tear her eyes away.\n\nSuddenly, Waren bellowed. \"Gods curse you, answer me, you coward!\"\n\nThe tavern fell silent. All eyes turned to the bar.\n\n\"I've asked you once,\" came Blair's voice. It was crisp, and eloquent, as the bard had always been. But there was a coldness, too, a hardness that Lunas wasn't used to hearing. Steel was in that voice, in the man's spine. \"I won't ask again. Leave me be.\"\n\n\"Get out,\" Waren growled. \"You don't belong here. Anywhere near here. You are an outcast. So cast yourself out.\"\n\n\"I can live and go where I please,\" Blair replied. \"This land is free, last I checked. And you are neither constable nor adjudicator. You are not the law.\" His voice became more gentle. \"I want no further quarrel with you. Let the dead lay.\"\n\n\"How *dare* you sit there, like you're a person of worth, like you have a place here. You're not welcome here! You're not welcome anywhere! Begone!\"\n\n\"No.\" Blair finally turned to face Waren. His eyes, the blue of a sea about to be consumed by a storm, stared at the former comrade. \"Just because you say I am unwelcome does not mean I am worthless. Just because I refuse to engage in your petty short-sighted emotional goading does not make me a coward. And just because you want to make yourself look better by making me look worse does not make you the better man.\" His jaw tightened, as if he was holding back the fury that had once marked him as a traitor and monster, and he said the next very carefully, enunciating each word deliberately. \"Leave. Me. In. Peace.\"\n\nWaren roared, and swung with his mug. It was stoneware, heavy, and could crack a man's skull. But Blair was fast. He kicked back from the bar, his stool toppling under him, and he stayed on his feet, long limbs staying balanced. The bard grabbed the stool by the leg as it fell, and he swung it at the veteran, sweeping it to make a clear space. Waren was undeterred, and came at him again. Blair, now with the stool in both hands, shoved the seat towards the veteran. It was not as damaging a weapon as the mug, but it had reach. It caught Waren in the midsection, and the shaggy veteran exhaled a *whoof* of air. Blair backpedaled, then crouched, reaching out again with his improvised weapon, and got the rim of the seat past Waren's ankle, at which point he pulled the stool back towards him. Tripped, Waren fell on his ass, the mug clattering away. Blair stood.\n\n\"If I were what you say I am,\" Blair bellowed, unable to keep the heat from his voice any longer, \"I would kill you here and now, as you lay on your back with no means to defend yourself. But I am not what you said I am. What you see is not what you want to see, but the man I am now. I chose a new path. I chose to get better, do better, *be* better. And I am. And I do not give a single solitary rut if you believe that or not. Cling to whatever 'truth' you like; the *facts* are what matter.\" He removed a coin, and tossed it onto Waren's prone body. The veteran stared, confused, furious. \"Have one on me.\"\n\nGathering his cloak from where it had fallen, Blair tossed another coin at the barkeep - \"Apologies for the mess\" - and turned for the door.\n\nBefore she knew what she was doing, Lunas was on her feet, heedless of Anders reaching for her to stop her. A few quick strides brought her to face Blair, inches from the door. For a long moment, they stared at one another.\n\nFear shot through Lunas to her heart. She looked into his eyes. His frustration and anger were giving way to the gentleness she'd seen in him long before, a gentleness that had drawn them together, holding each other close at night, sharing each other's burdens of grief, celebrating one another's joys. She saw the torch burning in his soul. And, in spite of herself, embers of something within her own were stoked, turned over, sparked.\n\nHer voice trembled. \"It's good to see you, Blair.\"\n\nHe blinked. His throat clenched and unclenched in a nervous swallow. \"It's good to see you too, Lunas.\"\n\n\"Let me... let me buy you a drink.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"I'd like that.\" He looked to the bar, to the shape of Waren getting back to his feet. \"But now may not be the best time. Maybe if we meet again.\"\n\nShe followed his gaze. \"Let me talk to-\"\n\nWhen she turned back, he was gone.\n\nTears suddenly came to her eyes. Her hands clenched into fists.\n\nShe hated him all over again, yet longed to tell him how her choice had hurt her, too, and while she was uncertain if what she felt was true, if she could actually be on his side again, she was there, and she was listening, and she had *missed him*.\n\nHis voice lingered in her ears, as gentle as his damaged soul.\n\n*Maybe if we meet again.*\n\nShe bit her lip, and nodded.\n\n\"We will.\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anders, Lunas, and Waren spent several mornings like this, in one tavern or another, starting the day with bracing drinks and hot food.
