Wouldn't it be cool if this thing actually killed me!?\"\n\nGus shook the 8-ball again.\n\n*As I see it, yes*\n\n\"That's the spirit!\"\n\nGus examined the guillotine closely. The blade was raised and stationary.  Attached to the top portion of the blade a taut rope ran parallel to the apparatus and was attached again near the bottom. \n\n\"Seems pretty straightforward. Just gotta cut that rope with my head in the hole, right?\"\n\n*All signs point to yes*\n\n\"Excellent.\"\n\nGus stuck his head face-up into the hole.

Upon first contact, nothing happened. Not a single strand wavered. Gus looked at it for a second as his smile reversed polarity.\n\n\"STOP. BEING.

He thought better when his eyes were closed harder.\n\n\"Concentrate....Concentrate....Concentrate...What am I concentrating on?!\"\n\n*Ask again later*\n\n\"Dammit!\"\n\nLosing his patience, Gus let out a flurry of knife blows on the rope. Sawing, striking, stabbing. Whenever exhaustion set in, Gus hoped it'd be enough to kill him. \n\nIt never was. \n\nA few strands of the rope gave, but there was still no indication of the blade budging anytime soon. Out of breath, Gus stopped swinging and burst into tears of desperation.\n\n\"COME ON YOU PIECE OF SH-\" \n\n*shhhhhhhhhhhhhing!*\n\nWithout warning and faster than anybody could react, the blade (seemingly friction-less) dropped down onto his neck. It stopped without piercing the skin, with its full weight resting on his Adam's apple. \n\nGus was disappointed, to say the least. He sighed and laid there thinking with the blade causing him some discomfort. \n\n\"Maybe the blade's not sharp enough!\"\n\n*Better not tell you now*\n\nGus pushed the blade off his neck, awkwardly wriggled out and started towards a book nearby. \n\n\"Ah, another Bible. Definitely don\u2019t need another one of these.\"\n\nHe ripped out the pages and tried to slice them on the blade. The pages were cut effortlessly.\n\n\"This thing cuts paper, but it can't cut my neck!? Wait.... paper cut.

I haven\u2019t seen a single person outside today. Not, like, only five people have walked down the street. I mean I literally haven\u2019t seen anybody. I tried calling everybody I know and nobody answered. I tried calling the police and nobody answered. I tried turning on the TV and every channel was black. I got online for some news, but came up with *nothing.* In fact, every site I went to hasn\u2019t had a new comment since yesterday. I drove around for 6 hours today trying to find *somebody*. I didn\u2019t see a single person. Where is everybody!?\n\nGus read the passage again. Not a day goes by that he doesn\u2019t wonder why everybody on Earth disappeared, yet he remained, immortal. He still doesn\u2019t know why. \n\n&gt; Day 5. Still no people\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026 I went outside again hoping for a clue I missed. *Anything*. I didn\u2019t find anything, but I had an interesting experience falling down a flight of 30 concrete stairs\u2026 It wasn\u2019t graceful. I had no control. I landed at the bottom with the full weight of my body being pushed onto my head. I feel fine\u2026\n\nGus skipped ahead. He\u2019s lived all of this before and re-living it never helped.\n\n&gt; Day 365. It\u2019s been a year since everybody disappeared. I can\u2019t die. I don\u2019t know why, but everything I\u2019ve done ends the same way. I don\u2019t die. I stuck a gun to my head and pulled the trigger. A bullet came out and stopped before going through my skull. I jumped off the tallest building I could find. I got up and walked away afterwards without so much as a limp. I\u2019ve tried every possible thing I could think of to kill myself, but I can\u2019t die. I haven\u2019t wanted to be alive for a long time now.\n\nGus still wants to die. He skipped ahead randomly.\n\n&gt; Day 854. I decided to go to the library today.

Hopefully the other books are better.\n\nGus stopped reading. \n\n\u201cI need to stop looking back at this stuff. I\u2019m trying to consolidate human history into one ultimate collection. For who?

We ask that you remain orderly in the face of our eminent extinction.\nThankyou.\u201d\n\nAll I felt was coldness. It was quite warm in reality, but I was cold to the bone.\n\nIt was likely the reality that humanity was gone.\n\nIt had been a few months since it all started, but in that time, I had almost deluded myself to the truth.\n\nIt was all gone.\n\nEveryone.\n\nI then cried for god knows how long.\nBut after a while, I couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\nNo more tears would come.\n\nThat is when I began to realise my immortality.\nI was quite sure about this, as, according to my computer, I had gone without moving for 32 days.\nThis confused me greatly, as I\u2019m sure it would anyone. So I tested. \nMy first test included cutting my finger, which ended very uneventfully. My finger didn\u2019t even bleed, and I had made sure to cut it quite deep. The knife just opened the skin, and my skin seemingly closed itself.\nIt was sort of freaky, but I very quickly got over it as I grew more adventurous.\n\nIn the course of only a few weeks, my tests had gone from cutting bits of skin off and maybe a finger, to finally jumping off a building, blowing my brains out, impaling myself etc. etc.\n\nI wasn\u2019t suicidal, so I very quickly became bored of killing myself in various ways and then being magically fine in the next thirty or so seconds.\n\nSo that left me with a question.\nAssuming I was impervious to death and age, what was I going to do?\n\nI pondered this for days and weeks, simply planning out my life, which was remarkably hard, as there wasn\u2019t a definite end to it.\n\nBut a revelation came to me quite literally in the form of a knock on the head.\nI rubbed my head out of reflex, it didn\u2019t even hurt. But I looked down to see a book from the bookcase I was leaning against.\n\n\u201cHuh,\u201d I uttered under my breath. Using my voice actually surprised me, but I shook my head and chuckled at myself lightly.\n\nI picked up the book and flicked through the pages, totally uninterested in the contents of the book itself. I had read it before of course, and it was a pretty generic romance novel.\n\nAnd that was when it hit me.\n\nNot sure what it was inside of the romance novel that spurred that thought forward, maybe it was just the book itself.\n\nLiterature, Culture, History.\n\nAll things, through the passage of time, will inevitably disappear into nothingness.\nNot unless something immortal, and impervious to time dedicates themselves to the keeping of this information.\n\nAnd who else to do it but me?\n\nSo, from that point onward I set out on my own adventure to reclaim humanities knowledge. This didn\u2019t, of course, just pertain to physical books and such. No, I would capture all of humankind\u2019s existence. \n\nBut first, the books.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy task to complete. Not even a little bit.\nThousands of years spent scouring the earth for books. I had long since raided all the important places. Ancient texts that are so old that they put my age to shame.\nNot just that though, I had to build a place to put all the books.\nThat was a really bad time.\n\nAs someone who has a mind far detached from sciences and the like, completely learning all of humanities knowledge on the subject so that I could create a library able to store that many books in such a way that they won\u2019t degrade even after potentially hundreds of thousands of years was a nightmare.\nNot to mention that I had to make all the tools and machines to do so from scratch.\nIt took me a few thousand years after the initial time of locating the books and them storing them in the best conditions so that they could last long enough to then be moved again to where I had built my masterpiece.\n\nBy the way, the library I had built was absolutely glorious. \nIt had the ability to store three times what I needed.\n\nEven the tech I used to make it happen was somewhat revolutionary. If given enough time, you\u2019ll learn anything.\nIn any case, I had successfully stored all the literature that there was, which was much harder and more tedious that I make it sound, but I\u2019ll spare you the details.\n\nFrom that point onward, it was a matter of regaining the ability to access the internet and other such things.\nEssentially, I wanted to make a massive back-up of the internet.\nSound ridiculous? Good.\n\nBecause that is precisely what it was.\n\nLuckily, me learning some science and other tech stuff, I had become exceptionally versed in computer science, etc. \nFrom there I basically just tried to create the best storage I could.\nAlthough I was sure a lot of information had been lost from degradation and natural disasters, I pushed forward with the mentality that I may as well get as much as possible.\n\nWell, after a few thousand years of that, I essentially came to the conclusion that my struggles were silly.\nI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of it a few thousand years earlier, but I found out that it was more than likely that there was already multiple backups of the Internet in all of its glory in some storage drive in some bunker underground.\n\nAfter a did a few years or searching, I found it. And many others.\nSeems like all the countries liked to keep tabs on each other and the internet at all times. Though, I could imagine that there wasn\u2019t much they could do with the sheer amount of data.\nIn any case, I recovered the storage and continued to upload all of it to my newly created drives.\n\nAfter many hundreds of problems, I managed to reclaim the internet and everything else too.\nDark Web, political stuff between countries and all sorts.\nA lot of it was very disturbing. Not like the disgusting porn stuff, more like the sorts of things that were said between countries and deals that were made in the shadows.\nAfter reclaiming the internet, I found myself in awe of how expansive, and chaotic it truly was.\nBillions upon billions of pages, millions upon millions of hours of video and that was an incredibly conservative estimate. In fact, I would basically be lying to you if I told you it was only that much.\n\nBut I watched it all.\n\nI deleted a lot of it forever, into the void.\n\nMost of that was just horrific things. But I kept an open mind. I made sure to keep all things that weren\u2019t just senseless violence and the like.\n\nBut really, you\u2019d be surprised how little of that was truly relevant. I kept many things that had to do with criminal activity. \n\nFor example, a site that seemed to be intrinsically linked to human trafficking.\nI kept these things.\n\nBecause whoever went searching for this, deserved to know.\n\nOr maybe they didn\u2019t.\n\nI can\u2019t say I really thought it through that far.\n\nRegardless of that, I spent a truly uncountable amount of time reading, watching.\nBut one day I suddenly realised that the next button redirected me to a page I had already read.\nAnd the next page too.\nI had reached the end.\nThe true end of humanity.\nAll this knowledge would have been lost without me, and in the time I was recovering this knowledge, I realised that I had become attached to it all.\n\nI knew everything there was to know about humans and their pasts.\n\nI knew more that humans did about their own selves.\n\nI knew the past.\nBut now I have reached the future.\n\nI looked to the large door I can vividly remember making and pondered for a moment.\nBut I shook my head.\nNo, it wasn\u2019t time yet.\nI must wait.\nSo, I began to endlessly click \u201cnext page\u201d and flip though books.\nYears passed by and before I knew it I was starting to create myself.\nI was creating a future within these walls.\nTech beyond your wildest imagination. Things that could send me to other planets, maybe other universes.\nBut I stayed.\nI waited.\nAn immeasurable amount of time once again passed.\nI wasn\u2019t bored. Actually, I had somehow become unable to feel bored. Not sure why, but everything intrigued me. Even when I knew the answer to something , I would continue to analyse the thing that caught my eye.\nBut today I merely sat in a chair and read a book with one leg draped over the other. I wore fancy clothing that had become habit to wear. A nice grey vest with a white dress shirt underneath, along with matching grey dress pants. Nice shoes and an incredibly advanced watch that was undoubtedly more powerful than supercomputers from ages past.\nBut I simply sat in a comfy chair, facing towards the large door I had remade and improved many millions of times.\nI smiled lightly as I flipped through the pages, leaving nothing unread.\nI very quickly reached the end of the book that I held in my hands. What a shame, it was a good book too.\n\nBut it was then that the cogs of time started to turn once more.\n\n*Blip.*\n", "edited": 1492191441.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humanity rapidly becoming extinct was an unexpected event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Death came quickly to the human race, a Super Bug they called it.

I had read it before of course, and it was a pretty generic romance novel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that was when it hit me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure what it was inside of the romance novel that spurred that thought forward, maybe it was just the book itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literature, Culture, History.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All things, through the passage of time, will inevitably disappear into nothingness.\nNot unless something immortal, and impervious to time dedicates themselves to the keeping of this information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And who else to do it but me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, from that point onward I set out on my own adventure to reclaim humanities knowledge. This didn\u2019t, of course, just pertain to physical books and such. No, I would capture all of humankind\u2019s existence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But first, the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn\u2019t an easy task to complete. Not even a little bit.\nThousands of years spent scouring the earth for books. I had long since raided all the important places. Ancient texts that are so old that they put my age to shame.\nNot just that though, I had to build a place to put all the books.\nThat was a really bad time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As someone who has a mind far detached from sciences and the like, completely learning all of humanities knowledge on the subject so that I could create a library able to store that many books in such a way that they won\u2019t degrade even after potentially hundreds of thousands of years was a nightmare.\nNot to mention that I had to make all the tools and machines to do so from scratch.\nIt took me a few thousand years after the initial time of locating the books and them storing them in the best conditions so that they could last long enough to then be moved again to where I had built my masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, the library I had built was absolutely glorious. \nIt had the ability to store three times what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the tech I used to make it happen was somewhat revolutionary. If given enough time, you\u2019ll learn anything.\nIn any case, I had successfully stored all the literature that there was, which was much harder and more tedious that I make it sound, but I\u2019ll spare you the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From that point onward, it was a matter of regaining the ability to access the internet and other such things.\nEssentially, I wanted to make a massive back-up of the internet.\nSound ridiculous? Good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because that is precisely what it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, me learning some science and other tech stuff, I had become exceptionally versed in computer science, etc. \nFrom there I basically just tried to create the best storage I could.\nAlthough I was sure a lot of information had been lost from degradation and natural disasters, I pushed forward with the mentality that I may as well get as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, after a few thousand years of that, I essentially came to the conclusion that my struggles were silly.\nI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of it a few thousand years earlier, but I found out that it was more than likely that there was already multiple backups of the Internet in all of its glory in some storage drive in some bunker underground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a did a few years or searching, I found it. And many others.\nSeems like all the countries liked to keep tabs on each other and the internet at all times. Though, I could imagine that there wasn\u2019t much they could do with the sheer amount of data.\nIn any case, I recovered the storage and continued to upload all of it to my newly created drives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After many hundreds of problems, I managed to reclaim the internet and everything else too.\nDark Web, political stuff between countries and all sorts.\nA lot of it was very disturbing. Not like the disgusting porn stuff, more like the sorts of things that were said between countries and deals that were made in the shadows.\nAfter reclaiming the internet, I found myself in awe of how expansive, and chaotic it truly was.\nBillions upon billions of pages, millions upon millions of hours of video and that was an incredibly conservative estimate. In fact, I would basically be lying to you if I told you it was only that much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I watched it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I deleted a lot of it forever, into the void.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of that was just horrific things. But I kept an open mind. I made sure to keep all things that weren\u2019t just senseless violence and the like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really, you\u2019d be surprised how little of that was truly relevant. I kept many things that had to do with criminal activity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a site that seemed to be intrinsically linked to human trafficking.\nI kept these things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because whoever went searching for this, deserved to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe they didn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t say I really thought it through that far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of that, I spent a truly uncountable amount of time reading, watching.\nBut one day I suddenly realised that the next button redirected me to a page I had already read.\nAnd the next page too.\nI had reached the end.\nThe true end of humanity.\nAll this knowledge would have been lost without me, and in the time I was recovering this knowledge, I realised that I had become attached to it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew everything there was to know about humans and their pasts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew more that humans did about their own selves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew the past.\nBut now I have reached the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked to the large door I can vividly remember making and pondered for a moment.\nBut I shook my head.\nNo, it wasn\u2019t time yet.\nI must wait.\nSo, I began to endlessly click \u201cnext page\u201d and flip though books.\nYears passed by and before I knew it I was starting to create myself.\nI was creating a future within these walls.\nTech beyond your wildest imagination. Things that could send me to other planets, maybe other universes.\nBut I stayed.\nI waited.\nAn immeasurable amount of time once again passed.\nI wasn\u2019t bored. Actually, I had somehow become unable to feel bored. Not sure why, but everything intrigued me. Even when I knew the answer to something , I would continue to analyse the thing that caught my eye.\nBut today I merely sat in a chair and read a book with one leg draped over the other. I wore fancy clothing that had become habit to wear. A nice grey vest with a white dress shirt underneath, along with matching grey dress pants. Nice shoes and an incredibly advanced watch that was undoubtedly more powerful than supercomputers from ages past.\nBut I simply sat in a comfy chair, facing towards the large door I had remade and improved many millions of times.\nI smiled lightly as I flipped through the pages, leaving nothing unread.\nI very quickly reached the end of the book that I held in my hands. What a shame, it was a good book too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was then that the cogs of time started to turn once more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg9gdar", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492219877.0, "created_utc": 1492191077.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659kqy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8z8v2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SurreptitiousWicked", "parent_id": "t3_659kqy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yet another death at noon\r\n\nOne more child lost to moon\r\n\nCurious eyes,shut forever\r\n\nA sorrow tale without a teller\r\n\nMaybe for the remainder\r\n\nCould it be forever\r\n\nEven the sun shone dimmer\r\n\nHad Atlas shed a tear\r\n\nAs I slid the last one between the others", "edited": 1492164709.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another death at noon&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One more child lost to moon&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Curious eyes,shut forever&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sorrow tale without a teller&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe for the remainder&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could it be forever&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the sun shone dimmer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had Atlas shed a tear&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I slid the last one between the others&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg8z8v2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492193240.0, "created_utc": 1492164440.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659kqy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9a3s2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iopov", "parent_id": "t3_659kqy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't remember when I started commenting on my life like this, but it started before the apocalypse.

The weapon that destroyed the civilization, and almost the human race, evaporated everything in its sizable radius and left those who lived far outside of the cities to live and devolve into knowledge-less tribes or nomads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I went back to their real start, listened and watched. When I was finished and I had cataloged all of their people, knowledge, and history, I set the volumes in the library and became the Librarian of the Human Species. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgaasj8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492260450.0, "created_utc": 1492231650.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659kqy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbocp5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kunell", "parent_id": "t3_659kqy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "**Peace on a Blue World**\n\nHello there. Today I spent the morning sleeping.\n\nIt was a nice and sunny today so I decided to go lay on a grassy hill. I watched clouds swim by on the azure sky until I dosed off.\n\nI decided to go into town for a bit. I rode my bike because I hadn't finished repairing the car yet. Can't seem to find all the parts... and it took me a while to read the manual. Also there's no internet anymore so... \n\nY'know maybe one day I'll go fix that too. I'll probably need to fix the car first though so I can drive to one of the internet buildings or whatever they are called. Maybe will take me a few decades but I'm sure it will be worth it. I'll put that down on my list.\n\nThe road was covered in cracks with bits of grass poking through. Gray with green. I went to the grocery store to pick up some canned food. I don't really need it because my Father designed me to use photosynthesis but I like to taste things to remember.\n\nI grabbed a few tampons on the way out. \n\nI left a single quarter on the checkout desk. It wasn't really enough for the purchase but I liked to watch the pile of coins build up.\n\nI put the canned fish and toiletries in the basket and headed toward the library. Gotta get the flashlight out of my purse its dark in there. Maybe one day I'll go try to restart the power generators. Add that to the list.\n\nSurprisingly, these days I like to read nonfiction more. I like to learn about how things work. I'm studying up on mechanical engineering these days because if I wanna ever go anywhere, I'm going to need some robot friends to help me.\n\nI grabbed a few books and climbed up the bookshelf to where then sun shone through a crack in the ceiling. Don't worry, I already moved all the books away because the rain was ruining quite a few of them. \n\nI stayed up here for a few hours.\n\nI found a nearby cafe and went in. Vines were growing everywhere and small red mushrooms dotted the grassy floor. I went to poke around behind the counter a bit. Found some sugar, cinnamon and coffee beans. I already have a coffee maker at home so I left that. I used to want to bring everything home but then I realized I could just leave everything, the world was my personal closet now after all.\n\nI sat there reading and eating my canned fish. The tuna tasted pretty nice. \n\nNice and sweet. \n\nI fell asleep.\n\nI woke up crying. \n\nIt happened sometimes. People weren't made to be alone and sometimes you just had to let the loneliness flow. As the hiccups subsided I thought to myself, *maybe I should get a pet?* But those eventually died too so maybe a robot would still be better. Or I could study genetic engineering like my Father and make an immortal pet. I guess I'll add that to the list.\n\nI biked back to the hill to watch the sun set. A squirrel joined me at some point, but only stayed for like 5 minutes before going off to collect more nuts. I'll name him Gerald.\n\nThe stars glittered as always. Now that our world didn't sparkle at night anymore, the stars had a chance to really show off. I wondered if there were any people out there. I was the only one of Father's experiments to survive the plague, but I heard some people managed to run from it, off this world and into the darkness. Maybe one day they'll come back. Or I could build a rocket and go find them. I'll add that to the list.\n\nI biked back to my dark house and started up the generator. It raged and roared profanities into the darkness. I rather disliked the noise, but I needed the power. I played a bit of Command and Conquer on the computer. Apparently it was a really old game but it was the only one that ran without internet.\n\nI drew a hot bath and soaked a bit. Running a bit low on bath bombs, maybe I'll go try to find some more tomorrow.\n\nI turned off the annoying generator, lit a candle and went outside to my backyard letting the warm night wind dry me off. \n\nCrickets in the night. A thin stream splooshed around a bit, reflecting the half moon back in its own warped way. I like to think of the stream as a tortured artist, painting the world as it sees it.
