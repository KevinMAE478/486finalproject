Like the drops that fell from the sky, her insults slowly petered out as he marched away from his home.\n\nIt's been like this for weeks, Jeremy thought. He pulled his hoodie up to shield himself from the weather and walked along grey streets, running the events of the day over in his head. Charlotte was always shouting these days. Late for dinner? Told off. Wanted to fuck her in the middle of the week? Scolded. Wanted to go out with the guys for beers? The cold shoulder.\n\nJeremy seethed, thinking of how the girl he'd fallen in love with had grown into someone he had nothing in common with. Gone was the warmth of her embrace and the excitement she used to conjure in him. It had been replaced by a slow, almost glacial resentment that had worsened since their son was born.\n\nTheir son. Jacob. Jeremy had never seen anything so beautiful - but he'd also never met something so difficult. Diagnosed with ADHD, he was a handful and Charlotte had to quit her job to take care of him, which hadn't helped the situation.\n\nAs Jeremy stewed on his life, he narrowly avoided walking headfirst into a lamppost which stood up triumphantly from the concrete pavement. He cursed under his breath as he avoided it just in time, slamming his shoulder into it as he dodged. \n\nAnd then suddenly, he wasn't in the rain. \n\nJeremy blinked, still startled from being spun by the impact of the lamppost. Sunlight beat down on his skin and when his eyes opened, he could see a cloudless blue sky through brown tints. He brought a hand up to his face, feeling the sunglasses there. Then he quickly became aware that he was wearing nothing but swim shorts. \n\n\"What's wrong honey?\" came a velvet voice Jeremy had never heard before. He swung his head over, seeing sand stretching in a sprawl for miles and people lounging across one of the nicest beaches he'd ever seen. The source of the voice, a black woman with long hair tied up in a ponytail, lay on the lounger next to him. She wore a tiny white bikini and the hot sun only served to highlight the sunscreen that shone from her beautiful skin. \n\n\"Jeremy?\" she asked, tipping her sunglasses with a hand that shone with a large diamond engagement ring and revealed azure eyes that looked concerned. \n\n\"Uh...\" was all he could say. She reached over, her hand clasping his wrist. He watched, detached, as an alien touch embraced him. He saw a ring on his own hand. \n\"You okay baby?\" she asked. \n\nHe drank in the beach and the sight of this woman. Suddenly, his old memory seemed faded. Was the rainy day he'd escaped into to flee Charlotte even real? Had he been dreaming? \n\nNo. If he was, he'd know this girl's name.\n\nBut he did know it. She was called Samantha.\n\n\"Yeah...I'm fine, I think.\" he said softly. She swung her legs off the lounger and sat up, her hand rubbing his chest. He looked down at abs he'd never owned and raised an eyebrow. But it somehow all felt so right.\n\n\"We can always head home if you like. Not like it's much of a walk, huh?\" She giggled, then added a sultry: \"I'll give you that massage you like...\"\n\nJeremy awoke again. This time, he was clad in a military uniform and sat in a room with a woman who looked similar to Charlotte, but she was crying. He blinked again, trying to retrieve memories of the dark-skinned beauty he'd just been with.\n\nBut it didn't come. \n\nEvery time he tried to blink his memories back, Jeremy found himself in a new life. A new world. A new choice. And every time, he began to understand that he was seeing himself if he'd made different decisions. \n\nIt wasn't until he remembered his son coming to him at night, handing him a drawing and whispering \"I love you daddy\" that Jeremy understood something.\n\nHe'd only ever made the right choices. \n\nHis own life was the right one.\n\nAnd with that realisation, he returned to it. Charlotte was still shrieking at him when he opened the door, but Jeremy smiled at her.

The dreams\u2026\u201d the man started whispering, sagging to his knees. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother burst from my wife\u2019s grip, and embraced the man. Joyous tears welled up in her eyes, as her arms lost their strength, leaving her dead in her husband\u2019s arms, as she said, \u201cI waited all these years. I love you Richie\u2026 I knew you\u2019d be back.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at the two, coming to grips with how much they had loved each other. I feared the young man, no, my father might have a heart attack from how much he was shaking. I noticed beside the crumpled cigarette carton was a picture of my mother and her husband that had stood beside her nightstand all of these years. Hers was still in her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I needed to know what had transpired, but I was still reeling from the shock, too. We also had a funeral to plan\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife steadied me as she gave me the sweetest hug. We looked down at the two of them wondering where to go from here\u2026 ideas swirling around our heads as the unfathomable replayed in our heads.

The man in the room stopped his computer work and stood attentively. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell me what&amp;#39;s going on. Now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We think it&amp;#39;s in everyone&amp;#39;s interest, if you forget, and move on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Forget? Forget what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your daughter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What the hell is this? How do you know-?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Think about it Allen. You know she&amp;#39;s better off without you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was angry, &lt;em&gt;so angry&lt;/em&gt;, and crying. &amp;quot;But she&amp;#39;ll- I can&amp;#39;t just- She needs... I love her!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then let her go.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at them each, then the door, &amp;quot;I can fix this-&amp;quot; They grabbed me, and threw me into the chair. The last thing I remember is a needle in my arm, and shouting, &amp;quot;I love her! I love her! I love her!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up in a hospital. No one was there waiting. I wasn&amp;#39;t really surprised. The nurse said I had suffered amnesia. Thankfully I still knew who I was, and that I lived in an apartment and still remembered how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d have to figure out what it was I forgot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I need a smoke. &lt;em&gt;Boy&lt;/em&gt; do I need a smoke.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lucky&amp;quot; the nurse said, and pointed to a pack of Marlboros beside my bed. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the only thing you had on you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg7tx1c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492130910.0, "created_utc": 1492102110.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655i9j", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg91cm1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kagemoto", "parent_id": "t3_655i9j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hello my child, I have a story to tell.\nWhy I came home so late, bloody as hell.\n\nIt all started on that day.\nWhere I was on my way,\nto get a couple of cigs.\n\nI got hit by this weird looking arrow,\nIt hurt because so deep it burrowed.\n\nAfter I felt a burning pain,\nOther than my own blood that stained.\nMy wound was already gone,\nthen a weird guy named DIO showed up and told me I have a Stand.\nAnd he said I will be a slave for his master plan.\n\nHe creeped me out so I ran,\nwent so far and then,\nI got caught.\n\nFor so long I was a slave, battling weird battle everyday,\nUntil one day,\nThe weird guy named DIO died.\nAnd I was able to come home tonight.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello my child, I have a story to tell.\nWhy I came home so late, bloody as hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all started on that day.\nWhere I was on my way,\nto get a couple of cigs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got hit by this weird looking arrow,\nIt hurt because so deep it burrowed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I felt a burning pain,\nOther than my own blood that stained.\nMy wound was already gone,\nthen a weird guy named DIO showed up and told me I have a Stand.\nAnd he said I will be a slave for his master plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He creeped me out so I ran,\nwent so far and then,\nI got caught.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For so long I was a slave, battling weird battle everyday,\nUntil one day,\nThe weird guy named DIO died.\nAnd I was able to come home tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg91cm1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492199292.0, "created_utc": 1492170492.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655i9j", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9gbmo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Showandtek", "parent_id": "t3_655i9j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I woke up early this morning and walked to the shop around the corner for some donuts.
