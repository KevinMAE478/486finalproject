He had long ago lost his paddles and has since surrendered his flight path to the almighty river.

BEER ME.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, you asshole, here\u2019s your beer!\u201d\n\nChad grabbed the can, stood up in his canoe and started winding up for a pitch. The past ten years Chad had been the starting pitcher for a multitude of baseball teams. He liked the fast ball.\n\nKeith hadn\u2019t even noticed Chad was standing when an 80 MPH beer was hurled directly at him. Lucky for Keith, Chad\u2019s aim was off. Any other day and it would\u2019ve smacked him right in the face. But today, it bounced off the tube and re-directed it\u2019s trajectory towards the shore nearby. \n\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that\u2026?\u201d\n\nKeith still hadn\u2019t propped his head up to investigate, or even open his eyes, for that matter.\n\n\u201cIt was your beer!

After what can only be described as the least efficient method of moving a human through water, Keith arrived at the shore and grabbed the beer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s mud and sand and shit on the top.\u201d Keith dunked the beer in the water and started brushing it off. \n\n\u201cStill good, tho-\u201c\n\nWithout finishing his sentence, the can opened on its own accord. Keith was unfazed, with eyes transfixed on the top. \n\n\u201cDude, this can just-\u201c\n\n\u201cGET YOUR LIPS AWAY FROM MY FACE, BUSTER!\u201d A booming, cacophony of words seemed to swirl all around Chad and Keith.\n\n\u201cChad, what the fuck was that, an app or something?\u201d Keith\u2019s brain literally couldn\u2019t process anything.\n\n\u201cDude, I think it\u2019s the beer\u2026 Is there something in it?\u201d Chad looked concerned, but curious, nonetheless.\n\nWithout responding, Keith held his eye up closer to the can to catch a glimpse inside.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little dude in here.\u201d Keith unenthusiastically muttered.\n\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Chad\u2019s concern was growing.\n\nA tiny, balding, human head popped out of the top of the beer can. \u201cThat is correct! It is I! The Shitty Genie!\u201d\n\nKeith remained stoic, with unwavering eyes transfixed on a tiny, chubby man struggling to squeeze out of the can\u2019s mouth hole. After what seemed to be an eternity (with no help from Keith), the genie finally freed himself from the can.\n\n\u201cI live in shitty beer and grant a shitty wish! What would you like to wish for?\u201d\n\n\u201cInfinite wishes.\u201d Keith stated, without skipping a beat.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better than \u2018shitty.\u2019 I can\u2019t do that.\u201d The genie seems to have had this response scripted already.\n\n\u201cAlright, I wish that I can have my paddles back and that we can have some more beer.\u201d Keith suggested.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s two wishes, dumb dumb.\u201d The genie was attempting to wipe a stain off his plain white shirt.\n\n\u201cLook. Genie. Look\u2026.\u201d Keith wanted to say something, but he didn\u2019t know what yet.\n\n\u201cKeith, am I drunk, or did a genie just come out of your beer?\u201d Chad was no longer concerned.\n\n\u201cChad\u2026. Chadwick\u2026. Chadalamadingdong. You\u2019re not wrong.\u201d Keith was still thinking of what to ask for.\n\n\u201cLook, buddy. I\u2019m not a busy genie, but I don\u2019t really like interacting with drunk people all the time. Can we get a move on?\u201d \n\n\u201cI wish for\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe ears of genie and Chad both perked up.\n\n\u201cI want some pepperoni rondos.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is a \u2018rondo\u2019\u2026?\u201d The genie had no idea what to create for him.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like, a pizza, that\u2019s turned into a calzone, that\u2019s then formed into a cinnamon roll shape, but they\u2019re still pizza.\u201d Keith thought highly of his impromptu description.\n\n\u201cAlright\u2026. umm\u2026 here ya go!\u201d The genie pulled a little cooler from behind his back and opened it. \n\nKeith reached inside. His eyes displayed growing anticipation\u2014the first emotion he\u2019s portrayed since this interaction started. Prior to this wish being granted, not even the appearance of a magical genie removed the apathy from his sullen, drunken eyes.\n\n\u201cOh baby. Rondo time.\u201d Keith used his index finger and thumb to reach in and pull out the only thing he felt--a normal-sized pizza, topped with a calzone, topped with cinnamon rolls.\n\n\u201cKeith, I don\u2019t think this genie is capable of producing rondos.\u201d Chad started laughing at the ridiculous meal revealed before him.\n\nKeith had already started on the pizza--again, unfazed by the events that had just transpired before him. \u201cIt\u2019s better than not eating pizza, Chad.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, alright! Looks like my job here is done. Do you guys have any idea where I can find an AA meeting tonight?\u201d The genie apparently had no way of finding this information out on his own.\n\n\u201cUh, yea\u2026\u201d Chad pulled out his phone wrapped in a plastic bag and found a meeting tonight at a local church. \n\n\u201cCool. Smell ya later.\u201d The genie walked up the banks of the shore, into the trees, never to be seen again by Chad or Keith. The meal created by him was almost gone. Keith appeared to be in worse condition than before the genie arrived.\n\n\u201cDude! That was nuts! You just got a free meal from a genie! I tried recording him with my phone, but every time I focused on him a can of PBR appeared.\u201d Chad couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened.\n\n\u201cI need to lie down\u2026\u201d Keith muttered without any syllables. \n\n\u201cWhat? Did you say you need to lie down? You\u2019re laying down in a tube, floating down a river! You have been for like 4 hours!\u201d Chad was understandably confused.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 like, I need to *LIE. DOWN.*\u201d Without properly finishing his thought, Keith rolled off of his tube onto the shore. His tube floated away, as if it was trying to escape.\n\n\u201cShit, man. You alright? You need anything?\u201d Chad\u2019s concern crept back over his face.\n\nKeith\u2019s eyes were closed.\n\n\u201cIs there anymore beer?\u201d \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cChad, beer me!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keith was floating down a river in an inflatable tube.

What would you like to wish for?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cInfinite wishes.\u201d Keith stated, without skipping a beat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s better than \u2018shitty.\u2019 I can\u2019t do that.\u201d The genie seems to have had this response scripted already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAlright, I wish that I can have my paddles back and that we can have some more beer.\u201d Keith suggested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s two wishes, dumb dumb.\u201d The genie was attempting to wipe a stain off his plain white shirt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLook. Genie. Look\u2026.\u201d Keith wanted to say something, but he didn\u2019t know what yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cKeith, am I drunk, or did a genie just come out of your beer?\u201d Chad was no longer concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cChad\u2026. Chadwick\u2026. Chadalamadingdong. You\u2019re not wrong.\u201d Keith was still thinking of what to ask for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLook, buddy. I\u2019m not a busy genie, but I don\u2019t really like interacting with drunk people all the time. Can we get a move on?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI wish for\u2026.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ears of genie and Chad both perked up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI want some pepperoni rondos.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat the hell is a \u2018rondo\u2019\u2026?\u201d The genie had no idea what to create for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey\u2019re like, a pizza, that\u2019s turned into a calzone, that\u2019s then formed into a cinnamon roll shape, but they\u2019re still pizza.\u201d Keith thought highly of his impromptu description.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAlright\u2026. umm\u2026 here ya go!\u201d The genie pulled a little cooler from behind his back and opened it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keith reached inside. His eyes displayed growing anticipation\u2014the first emotion he\u2019s portrayed since this interaction started. Prior to this wish being granted, not even the appearance of a magical genie removed the apathy from his sullen, drunken eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh baby. Rondo time.\u201d Keith used his index finger and thumb to reach in and pull out the only thing he felt--a normal-sized pizza, topped with a calzone, topped with cinnamon rolls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cKeith, I don\u2019t think this genie is capable of producing rondos.\u201d Chad started laughing at the ridiculous meal revealed before him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keith had already started on the pizza--again, unfazed by the events that had just transpired before him. \u201cIt\u2019s better than not eating pizza, Chad.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, alright! Looks like my job here is done. Do you guys have any idea where I can find an AA meeting tonight?\u201d The genie apparently had no way of finding this information out on his own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUh, yea\u2026\u201d Chad pulled out his phone wrapped in a plastic bag and found a meeting tonight at a local church. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCool. Smell ya later.\u201d The genie walked up the banks of the shore, into the trees, never to be seen again by Chad or Keith. The meal created by him was almost gone. Keith appeared to be in worse condition than before the genie arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDude! That was nuts! You just got a free meal from a genie! I tried recording him with my phone, but every time I focused on him a can of PBR appeared.\u201d Chad couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI need to lie down\u2026\u201d Keith muttered without any syllables. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat? Did you say you need to lie down? You\u2019re laying down in a tube, floating down a river! You have been for like 4 hours!\u201d Chad was understandably confused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo\u2026 like, I need to &lt;em&gt;LIE. DOWN.&lt;/em&gt;\u201d Without properly finishing his thought, Keith rolled off of his tube onto the shore. His tube floated away, as if it was trying to escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cShit, man. You alright? You need anything?\u201d Chad\u2019s concern crept back over his face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keith\u2019s eyes were closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIs there anymore beer?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgdqj39", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476379.0, "created_utc": 1492447579.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vu38", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdr53v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "A-La-Mode", "parent_id": "t3_65vu38", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Little Samantha picked the dented can up off the kitchen floor.
