Centuries it had stood in Pisa, a sight for the eyes of millions of tourists every year. A monument of Italy's past, and now it was rubble, ruin, and dust.\n\nHe shook his head again. Maybe the tourism board would be able to keep people coming to see the ruins of the leaning tower. Maybe. \n\n\"A lot of work for us today,\" someone said, behind Niccolo. He turned and saw Giorgio, the head of the Clearing teams. \n\n\"Yes, Hard work, and a sad day.\" Niccolo hadn't particularly cared for the leaning tower when it had stood. but now that it didn't exist anymore, he was surprised at how much he missed it. \"At least no one got hurt, could you imagine the scandal?\" \n\nGiorgio sighed. \"What a thing to lose the Tower and a life in the same day.\" He paused, seeming to reach around for a few moments. \"But what a way to go.\" \n\nHe smiled with his yellowing teeth. \n\n\"Never in my life would I want to be famous for such a thing.\" Niccolo said. Death, even death by a hallowed monument from another century, was still death. \n\n\"Ah, well, you would never be famous for anything but for what a tower would do to you.\" Giorgio laughed. \n\nNiccolo spat at the ground in mock disgust, which made Giorgio laugh more. \"Come,\" said Niccolo, \"Let's see how the progress is going.\" \n\nThe duo walked from the steps of the visitor's center, which had been converted to the command center for the operation. Bulldozers and cranes were about the interior field around the rubble of the tower. \n\nIt had crumbled, more than fallen--the forces of gravity defeating the construction. Despite its failure, it had been able to withstand a respectable angle, which gave credit to the ancient builders. \n\nAnd the modern ones, Niccolo thought. Until he started working on the project, even he didn't know about the structural work done before the turn of the millennium. \n\nAmong the rubble, men in yellow jackets and white hard hats were stepping around, marking large pieces for the crane, leaving the rest for the bulldozers. The government wanted to preserve as much of the original material as possible for museum pieces or other kinds of archiving. There was even talk, though Niccolo thought it was crazy, of building another tower with as much of the original material as possible. \n\nNiccolo stepped up to a large slab of marble and felt the cool stone. He pulled his hand away and wiped the dust on his trousers. \n\n\"Such beautiful material,\" he said. \n\nThere was a cry from where the foundations were. Niccolo looked over at Giorgio and saw the foreman's face darken. The two ran over. \n\nWorkplace injuries were always bad, but moreover, they brought a bad feeling to the work site and where one happened, others would come. \n\nBut when they got to where the shouts originated, Niccolo could feel relief. No one had been hurt. \n\n\"Hey, what in the name of the virgin are you yelling about?\" Giorgio shouted. \n\n\"We found something, sir.\" One of the workers cried out.\n\n\"What?\" Giorgio said. A crowd of workers was beginning to gather to see what was happening. Giorgio clambered through the detritus to see what the worker was talking about. \n\nNiccolo followed, any annoyance at the work stoppage overridden by curiosity. \n\n\"God in heaven,\" Giorgio said, and crossed himself. Niccolo knew exactly what he was feeling. \n\nThe worker who had shouted at them was pointing into a hole, four or five meters wide. Sunlight seemed to be swallowed by it and that gave the impression that it went on forever, down into an abyss. \n\n\"How did you find this?\" Niccolo asked the worker. \n\n\"We were clearing rubble here and Antonio pushed a heavy slab,\" he mimed the action, \"and then there was a rumble and this hole appeared.\" \n\nNiccolo grabbed Giorgio. \"Giorgio, we're going to need to look under there to see if it's sound enough for you to keep working.\" \n\nGiorgio nodded. \"Okay, okay.\" He looked up. \"Clear the site!\" He shouted and started to wave the men away. \"You better have us back on the job today. It looks like we just got a little break.\" \n\nOnce the clearance teams were away, Niccolo brought in his structural team and a search group from the fire-department. Soon, they were harnessed and had lines dropping down into the hole. \n\nOne by one, Niccolo and his team rappelled into the darkness, bright torches on their hips throwing circles of light wildly around the shaft. According the how much rope they had thrown, the hole went down deep. \n\nThey landed and started to shine their lights all around. The shaft had gone on, and it had opened up into a cavern. Niccolo searched around with his own light, playing it on the rough walls and trying to make out the makeup of the roof. \n\nSo far, it seemed that the cave was stable, and it would hold for whatever they were doing above. but the shaft had been strange--how had the builders not known about it? \n\nAnd then Niccolo's light caught something, and he nearly dropped the torch as he crossed himself. \n\n___\n\nIt could feel a presence. Something within the cavern. That was new, for it had not felt any presence for a millennium.\n\nThat time had made it almost docile. That time had made it patient. Now, it began to squirm and writhe and pull against its tethers. \n\n___\n\nThe floodlights they brought illuminated the face of a huge cathedral. It was similar to the one above, but decidedly more gothic and more brutal--with black stone and grimacing and spiteful gargoyles. \n\nEven more, it had a set of huge doors, maybe fifteen or twenty meters in height, carved all over with demons and images of fires and battles. \n\nLooking at it made Niccolo anxious.  \n\nBut when he looked at a drawing of the grounds, and had approximated where this huge facade was, it had been under where a lot of the top of the tower had fallen, and that meant they'd need to inspect it to see if there were any other weakness to be found. \n\nBut where had this building come from? Niccolo hope someone could answer him eventually. But first he had a job to do. \n\nThey had tried the doors, but as Niccolo had thought, they hadn't moved much. So he'd had a winch lowered. A team had set it up, looping the hooks through great iron rings that made for handles. \n\n\"The winch is ready, Niccolo.\" Called one of the workers, who gave a thumbs up showing that the space was all clear. \n\nNiccolo stepped back behind a small barrier and gave his own thumbs up and the work started the engine. The roar of the winch filled the cavern, echoing and seeming louder than anything Niccolo had heard in his life. The noise seemed to take on an unearthly growl to it and made Niccolo's stomach turn. \n\nAs the winch picked up slack and the chain grew taught, Niccolo began to have the feeling that something very bad as about to happen. \n\n___ \n\nCacophony. \n\nIt thrashed at the noise. Struggling in its bindings. It screamed, trying to displace the noise with his own.\n\nAnd then he felt pulling, as if the binding were being tugged at and it was being strangled with it. It bit and fought and finally it started to run at the walls of its prison. \n\nIt rammed against the door, again and again, willing the stretching and pulling to stop. \n\n___\n\nThe winch shook and Niccolo could hear its squeal as it fought to open the large door. Niccolo had a suspicion that the things were locked, but there had been no keyhole, no mechanism by which the door could be locked from the outside. \n\nAnd there was no way it could have been locked from within, could it? Who would have been in there, if that had been the case? \n\nNiccolo shivered, as the winch bucked again. \n\n___\n\nSomething was weakening the bindings. It could feel that, as if the stretching and pulling had loosened them, and allowed it to move more freely. \n\nWhere it had wanted the feeling to stop, it now wanted to continue. It saw freedom, liberation from the bonds of injustice. If only the pulling continued for a little bit more. \n\nIt had started to ram the door out of a wild, manic need for the pain to stop. Now, it ran against the door, rabid with the taste of freedom. \n___\n\nThe winch bucked again, and then there was a cracking noise that turned into a thunderclap. Niccolo ducked down farther and held his hands over his ears. The cavern echoed with the sound for what seemed like forever.\n\nAfter a few moments, Niccolo finally pulled his hand from his ears, and realized that the only sound was the winch engine as it tried to collect more chain. The sound seemed a lot damper now, and didn't echo the way it had earlier. \n\nThat was strange. \n\nHe looked over the barrier and saw one of the large doors, ripped from its hinges and laying on the floor of the cavern. Despite its treatment, it looked completely whole. \n\nAround him others began to peek out from their own barriers or around the corner of rocks. Niccolo picked up a torch and pointed it into the opening. Just as that shaft, the light seemed to be swallowed by the darkness. \n\nHe walked forward, taking cautious steps. A few other flashlights and workers joined him as he stepped forward. \n\nHe reached the top of the door, and the light flickered and turned off. Pieced of junk, he thought. He slapped the side of the light until it flickered back on. He arrived at the threshold and peered into the darkness. The solitary beam of light did little to help. \n\nHe was able to make out smooth walls around the chamber. It seemed completely empty, and not even as carved or intricate as the facade which they had encountered. \n\nHe took a step across the threshold, his boot landing on smooth stone. He thought he could see something in the center of the room and moved his light to it. It had the look of an altar, like the one in St. Peter's. \n\nNiccolo took a step toward it. His light flickered again, and he was vaguely aware that he was falling, but that he could see his torso and his legs while he did so. \n\nStrange, he thought, before the world went black. \n\n___\n\n*Thanks for reading! /r/chrisbryant*", "edited": 1491998731.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Niccolo shook his head in disbelief at the ruin of the Tower.

Death, even death by a hallowed monument from another century, was still death. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah, well, you would never be famous for anything but for what a tower would do to you.&amp;quot; Giorgio laughed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Niccolo spat at the ground in mock disgust, which made Giorgio laugh more. &amp;quot;Come,&amp;quot; said Niccolo, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s see how the progress is going.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The duo walked from the steps of the visitor&amp;#39;s center, which had been converted to the command center for the operation. Bulldozers and cranes were about the interior field around the rubble of the tower. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had crumbled, more than fallen--the forces of gravity defeating the construction. Despite its failure, it had been able to withstand a respectable angle, which gave credit to the ancient builders. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the modern ones, Niccolo thought. Until he started working on the project, even he didn&amp;#39;t know about the structural work done before the turn of the millennium. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Among the rubble, men in yellow jackets and white hard hats were stepping around, marking large pieces for the crane, leaving the rest for the bulldozers. The government wanted to preserve as much of the original material as possible for museum pieces or other kinds of archiving. There was even talk, though Niccolo thought it was crazy, of building another tower with as much of the original material as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Niccolo stepped up to a large slab of marble and felt the cool stone. He pulled his hand away and wiped the dust on his trousers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Such beautiful material,&amp;quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a cry from where the foundations were. Niccolo looked over at Giorgio and saw the foreman&amp;#39;s face darken. The two ran over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Workplace injuries were always bad, but moreover, they brought a bad feeling to the work site and where one happened, others would come. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when they got to where the shouts originated, Niccolo could feel relief. No one had been hurt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, what in the name of the virgin are you yelling about?&amp;quot; Giorgio shouted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We found something, sir.&amp;quot; One of the workers cried out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; Giorgio said. A crowd of workers was beginning to gather to see what was happening. Giorgio clambered through the detritus to see what the worker was talking about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Niccolo followed, any annoyance at the work stoppage overridden by curiosity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;God in heaven,&amp;quot; Giorgio said, and crossed himself. Niccolo knew exactly what he was feeling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worker who had shouted at them was pointing into a hole, four or five meters wide. Sunlight seemed to be swallowed by it and that gave the impression that it went on forever, down into an abyss. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How did you find this?&amp;quot; Niccolo asked the worker. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We were clearing rubble here and Antonio pushed a heavy slab,&amp;quot; he mimed the action, &amp;quot;and then there was a rumble and this hole appeared.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Niccolo grabbed Giorgio. &amp;quot;Giorgio, we&amp;#39;re going to need to look under there to see if it&amp;#39;s sound enough for you to keep working.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Giorgio nodded. &amp;quot;Okay, okay.&amp;quot; He looked up. &amp;quot;Clear the site!&amp;quot; He shouted and started to wave the men away. &amp;quot;You better have us back on the job today. It looks like we just got a little break.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the clearance teams were away, Niccolo brought in his structural team and a search group from the fire-department. Soon, they were harnessed and had lines dropping down into the hole. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One by one, Niccolo and his team rappelled into the darkness, bright torches on their hips throwing circles of light wildly around the shaft. According the how much rope they had thrown, the hole went down deep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They landed and started to shine their lights all around. The shaft had gone on, and it had opened up into a cavern. Niccolo searched around with his own light, playing it on the rough walls and trying to make out the makeup of the roof. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far, it seemed that the cave was stable, and it would hold for whatever they were doing above. but the shaft had been strange--how had the builders not known about it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then Niccolo&amp;#39;s light caught something, and he nearly dropped the torch as he crossed himself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could feel a presence. Something within the cavern. That was new, for it had not felt any presence for a millennium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That time had made it almost docile. That time had made it patient. Now, it began to squirm and writhe and pull against its tethers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The floodlights they brought illuminated the face of a huge cathedral. It was similar to the one above, but decidedly more gothic and more brutal--with black stone and grimacing and spiteful gargoyles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even more, it had a set of huge doors, maybe fifteen or twenty meters in height, carved all over with demons and images of fires and battles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at it made Niccolo anxious.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when he looked at a drawing of the grounds, and had approximated where this huge facade was, it had been under where a lot of the top of the tower had fallen, and that meant they&amp;#39;d need to inspect it to see if there were any other weakness to be found. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But where had this building come from? Niccolo hope someone could answer him eventually. But first he had a job to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had tried the doors, but as Niccolo had thought, they hadn&amp;#39;t moved much. So he&amp;#39;d had a winch lowered. A team had set it up, looping the hooks through great iron rings that made for handles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The winch is ready, Niccolo.&amp;quot; Called one of the workers, who gave a thumbs up showing that the space was all clear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Niccolo stepped back behind a small barrier and gave his own thumbs up and the work started the engine. The roar of the winch filled the cavern, echoing and seeming louder than anything Niccolo had heard in his life. The noise seemed to take on an unearthly growl to it and made Niccolo&amp;#39;s stomach turn. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the winch picked up slack and the chain grew taught, Niccolo began to have the feeling that something very bad as about to happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cacophony. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It thrashed at the noise. Struggling in its bindings. It screamed, trying to displace the noise with his own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then he felt pulling, as if the binding were being tugged at and it was being strangled with it. It bit and fought and finally it started to run at the walls of its prison. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It rammed against the door, again and again, willing the stretching and pulling to stop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The winch shook and Niccolo could hear its squeal as it fought to open the large door. Niccolo had a suspicion that the things were locked, but there had been no keyhole, no mechanism by which the door could be locked from the outside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there was no way it could have been locked from within, could it? Who would have been in there, if that had been the case? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Niccolo shivered, as the winch bucked again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something was weakening the bindings. It could feel that, as if the stretching and pulling had loosened them, and allowed it to move more freely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where it had wanted the feeling to stop, it now wanted to continue. It saw freedom, liberation from the bonds of injustice. If only the pulling continued for a little bit more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had started to ram the door out of a wild, manic need for the pain to stop. Now, it ran against the door, rabid with the taste of freedom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The winch bucked again, and then there was a cracking noise that turned into a thunderclap. Niccolo ducked down farther and held his hands over his ears. The cavern echoed with the sound for what seemed like forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few moments, Niccolo finally pulled his hand from his ears, and realized that the only sound was the winch engine as it tried to collect more chain. The sound seemed a lot damper now, and didn&amp;#39;t echo the way it had earlier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was strange. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He looked over the barrier and saw one of the large doors, ripped from its hinges and laying on the floor of the cavern. Despite its treatment, it looked completely whole. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around him others began to peek out from their own barriers or around the corner of rocks. Niccolo picked up a torch and pointed it into the opening. Just as that shaft, the light seemed to be swallowed by the darkness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He walked forward, taking cautious steps. A few other flashlights and workers joined him as he stepped forward. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He reached the top of the door, and the light flickered and turned off. Pieced of junk, he thought. He slapped the side of the light until it flickered back on. He arrived at the threshold and peered into the darkness. The solitary beam of light did little to help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was able to make out smooth walls around the chamber. It seemed completely empty, and not even as carved or intricate as the facade which they had encountered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He took a step across the threshold, his boot landing on smooth stone. He thought he could see something in the center of the room and moved his light to it. It had the look of an altar, like the one in St. Peter&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Niccolo took a step toward it. His light flickered again, and he was vaguely aware that he was falling, but that he could see his torso and his legs while he did so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strange, he thought, before the world went black. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for reading! &lt;a href=\"/r/chrisbryant\"&gt;/r/chrisbryant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5rcy0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492026754.0, "created_utc": 1491997954.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x1zt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x1zt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5z1ha", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wamblytomato", "parent_id": "t1_dg5r4bd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As an Italian pizza lover, I must say that such a factory would indeed be considered the source of all evil.\n\nTerrifying toppings aside, nice entry :D", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an Italian pizza lover, I must say that such a factory would indeed be considered the source of all evil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Terrifying toppings aside, nice entry :D&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5z1ha", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492037811.0, "created_utc": 1492009011.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5r4bd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DozenFlippers", "parent_id": "t3_64x1zt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The source of all evil.

I do research all over the world and I was in Italy then and I wonder if that was by accident or by... Well, let's get on with the story first.\n\n\nI entered the cavern, for it was a cavern. A great abyss gaped in the Earth. White marble braced its insides, but near the surface it was almost a fissure. The scent of the centuries came forward. I was excited. My field is the early 1000's, the Renaissance of the Middle Ages, and up to the 17th century. The tower was completed in the late 14th century, about fifty years from the destructive plague of 1315 to 1317. \n\n\nI inhaled deeply and wondered if this was how it smelled then. An old scent, unclean and bitter. Was this the smell of death? Of hopelessness? You can study everything about the past, but you can never smell it. You can never live it.\n\n\nI took all the chances. I did not care for the danger. Above the cavern in the 21st century, people were crying. The sound of scared children and mournful wives were too much. I entered into this new world. Though I mourned the tragedy, I was glad for this opportunity.\n\n\nInside I descended quickly. I was alone for it was unsafe. The policemen above quickly disappeared and then it was myself and my light and the mystery of the dark. I walked a long cave. There had been steps that helped me climb down, steps cut into the Earth. Then I walked forward in a great tunnel. This tunnel existed in no maps.\n\n\nThe walls were marble and white and pure. They could have been built today. The sound of an ocean echoed and then I heard a bell. It rang deep in the cave, shaking my heart and I faltered. I was not a man who believed in ghosts then, and so I was terrified. My mind made leaps to explain the bell.\n\n\n*It is from above,* I thought. *Maybe a pipeline.*\n\n\nBut then there was laughter. \n\n\nThe cave went deeper and deeper and the scent of something bitter grew stronger and stronger. A glow had come, a faint light that was amber, and it came all around. I no longer needed my light. The air was filled with the moisture of the dead. A thickness that I cannot describe in any other way. A dread fell over me but I could not go back. \n\n\nAn organ began to play far away. The cave was now a hall and as I walked forward I came to a door. A plaque was fitted there, an old thing and it looked as though it was not meant to be placed there.\n\n\n*Gerado* it said. Nothing more. Crudely carved, and falling apart. *Gerado*.\n\n\nIt struck me for it was close to my name. \n\n\n*Gerald. Gerado.*\n\n\nThe door was masterful as the Tower was and it was ajar and the music was coming from within. \n\n\nI entered and then I was in a cave again and the floor was black Earth and the walls were a ruined marble work with dirt falling from its walls and its splendor slowly eroding. A man stood there. He looked like me. He stood and stared at me and he was old, deathly old, and he had to be dead.\n\n\nHe sung softly, ignoring me. He sung in the early Italian of his time in the 14th century. The words escaped me but it was sad and sorrowful. Then he played his organ which was derelict and tuneless. He was a sad man and his hopelessness touched me profoundly.\n\n\nThen he spoke and I understood his words.\n\n\n\"My tower,\" he said. \n\n\nWas it me he was speaking to? He seemed to not notice I was there.\n\n\n\"My tower. My work. My life. Failing. Failing. Failing and gone. My work. My life. Goning and done.\"\n\n\nDid he know it had fallen?\n\n\nHe saw me then and his eyes lit up. He was afraid as if I were the ghost. He made the sign of the cross.\n\n\n\"Gerado!\" he screamed. \"Gerado! In Christ's name I bless thee. You are a spirit. A holy spirit!\"\n\n\nI was deathly afraid.\n\n\n\"I-I... You are a spirit. I am Gerald.\"\n\n\nAnd he cowered and the ground shook and the walls crumbled.\n\n\n\"No! No! Gerado? Gerado, yes? Me? You are me?\"\n\n\nSo I had to lie, though I wonder if I really did.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\nAnd he laughed and was bright and his age seemed to fall away.\n\n\n\"The Tower! Our Tower. We are saint then? Our Tower has pleased God and man? We have lived forever then? Canonized? People know our name yes? Gerado di Gerado?\"\n\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\nHe was relieved. The world was crumbling. He walked to me and rest his ancient hand on my shoulder.\n\n\n\"I am afraid of death,\" he said. \"So very afraid. But thee has come and is a sign from the Lord. We will not die. The darkness is but an illusion. The Tower will stand forever, no? Our name will live in eternity. I have nothing but this. I thank thee for coming.\"\n\n\nI wanted to speak but the feeling was going and my body was numb. A bell tolled above as though we were in a cathedral somewhere and its ringing was fading.\n\n\n\"Mass, yes?\" Gerado said.\n\n\nHe walked away and headed for the door. He turned and spoke once more.\n\n\n\"My life went into this. You are young from the light of Christ. I am still mortal. I am old. My life has gone into this Tower. Long have I spent, fearful of its fall. Of its demise. Its structure worries me. Even death must wait for this is my life's goal.\"\n\n\n\"Don't worry,\" I said. \"The Tower will never fall. It will stand straight forever until the day of Judgment.\"\n\n\nHe bowed and smiled a toothless grin.\n\n\n\"Then I will pray and die in peace,\" he said.\n\n\nAnd he was gone.\n\n\nThe trip back was claustrophobic. As I emerged from the abyss I was hounded by medics and officials. Why had I taken so long? Why did I not respond? Where was I?\n\n\nI told them about the tunnel and they were incredulous. They flashed their lights in the abyss and it was only forty or so feet deep. A hole full of remnants from a loose foundation. The smell of broken and burnt concrete and marble came and there was nothing else within. The crying of the 21st century surrounded me.\n\n\n\"I must have hallucinated,\" I said.\n\n\nI wondered of the mourning of that world long past. \n\n\n*Gerado,* I thought.", "edited": 1491998034.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was the first to go down.

It rang deep in the cave, shaking my heart and I faltered. I was not a man who believed in ghosts then, and so I was terrified. My mind made leaps to explain the bell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is from above,&lt;/em&gt; I thought. &lt;em&gt;Maybe a pipeline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then there was laughter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cave went deeper and deeper and the scent of something bitter grew stronger and stronger. A glow had come, a faint light that was amber, and it came all around. I no longer needed my light. The air was filled with the moisture of the dead. A thickness that I cannot describe in any other way. A dread fell over me but I could not go back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An organ began to play far away. The cave was now a hall and as I walked forward I came to a door. A plaque was fitted there, an old thing and it looked as though it was not meant to be placed there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gerado&lt;/em&gt; it said. Nothing more. Crudely carved, and falling apart. &lt;em&gt;Gerado&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It struck me for it was close to my name. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gerald. Gerado.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The door was masterful as the Tower was and it was ajar and the music was coming from within. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I entered and then I was in a cave again and the floor was black Earth and the walls were a ruined marble work with dirt falling from its walls and its splendor slowly eroding. A man stood there. He looked like me. He stood and stared at me and he was old, deathly old, and he had to be dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sung softly, ignoring me. He sung in the early Italian of his time in the 14th century. The words escaped me but it was sad and sorrowful. Then he played his organ which was derelict and tuneless. He was a sad man and his hopelessness touched me profoundly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he spoke and I understood his words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My tower,&amp;quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was it me he was speaking to? He seemed to not notice I was there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My tower. My work. My life. Failing. Failing. Failing and gone. My work. My life. Goning and done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did he know it had fallen?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He saw me then and his eyes lit up. He was afraid as if I were the ghost. He made the sign of the cross.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gerado!&amp;quot; he screamed. &amp;quot;Gerado! In Christ&amp;#39;s name I bless thee. You are a spirit. A holy spirit!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was deathly afraid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I-I... You are a spirit. I am Gerald.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he cowered and the ground shook and the walls crumbled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No! No! Gerado? Gerado, yes? Me? You are me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I had to lie, though I wonder if I really did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he laughed and was bright and his age seemed to fall away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Tower! Our Tower. We are saint then? Our Tower has pleased God and man? We have lived forever then? Canonized? People know our name yes? Gerado di Gerado?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was relieved. The world was crumbling. He walked to me and rest his ancient hand on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am afraid of death,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;So very afraid. But thee has come and is a sign from the Lord. We will not die. The darkness is but an illusion. The Tower will stand forever, no? Our name will live in eternity. I have nothing but this. I thank thee for coming.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to speak but the feeling was going and my body was numb. A bell tolled above as though we were in a cathedral somewhere and its ringing was fading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mass, yes?&amp;quot; Gerado said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He walked away and headed for the door. He turned and spoke once more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My life went into this. You are young from the light of Christ. I am still mortal. I am old. My life has gone into this Tower. Long have I spent, fearful of its fall. Of its demise. Its structure worries me. Even death must wait for this is my life&amp;#39;s goal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;The Tower will never fall. It will stand straight forever until the day of Judgment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He bowed and smiled a toothless grin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then I will pray and die in peace,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trip back was claustrophobic. As I emerged from the abyss I was hounded by medics and officials. Why had I taken so long? Why did I not respond? Where was I?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told them about the tunnel and they were incredulous. They flashed their lights in the abyss and it was only forty or so feet deep. A hole full of remnants from a loose foundation. The smell of broken and burnt concrete and marble came and there was nothing else within. The crying of the 21st century surrounded me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I must have hallucinated,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wondered of the mourning of that world long past. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gerado,&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg5r2yt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492026166.0, "created_utc": 1491997366.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x1zt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5tvtc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rarelyfunny", "parent_id": "t3_64x1zt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He would have preferred it if the bloody Tower had the decency to keel over during the warmer summer months, or at the very least, during the day, so that he wouldn\u2019t be hampered by the darkness which cloaked the skies.

It seemed to him a particularly crass way of aspiring to something bigger than themselves, the same way sports fans often wore the same jerseys as their heroes.\n\nThe other teams chimed in rapidly, and Carl momentarily relaxed. A total of six Council agents were onsite tonight, and used as he was to undertaking missions on his own, this was surely going to be a walk in the park. \n\n\u201cHow sure is the Council that there\u2019s really a portal underneath?\u201d said Cherie, rubbing her hands together. \u201cAnd why are we bringing down the Tower with a controlled detonation again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho knows? It\u2019s been centuries since the portal was sealed, and even our records don\u2019t fully provide the parameters of the spell. Our best guess is that it may still be active, which is why we\u2019re here. And as for bringing the Tower down\u2026 think of it as us deciding when to rip the plaster off a wound, instead of leaving it to dangle and fall off on its own.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if the portal\u2019s still active?\u201d\n\n\u201cBest case, whatever we trapped inside, stays inside.\u201d\n\nCarl opted not to explore the less optimistic outcomes, but in truth, there was no real need to. Cherie was young, but she had displayed a certain open-mindedness which made her a natural fit for a go-between the Council and the Tame governments. Her training would already have required her to study in close detail the various demonic outbreaks for at least the last few centuries, so that she would better appreciate the work the Council did. \n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s bad, are six of you enough?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s never enough, thought Carl, as he lit up and took a heavy drag. Cherie coughed briefly as the fumes streamed her way. She shook her head, rejecting his proffered packet.\n\n\u201cPortals used to be the method of choice for sealing the larger demons we had trouble putting down,\u201d said Carl, changing subjects as subtly as he could. \u201cIt was seen as more efficient. Construct a parallel world similar to ours, lure them in, close the exit.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018used to be\u2019. What changed?\u201d\n\n\u201cWear and tear, mostly,\u201d said Carl, gesturing with his chin towards the Tower. \u201cThe seals are powered largely by leeching excess lifeforce from the environment, which is why so many of the portals are located in areas of heavy human concentration. That doesn\u2019t mean the brick and mortar components of the seals don\u2019t erode over time though, and when they do, the seals invariably weaken.\u201d\n\nCherie thought for a moment. \u201cIs that why the Taj Mahal was closed off to the public a few years ago?\u201d\n\nCarl grinned. He generally did not like other people much, but there was a certain impish intelligence to Cherie which reminded him of his grandmother. \u201cYou can say that. That was one of the larger portals, we had eight council members there full-time while restoration works were carried out.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo whatever is trapped under the Tower, it\u2019s weaker cause there\u2019s only six of you here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would have more if we could, but there\u2019s good work to be done everywhere, right?

A ball of flame grew hungrily on the roof of the nearby cathedral, as it sputtered and lit up the horizon. The glyphs facing the cathedral came to life immediately, brimming brightly with energy, ready to serve out their function.\n\nCarl and Cherie broke into a run, heading directly for the cathedral.
