He never talked about any of this before then suddenly he's a pile of ashes!\"\n\nJonathan immediately handed over a box of tissues, which he had readily available. \n\n\"Lack of communication is *the* biggest problem in any undead relationship ^\u2020 , mrs. von Hauptszoll.\" explained Jonathan \"I've seen entire zombie families quite literally torn apart because of it. Sometimes the heart, or what's left of it, doesn't manage to find the words that it wants to say and lets them float among silence until the problem feel too big to handle with just words.

Perhaps I should let him have some space in the afterlife and then he'll come back?\" \n\n\"To be perfectly honest with you, it is very difficult to say without having both of you in the office at the same time. And quite frankly, the afterlife is not my area of expertise. I'm not entirely sure what help I could offer here for the both of you.\" \n\nJonathan gave an apologetic and somewhat sincere smile to the crestfallen vampire and then made a few more notes in the silence that followed. As he was writing a sudden idea dawned on him and caught himself smiling.\n\n\"Ah. But I do know of a consultant of mine that just might help you, mrs. von Hauptszoll!\" \n\n\"Oh?\" she looked at him with some hope and petted her bat extra hard for luck. \n\nJonathan pressed down a button on his intercom. \"Ms. Brainchild, would you be so kind to bring in the consultant we just engaged the other week?\" \n\n\"Ughhhhhhghhhhhhghghh\" came the gargled reply from the other side of the intercom. \n\n\"Ms. Brainchild.\" Jonathan explained to mrs. von Hauptszoll \"My secretary. Very talented, though she can be a bit of a mouthful.\" \n\n\"Oh yes! The quaint zombie girl, I saw her outside. I'm not familiar with that accent though?\" \n\n\"Jawless, I think, with a mix of half-eaten larynx.\" Jonathan said without making a single hint of emotion.  \n\n\"Ah.\" mrs. von Hauptszoll nodded very carefully \"That sounds like it.\" \n\nThe both of them looked at each other in utter silence as they were both acutely aware of the social dynamic minefield in place. Though gracefully it didn't last too long before a cold, unnerving and utterly voiceless voice interrupted the silence.\n\n*DOCTOR HAART.*\n\nBoth Jonathan and mrs. von Hauptszoll looked startled over at the corner of the office where a tall, black robed and hooded figure stood motionlessly. \n\n\"Ah, Death! There you are!\" said Jonathan and smiled as he stood up.\n\n*SOME WOULD ARGUE I AM ALWAYS HERE.*\n\n\"Haha. Yes, well, that's a topic I'm afraid we just can't get into right now. You see, the reason I called is that mrs. von Hauptszoll here...\" Haart indicated to the vampire who nodded gracefully to Death, who in turn did not. \"...Is having a bit of a relationship issue with her husband who has decided to, well, die. Like... properly.\"\n\n*AH. I SUPPOSE THAT IS NOT IDEAL.*\n\n\"Very much not. Very much not so, indeed. Seeing as that's a bit outside my area of expertise I figured you could be so kind as to perhaps assist in the matter?\"\n\n*DOCTOR HAART, I ONLY SHEPHERD THE DEAD TO THEIR DESTINED AFTER-LIFE. I DO NOT DEAL WITH THE FALLOUT THAT CAUSES AMONG THE DECEASED FAMILY. IF THAT WAS THE CASE I WOULD HAVE DEMANDED A RATHER SUBSTANTIAL RAISE.* ^\u2021\n\n^^^\u2021 ^^Death ^^was ^^in ^^fact ^^not ^^paid ^^anything ^^for ^^its ^^occupation. ^^But ^^figured ^^that ^^the ^^socio-economic ^^situation ^^in ^^the ^^business ^^of ^^universal ^^certainties ^^was ^^a ^^bit ^^too ^^bleak ^^for ^^mortals ^^to ^^handle. \n\n\"Oh don't get me wrong, I wasn't suggest you'd mediate between the two in any way. That would have been ludicrous!\" \n\n*YES.*\n\n\"Merely that you could take mrs. von Hauptszoll here to her beloved's afterlife and then they could chat a bit?\"\n\n*OH.*\n\n\"It would only be for half an hour or so, that's what's left of this hour's appointment anyway. Surely there's no rules against visitation in the afterlife?\" \n\nThere was a brief pause, some might claim it a gigantic one as the cogwheels of the universe creaked to a halt in protest of the idea. But in terms the actual duration of the pause -- it wasn't more than five seconds or so.\n\n*I SUPPOSE.* \n\nMrs. von Hauptszoll rose from her chair and smiled brightly. \"Oh thank you! Thank you! You're a life-saver!\" \n\n*TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THIS MRS. VON HAUPTSZOLL. I'M REALLY NOT.*\n\nMrs. von Hauptszoll gave Jonathan a brief hug and a big thank you before she grabbed Death's hand and the both of them vanished out of thin air. In retrospect, these things should have probably inspired all sorts of philosophical conundrums in Jonathan's mind but the way he figured it, philosophy was something you left behind once you worked office hours and got a pay check.  \n\nWith a merry stroll back to his chair and desk, he sat down and dotted down some final notes. Once done he grabbed his papers, stood up and then suddenly realization dawned on him. \n\n\"Oh damn!\" he exclaimed and blinked. \"Milk. I always forget to buy the milk.\" \n\nWriting down a quick addition to his grocery list he nodded happily, grabbed his coat and turned the lights off to his office.\n\n-------------------------\n\nAuthor's note: I feel like I should add, and this may be very obvious for many, that this is heavily influenced by Terry Pratchett and the Discworld-series.

And that&amp;#39;s when we convince ourselves that we have to do something drastic.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;\u2020&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;The&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;second&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;biggest&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;problem&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;is&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;an&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;uninventive&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;sex-life&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;and&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;third&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;insensitive&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vampire-hunters&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;\u2020\u2020&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;\u2020\u2020&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;term&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;very&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;much&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;divisive&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;in&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;undead-community,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;given&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;that&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vampire-hunters&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;seldom&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;just&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;hunts&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vampires.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;The&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Committee&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;of&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Ghouls,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Skeletal&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Zombies&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Issues&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;have&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;multiple&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;times&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;tried&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;to&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;bring&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;awareness&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;by&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;asking&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;people&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;to&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;refer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;to&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;them&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;as&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;undead-in-general&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;hunters.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So what you&amp;#39;re saying is that it&amp;#39;s just a phase, Doctor Haart? Perhaps I should let him have some space in the afterlife and then he&amp;#39;ll come back?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To be perfectly honest with you, it is very difficult to say without having both of you in the office at the same time. And quite frankly, the afterlife is not my area of expertise. I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure what help I could offer here for the both of you.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jonathan gave an apologetic and somewhat sincere smile to the crestfallen vampire and then made a few more notes in the silence that followed. As he was writing a sudden idea dawned on him and caught himself smiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah. But I do know of a consultant of mine that just might help you, mrs. von Hauptszoll!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh?&amp;quot; she looked at him with some hope and petted her bat extra hard for luck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jonathan pressed down a button on his intercom. &amp;quot;Ms. Brainchild, would you be so kind to bring in the consultant we just engaged the other week?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ughhhhhhghhhhhhghghh&amp;quot; came the gargled reply from the other side of the intercom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ms. Brainchild.&amp;quot; Jonathan explained to mrs. von Hauptszoll &amp;quot;My secretary. Very talented, though she can be a bit of a mouthful.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh yes! The quaint zombie girl, I saw her outside. I&amp;#39;m not familiar with that accent though?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jawless, I think, with a mix of half-eaten larynx.&amp;quot; Jonathan said without making a single hint of emotion.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah.&amp;quot; mrs. von Hauptszoll nodded very carefully &amp;quot;That sounds like it.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The both of them looked at each other in utter silence as they were both acutely aware of the social dynamic minefield in place. Though gracefully it didn&amp;#39;t last too long before a cold, unnerving and utterly voiceless voice interrupted the silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DOCTOR HAART.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both Jonathan and mrs. von Hauptszoll looked startled over at the corner of the office where a tall, black robed and hooded figure stood motionlessly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah, Death! There you are!&amp;quot; said Jonathan and smiled as he stood up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SOME WOULD ARGUE I AM ALWAYS HERE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Haha. Yes, well, that&amp;#39;s a topic I&amp;#39;m afraid we just can&amp;#39;t get into right now. You see, the reason I called is that mrs. von Hauptszoll here...&amp;quot; Haart indicated to the vampire who nodded gracefully to Death, who in turn did not. &amp;quot;...Is having a bit of a relationship issue with her husband who has decided to, well, die. Like... properly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AH. I SUPPOSE THAT IS NOT IDEAL.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Very much not. Very much not so, indeed. Seeing as that&amp;#39;s a bit outside my area of expertise I figured you could be so kind as to perhaps assist in the matter?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DOCTOR HAART, I ONLY SHEPHERD THE DEAD TO THEIR DESTINED AFTER-LIFE. I DO NOT DEAL WITH THE FALLOUT THAT CAUSES AMONG THE DECEASED FAMILY. IF THAT WAS THE CASE I WOULD HAVE DEMANDED A RATHER SUBSTANTIAL RAISE.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup&gt;\u2021&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;\u2021&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Death&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;was&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;in&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fact&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;not&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;paid&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;anything&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;for&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;its&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;occupation.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;But&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;figured&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;that&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;socio-economic&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;situation&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;in&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;business&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;of&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;universal&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;certainties&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;was&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;bit&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;too&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;bleak&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;for&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;mortals&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;to&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;handle.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I wasn&amp;#39;t suggest you&amp;#39;d mediate between the two in any way. That would have been ludicrous!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;YES.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Merely that you could take mrs. von Hauptszoll here to her beloved&amp;#39;s afterlife and then they could chat a bit?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OH.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It would only be for half an hour or so, that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s left of this hour&amp;#39;s appointment anyway. Surely there&amp;#39;s no rules against visitation in the afterlife?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a brief pause, some might claim it a gigantic one as the cogwheels of the universe creaked to a halt in protest of the idea. But in terms the actual duration of the pause -- it wasn&amp;#39;t more than five seconds or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I SUPPOSE.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. von Hauptszoll rose from her chair and smiled brightly. &amp;quot;Oh thank you! Thank you! You&amp;#39;re a life-saver!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THIS MRS. VON HAUPTSZOLL. I&amp;#39;M REALLY NOT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. von Hauptszoll gave Jonathan a brief hug and a big thank you before she grabbed Death&amp;#39;s hand and the both of them vanished out of thin air. In retrospect, these things should have probably inspired all sorts of philosophical conundrums in Jonathan&amp;#39;s mind but the way he figured it, philosophy was something you left behind once you worked office hours and got a pay check.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a merry stroll back to his chair and desk, he sat down and dotted down some final notes. Once done he grabbed his papers, stood up and then suddenly realization dawned on him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh damn!&amp;quot; he exclaimed and blinked. &amp;quot;Milk. I always forget to buy the milk.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Writing down a quick addition to his grocery list he nodded happily, grabbed his coat and turned the lights off to his office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Author&amp;#39;s note: I feel like I should add, and this may be very obvious for many, that this is heavily influenced by Terry Pratchett and the Discworld-series.

I loved hanging out with you. But I also loved sports -- it\u2019s a part of who I am. It\u2019s not like I just dated you for your looks.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Anya countered. \u201cWell then why haven\u2019t you asked me out on a date yet? It\u2019s been weeks! We could have taken a nice, romantic ride on the River Styx or strolled through Persephone\u2019s jewel garden, but noooooo. The instant my skin started sagging, you lost interest. Admit it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for me, you know,\u201d John pleaded defensively. \u201cI wanted to grow up, have kids. Maybe a dog or two. That sort of thing. But now, we just.... can\u2019t. Every time I touch you, I can\u2019t even feel your hand. I want to feel again.\u201d\n\nAnya\u2019s face softened. \u201cI know. It\u2019s hard for me too.

You just lost something very dear to you -- your physical intimacy. What you need to do now is find a way to ignite that spark without the warmth of life. Miss Harper, you made some very good suggestions earlier. Why don\u2019t you take a nice, relaxing drift on the Styx? Charon\u2019s ferry rides may be expensive, but they can be very soothing. I can book you a discounted cruise if you wish.\u201d\n\nJohn looked at Anya beseechingly before looking back at me. \u201cYes please. I uh, I would like that.\u201d He turned to his ghoulish girlfriend awkwardly. \u201cWould you?\u201d\n\nAnya paused for a moment before nodding. \u201cI think so.\u201d She smiled, revealing a row of rotting teeth. It was a charming sight, in all honesty. Even more charming when it was returned by her beau. I looked at the clock hanging on my desk. \n\n\u201cWell I think we have made excellent progress today,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you free this time next week?\u201d\n\nThe two of them nod. \u201cGood. I will see you then. Please do not be late. If you need to cancel for any reason at all I expect 48 hours of notice beforehand.\u201d I give them a toothy grin. \u201cI think this can work, between you two. Keep at it and remember: you were only human.\u201d \n\nThe happy couple left my office, walking down the halls slightly closer than they had before. I give them a curt nod before giving my attention to my rug. A bit of brain spatter on the strings, but nothing that wouldn\u2019t come out. Anyhow, it was time to close up shop before making my way to the soft, velveteen comfort of my coffin. I thought about the two ghouls and silently wished them luck.

I uh, I would like that.\u201d He turned to his ghoulish girlfriend awkwardly. \u201cWould you?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anya paused for a moment before nodding. \u201cI think so.\u201d She smiled, revealing a row of rotting teeth. It was a charming sight, in all honesty. Even more charming when it was returned by her beau. I looked at the clock hanging on my desk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell I think we have made excellent progress today,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you free this time next week?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two of them nod. \u201cGood. I will see you then. Please do not be late. If you need to cancel for any reason at all I expect 48 hours of notice beforehand.\u201d I give them a toothy grin. \u201cI think this can work, between you two. Keep at it and remember: you were only human.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The happy couple left my office, walking down the halls slightly closer than they had before. I give them a curt nod before giving my attention to my rug. A bit of brain spatter on the strings, but nothing that wouldn\u2019t come out. Anyhow, it was time to close up shop before making my way to the soft, velveteen comfort of my coffin. I thought about the two ghouls and silently wished them luck. Dying is easy, but undeath takes a bit of getting used to. But, I reminded myself, at least they have each other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose that\u2019s all any of us can really hope for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg8qt11", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492172079.0, "created_utc": 1492143279.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8qeod", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cipher0012", "parent_id": "t3_658g0z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Nec-Romancer\n\nI sighed as I straightened the small bronze plaque listing my name and service offered.
