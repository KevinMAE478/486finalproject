On Sundays, like all Sundays, he took a trip to his favorite coffee shop, where the baristas knew him by name. Like all ordinary men, he ordered a medium latte, and took a seat at his favorite table. Kyle perused the coffee shop, smiled at the regulars, and gazed over the new ones. Then, like all, he pulled out his phone and went on Twitter.\n\n\"That festering dump, again?\"\n\nKyle looked up from his phone to face the voice that had joined him on his coffee trips for the last few weeks. Unlike ordinary men, the voice came from something that wasn't a man at all, and Kyle smirked. \"Oh, come on Azzy. I saw you tweeting the other day.\"\n\nThe demon growled and the suit that Kyle had bought him sparked. He quickly put it out, and Azarolth the Defiler remembered that in the mortal plane, he had to pretend to be mortal. \"Only because the damn gas station attendant was a fraud,\" he said.\n\n\"Fraud? He was doing his job.\"\n\n\"Three dollars a gallon for gas!\" Azarolth scoffed, \"Typical human.\"\n\nKyle laughed and went back to his phone. He scrolled through his feed, liked a few tweets, and retweeted some others. \"How'd you get that picture anyway?\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"Your avi.\"\n\n\"My what?\"\n\nKyle smirked, \"The picture you used for Twitter. You look so *clean*.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" Azarolth looked up from his newspaper and Kyle looked at him. Typically, he still had the darkish-red skin, only dabbed with a bit of makeup to make him look more human. He wore a hat to cover his horns, but Kyle knew. \"I used photoshop.\"\n\n\"You know photoshop?\"\n\n\"You've kept me in this plane for three months, Kyle. I needed to learn some things.\"\n\nKyle nodded, and turned back to his phone. He liked one of @Azzy_D's tweets and laughed.

On Sundays, like all Sundays, he took a trip to his favorite coffee shop, where the baristas knew him by name. Like all ordinary men, he ordered a medium latte, and took a seat at his favorite table. Kyle perused the coffee shop, smiled at the regulars, and gazed over the new ones. Then, like all, he pulled out his phone and went on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That festering dump, again?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kyle looked up from his phone to face the voice that had joined him on his coffee trips for the last few weeks. Unlike ordinary men, the voice came from something that wasn&amp;#39;t a man at all, and Kyle smirked. &amp;quot;Oh, come on Azzy. I saw you tweeting the other day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The demon growled and the suit that Kyle had bought him sparked. He quickly put it out, and Azarolth the Defiler remembered that in the mortal plane, he had to pretend to be mortal. &amp;quot;Only because the damn gas station attendant was a fraud,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fraud? He was doing his job.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Three dollars a gallon for gas!&amp;quot; Azarolth scoffed, &amp;quot;Typical human.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kyle laughed and went back to his phone. He scrolled through his feed, liked a few tweets, and retweeted some others. &amp;quot;How&amp;#39;d you get that picture anyway?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Which?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your avi.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kyle smirked, &amp;quot;The picture you used for Twitter.

Typically, he still had the darkish-red skin, only dabbed with a bit of makeup to make him look more human. He wore a hat to cover his horns, but Kyle knew. &amp;quot;I used photoshop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You know photoshop?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve kept me in this plane for three months, Kyle. I needed to learn some things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kyle nodded, and turned back to his phone. He liked one of @Azzy_D&amp;#39;s tweets and laughed.

Lord Gaben is a meticulous fellow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You work for Gaben?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, yes, how else is Elo Hell gonna run itself?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I knew it! I knew it&amp;#39;s real! All my friends keep telling me to stop using it as an excuse. It&amp;#39;s so maddening!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The guys over at Riot are way better than us though, I don&amp;#39;t know how they manage it. However it got so carcinogenic there that they won&amp;#39;t be able to sustain a high test-subject-base in the long run; they will run out of players too soon. We believe our approach will be more successful in the end. Lord Gaben will prevail over Prince Tryndamere.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How many players trade their souls to get out of Elo Hell?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Enough to fuel the process for Half-Life 3. Perfection demands a high toll.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, I know: can I wish for Half-Life 3 to be released soon?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No can do, kid. Lord Gaben does as he pleases, but even he has his limitations. Not enough souls yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If I give you my soul for this process, can I play it once it comes out?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure; I&amp;#39;ll put you in stasis until then. It will take a couple more generations, but I&amp;#39;ll wake you up when the time comes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sweet!

How cliched can this demon get?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I CAN HEAR ALL YOUR THOUGHTS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOR WE ARE NOW ONE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then how come I can only hear when you\u2019re trying to communicate with me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BECAUSE, MORTAL, YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND MY THOUGHTS EVEN IF YOU TRIED. THEY ARE NOT AS EASILY UNDERSTOOD AS A MERE HUMAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well, looks like my only course of action is to learn to live as if I was schizophrenic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO SAYS YOU AREN\u2019T?

Just thinking about it makes ME think I\u2019m crazy. Maybe I am. &lt;strong&gt;YOU ARE&lt;/strong&gt;. This is going to be annoying.

Enquired the underworld soul broker, evidently intrigued by Jarrod's life choices. \n\n\"no, no and... Nope\" \n\n\"hang on a second kid\" Rathulo pulled a clipboard from his jacket pocket, and scanned the pen down the page, with what seemed to be a table on it. \"let's see... No, no, no...\" he mumbled to himself for a few moments, then abruptly stopped as if springing to life again. \"you're a triple A kid, you're soul is a triple A. Do you have any idea what this means\"?\n\n\"Not really, that's sort of the reason I came down here, to learn about the inner working of the underworld\" \n\n\"your soul is the purest of souls, only the big banks of the soul trade have ever actually brokered a deal with a triple A soul\". Rathulo suddenly jumping with joy, his short frame reaching heights it never has. \n\n\"I'm extremely confused, can you please go into a bit more detail\"? Asked Jarrod, his hand rubbing the back of his head. \n\n\"well kid basically what I do as a soul broker is I buy your soul for wishes, and depending on how pure your soul is will depend on the wish I can grant, the price I'm willing to pay. I then take your soul and float it on the soul exchange for a profit\" \n\n\"So what happens to my soul then\"? Inquired Jarrod, so impatient to finally learn about the Underworld that he forgot his manners and cut off Rathulo. \n\n\"let me finish boy. So once it is on the soul exchange the rich souls in the underworld will buy them\". \n\n\"then what, then what\"!? Jarrod snapped eagerly.\n\n\"well they wait for them to reach maturity. That is when the person whom the soul belonged to in the mortal world is taken by death. Death then acts a courier to escort the physical body to the underworld where they become loyal servants for eternity. If you don't sell your soul and you end up in the underworld, you're free to choose a career in the underworld\".\n\n\"hold on so why are pure souls so valued\"?\n\n\"Two reasons boy, one is it's essentially a big Fuck you to the over world. What you mortals call heaven, pardon my French. Second reason and most important, you guys are the hardest workers of all, so you're a much less risky asset\". \n\nRathulo and Jarrod talked for a couple more minutes about the rules and regulations. Then finally Rathulo got to business. Seal the deal and take what he needs. \"so kid I ask, what wish would you like, you can have literally any wish you can think of, within limits of course\".\n\n\"okay, why not. I've earned it after all this work being a good person, Fuck it. Wow that felt good, Time to live a little\" Rathulo began rubbing his hands together. The image of him rolling up to the soul exchange and handing a triple A to the trading board, all his doubters watching in utter awe. \"hmmmmmm, well I guess I will just wish for a second wish, then I'll have two\"\n\n\"sorry kid hasn't worked like that for nearly 10 years. Not since the bubble of 08. Everyone was doing that way back, bundling wishes. You had 3 wishes being granted for the one high purity soul, causing artificial demand to inflate prices. Sooner or later the banks began lending more wishes than they could afford. Everyone panicked and went to get their funds out of the wish bank all at once. The system collapsed like a game of Jenga\"\n\n\"Oh shit, you guys play Jenga down here too\"? \n\n\"Yeah we go nuts for it, 30 years ago a soul trader was told by a mortal client about it. Ever since then it's been huge\" \n\n\"Well I hate to break it to you, but that is really the only wish I would take\"\n\"\nWait, wait! you can't leave without making a deal\"! Rathulo lurched forward in desperation to stop Jarrod from entering the portal. \"ummm why not\"?\n\"one tiny detail, so um... this isn't really the underworld. It's technically a neutral zone in the underworld set up for the soul-wish exchange between Underworld beings and mortals. You see mortals can't survive in the underworld, it's impossible! so this is a limbo\"\n\n\"Jesus Christ Rathulo, haven't you guys ever heard of consumer law? This is a voluntary exchange, I can't be forced into this deal. So you can quit trying to suck me in, dick\"!\n\n\"No we know that, so basically if we can't seal the deal, we're both stuck in limbo. I have to take your soul back, so to do that without a deal we sit here until death do us part. Romantic isn't it\"?\n\n\"asshole\" quipped Jarrod \n\n\"hey, any more of that language and I'll be forced to downgrade your soul to an A\" \n\n\"Okay then what you got on offer\"? \n\n\"Well the best I can do for you is... Let's see. give me a second to crunch the numbers\" Rathulo whipped out a calculator from his back pocket and began swiftly punching in numbers. \"No aging. That includes muscle degeneration, memory loss, diseases common to old age. Anything. All you do is choose the age in which you want it all to stop\". \n\n\"so do I die\"?\n\n\"yes, my god kid did you not listen when I explained how this works? Why would an investor in his right mind buy a soul that will never mature\" \n\n\"OKAY, no need to get snarky, eh. what else you got\"?\n\n\"hmm, oh, oh how about instant attraction to the sex of your choice\"?\n\n\"nope, I'm fairly happy with my sex life, plus I have happy time as well. Honestly not impressed, looks like you may have to wait it out until I die. Just you and me buddy. Hahaha, it'll be fun. Just two Shit kickers, old pals, camping out in limbo, until death do us part. Who knows maybe we can settle down, lead a quite life in the suburbs\" Jarrod said flippantly. \n\n\"well looks like you're now an A rated soul. Nice one you facetious prick. now the best you can get is... 50 million dollars\". \n\n\"well I sure as Shit don't want to sell my soul to be an eternal slave to some underworld investor for a measly 50 mill. Looks like your stuck with me\". Jarrod decided unfazed by the prospect of spending the rest of his life in limbo \"and by the way, if you want your happy time, please do it somewhere where I can't hear or see you\"\n\n\"how about in your mouth douche\" Rathulo mumbled to himself.\n\n\"hey Rathulo? Rath my man?... You're Being ratherlo rude today aren't you\" \n\n\"WHAT. DO. YOU. WANT\"!? Rathulo responded clenching his fists and jaw. \n\n\"did you by any chance bring Jenga\" \n\n\"yes\"\n\n\"awesome. You know I've always said to myself I wish I could just play Jenga for the rest of my life and not have to work or anything\"\n\n\"what was that you said\"? Rathulo jerked into responsiveness, desperately trying to hold back an evil grin. He quickly fumbled around for his voice recorder, and having found it before Jarrod responded he clicked record.\n\n\"oh I was just saying how I honestly wish I could just play Jenga for the rest of my life without the need to work or anything, just play Jenga whenever I want, wherever I want\"\n\n\"Well sir today is your lucky day. Been a real pleasure doing business. Just in the nick of time awsell, mother gets home in 5 minutes so I still have enough happy time left. YES\"! \n\n\"Wait. What!

So, how do you know you're not immortal if your purpose had always been fulfilled?\"\n\nThe demon did not react to this and remained silent for a moment. The young man waited for the demon to to reply.

Who created the portal?\"\n\n\"The greater being had brought me to My being within the veil. The greater being who created the veil and the portal.\" \n\n\"So it was a mortal who created you?\"\n\n\"...I ...no.\"\n\nThe demon appeared confused.\n\"Since the portal couldn't have been created within the veil it had to have been created here, on my plane.\"\n\nThe demon looked nonplussed at this theory.\n\"So, if I die, wouldn't you cease to exist since your plane was created from my own?\"\n\n\"No, the veil is infinite. Iam not a mortal, therefore I cannot die.\"\n\n\"That's not a rational answer.\"\n\n\"Neither is your assumption that the veil only existed with the creation of the portal.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. So I guess my assumption that you are the only being within he veil was misguided?\"\n\n\"I don't know how you came to that conclusion in the first place? There are others within the veil. But none are akin to my being. They only pass through to the next.\"\n\n\"The next what?\"\n\n\"The next plane.\"\n\n\"So, it was from that other plane that our two planes were created?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You mean there is an afterlife?\"\n\n\"Yes. But not for me since I am immortal.\"\n\n\"Were we created by the same being?\"\n\n\"No. I was not birthed from a mortal. I was created, thusly a mortal cannot kill me and I cannot die a mortals death.\"\n\n\"So you're not like me and you can exist in both our worlds except for the next. who created man?\" \n\n\"That is not my concern.\"\n\n\"But who takes my soul? Is there a hell?\"\n\nThe demon stared quizzically at the young man\n\n\"Only the eater of souls.\"\n\n\"So what will happen when my soul is ...eaten?\"\n\n\"Youre soul shall slake the appetite of he who had tasked me with this burden.\"\n\n\"So, you feel remorse for us mortals?\"\n\n\"No. I care not for the plight or grievances of man. I am only bound to my purpose.\"\n\n\"So you feel emburdened only by your inability to free yourself of your own purpose?\"\n\nThe demon only stared at the young man.\nFeeling defeated that this conversation was going nowhere the young man conceded with a heavy heart.\n\n\" ...ok. So can you answer my original question. Can you die?\"\n\nThe demons expression softened and stared solemnly at the small man and replied.\n\"Do you wish to know the truth?\"\n\n\"Yes, I wish to know if you can die?\"\nThe young man retorted with a stern demeanor.\n\nThe demon stooped down to meet the mortal mans face and spoke.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAnd then vanished.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You mortals are all the same.

Once I was done cutting, I presented Mr. &lt;em&gt;Izdregaard&lt;/em&gt; with his &amp;#39;human sole&amp;#39; and my wish. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wish for a pair of white sneakers that will fit me perfectly, and that will make me the fastest man on earth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The demon cocked his head sideways and held up the partial sneaker. &amp;quot;What is this trash?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s my sole,&amp;quot; I replied. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is not a human soul.&amp;quot; His demeanor could kill if he wasn&amp;#39;t so adorable! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure it is, &lt;em&gt;Izzy&lt;/em&gt;! Name another creature on earth that purposefully wears sneakers. I bet you can&amp;#39;t. I destroyed my gym shoes to give you my sole. I made my wish and gave you your payment. Grant my wish and be gone!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Izdregaard&lt;/em&gt; looked thoroughly confused, but seemed to accept my logic. He disappeared with a puff of smoke, and left behind him a pair of white sneakers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Damn, I forgot to have him give &lt;em&gt;Gregthaar&lt;/em&gt; my regards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg9on4h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492229748.0, "created_utc": 1492200948.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6540sf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg90y9j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kagemoto", "parent_id": "t3_6540sf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Alex sips his drink as he watches ~~The Scarlet One~~ attempt to access the computer.\n\n\"**CURSE THIS INFERNAL DEVICE!**\"\n\nAlex snickers, \"I thought you know everything?
