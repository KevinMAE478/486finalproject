Of course, calling it an apartment was probably overstating it. It was basic housing. An 8' by 10' by 7' cube with a small bunk with drawers underneath, a small toilet with a sink on top of the tank, a chair, and a tiny table. The room had one outlet that would give you exactly 200 watts of power every day. The toilet was allowed 10 flushes. If you chose not to work or were unable to be employed, you received this and a total of 2000 calories of food at any vendor. \n\nI looked down at the envelope again and read the name. Was that my name? I opened the envelope and pulled out the basic allowance for living (BAL) which turned out to be 300 credits. The envelope also yielded a watch and the cheapest com in existence. There was also an ID card, and it had a photo on it. Was that me? I stood up and walked to the mirror over the toilet, comparing my reflection to the ID. Yep, it was me.\n\nI put the watch on and put the com, ID, and credits into the pocket of the tan pants I was wearing. In fact, now that I was looking, I noticed I was wearing the cheapest and most basic clothing available, being tan pants, shirt, and shoes. \n\nThere was a knock on the door of my unit, but when I opened the door, all there was was a card on the ground. I picked it up and brought it inside, reading as I went. The first side just had an address: F-23Gold-14B. The back just had a long string of numbers: 194275726883539\n\nMy brain was really fuzzy, and I felt like a nap, but something about the card drew me. I stepped out of my cube and noted my address: Z-15Blue-23D\n\nI wandered down the narrow, filthy street, dodging the dregs of society, all of whom now lived in the basic housing slums. I soon spotted a public tube station and paid the five credit fee to get inside. Inside there was a higher class of scum, and I was able to find the map of the tube system. I found the closest stop to the address I wanted and soon was riding through the system packed shoulder to shoulder with the glot of humanity in this particular tube car.\n\nF sector turned out to be a lot nicer and a lot quieter than Z sector had been, and I quickly found the address. The units were all much larger here, and the street was nicer. The address I showed up at had a black door with a number pad and a palm scanner next to the latch. There was a note on the door that said \"Enter the code, then palm on scanner\". \n\nI typed in the code and placed my palm on the scanner and watched as the scanners lights flared from between my fingers. No sooner had the scan finished than the door popped ajar. The door led to a small closet-like area. I stepped in, shutting the outside door, and another door popped open. I opened this one as well and walked into a room of wonder. \n\nHolographic screens lit up from the walls and I saw....myself. Myself dressed as a soldier. As a businessman. As a dancer. As a gardener. I stared in wonder until one of them spoke.\n\n\"Hello,\" the soldier said. \"If you are watching this, you've been caught and mindwiped.\"\n\n\"Again,\" added the businessman. \n\n\"We,\" the gardener said, gesturing to the holograms. \"Are the previous versions of you.

After spending four years in maximum security prison it was the day of my memory wipe. I don't fit the bill for a killer but I guess it just happened. My best friend, James was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's when he was 43. It destroyed him and he could bear the thought him losing completely everything, everything become foreign even his wife and children. He made me promise that the day he didn't recognize, I had to kill him. He wanted die while he had at least some of his memories left. I had to do it out of mercy, I couldn't say know, it was the only way I could help him. Leaving someone to lose who they are, all the experiences that shaped them, making their family into strangers, that's the cruelest punishment that god has ever inflicted upon anyone. \n      I was caught. The day I killed him my fingerprints were found at the scene. James didn't want his death to look like suicide, he wanted his family to remember his strong. I was as careful as I could be but I still left fingerprints. James's family was furious with me. They didn't understand that I did it out of mercy. They wanted the him back even though he didn't want to be. \n    Ironic isn't it? The very thing I tried to prevent in my best friend is now my punishment. I will wake up one day and I will be lost, oblivious to who I am, what the world around me is and what I've done. I wish we were still back in the olden days where criminals were just killed. The government says this punishment, having  my memory wiped, is more humane and it will return me to be \"a functioning member of society\". Multiple times now I have tried to kill myself to avoid the punishment but they just kept moving the date of it up. Now its my turn. \n\n\"Fuck!\" I am jolted awake by a sharp pain stabbing my left temple. I look around. I recognize nothing around me. My room is generic: nothing is out of place and everything is white. I stumble into the bathroom to the right of my bed. As I turn to the mirror I jump. My reflection startles me. I don't know who I'm looking at. This stranger in the mirror. I see scars on my face that i don't know where they are from. I can't stand to stare at the mirror. With all my strength I punch it sending glass and blood flying. Sobbing, I grab a shard of glass, hold in to my neck, scream and... \n\n                             Nothing", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was my turn.
