A feisty looking orange and white striped tabby leaped out of my bed and made a run for the door before I could retaliate for the rude awakening. I swore to god that one day I was going to kill that cat.   \n\n\u201cOh, honey, you\u2019re awake!\u201d cried Jennifer from down the bottom of the stairs. She leaned on the banister, twirling a paintbrush. \u201cI\u2019m right on the cusp of a breakthrough, I know it!\u201d she exclaimed. She was always \u2018on the cusp of a breakthrough.\u2019 It usually meant that I\u2019d be stuck doing some chore that she suddenly didn\u2019t have time for.   \n\n\"Now that you\u2019re up, do you think you could take the kids to school on your way to work?\u201d she continued. Yep, there it was. Married life was great, really, but sometimes the kids were just too much to handle. I loved them, of course. But once in awhile I just wished it could go back to how it used to be. We were just Mike and Jennifer (And a bottle of wine) her painting, me admiring. Back then it was so simple. Back before we had responsibilities.\n\n\u201cOf course, sweetie, no problem,\u201d I replied. \u201cJust try and get your breakthrough over with in time to make it to the school before noon, okay? It\u2019s not good if the professor\u2019s late, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo promises,\u201d she grinned. Even when she was pawning off her duties on to me she still managed to be cute as the day I met her. \n\nI showered and dressed quickly. There wasn\u2019t a lot of time to eat, so I scarfed down a protein bar while I adjusted my tie. I never managed to get it right, what was up with fancy clothes being such a hassle, anyways?\n\nI grabbed the kids by their collars and nearly dragged them out the door.\n\n\u201cLucas, if you don\u2019t quit pestering your sister I swear to god I\u2019ll turn this car around,\u201d I had to threaten only halfway to the school. \n\t\n\u201cGood, then we won\u2019t have to go to school!\u201d he said with a smirk. Damn smartass kid. \n\t\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I guess going to school is punishment enough,\u201d I sighed. We were in the circle drive in no time, but it took nearly 15 minutes to get through it with all the annoying helicopter parents taking their sweet time kissing their kids goodbye for what felt like hours. I finally dropped off the two little devils and sped off for work.\n\t\nBy the time I reached the office my shirt was wet with the smelly, sticky perspiration that can only come from a long car ride with a busted air conditioner. It didn\u2019t help that my bucket of bolts had leather seats. Luckily I had ran into this situation before, and I switched out with my backup shirt in no time.\n\t\nStill enough time to be late to the office though, and that was just the start of the shittiest work day I\u2019d had in a long time. My assistant spilled coffee on my lap, my boss yelled at me for my colleague\u2019s mistakes not once, not twice but three times, and to top it all off he double booked me, telling me to make sure that I both help him give a presentation at the big meeting and contact his wife at 1:40, exactly halfway through our meeting, to make sure she could make it for dinner. \nIt wasn\u2019t my responsibility at all, but I saw what he was doing. If he stepped out to take a personal call in the middle of a meeting this important it\u2019d be career suicide, so he pawned it off on me. I hated that guy.\n\nHe was my boss though, so when he nodded at me to leave at 5:40, I did. I stepped out of the room and pulled out my phone. \n\n\u201cI know I have your number somewhere in here Meredith,\u201d I muttered to myself as I scrolled through the contacts. \u201cAh there we go.\u201d I tapped it to start a call and brought it to my ear.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d answered a male voice. Well that didn\u2019t sound like Meredith, unless she\u2019d gone through some changes since I last talked to her. I pulled my phone from my ear and investigated. Sure enough, I tapped the wrong button and ended up calling \u201cMe\u201d instead of Meredith in my contacts. But that was weird. That was my number. Why was someone answering?\n\n\u201cUm, hello?\u201d I asked, bringing the phone back up to my face.\n\n\u201cHello, Mike,\u201d repeated the voice. My voice. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be in the backseat for a little bit today. Sound like fun?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d I questioned frantically. Who would be able to replicate my voice so accurately, and what the hell were they talking about?\n\n\u201cWhy Mike,\u201d I answered. \u201cI\u2019m you.\u201d\n\nI threw my phone on the ground. That thing was a piece of shit, I could never hit the right button anyway. \n\n\u201cMike, get back in here, they have a question for you!\u201d called my boss from the conference room. \u201cWas that a personal call?\u201d He asked when I poked my head through the door.\n\n\u201cYeah, it was your wife,\u201d I answered. \u201cShe says to go screw yourself. Also, I quit.\u201d\n\nI made my way to the elevator while the entire conference room stood in shocked silence. From there, it was easy riding to the car dealership, where I picked up a brand new model of the junky old Chevy I drove there. I just left that one by the side of the road. The new one had a pretty kickass air conditioner. \n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d I asked as I sped off toward the kids\u2019 school.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m picking up the kids from school,\u201d I returned. I sped up to 15 above the speed limit, swerving in and out of traffic.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re ruining my life!\u201d I cried. There was nothing I could do but watch as I ran a red light. \u201cI can\u2019t afford this car, especially now that you for sure just got me fired!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut doesn\u2019t it feel fantastic?\u201d I countered as I arrived at the school to pick up the kids. It did feel pretty great. But I needed to get back control, I couldn\u2019t keep doing this. The drive was filled with cars, again. People took as long to pick up their kids as they did to drop them off. \n\n\u201cScrew it,\u201d I exclaimed. I hopped the curb to the sidewalk, honking the horn with delight to see kids, parents and teachers leap to get out of the way. \n\n\u201cDad?\u201d wondered a small voice when I stopped at the main entrance. Lucas stood next to my car with a look of confusion. That's right, his sister went to stay at a friend\u2019s house after school today. \n\n\u201cHey Lucas,\u201d I started. \n\n\u201cYeah, Dad?\u201d He answered, still with the same look of confusion.\n\n\u201cQuit picking on your fucking sister,\u201d I breathed in his face. I tore out of the drive, swerving around the pedestrians who didn\u2019t take note of my entrance. I was home in what felt like seconds. I tore off the last of my clothes I stepped over the threshold. I wasn't going to wear uncomfortable dress clothes in my own home.\n\nI made my way to the former bedroom that we had transformed into a studio earlier in the year.\n\nJust as I\u2019d hoped, Jennifer was waiting for me, naked as well and painting with no regard for the mess she made. A bottle of wine was in her right hand. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing you called yourself today too?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI sure did,\u201d I replied.\n\nI kissed her with a passion that neither of us had felt in years, and we collapsed to \nthe ground in each other\u2019s arms.\n\n\u201cHey, honey?\u201d I sighed, content.\n\n\u201cYes baby?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the cat?\u201d\n\n", "edited": 1492342170.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cGod dammit!\u201d I screamed, clutching my bleeding hand as I lept out of bed. A feisty looking orange and white striped tabby leaped out of my bed and made a run for the door before I could retaliate for the rude awakening. I swore to god that one day I was going to kill that cat.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, honey, you\u2019re awake!\u201d cried Jennifer from down the bottom of the stairs. She leaned on the banister, twirling a paintbrush. \u201cI\u2019m right on the cusp of a breakthrough, I know it!\u201d she exclaimed. She was always \u2018on the cusp of a breakthrough.\u2019 It usually meant that I\u2019d be stuck doing some chore that she suddenly didn\u2019t have time for.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now that you\u2019re up, do you think you could take the kids to school on your way to work?\u201d she continued. Yep, there it was. Married life was great, really, but sometimes the kids were just too much to handle. I loved them, of course. But once in awhile I just wished it could go back to how it used to be. We were just Mike and Jennifer (And a bottle of wine) her painting, me admiring. Back then it was so simple. Back before we had responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOf course, sweetie, no problem,\u201d I replied. \u201cJust try and get your breakthrough over with in time to make it to the school before noon, okay? It\u2019s not good if the professor\u2019s late, you know.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo promises,\u201d she grinned. Even when she was pawning off her duties on to me she still managed to be cute as the day I met her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I showered and dressed quickly. There wasn\u2019t a lot of time to eat, so I scarfed down a protein bar while I adjusted my tie. I never managed to get it right, what was up with fancy clothes being such a hassle, anyways?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the kids by their collars and nearly dragged them out the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLucas, if you don\u2019t quit pestering your sister I swear to god I\u2019ll turn this car around,\u201d I had to threaten only halfway to the school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGood, then we won\u2019t have to go to school!\u201d he said with a smirk. Damn smartass kid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re right, I guess going to school is punishment enough,\u201d I sighed. We were in the circle drive in no time, but it took nearly 15 minutes to get through it with all the annoying helicopter parents taking their sweet time kissing their kids goodbye for what felt like hours. I finally dropped off the two little devils and sped off for work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I reached the office my shirt was wet with the smelly, sticky perspiration that can only come from a long car ride with a busted air conditioner. It didn\u2019t help that my bucket of bolts had leather seats. Luckily I had ran into this situation before, and I switched out with my backup shirt in no time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still enough time to be late to the office though, and that was just the start of the shittiest work day I\u2019d had in a long time. My assistant spilled coffee on my lap, my boss yelled at me for my colleague\u2019s mistakes not once, not twice but three times, and to top it all off he double booked me, telling me to make sure that I both help him give a presentation at the big meeting and contact his wife at 1:40, exactly halfway through our meeting, to make sure she could make it for dinner. \nIt wasn\u2019t my responsibility at all, but I saw what he was doing. If he stepped out to take a personal call in the middle of a meeting this important it\u2019d be career suicide, so he pawned it off on me. I hated that guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was my boss though, so when he nodded at me to leave at 5:40, I did. I stepped out of the room and pulled out my phone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI know I have your number somewhere in here Meredith,\u201d I muttered to myself as I scrolled through the contacts. \u201cAh there we go.\u201d I tapped it to start a call and brought it to my ear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHello,\u201d answered a male voice. Well that didn\u2019t sound like Meredith, unless she\u2019d gone through some changes since I last talked to her. I pulled my phone from my ear and investigated. Sure enough, I tapped the wrong button and ended up calling \u201cMe\u201d instead of Meredith in my contacts. But that was weird. That was my number. Why was someone answering?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUm, hello?\u201d I asked, bringing the phone back up to my face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHello, Mike,\u201d repeated the voice.
