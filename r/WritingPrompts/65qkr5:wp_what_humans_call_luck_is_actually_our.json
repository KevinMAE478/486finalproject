She was almost certain the higher-ups had dumped the K'renian scientist on her in some vague attempt at a political alliance but she refused to hold his hand during her examination. As far as she was concerned, if the K'renians were really serious about an alliance - and by all accounts, their losing war against the Human's unorthodox military technology suggested they **should** be - they had better have sent someone actually qualified in the field of Adoptive Physiologies.\n\nWhile Dr. Ferran familiarized himself with the recordings, Jeyn stepped up to the dissection table where an unconscious, female member of the Human species lay strapped down - all Human specimens were kept in chemically induced comas during her studies primarily for her own safety. Even with the VMD on standby in the event of a catastrophic Reality Collapse, her studies hypothesized that any single Human \"actively\" - previous studies suggested this was as simple as believing \"The Odds\" meant nothing - attempting to manipulate probability could pose an extreme threat to the entire facility.\n\nThe Human was oddly serene, Jeyn thought, as she watched the slow, almost rhythmic breathing of the specimen, machines calibrating to her medical heads-up display and manipulator gauntlets.\n\n\"Alright. Computer, I'm beginning the standard physiological tests. Let's turn the VMA up to 1.1 and begin recording.\" she began, turning her attention to the readings she was receiving of the various biological processes inherent to this lifeform.\n\n\"Confirmed, Dr. Jeyn.\"\n\n\"Note that as per all prior examinations, the specimen appears to be in near-peak physical condition as per our expected parameters for their species. There appears to be evidence of minor tissue and bone damage from past traumas, likely healed by some kind of advanced but imperfect regenerative accelerant. Breathing, heart rate and blood levels all look to be standard as well, given the amount of seditive.\"\n\nJeyn moved closer, bringing her gauntlets to rest just above the specimen's chest cavity before running them down the rest of the length of the Human's body, \"As with previous specimens, the Human does not appear to have any kind of organ responsible for the production of pheromones or any other chemical substance that could be attributed to Probability Manipulation. Beginning examination of the specimen's brain.\" The doctor moved to the Human's head, though she didn't have high hopes for this either.\n\nAfter a brief moment, the scans of the subject's brain revealed the same as it had before: there was no biological feature of any kind responsible for the Human's ability to manipulate local probability. Jeyn sighed, \"As per expectations, there appears to be nothing in their brains that allows them to do what they do. Computer, please switch the gauntlets to Pseudo-Metaphysical mode.\"\n\n\"Pseudo-Metaphysical... You can't tell me you've developed a machine that can scan for things outside of the bounds of reality, Dr. Jeyn. Abstractions have never been able to be recorded by any scientific measuring system in the past.\" Ferran interjected.\n\nJeyn sighed again, flicking her gauntlets through the air as hardlight projections of several readings came up, \"As I told your superiors Dr. Ferran, this facility deals in a wide variety of so-called \"impossible\" branches of science. What we do here can often be catagorized as beyond the limits of whatever you K'renians call Science. Now if you'll excuse me, this is a delicate process and a single mistake could lead to a breach with significant potential for damage, even with the VMA only set to 1.1.\"\n\nAs the displays cycled through several dozen different readings, something new caught Jeyn's eye. She scimmed through them again, hearts racing as she felt the telltale signs of a substantial breakthrough come within her grasp.\n\n\"Computer, create a simultaneous visual of all of these readings. Start modelling each permutation as well, I think I might be on to something but I need to see how each of these readings interacts with the others at every base-level.\"\n\n\"Confirmed, Dr. Jeyn. Models will be added to your heads-up display as they complete, required time for all projections is one hour.\"\n\n\"Actually, run them through an An'thera's Law model as well and bring that up first. I'll take the rest after I've looked at that.\" she added as an afterthought, watching the models come in through her display. The AI hummed in confirmation.\n\nBeside her, Ferran huffed, \"I absolutely cannot excuse you! What you're suggesting is that the K'renian and Orbik understandings of reality are-\"\n\n\"Far below those of the Manlak, yes Dr. Ferran that is exactly what I'm suggesting. To you, some of our processes might seem arcane - or as the Human's call it: magical - but I assure you that we are the foremost researches of this particular phenomena for a reason.\"\n\nThe K'renian started opening his mouth to retort when the hazard lights turned on, emergency sirens wailing.\n\n\"What is going on?!\" Ferran shouted, looking to Jeyn with wide-eyes.\n\n\"Damn it! I was so close! Wait, maybe this isn't what it looks like...\"\n\n\"Dr. Jeyn, what the stars is happening?! \"\n\nJeyn brought up the An'thera model, ignoring the warnings on her heads-up display, and started smiling.\n\n\"What is happening, Ferran, is that we aren't experiencing a breach. I can't believe the Human's Probability Manipulation could be so quick when amplified to only 1.1. The data we're getting now will take us leaps and bounds torward replicating this phenomena! Our Amplifiers and Dampeners were a stroke of genius, but this might provide us with a bluepri-\"\n\nThe doctor was cut off by an explosion that rocked the laboratory as the sealed doors were blown inward, throwing her and the K'renian across the room. Jeyn looked up as the smoke cleared, searching for the source of the intrusion as her ears rang. From the hole in the door, a pair of Humans emerged. The first, a female member of the species, moved to the table with Jeyn's specimen and brought out a small nanoblade, cutting the other female free. The second, a male, moved between Jeyn and Ferran, holding a blaster up to both of them.\n\n\"Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem.\" the male said, using some kind of speech jammer that didn't register on Jeyn's universal translator. The message was clear enough, though.\n\n\"How?! How the hell did you find us?\" Jeyn spat, \"This facility was beyond the reach of both the K'renians and Orbiks until we let one of them in! There's no way you could have fou-\"\n\nThe Human smiled at her, and understanding dawned.\n\n\"No... NO! That's impossible! You can't have... Did the Human species learn to control it? Can you manipulate probability at will now?! Tell me!\" Jeyn railed, voice breaking as her shouts echoed throughout the small room.\n\n\"Syt amet, consectetur!\" the female shouted, carrying Jeyn's specimen on her shoulder as she walked out.\n\nThe male Human nodded, winking at Jeyn as he turned to leave as well.\n\nJeyn scrambled to her feet, slipping as her ears rang, \"Sonofabitch, get back here!\"\n\nShe looked down at her feet, wincing as the metallic ping of a kinetic grenade landing stopped her.\n\n\"No... I was so close!\"\n\n***THOOM***\n\n***\n*End of record.

The AI hummed in confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beside her, Ferran huffed, &amp;quot;I absolutely cannot excuse you! What you&amp;#39;re suggesting is that the K&amp;#39;renian and Orbik understandings of reality are-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Far below those of the Manlak, yes Dr. Ferran that is exactly what I&amp;#39;m suggesting. To you, some of our processes might seem arcane - or as the Human&amp;#39;s call it: magical - but I assure you that we are the foremost researches of this particular phenomena for a reason.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The K&amp;#39;renian started opening his mouth to retort when the hazard lights turned on, emergency sirens wailing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is going on?!&amp;quot; Ferran shouted, looking to Jeyn with wide-eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Damn it! I was so close! Wait, maybe this isn&amp;#39;t what it looks like...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dr. Jeyn, what the stars is happening?! &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jeyn brought up the An&amp;#39;thera model, ignoring the warnings on her heads-up display, and started smiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is happening, Ferran, is that we aren&amp;#39;t experiencing a breach. I can&amp;#39;t believe the Human&amp;#39;s Probability Manipulation could be so quick when amplified to only 1.1. The data we&amp;#39;re getting now will take us leaps and bounds torward replicating this phenomena! Our Amplifiers and Dampeners were a stroke of genius, but this might provide us with a bluepri-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doctor was cut off by an explosion that rocked the laboratory as the sealed doors were blown inward, throwing her and the K&amp;#39;renian across the room. Jeyn looked up as the smoke cleared, searching for the source of the intrusion as her ears rang. From the hole in the door, a pair of Humans emerged. The first, a female member of the species, moved to the table with Jeyn&amp;#39;s specimen and brought out a small nanoblade, cutting the other female free. The second, a male, moved between Jeyn and Ferran, holding a blaster up to both of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem.&amp;quot; the male said, using some kind of speech jammer that didn&amp;#39;t register on Jeyn&amp;#39;s universal translator. The message was clear enough, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How?! How the hell did you find us?&amp;quot; Jeyn spat, &amp;quot;This facility was beyond the reach of both the K&amp;#39;renians and Orbiks until we let one of them in! There&amp;#39;s no way you could have fou-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Human smiled at her, and understanding dawned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No... NO! That&amp;#39;s impossible! You can&amp;#39;t have... Did the Human species learn to control it? Can you manipulate probability at will now?! Tell me!&amp;quot; Jeyn railed, voice breaking as her shouts echoed throughout the small room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Syt amet, consectetur!&amp;quot; the female shouted, carrying Jeyn&amp;#39;s specimen on her shoulder as she walked out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The male Human nodded, winking at Jeyn as he turned to leave as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jeyn scrambled to her feet, slipping as her ears rang, &amp;quot;Sonofabitch, get back here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked down at her feet, wincing as the metallic ping of a kinetic grenade landing stopped her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No... I was so close!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THOOM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;End of record.
