Her vision had started to cloud, her mind simultaneously panicked and hazy as she felt herself slip out of consciousness, and then... she had woken up. Shaking off the unease in the pit of her stomach, she had put the episode down to a simple fainting fit.\n\nOnce it had happened three or four more times over the next week, Anjuli had decided she ought to get it checked out. Her doctor was perplexed, but offered up a long list of possible problems - vasovagal syncope, situational syncope, anaemia, cardiac arrhythmias, even a carotid body tumour... And eventually, after several normal blood tests and even a test that seemed to originate from the middle ages, in which Anjuli was tied to a table and tipped upwards, she was finally, gently, given a diagnosis of psychogenic pseudosyncope. \n\n\"What in the hell is psycho- psychogen... that?\"\n\n\"It's not uncommon in people your age. Sometimes, your brain can play tricks on you, and make you feel as though you're fainting with no physical cause.\"\n\n\"I'm not fucking lying!\"\n\n\"I don't think you're lying.\" If that doctor's voice got any more calming, Anjuli thought she hit her. \"It's totally involuntary, but it's caused by your mind, not your body.\"\n\nBut protest as Anjuli might, she was sent to sit with gritted teeth through what felt like countless sessions of psychotherapy, counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy. \n\nOf course, a few months later, she was given plenty of reason to stop going. This time, when she woke up groggy and already irritable from one of her fainting episodes, Anjuli found a sheet of her thick drawing paper in front of her. Her eyes widened in astonishment as she looked down at it; a beautiful landscape had been sketched across the page - a sweeping river cutting its way across a lush, green forest. Anjuli let out a sharp breath. The details were simply staggering, right down to the curve of the wings of one of the birds flying over the treetops, and a glint in the river of a fish swimming beneath its surface.\n\nOver the week or so that followed, Anjuli woke up to more and more drawings, each more beautiful than the last. God knows she couldn't draw much more than a stick figure when she was awake - and even those were normally a bit lopsided - but she couldn't escape the conclusion that she had done this. Perhaps she just needed the rest of her brain to switch off to let her artistic side flourish and grow - perhaps she was in such a focused state that she simply couldn't spare the energy to form memories.\n\nAnd as she kept looking, Anjuli found yet more proof that she'd been awake, roving the house in search of inspiration. Just little things, but evidence nonetheless - an opened window, a half-eaten sandwich that she was sure had been untouched early that morning, a used toothbrush, a coffee-stained mug lying in the sink, and once, a slight opening in the hatch to the attic that she never used.\n\nIt didn't take Anjuli long to start selling her paintings. They were beautiful enough to sell in themselves, but with the story behind them of the artist who seemed to sleepwalk through the painting process, they sold faster than Anjuli could even produce them. A still life one day, a portrait of a sparrow the next, even Anjuli could not predict what would be coming.\n\nHowever, it was with a flicker of unease that she opened her eyes one afternoon to her latest sketch. She had recently been featured in a double-page newspaper article, and nothing that had been shown in the article, nothing at all, even came close to the portrait that lay in front of her. The trees that were customary of many of her paintings were still there, but dark and twisted, casting contorted shadows over the rest of the sheet. Red eyes peered from the darkness, their pupils slit-like and dead. And in spiky, twisted letters that at first seemed to blend in with the tree trunks, Anjuli read one word: 'watching'.\n\nAnjuli did not try to sell that painting. But over the weeks that followed, the hidden corner of her desk where she had thrust the offending landscape accumulated more and more pictures. A figure, stalking closer and closer, a blood-stained dagger etched with perfect precision, a dead woman with her hand falling over the side of a bed, her hair tangled and matted with blood.\n\nAnjuli started to dread her black-outs, in a way she hadn't since they'd first begun, afraid to see what she'd wake up to. The swimming head and tightness around her neck that always preceded an episode started to haunt her dreams, and she'd wake up drenched in sweat, gasping for breath with tears prickling the backs of her eyes. She began to spend most of her waking hours pacing around the room, doing anything to keep herself active and unable to slip out of consciousness. But try as she might, she could not keep herself moving forever, and when she sat down...\n\nThe familiar pressure appeared at Anjuli's neck. Instantly, stars began to swim in her vision - but this time, she leapt to her feet, crying out as her elbow collided hard with her desk. She spun round, and nearly toppled over in horror.\n\nA figure stood behind her chair, gloved hands stretched out.\n\nAnjuli shrieked, pressing herself further backwards into her desk, her arms tightening reflexively around her stomach.\n\n\"Who-? What-?\" She opened her mouth to scream again, but a hand clamped itself over her jaw.\n\n\"Quiet,\" the man hissed. His clothes were tattered, hanging loosely off his thin frame, and a days' worth of stubble peppered his jaw.\n\nAnjuli tried to shout, but only a muffled moan escaped against his hand. Her eyes flitted desperately around the room, at the sheet of paper that was held, slightly crumpled, in the man's other hand, and at the hatch that hung open in the ceiling of the corridor outside... Pieces started to slot together in Anjuli's head, and tears spilled silently from her eyes.\n\n\"I've had enough...\" the man whispered. His eyes darted dizzyingly to and fro, giving him a restless, unhinged look. \"My paintings were a payment to you, a thank you, if you like... I should have predicted that you would take credit for them, the swollen head that you have...\"\n\nAnjuli squeaked, her nails scrabbling against his fingers.\n\n\"I thought you deserved it, you being kind enough to let me stay here, to feed me when I sent you to sleep... But you were just using me, weren't you?\" His voice hardened. \"Living off my talent while you let me rot in that cold, empty attic.\"\n\nAnjuli tried to bite his hand, but she couldn't even get her mouth to open. She swung her fists wildly into his stomach, but he barely even seemed to notice.\n\nHis hand gripped her jaw painfully, and his lip twisted. \"No more.\"\n\nHis eyes bored into hers, a cold, electric blue. His spare hand reached up to caress her face gently with one thumb. Slowly, softly, it crept down to her neck, and began to tighten around her throat.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been happening for years, at least since she was in her mid-twenties.

Her vision had started to cloud, her mind simultaneously panicked and hazy as she felt herself slip out of consciousness, and then... she had woken up. Shaking off the unease in the pit of her stomach, she had put the episode down to a simple fainting fit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once it had happened three or four more times over the next week, Anjuli had decided she ought to get it checked out.

Her eyes were turned away. Jeffrey adjusted the hideous green-and-yellow tie, which, he decided, definitely had to go. Tomorrow he would buy something decent and give this *thing* back to Richie, even if the interview went badly. \n\n\n\"This time, I was in the elevator on my way up. Next thing I know...\" she trailed off, pointing at the covered canvas. Jeffrey tried to project comfort at her, relaxing his shoulders in the ill-fitting suit, and did his best impression of a soothing tone.\n\n\n\"Sometimes you get really caught up in an idea, you know? I've seen you just get distracted sometimes, and then it's like you don't hear a word anyone says. And it's like that thing, highway hypnosis or something? When you're driving a route you've taken a million times and you suddenly lose track of time and you're there already. It happens to me too. They call that highway hypnosis, right?\" \n\n\nIn fact, it had never happened to him, but he thought he'd read something like that once. Maria shook her head, dark hair shading her averted gaze. \"This is different. It's not...\"\n\n\nAbruptly, she strode over to the far wall, tautly controlled, and turned over a series of four paintings. Their surfaces had been pressed to the wall, heedless of potential damage, very unlike her usual careful treatment of her work. \n\n\n\"I've showed you the first two before, right?\" \n\n\nJeffrey nodded, perusing the set with genuine interest. He rubbed his newly clean-shaven face gingerly. He would still make the interview, he had two hours, no problem.  \n\n\n\"Sure, before you told me about the, uh, blackouts? I figured you were trying something new. I thought they were kind of freaky... with the shadows all twisted, and that's blood on the wall? But isn't there a good market for this kind of thing? Like... that guy, with the name I can never remember. Anyway, your stuff is fucking *awesome*, Maria. I bet you could kind of, carve out a niche for yourself, you know, like--\"\n\n\nThere was something in the last two pictures. They all depicted more or less the same scene: in the first, a nondescript wooden floor by a dusty window, half of a shadowed doorway on the right side, the corner of a picture frame visible on the left. It was obviously Maria's studio, and that would be the door to the closet where she kept rarely used tools, extra supplies and scraps of wood. Outside the door--in the painting, not in real life--were streaks of what appeared to be blood, trailing down the doorframe and into the closet as if dragged by a despairing hand. Strange angular shadows gave the image a curiously offputting quality--Jeffrey, whose interest in visual art other than Maria's rarely went farther than taking pictures with his cellphone camera, wasn't sure why. Something to do with the perspective, perhaps.\n\n\nThe second picture showed the same corner of the studio, but the shadows seemed to fall differently--and a larger portion of the darkened doorway was visible. \n\n\nThe third presented the doorway in full, and two strange, textured dots in the center of the darkness. Some shade of purple, or maroon?  \n\n\nThe fourth one added the indistinct outline of a figure squatting in the doorway. Those oddly-colored dots were its eyes. Frankly, Jeffrey found it disturbing... something about the silhouette was seriously amiss. Perhaps whatever nightmare vision Maria had captured here would prove profitable, but he could not call it pleasant to look at. The thing in the doorway was holding something limp at the end of one of its outstretched limbs, dangling from what might be claws.\n\n\n\"I didn't want to tell you at first because it scared me. I thought I might have a brain tumor or something... I've never had anything like this happen before. But they were *good*, the paintings were *good*, so I didn't say anything and I just kept going. Then, even when I did the fourth one, I told myself nothing was wrong. I figured it was just like sleepwalking, or sleep sex, or the... highway hypnosis, like you said, and maybe I was unconsciously imitating one of those people who do horror artwork, even though I don't really like that stuff. But then--\" her voice began to tremble as she neared the end. Jeffrey took a step towards her but she backed away, keeping him at a distance. \n\n\n\"Then I woke up after painting the fifth one, I woke up holding the brush and looked at it and--that's not me. That's not something I would ever imagine. It wasn't *right*. So I called you.\" Her face crumpled. \"I called you. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\nShe sounded so forlorn that Jeffrey wanted to take her in his arms, to tell her everything was going to be ok, but something about the set of her shoulders stopped him. He looked again at the covered canvas. Maria was looking away from him, away from the paintings. Something was wrong. \n\n\n\"I called you, and I just wanted you to come so I wouldn't be alone, with your stupid leather jacket and your stupid beard and... I just wanted you to come. But then I saw you.\" She glanced at him for a moment, for the first time since she'd brought him into the studio, then looked away, as if the sight hurt her.\n\n\n\"Wait a minute--you're upset about the way I *look*?\" Jeffrey sputtered in confusion. \"Like I told you, I have the interview for the office gig, and it's not like they're going to hire Mr. Hell's Angels--this is my brother's stupid cheap suit. I'm going to get another one! So you painted a bad dream, it's weird... but come on, what's the big deal?\" \n\n\nMaria, still refusing to look at him, pointed at the covered canvas. With a sigh, Jeffrey grasped one corner of the covering sheet and pulled it off in a single motion. Then he stared for quite a while.\n\n\nThe fifth painting displayed almost the same scene as the previous one. The same room, the same doorway, the same bloody markings on the wall. But this time, no light came through the window. It was black outside; the entire room was cast into shadow. Yet what lay behind the doorway was clearly visible: it was not Maria's supply closet. It was somewhere else entirely. And the figure inside it, the horrible, leering figure--\n\n\nWas holding an ugly, green-and-yellow tie in its dripping claw.\n\n\nOutside, all the lights went out.

I can feel the familiar darkening around the edges. I am receding as the blackness takes over, billowing over me. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t even have any canvases.&amp;quot; The abyss does not care. &amp;quot;This is just really not a good time for...for m-&amp;quot; I fall to the hardwood floor. My body stands up, leaving me on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I awake standing upright. I am staring at my latest work. &amp;quot;No. Goddammit. It looks like a murder scene in here.&amp;quot; I say to my other self, the one who can&amp;#39;t fucking control themselves, apparently. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wall of my living room is covered in a demented mural. Satanic goats, pentagrams, babies and such. &amp;quot;It really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a nice piece....&amp;quot;  I say to myself. Regardless of the dementedness and the fact that it is on my wall for Christ&amp;#39;s sake. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The door bell rings. &amp;quot;No. It can&amp;#39;t possibly be...&amp;quot; I trail off as I look at the clock. &amp;quot;Shit. Shit shit shit shit-&amp;quot; the doorbell cuts me off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hurry to the door. &lt;em&gt;What am I going to say?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I swing it open. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey!&amp;quot; they say amiably. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey!&amp;quot; I fire right back. It must have sounded a little panicked. They look a little concerned. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is something wrong?&amp;quot; she asks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, Mom, it&amp;#39;s just that...a pipe burst! My kitchen is flooded. We&amp;#39;re going to have to go out to eat.&amp;quot; I say, practically patting myself on the back for my ingenuity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh no! Well I&amp;#39;m sure that your father could take a look at -&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No!&amp;quot; I shout, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s fine, really. I&amp;#39;ve already called somebody and they&amp;#39;ll be here shortly.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They both jumped a little when I shouted. Now they look unconvinced. I stand in the doorway awkwardly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, are we ready to get going or what?&amp;quot; I say. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well you don&amp;#39;t look ready.&amp;quot; Mom says. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look down. &lt;em&gt;Shit.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; Blackout me found the time to change. I&amp;#39;m wearing an old shirt that&amp;#39;s speckled with old paint, and shorts that I&amp;#39;ve had since I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shoot. I guess I got so caught up with the whole pipe thing that I forgot. I&amp;#39;ll go change.&amp;quot; I slam the door in their face. I can&amp;#39;t risk it. They have gone to church every Sunday for the past 40 years. They can&amp;#39;t think I made that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I run to my room. My good clothes are piled on the floor. I pull my painting clothes off and throw them to the side. I am halfway up my pant&amp;#39;s zipper when I hear the door open. &lt;em&gt;Shit. Fuck. Shit.&lt;/em&gt; There is a spare key under the carpet! Of course I&amp;#39;ve told them about it before. They had to come water my plants while I was in Paris! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I run to the living room with my pants still unzipped. I find them staring at the wall. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not what it looks like!&amp;quot; I scream, not knowing what else to say. It is, indeed, exactly what it looks like. They turn to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s...about time.&amp;quot; Dad says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Son.

Though it is true that vampires as a whole tend to feel intense pride for and affinity to their heritage, they have also learned that discretion is the better part of valor, and that in a world where ordinary humans outnumber vampires a million to one, perhaps it would be wise to eschew the castle, abandon the stuffy upperclass pretensions, relinquish the telltale family names.\n\nIt is for this reason that I style myself as Dr Sara Benwick, a plain, unassuming psychologist who\u2019s barely making ends meet. I rely on my make-up skills to appear *less* striking, my office is on a second-tier property outside the city center, and I try not to get too used to my Swiss bankers addressing me as \u201cCountess Sevelline Belacuse\u201d whenever I have to make emergency withdrawals.\n\nI find it much harder to mask my professional skills though, and as word of mouth spread of my breakthrough successes with human clients who had made scant headway with their physicians, my client base grew disproportionately weighted with humans. Lest anyone accuse me of disloyalty towards my kind, I have always bent over backwards for fellow vampires, and this evening was not to be any different.\n\n\u201cYour next patient is Mr Jeffery Hrulum, miss,\u201d said Nancy, as she slipped the open file onto my table. The slightly-elongated \u2018plus\u2019 sign, neatly scribed on the top of the file, clearly designated this client as a vampire. My idea of a little joke, and yes, you are not the first to ask gently after the state of my sense of humour. \u201cIt\u2019s his third visit today.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, I remember him,\u201d I said, as a frown crossed my forehead. \u201cYou should probably set up the easel then. Mr Hrulum is likely to have brought along another piece today, just as I\u2019ve asked him to.\u201d\n\nNancy lingered, and I shot a severe look at her. I had hired her as a favour to my cousin, thrice-removed, though in truth I would have dumped her for a human secretary in a heartbeat. At least if humans were ineffective at their jobs, I could always arrange to have them\u2026 taken care of.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t dawdle, Nancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026 miss, you promised I could get his signature, the last time he came.\u201d\n\nI sighed, and rubbed my temples. \u201cFine, you can ask him when he leaves. But I warn him, if his condition has not improved, I highly doubt he will be in a state of mind to accommodate you.\u201d\n\nNancy scurried off excitedly, and I heard her call for Jeffery Hrulam through the thick oak door. In a way, I couldn\u2019t blame her. Mr Hrulam was undoubtedly one of the most-sought after celebrities in modern times, in both human and vampire worlds. The humans slavishly fawned over the masterful artwork he churned out, gobbling up every canvas which passed through his studio, while the vampires branded him our cultural saviour, a bold and daring artist who advanced the essence of vampirism.\n\nYou see, Mr Hrulam\u2019s trade, his call to fame, lay in the evocative hellscapes he painted. I\u2019ve seen them myself, not just those soulless reprints on the internet, but the originals themselves, set in frames which singed as they fought to retain the smouldering pieces they contained. His brushstrokes conveyed a dark magic which had not been seen in centuries, and the grip his masterpieces held over humans and vampires alike was second to none. \n\nThe first time he had unleashed his work on an unsuspecting public, legends say, entire crowds had been mesmerized for days, wasting away slowly as they stood entranced, trapped in a quicksand of spellbound enrapture. The vampire elders, fearing a good old-fashioned mobhunt, had to beseech that he tone down his genius. Mr Hrulam had cried bloody murder, claiming his artistic vision was being suppressed, but he had relented in the end, for the greater good.\n\nIt had occurred to me, more than once in the past few months that I have been seeing him as my patient, that only I knew the real reason why his recent work had been waning in potency, quality.  \n\n\u201cDr Benwick,\u201d Mr Hrulam intoned gravely, after he set his shrouded painting on the easel. His dark foppish hair bounced limply, and he seemed far weaker than he had been the last I saw him. \u201cIt is not working. It is getting worse, and I am at my wit\u2019s end.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow me, Mr Hrulam. I shall judge for myself.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, then wrenched away the covers on his painting with a flourish. Even in the dim lighting, the full force of his painting assaulted me immediately, beating my senses with heavy artistic cudgels. If I were standing, I surely would have stumbled.\n\nThe brushstrokes, the colours, the contrasts, the composition\u2026 they were all undoubtedly by his hand, his talented, once-in-many-lifetimes hand.\n\nBut there was no death, no destruction. None of the thousand wailing souls in *Despair*, his first breakthrough piece of a portal opening into Hell, offering a guilty glimpse of the world which lay beyond ours. Neither were there any tentacles, or hooves, or claws, or fangs, as there were in *Old Gods*, his follow-up family portrait. This was, truly, unlike any of the other hundred works he ever produced, every one of which was unadulterated nightmare fuel.\n\nIn this painting, there was a bunny, white and fluffy, in a field. In its furry paws was a stub of a carrot. The sun, shining brightly, illuminated a vast, verdant field. A smile of contentment hung across the bunny\u2019s face, cute, adorable, and extremely punchable.\n\n\u201cWhat horror have you brought here, Mr Hrulam,\u201d I said, hissing through clenched teeth.\n\nThe shroud went back over the painting, and Mr Hrulam buried his head in his hands, sobbing as he relayed his sad tale.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried everything you asked me to do, Dr Benwick, I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ve travelled back home to reacquaint myself with the bloodshed we spilled, I\u2019ve reread the classics which spoke of the eternal wars we must wage against the humans. I\u2019ve spruced up my torture chamber, I\u2019ve partaken of the blood of innocents\u2026 everything, everything that a good vampire must do!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut still\u2026 you churn out abominations like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do\u2026 I get to work, I lose consciousness as I always did, but when I awake, no more do my canvases carry the diseases of my mind! I only get unmentionables like this, all full of cheer and laughter and love! My assistant is disappointed too, but she says she has no control over me when I lapse into my work frenzies. Last week\u2026 last week, I even painted\u2026 a puppy\u2026\u201d\n\nThe bile rose in my throat, and I had to fight from gagging. If the vampires knew that their prodigy had come to this, if the human metalheads and horror aficionados learned that he was no longer able to produce his masterpieces\u2026\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d I said, as the gears clicked into place in my mind, \u201cyou mentioned an assistant? You\u2019ve always worked alone, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but after I kept hurting myself during my unconscious states\u2026 I hired her, just to watch out for me, you know? And to get me more Red No. 11, I always run out of that shade the fastest\u2026\u201d\n\nI flipped through my notes in the file frantically, and confirmed my suspicions. I was angry at myself \u2013 I should have spotted this, a long, long time ago.\n\n\u201cMr Hrulam, when would you say you hired this assistant of yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout\u2026 six months ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s good at her work, yes? Goes beyond the call of duty, watches for your welfare, cares for you? A little on the meaty side, shapely as like Venus?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 suppose\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when would you say your art pieces have become more and more disturbing?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout\u2026 six months ago, too?\u201d\n\nOn one hand, I was relieved. Mr Hrulam\u2019s gradual slide into insanity could be arrested, and I could be content that I had helped salvage one of the finest minds in our generation. It was always gratifying to be able to find a solution to the puzzles I faced, without having to beg for help from any of demons or Old Gods. It was a matter of professional pride.\n\nOn the other hand, I felt a twinge of sadness for Mr Hrulam. Perhaps it was true what they said after all, that it was our most tortured artists and geniuses who produced the most groundbreaking, redefining pieces of art.\n\n\u201cMr Hrulam, I may have gotten it wrong. The solution does not lie in steeping you in darkness again, we\u2019ve obviously tried that and it isn\u2019t working. The problem, it seems, is one of your own doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me! Tell me what I\u2019ve done wrong!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, Mr Hrulam, you\u2019ve quite clearly fallen in love!\u201d\n\n---\n\n/r/rarelyfunny", "edited": 1492362272.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vampires, contrary to common perception, are far more adaptable than popular media give them credit for.

It wasn't always like this, just last month I had painted a really cute dog, it fetched quite a bit of attention at the auction house.\n\nBut this was different, it was darker, more sinister. I felt... anxious when I looked at it. I couldn't explain what I felt if I tried, it was a painting of the city I lived in. It was dimly lit and the colors were desaturated. The previous painting was of the rural area outside of city limits. I felt a little sick, so I decided to lock up the studio and take a break, maybe I'm using this power too much and it's sapping my positivity or something like that.\n\nI put the key away up high and tried to relax. I flipped on the television but the first thing to pop up was a news bit about some weird death a couple dozen miles away.

I had considered getting rid of the T.V. altogether, but it felt normal to have this connection to something other than a canvas. \n\nThe show ended with some dopey life lesson about trusting your friends, I laughed out loud. I never really had a lot of those, I didn't feel comfortable being around other people, like my only purpose to them was to paint pretty pictures. I turned off the T.V. and walked to the bathroom where I brushed my teeth and washed my face before noticing my own reflection in the mirror. I was looking rather gaunt. My normal flush complexion and full cheeks had turned to ghostly white flesh and my jawline was now visible.\n\n\"Maybe I ought to eat better...\" I trailed off.\n\nI hadn't really been eating a lot. Maybe that's why my paintings were turning sad. I wasn't treating my body right and my unconcious mind was suffering for it. This theory set me at peace a bit and I promised I would treat myself tomorrow. I climbed into bed feeling exhausted. I drifted asleep after gazing at the ceiling for what seemed like hours, although I wasn't keeping track.\n\nI awoke the next morning sore and stiff. I felt strange, I looked around and noticed I was on the floor, had I fallen off the bed? I felt around for my glasses. My hands searched nearby until I gripped the frame and put them on. I jumped back as I saw the horror that lay before me. I was in my studio. A new painting towering over me on the easel. My breathing slowed as I began to calm myself.\n\nThis has happened before, but this time felt different, it felt scary and I felt uncomfortable in my own skin. For once I didn't feel in control. I rose to greet this new painting. It was so real, like a photograph. It was my street. I could see my building in the background. Freaky. I picked it up and put it with the other one. I needed to get out for a bit.\n\nI walked out to down the street. I came to the spot of the painting's perspective. I felt nervous standing there. I felt like crying just looking out over the street. I wiped my eye and walked out to a nearby caf\u00e9, I sat down and had a great breakfast. Plenty of delicious treats to choose from and I was starving.\n\n\"Two sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast croissant sandwiches please. Oh, and a coffee, two cream, two sugars.\" I recited to the barista.\n\nShe called back to the kitchen and I took my seat. Within minutes my order was ready and I seriously pigged out. It felt so good to eat and I was in total bliss for the duration of my meal. I felt awesome after washing the last of my food down with a hot coffee. Maybe that's what I really needed was a delicious hearty meal. I felt like painting again really badly so I jogged back to my apartment. I cracked open a few windows and opened the curtains. My studio felt alive, it was cheerful and bright. I was in the perfect mood to paint.\n\nI proceeded to pick up a brush and focus. I learned to control it in order to induce the blackouts. I focused hard and breathed in time with the breeze outside of the window and drifted off. I could feel something take over my body and begin to move just as I faded away.\n\nMy eyes opened. I couldn't tell the passage of time. But it was dim in the studio. My body finished the last stroke as my brain reactivated. I peered closely at the image before me. My attitude from earlier drained from me. It was replaced by panic. The image splayed out before my eyes was... me, sitting in this exact moment staring at this exact painting from behind. It was so real, I felt like I could tap myself on the shoulder if I touched the canvas. I turned around slowly, my mind racing with the plots of a thousand horror films. Tears streamed down my face when I looked.\n\n\"I'm here for my paintings\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning, very, very, very long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hm, why is it like this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rose from the stool and gripped the edges of the painting gingerly as to not smudge the damp canvas.

For once I didn&amp;#39;t feel in control. I rose to greet this new painting. It was so real, like a photograph. It was my street. I could see my building in the background. Freaky. I picked it up and put it with the other one. I needed to get out for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked out to down the street. I came to the spot of the painting&amp;#39;s perspective. I felt nervous standing there. I felt like crying just looking out over the street. I wiped my eye and walked out to a nearby caf\u00e9, I sat down and had a great breakfast. Plenty of delicious treats to choose from and I was starving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Two sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast croissant sandwiches please. Oh, and a coffee, two cream, two sugars.&amp;quot; I recited to the barista.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She called back to the kitchen and I took my seat. Within minutes my order was ready and I seriously pigged out. It felt so good to eat and I was in total bliss for the duration of my meal. I felt awesome after washing the last of my food down with a hot coffee. Maybe that&amp;#39;s what I really needed was a delicious hearty meal. I felt like painting again really badly so I jogged back to my apartment. I cracked open a few windows and opened the curtains. My studio felt alive, it was cheerful and bright. I was in the perfect mood to paint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I proceeded to pick up a brush and focus. I learned to control it in order to induce the blackouts. I focused hard and breathed in time with the breeze outside of the window and drifted off. I could feel something take over my body and begin to move just as I faded away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My eyes opened. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell the passage of time. But it was dim in the studio. My body finished the last stroke as my brain reactivated. I peered closely at the image before me. My attitude from earlier drained from me. It was replaced by panic. The image splayed out before my eyes was... me, sitting in this exact moment staring at this exact painting from behind. It was so real, I felt like I could tap myself on the shoulder if I touched the canvas. I turned around slowly, my mind racing with the plots of a thousand horror films. Tears streamed down my face when I looked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m here for my paintings&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgczko5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492425576.0, "created_utc": 1492396776.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p0ek", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p0ek", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcpuqs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SchroedingersHat", "parent_id": "t1_dgcp43u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Save the girl, save the plot\n\n.....who am I kidding, some things are beyond saving.\n\nYour story was good though.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save the girl, save the plot&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.....who am I kidding, some things are beyond saving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your story was good though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgcpuqs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492412403.0, "created_utc": 1492383603.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcp43u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MetaCloneHashtag", "parent_id": "t3_65p0ek", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I felt the rubber still on my arm, the taste of bile was still in my mouth.

It soon became a stream, though the paintings were not yet unveiled. \n\nWaiters moved through the gathering crowd carrying trays of champagne flutes. I lifted one, needing something for my hands to fiddle with. The alcohol is a secondary thought, but it should help. \n\nLaura nudged me gently in the side. Following her gaze, I saw Gregg looking over at us. He offered a wave, which I returned with less enthusiasm than Laura did. \n\nI pinched her arm. \"Stop it.\"\n\n\"He likes you,\" she said. \"Go over and talk to him before all this starts.\"\n\n[Now]\n\nHer smile is disarming and it's hard to say no, but I've learned not to trust a smile. \n\n\"I'm taken,\" I said. \n\n\"You keep saying that. Haven't met him yet.\"\n\n\"One day.\" It was my turn to smile and it came easily. I drank some more champagne. \n\n\"Nervous?\"\n\n\"Better.\" I waggled the flute. \"This seems to be helping.\"\n\nI have never liked crowds and I could never tell her why, not the real reason anyway. I felt a headache coming on; nothing to do with the champagne. Mind overcrowded with things that were still happening somewhere in time behind me.\n\n[Before] \n\nI always keep a neat space, unlike the rest of my house; strewn with empty pots, cans and wrappers; the basement is pristine. The light could be better, but I make do. \n\nCanvas covered by stained sheets line one wall. \n\n\"My other paintings,\" I explain to Lucia. \"Unfinished.\"\n\n\"You work on a few at once?\"\n\n\"I like it that way.\" I spare the hidden paintings a glance. \"Sometimes things come back from one and then another\"\n\n\"The dreams?\"\n\n\"I don't dream. There's just...nothing.\"\n\nI look back at her, trying to read her expression. She probably thinks I take drugs, but that isn't why I black out. \n\n\"You don't remember?\"\n\n\"Just feelings.\" I move to the closest painting and remove the sheet, letting it puddle on the floor. \n\nLucia steps closer to look. Even for me the style is hard to define. Contemporary, but also expressive and figuartive, bordering on impressionism. The shapes lack hard lines, the colors bleed into each other as they were painted \u2013 smeared \u2013 on. \n\n\"Who is she?\" Lucia asks, lifting her glasses above her nose. \n\nThe woman is thin, too thin to be healthy or even alive. Her arms are more like sticks draped in skin, rather than flesh and blood. Pallid skin, washed out to dirty grey matching the murky water she's stepping into. The water is illuminated by what I feel can only be moonlight. Her face stands empty because I haven't painted it yet; a blank oval framed by strands of black hair. \n\n\"The lake has an old name,\" I say. \n\nLucia turns to me, \"What?\"\n\n\"I don't know. She's going to be baptized in it.\" Nothing about the scene suggests anything holy, but I don't voice the idea. \n\n\"When will you finish it?\"\n\n\"Now, I suppose.\"\n\nLucia steps back from the canvas, arm motioning me forward. This is something she rarely gets to see; a critic seeing a piece finished. \n\nMy board, brushes and a scalpel sit on a sideboard. Lifting them, I step to the painting and begin mixing oils from those arrayed in front of the canvas. \n\nThe basement's sole bare light bulb begins to buzz loud enough for me to hear. I face Lucia, but she doesn't seem to notice. \nWhy is the scalpel there? \n\nI notice the slice across my thumb. When did that happen?\n\nSeomthing tightens around my pelvis, tight between my thighs and pushing up against my stomach. I can taste something in the back of my throat. Along the bottom of the canvas, the water no longer has the texture of paint. The figure's posture seems to have changed, like she'S impatient. \n\n\"The lake is a door. He sees and so does she.\"\n\n\"What?\" \n\nMy head is hot and cold, a think film of sweat stands out on my forehead. The light drones like a cloud of flies, drowning out my own breathing. \n\nI turn, and never hear Lucia scream. \n\n[Now]\n\nOne by one, they uncovered the paintings, beginning in one room and moving to another so the crowd is funneled in one direction. The first dozen or so were simple enough: landscapes. Not what they want to see, but they're still drawn in. \n\nThey have the same blurring of lines, the same figurative elements that lend each the quality of something Other. Something elemental and ethereal. The pictures \u2013 even these, before the dreams - speak to people. They make them think of places we can never go, but which could be all too real.\n\nLaura seemed impressed, though later she wouldn't be able to say why exactly and her write-up will be filled with abstracts. Only suggestions of feelings and ideas, but little in the way of in-depth analysis; even the ideas will be difficult to capture. It will be enough to entice people, which I think is the point.\n\nDraining my second glass of champagne gave me the legs to carry on. \n\nI glance from the canvas to Lucia, brush hand moving on its own. As I put paint to canvas, filling in the face, coloured smoke drifts into the sclera of Lucia's eyes. It seems to burn at the edges as though corrosive. \n\nI wonder who else might have been here in the basement with me and why I am awake for this and not three others there must have been. \n\nThe light in the room dims, though the bulb burns with the same intensity as before. \n\nThe woman in the painting has a face now: black lined eyes and mouth. A theatre mask half turned to the audience, so no one can tell if it's a mask of comedy or tragedy. \n\nOn the floor, Lucia flops and writhes; a fish tossed onto land. She finally sits up, her arms limp at her sides and looks at me, though she can\u2019t see anymore. I know because of the way she stares, unblinking and unseeing, even though she\u2019s looking right at me.\n\nA theatre mask half turned. Comedy or tragedy, but more like a scream frozen at the moment before it breaks from the woman\u2019s throat.\n\nShe looks at me and I realize why I am still conscious. \n\n[Now]\n\nI\u2019m not drunk by the end, but tipsier than I should have been. If Laura noticed \u2013 and she must - then she said nothing about it. The headache from earlier had subsided to a tiny throb in the base of my skull.\n\nWe were with the crowd in the main room of the gallery. All the paintings were uncovered. The faces looked out at me as if trying to remember where they saw me last. I think each of them knew who I was, but couldn\u2019t place me exactly.\n\nWhen they didn\u2019t move, I was almost disappointed, but more grateful than anything else. Being carried away screaming wouldn\u2019t be the best way to end the night \u2014 though at this point, I\u2019m not sure what would be.\n\nFinally, Lucia arrived. She was just suddenly in the crowd where she wasn\u2019t before, moving in from the edges. She used a cane to guide her, and its gentle tapping was the first sign that she\u2019s here. The crowd parted and a small wave of applause built, most likely kept low so as not to startle her. Her white hair suited her now. Her face was aged, as though it had caught up to the grey curtains framing it. \n\nLaura pressed forward, tugging me along. I was just tipsy enough that I couldn\u2019t muster the strength to fight. \n\nMaking a space at the edge of the channel formed by the crowd, Lucia passed close enough to touch. She turned as her cane tapped my foot.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she said, smiling. \n\nOnly her eyes were the same as I remembered from the last time I saw them. They had the quality of shattered glass, and something else seemed to tug at the smile, like her lips were being slowly pulled wider by hooks only she could feel.\n\nShe no longer needed eyes to see, and the Other thing drifted behind her dead pupils. It saw me.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nIf she/it recognized my voice or my face, it did nothing. Only nodded and carried on, directing Lucia to where it needed her to go.", "edited": 1492386208.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doors opened and a steady trickle of people began to enter.

I think each of them knew who I was, but couldn\u2019t place me exactly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they didn\u2019t move, I was almost disappointed, but more grateful than anything else. Being carried away screaming wouldn\u2019t be the best way to end the night \u2014 though at this point, I\u2019m not sure what would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, Lucia arrived. She was just suddenly in the crowd where she wasn\u2019t before, moving in from the edges. She used a cane to guide her, and its gentle tapping was the first sign that she\u2019s here. The crowd parted and a small wave of applause built, most likely kept low so as not to startle her. Her white hair suited her now. Her face was aged, as though it had caught up to the grey curtains framing it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laura pressed forward, tugging me along. I was just tipsy enough that I couldn\u2019t muster the strength to fight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making a space at the edge of the channel formed by the crowd, Lucia passed close enough to touch. She turned as her cane tapped my foot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she said, smiling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only her eyes were the same as I remembered from the last time I saw them. They had the quality of shattered glass, and something else seemed to tug at the smile, like her lips were being slowly pulled wider by hooks only she could feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She no longer needed eyes to see, and the Other thing drifted behind her dead pupils. It saw me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she/it recognized my voice or my face, it did nothing. Only nodded and carried on, directing Lucia to where it needed her to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgcrhzr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492414665.0, "created_utc": 1492385865.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p0ek", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p0ek", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgctkiv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TotalFork", "parent_id": "t1_dgc3ebp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It would be easier to read if this were broken up into more paragraphs.

The only thing I could make out clearly was a face with an ever-changing number of eyes and a grin that spoke of anything but joy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t stand looking at it anymore. Every time I try to turn it away from me, I find myself turning it back around. Whenever I try to leave the room, I find myself carrying it with me. I tried to slash it with a steak knife, but my freshly bandaged thigh is testament to how that went, and I swear I heard giggling as I swore and cursed after stabbing myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t take it. It won&amp;#39;t leave me alone. It hurts just to look at, and it won&amp;#39;t let me stop looking. I want to stop, but I find myself drawn to it in a way, like it&amp;#39;s calling to me. I have decided to take my own life to escape. I only hope that there are no dreams in the long sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgcg3f0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492399543.0, "created_utc": 1492370743.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p0ek", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcgnkz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "osobdp593", "parent_id": "t3_65p0ek", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I woke up in bed by the sound of my alarm, boy last night must have been crazy can't really remember anything, went to the bathroom and saw my hands stained with paint, curious I went to the studio to see what have I painted in my black out, as soon as I turned the lights I saw the canvas beautiful greens on top, striking reds in the bottom, astonishing blues on the sides, and whole lot of brown in the middle didn't really get it it was like the whole painting was out of focus, confused I put it aside, maybe I could sell it as a piece of modern art, the day went by in a hurry didn't really do much either, next day the same painting in a new a canvas only this time it looks a little bit more detailed I can recognize some of the greens as a couple of trees and bushes some of the reds looked like kind of cloth the blues I thought were the sky on the side and browns still looked out of shaped, I wonder why do paints this my sleep and something inside felt weird about the whole situation, another day went by without me noticing. \nNext day I woke up at noon didn't even heard my alarm I'm in the bath the water is warm like I have just gotten in, I quickly got out not remembering how I've got there I try to remember what I did last night nothing comes to mind something inside me felt horribly wrong, suddenly I heard I little voice inside my head telling me \" do you remember going to sleep at all\" I realize I don't remember going to sleep try to recall what I did the day before and can only think that it went awfully fast anything else, I found my self going to the studio in the middle of my confusion, I turned on the lights and I am really afraid to look at what I've done this time is clear and I recognize this view I seen it a million times and its clear what I've done I call 911 immediately. \n\n- this is 911 how may I assist you today \n* yeah ummm I think there's been a horrible accident on rural route 68, fifteen minutes north out Pitluck town. \n-sir please stay where you an ambulance is on the w.. \n*no, send the cops no one is alive in there and please tell them I don't know what I did but I know I'm guilty and I'm afraid I'll do it again. \n-sir what is it that you do... \n\nI hung up the phone better not trouble this poor little girl, the cops will be outside my door in about 20 minutes, I looked at the painting one last time before going out and face what is outside my door and wait for the cops, it's the best work I've ever made and the best I'll ever do, it's sad this is my master piece the details are perfect the colors I can see them every time I close my eyes and the whole scene will forever be inside my head I will never be able to forget it nor will the 4 police officers that answer the call for an erratic man in the woods outside of town, I open my front door and there it is just like in the painting I just sat in the flimsy plastic chair by the front porch and wait for the cops I can see some of them still bleeding, the beautiful reds of the painting come to me, I can see the trees and the bushes perfectly capture in the painting, I hear a faint siren in the distance, they are coming maybe five minutes away, it's always so quiet in the forest, I can see the lights they are almost here. \nThe two patrol cars stopped the poor little Sheryl open her door and immediately vomit and started crying, she shouldn't be a police officer she isn't cut out for it.

While I was walking along the Savannah there was a strange woman. She looked like she was a native but the markings on her face where different. I decided to follow the woman seeking an adventure. She crawled into a small space just between two boulders, and I lost her. I tried to follow but once I peeked inside something hit my eye, and I blacked out. I woke up later on, with my right eye covered. The tour Gide was standing to the left of the cot I was it, staring. \"What happened?\" I blurted out sounding confused \"we had noticed you where not in the group, we had a search party go looking for you. We couldn't find you for 3 days, we went back to the spot where we lost you and found you handing by your feet. Luckily we found you in time.\" The tour guide Said with a worried smile. That's strange, I don't remember anything.. \n\nThe next day I decided to bring out my oil paints, I sat down and suddenly blacked out. I woke up sitting in the chair with my brush in hand, the painting was complete. It was the boulders but with a strange red tint to it, and also with a white light coming out. \"That's weird, I don't remember painting this\" there was a knock on the door. The tour guide came in with his bag in hand \"it's almost time to leave, pack up your things and we'll be off\" he said with a smile. I carefully put away my oil paint and put my painting in the bag, I was happy to go home and leave the memories of the woman and the boulders behind. When i finally Arrive home, to my  empty apartment in the city, I pulled out my painting and looked at it, I turned my attention to a blank canvas. I pulled out the paints and sat, then once again I blacked out. I woke up on the floor this time, I jumped up and took a look at the new painting, it was the same woman from Africa. Her face was beautiful, her bright blue eyes, the red markings on her face, what did it mean? I went to sleep soon after that, before I did I put the painting face down so I wouldn't feel like I was being watched. I woke up the next morning with a new canvas in my hands. I blacked out once again. I awoke this time by the window, the sun was setting, I must have been out for a while. Remembering the canvas I looked to the left, there sat the new painting. This time, the woman was in the small space between the boulders, in a cave. I'll never forget the thing behind her.. It was me, with the same bandage over my right eye, and the same clothes that I was wearing. I heard the floor creak, I spun around.. And there stood the woman, with the strange markings on her face. I now know what they mean. The marking that looked like a blade of glass meant death, the hands meant To, and the sphere, meant death to all.

I was going there to get a change in life.\nLately my paintings have been plain, a bowl of apples, lemons, grapes. I have had a hard time finding inspiration. While I was walking along the Savannah there was a strange woman. She looked like she was a native but the markings on her face where different. I decided to follow the woman seeking an adventure. She crawled into a small space just between two boulders, and I lost her. I tried to follow but once I peeked inside something hit my eye, and I blacked out. I woke up later on, with my right eye covered. The tour Gide was standing to the left of the cot I was it, staring. &amp;quot;What happened?&amp;quot; I blurted out sounding confused &amp;quot;we had noticed you where not in the group, we had a search party go looking for you. We couldn&amp;#39;t find you for 3 days, we went back to the spot where we lost you and found you handing by your feet.

You're the professor, I'm sure you are busy with many other students. I just wondered if you had any idea what this could be. I've been trying to analyze the paintings myself but they are just taking such a dark turn. David even died in one! Of course I didn't show him that one and got rid of it as fast as possible. No they've never been that dark. NO. I don't think anything like that could have happened. What's wrong with you? Don't even speak like that. DO NOT PUT THAT OUT THERE. I'm very superstitious. I destroyed those paintings. Do not lecture me about reality. Clearly your school is not accredited. I will be writing a complaint. I do not like the tone you are taking with me. You're disgusting.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPt arrived for session today. Appeared manic but rather jovial considering her circumstances. Last month pt asked to be placed in art therapy group. She had been doing well, painting fond memories and able to talk openly about her family. Seroquel dose was raised to 200mg PO each evening. Pt appears to have had some regression at weekly meeting today. Orderlies had warned that she was living in a delusion like state, this included talking about her family as if they were alive. I attempted to reason with Pt, however she refused to let go of delusion. Pt believes that family is alive and well at home and that the facility is some sort of school. Pt prefers to refer to staff as 'professors' and fellow patients as 'students'. It is recommended that Pt is refused access to art therapy and that her medications be changed to reflect the severity of her delusions. Standing orders for up 4mg valium PO and 5mg Haloperidol IM if patient continues to display erratic and dangerous behaviors.
