(Yeah, I know, okay\u2026it\u2019s just what it is\u2026 what can I say?) She\u2019s like, \u201cHey, Suze, how\u2019s the gizmo coming?\u201d\n\n  \u201cUh, not so loud, Aga.\u201d She\u2019s standing there her arms on her hips. She\u2019s tall, much taller than me so she towers above me tossing her long blond hair back and smirking the way she does. \u201cWhat?! Doesn\u2019t your mom know about the time machine?\u201d \n\n  I winced. \u201cDon\u2019t call it that. Better to stick with \u2018gizmo.\u2019\u201d\n\n  \u201cWhen do I get to go anywhere in it, Suzie?\u201d\n\n  \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201cGet in.\u201d So we snuggled in together into the tiny cockpit of the thing. It\u2019s sort of like a little golf cart but more enclosed and not so bulky and heavy. I set some dials. \u201cI hope this garage wasn\u2019t buried under a mountain or something in the past,\u201d I said pushing the start button and then everything went black. And noiseless but quiet \u2013 if that\u2019s even the right word \u2013 in a way that seemed to fill my head with a racket. Is this what they mean by \u2018white noise\u2019? In about half a minute though, we saw swirly lights and then everything started to come into focus. A lot like a dream \u2013 when everything seems to make sense even though it\u2019s totally screwy. \n  And then there we were. The garage was gone of course. And we were in the woods. We struggled out of the little gizmo. There was a creek about five feet away. And a path that led away from the creek. \n\n  \u201cShall we go this way?\u201d I asked Aga, pointing to the path.\n\n  She nodded and looked around. \u201cThis place does seem familiar though.\u201d\n\n  \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s my backyard.\u201d\n\n  We walked about half a mile and then we were in the town. The town. I mean, like, my hometown only smaller and no cars and dirt streets. The street is narrow flanked on each side by a row of houses. Only one I recognize. It\u2019s the county historical museum now of course. Two and half stories, about half a block wide. Nice.\n\n  A woman emerged from a doorway ahead of us dressed in a floor-length dress and a bonnet. \u201cWe probably should have dressed for this,\u201d Aga said. Did I mention we were both wearing little shorts and I was in a tee-shirt and Aga in a halter top? \u201cI\u2019m not even wearing a bra,\u201d Aga whispered.\n\n  \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I told her: \u201cI don\u2019t think bras have been invented yet.\u201d\n  \u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d\n\n  Anyway, the woman walked past us, sort of looking us over. \n\n  \u201cI just got here,\u201d Aga told her. She does crack me up. \n\n  And then we saw him. The guy who was going to change our lives. (Although I guess if you go back in time, whatever happens is going to change your life.) \n\n  He\u2019s wearing like a long caftan and one of those round Serbian or whatever caps \u2013 red with a dangling tassel. He has a bit of a little mustache and goatee. He\u2019s about late twenties or so. Tall. Handsome actually. And I could tell Aga was impressed too. He walks right up to us. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou two young ladies aren\u2019t from here, I take it.\u201d\n\n  \u201cAnd you are?\u201d Aga retorts. This makes him laugh. A good sign, I think.\n\n  \u201cI just got here from somewhere else. And I expect you did too.\u201d\n\n  \u201cWe\u2019ve been here less than half an hour,\u201d Aga tells him.\n\n  \u201cActually, I\u2019ve lived here all my life,\u201d I told him, \u201cJust not now.\u201d\n\n  \u201cThat\u2019s what I suspected when I saw you,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go to that inn over there. We can have a bite to eat.\u201d\n\n  \u201cMy mother\u2019s serving dinner in a few minutes,\u201d I said.\n\n  Aga gave me a reproachful look. \u201cYeah, Suze, in 2017!\u201d\n\n  I shrugged and we walked half a block up the street and walked into what looked like really a rather nice little inn/brewpub or what have you. We took seats at a table.\n\n  \u201cThis is cozy,\u201d I said.\n\n  \u201cYou have a bit of a British accent, I think,\u201d Aga told our companion.\n\n  \u201cI spent the sixties in London,\u201d he explained (and he made quotation marks with his fingers when he said \u2018sixties\u2019), \u201cthough I am originally from what you would call eastern Europe \u2013 in what is now known as the fourth century C.E.\u201d\n\n  I\u2019m like, \u201cWow! I\u2019m Suzie,\u201d I said, \u201cAnd this is my best friend Agnieszka.\u201d\n\n  \u201cYeah, my grandparents are from your neck of the woods,\u201d she told him.\n\n  He smiled and nodded. \u201cMy name is Peabody.\u201d We both registered looks of astonishment. He grimaced. \u201cOkay, I made it up or rather copied it from an animated television show.\u201d\n\n  \u201cI could use a drink,\u201d I said, dryly (ha).\n\n  Aga looked around. \u201cAre they going to card us?\u201d \n\n  \u201cIt\u2019s sixteen ninety-nine,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have rules yet.\u201d\n\n  So the lady came to our table and we all ordered beer. \n\n  \u201cSo here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Peabody said when our beers arrived and we toasted the luck of our meeting and took our first sips and Aga asked him what he was doing here in 1699, \u201cI have been traveling hither and yon\u2026\u201d he paused.\n\n  \u201cFor seventeen centuries,\u201d I interjected.\n\n  He laughed. \u201cWell, of course yes and no. I\u2019m only 28. So the time flies, as it were.\u201d \n\n  Aga is gazing at him, rapt.\n\n  He goes on: \u201cI am what you call a wizard. And I have developed a spell to travel in time and space. I have been here three weeks. One of the things going on here, however, is that they are having a witch trial. Really I would like to just leave but I feel like I should save this poor young lady from the trial before I go. This place makes me nervous. Since I myself am a magician and these people execute magicians, I am rather disposed to make an exit as expeditiously as feasible. Now that you are here, perhaps you can be of assistance.\u201d\n\n  \u201cA witch trial?!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cRight here in River City? We will be glad to help.\u201d And Aga nods vigorously.\n\n  \u201cTomorrow is the trial,\u201d Peabody tells us. \u201cFirst thing in the morning. Where are you staying?\u201d\n\n  I roll my eyes. \u201cI live down the street from here but the street hasn\u2019t been made yet.\u201d\n\n  So Peabody arranged for us to stay at the house of a friend of his. A very nice lady named Agnes. \u201cThat\u2019s just like my name,\u201d Aga exclaimed when they were introduced. They seemed to hit it off right away. Also Agnes loaned us some clothes since we had nothing to wear but our scandalously revealing come-as-you-are stuff. We spent the evening sitting up with Agnes and talking about life in Pleasantville (I made this name up). I told her that I lived there but then I had to stammer around since she had lived there, like me, all her life but had never laid eyes on me before. Finally we realized that Peabody had already told her about time travel and then I could explain that I too was a time traveler, that I had lived my whole life in Pleasantville born and raised. We got along really well after that. She was very cool. She was also upset about the trail coming up the next day. \n\n  \u201cIt is my earnest desire that you and my namesake will be able to assist in alleviating the danger that menaces poor dear Felicity on the morrow.\u201d\n\n  So the next morning we have beer for breakfast. (I think I like the 17th century.) And we go out into the street. Now there\u2019s about a hundred people out there, presumably out for blood. Peabody comes up to us right away. \u201cPleasant night?\u201d he asks.\n\n  I\u2019m like, \u201cYes.\u201d And my new friend Agnes takes my hand and squeezes it. \u201cReally, I\u2019m glad to be here,\u201d I said. And Agnieszka sidles up to Peabody and sort of strokes his arm. Things are looking up. \n\n  \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Mr. Peabody?\u201d Aga asks him.\n\n  \u201cIf I can just get Ms. Felicity away from the crowd, perhaps I can cast a spell and take her away. Where can I go?\u201d\n\n  I tell him he can take her to my house, which after all, is just down the street. I give him the street coordinates and house number. \u201cIt\u2019s a two story, wooden house painted white, on High Street between Elm and Oak Avenues. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\n  \u201cYour honor!\u201d Peabody exclaims, approaching the dais set up at one side of the town square (right where the Dairy Queen is now). \u201cI am representing Miss Felicity in this case.\u201d The surly crowd parts as our tall young hero strides towards the dais. \n\n  The judge, a dour looking old fart (as you would expect) looks down upon Peabody. \u201cAnd who, pray tell, art thou?\u201d\n\n  \u201cI am Mr. Peabody. And I represent Mistress Felicity in the case of the Crown versus Felicity Droughthaven.\u201d\n  \u201cThe Court recognizes Mr. Peabody,\u201d intoned the old bugaboo. \n\n  Then, suddenly and rather astonishingly, Peabody raised his arms and exclaimed: \u201cKlaatu barada nikto!\u201d And in a twinkling, he and Ms. Felicity vanished. In a puff of smoke? Uh, I\u2019m not sure, though it sort of seemed like that. \n  \u201cWhere did they go?\u201d Agnes asked me.\n\n  \u201cTo my house,\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a couple blocks away. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I took her by the hand and with Agnieszka following ran for the woods where my gizmo was parked. We jumped in, really a tight fit now but we managed and I pressed the buttons and in about 45 seconds, voila.\n\n\n \n\n\n", "edited": 1492311096.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Agnieszka comes into my garage while I\u2019m working on my time machine.

A lot like a dream \u2013 when everything seems to make sense even though it\u2019s totally screwy. \n  And then there we were. The garage was gone of course. And we were in the woods. We struggled out of the little gizmo. There was a creek about five feet away. And a path that led away from the creek. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cShall we go this way?\u201d I asked Aga, pointing to the path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She nodded and looked around. \u201cThis place does seem familiar though.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s my backyard.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We walked about half a mile and then we were in the town. The town. I mean, like, my hometown only smaller and no cars and dirt streets. The street is narrow flanked on each side by a row of houses. Only one I recognize. It\u2019s the county historical museum now of course. Two and half stories, about half a block wide. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A woman emerged from a doorway ahead of us dressed in a floor-length dress and a bonnet. \u201cWe probably should have dressed for this,\u201d Aga said. Did I mention we were both wearing little shorts and I was in a tee-shirt and Aga in a halter top? \u201cI\u2019m not even wearing a bra,\u201d Aga whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I told her: \u201cI don\u2019t think bras have been invented yet.\u201d\n  \u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the woman walked past us, sort of looking us over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI just got here,\u201d Aga told her. She does crack me up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then we saw him. The guy who was going to change our lives. (Although I guess if you go back in time, whatever happens is going to change your life.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s wearing like a long caftan and one of those round Serbian or whatever caps \u2013 red with a dangling tassel. He has a bit of a little mustache and goatee. He\u2019s about late twenties or so. Tall. Handsome actually. And I could tell Aga was impressed too. He walks right up to us. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou two young ladies aren\u2019t from here, I take it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd you are?\u201d Aga retorts. This makes him laugh. A good sign, I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI just got here from somewhere else. And I expect you did too.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe\u2019ve been here less than half an hour,\u201d Aga tells him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cActually, I\u2019ve lived here all my life,\u201d I told him, \u201cJust not now.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s what I suspected when I saw you,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go to that inn over there. We can have a bite to eat.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMy mother\u2019s serving dinner in a few minutes,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aga gave me a reproachful look. \u201cYeah, Suze, in 2017!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shrugged and we walked half a block up the street and walked into what looked like really a rather nice little inn/brewpub or what have you. We took seats at a table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is cozy,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou have a bit of a British accent, I think,\u201d Aga told our companion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI spent the sixties in London,\u201d he explained (and he made quotation marks with his fingers when he said \u2018sixties\u2019), \u201cthough I am originally from what you would call eastern Europe \u2013 in what is now known as the fourth century C.E.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m like, \u201cWow! I\u2019m Suzie,\u201d I said, \u201cAnd this is my best friend Agnieszka.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah, my grandparents are from your neck of the woods,\u201d she told him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled and nodded. \u201cMy name is Peabody.\u201d We both registered looks of astonishment. He grimaced. \u201cOkay, I made it up or rather copied it from an animated television show.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI could use a drink,\u201d I said, dryly (ha).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aga looked around. \u201cAre they going to card us?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s sixteen ninety-nine,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have rules yet.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the lady came to our table and we all ordered beer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Peabody said when our beers arrived and we toasted the luck of our meeting and took our first sips and Aga asked him what he was doing here in 1699, \u201cI have been traveling hither and yon\u2026\u201d he paused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFor seventeen centuries,\u201d I interjected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He laughed. \u201cWell, of course yes and no. I\u2019m only 28. So the time flies, as it were.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aga is gazing at him, rapt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He goes on: \u201cI am what you call a wizard. And I have developed a spell to travel in time and space. I have been here three weeks. One of the things going on here, however, is that they are having a witch trial. Really I would like to just leave but I feel like I should save this poor young lady from the trial before I go. This place makes me nervous. Since I myself am a magician and these people execute magicians, I am rather disposed to make an exit as expeditiously as feasible. Now that you are here, perhaps you can be of assistance.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cA witch trial?!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cRight here in River City? We will be glad to help.\u201d And Aga nods vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTomorrow is the trial,\u201d Peabody tells us. \u201cFirst thing in the morning. Where are you staying?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I roll my eyes. \u201cI live down the street from here but the street hasn\u2019t been made yet.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Peabody arranged for us to stay at the house of a friend of his. A very nice lady named Agnes. \u201cThat\u2019s just like my name,\u201d Aga exclaimed when they were introduced. They seemed to hit it off right away. Also Agnes loaned us some clothes since we had nothing to wear but our scandalously revealing come-as-you-are stuff. We spent the evening sitting up with Agnes and talking about life in Pleasantville (I made this name up). I told her that I lived there but then I had to stammer around since she had lived there, like me, all her life but had never laid eyes on me before. Finally we realized that Peabody had already told her about time travel and then I could explain that I too was a time traveler, that I had lived my whole life in Pleasantville born and raised. We got along really well after that. She was very cool. She was also upset about the trail coming up the next day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt is my earnest desire that you and my namesake will be able to assist in alleviating the danger that menaces poor dear Felicity on the morrow.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the next morning we have beer for breakfast. (I think I like the 17th century.) And we go out into the street. Now there\u2019s about a hundred people out there, presumably out for blood. Peabody comes up to us right away. \u201cPleasant night?\u201d he asks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m like, \u201cYes.\u201d And my new friend Agnes takes my hand and squeezes it. \u201cReally, I\u2019m glad to be here,\u201d I said. And Agnieszka sidles up to Peabody and sort of strokes his arm. Things are looking up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Mr. Peabody?\u201d Aga asks him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf I can just get Ms. Felicity away from the crowd, perhaps I can cast a spell and take her away. Where can I go?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tell him he can take her to my house, which after all, is just down the street. I give him the street coordinates and house number. \u201cIt\u2019s a two story, wooden house painted white, on High Street between Elm and Oak Avenues. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYour honor!\u201d Peabody exclaims, approaching the dais set up at one side of the town square (right where the Dairy Queen is now). \u201cI am representing Miss Felicity in this case.\u201d The surly crowd parts as our tall young hero strides towards the dais. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The judge, a dour looking old fart (as you would expect) looks down upon Peabody. \u201cAnd who, pray tell, art thou?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI am Mr. Peabody. And I represent Mistress Felicity in the case of the Crown versus Felicity Droughthaven.\u201d\n  \u201cThe Court recognizes Mr. Peabody,\u201d intoned the old bugaboo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, suddenly and rather astonishingly, Peabody raised his arms and exclaimed: \u201cKlaatu barada nikto!\u201d And in a twinkling, he and Ms. Felicity vanished. In a puff of smoke? Uh, I\u2019m not sure, though it sort of seemed like that. \n  \u201cWhere did they go?\u201d Agnes asked me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTo my house,\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a couple blocks away. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I took her by the hand and with Agnieszka following ran for the woods where my gizmo was parked. We jumped in, really a tight fit now but we managed and I pressed the buttons and in about 45 seconds, voila.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgbkemj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492339315.0, "created_utc": 1492310515.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hzlv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hzlv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hzlv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hzlv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbli3f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mistaque", "parent_id": "t1_dgb7opb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Improvement through practice is what writing prompts is all about.
