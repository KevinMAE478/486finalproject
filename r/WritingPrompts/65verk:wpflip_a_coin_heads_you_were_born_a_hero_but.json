Well of course not, the Universe is huge! He simply flips a coin.\n\n\"Heads, a man is born evil, lacking ethics and honor. Tails, a man is born good, full of righteousness. We go forth with free will, able to choose our own destinies, but underneath it all lies these base traits. The current of our soul pulling us towards ourselves. Many fight it and lose themselves in the process; they resist the call or cannot rise to the occasion. They awake on their death finding their lives to have passed in ritualistic automation. They are the core of our society, the backbone. Our mass produced machines built around interchangeable, uniform parts. So we grind the individuality out. \n\n\"Everyone is someone who just hasn't made it big. Someone with a great idea. Someone who can change the world. While our births come from coin flips, life is in fact played with dice. Weighted dice, but dice nonetheless.\n\n\"So I started my revolution. I found the others who hadn't been ground down yet.

We go forth with free will, able to choose our own destinies, but underneath it all lies these base traits. The current of our soul pulling us towards ourselves. Many fight it and lose themselves in the process; they resist the call or cannot rise to the occasion. They awake on their death finding their lives to have passed in ritualistic automation. They are the core of our society, the backbone. Our mass produced machines built around interchangeable, uniform parts. So we grind the individuality out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone is someone who just hasn&amp;#39;t made it big. Someone with a great idea. Someone who can change the world.

I thought you'd be in hiding after how royally you f***ed up yesterday\" said the cold voice. \"I need to eat. Have anything that pays this time?\" I replied quickly. I did not want to be here for any longer than i had to be. \"Sure, but i only have the one and i doubt you'll take it. A rookie already took it, but we haven't heard back from her. You're expendable, so check up on her. I'll buy you a meal if you come back alive.\" he said without a shred of emotion. \"I'll take it, what are the details\"\n\nI parked a block away from the target, she was just sitting there right out in the open. I know she's a rookie, but how dumb can you get? Her mark was approaching her rapidly. I left the car, i had to save her. Wait.... he's carrying... two cups? I gazed in amazement as the mark sat next to her, handed her a coffee, and placed his hand on her thigh. Well, so that's how she operates. It would have seemed out of place to return to my car so soon so i decided I might as well listen in. He seemed completely enamored with her, almost as if he had been drugged. He went on and on about her looks, her personality, if it was a part of her, he could not go without complementing it. I found it quite odd, while she was attractive in her own right she was far too plain to be deserving of such flattery. She just sat there, staring with him. Then all of a sudden she spoke. \"I know you're listening in. Why not take a seat?\" she was.... speaking to me? \"O......Okay....\" i fumbled. \"It's quite alright, he will be like this for a few hours. It's my power, it's how i operate. One small touch and i can alter his memories, even as he is making them. Should i give you a large mustache or a mohawk?\" I didn't ask for her to tell me any of this. How incredibly unprofessional, telling a stranger all of this. \"But you aren't a stranger, you're the Valtec's kid aren't you?\" so she can read minds as well. Cleverly left that out didn't you? Yes I am their son, no i don't keep in contact, yes my lifestyle is radically different from what most people think. \"Funny, I didn't ask you any of that.\" she quickly replied. This girl is infuriating. No matter, now that i know she's fine i can at least eat for the day. \"I'm leaving now, best of luck\" i replied. \"It's Bianca. My name.\" I said nothing and returned to my car.\n\nMichelin stars are awarded to restaurants with the best tasting food. If a restaurant is awarded even one people will drive for miles to taste their cuisine. It's supposed to be the best in the world. Clearly people with that opinion have never been starving before. Anyone who has been through starvation will tell you that no meal is quite as sweet as the one that breaks your fast. I mused as i wolfed down my reward for verifying her safety in the sanctity of the decaying shambles i called a home. That's when i heard it. Footsteps. The only sound to break the symphony of crickets, stray dogs, and the wind rolling through the fields of vastly overgrown grass. I quickly undressed. No one visits me, ever. This reeks of danger, i have to hide. *BOOM* At once, the annoying nuances of the countryside paled in comparison to the sound of my door caving in. My parents entered. They had found this hideout too, it seems. \"Come out Son, you have tarnished our reputation far enough.\" my father uttered. I quietly made my way through the front door and into the fields beyond. I ran as fast as i could to the sounds of my home being destroyed once more.   \nNaked, alone, afraid, and invisible i ran through the night. How long had it been since i had last used my power? Four years? Five? I can't recall. My power had been considered a breakthrough in selective breeding, a miracle the doctors had said. Until my childhood evaluations i was considered a prodigy and i thought my parents were the most wonderful people in the whole wide world. Then, the doctors told us the harsh truth of the situation. Every time i used my power my body would age exponentially. In the five days that follow the use of my power, my body would age the equivalent of three years of normal growth. We grew deathly silent as we all tried to count how many times i had used my power. Instead of being incredibly smart, tall, and gifted for my age, i came to the realization that instead of being a gifted eight year old, I was a rather normal seventeen year old. My father screamed that there was no way I could be his son, my mother cried that it wasn't her fault, and i ran. That was the day i turned twenty, and the day I left my old life behind. I had never agreed with them, with the life i was \"born\" into. I decided to rebel. Rebel against them, against society, against their immense expectations. With limited options, the education level of an eight year old, and even worse funds I couldn't even manage to leave my hometown. I drifted from place to place doing jobs for the organization and tarnishing my parents name. They had found me occasionally, and each time they tried to end my shameful life. I had lost track of how old I was. How many times had i used this power just to escape the people who created me? All of these things ran through my mind as my feet carried me through the night. I turned around to make sure i had not been followed, but instead of my fathers face i found the face of a girl. \"....Bianca?\"\n\n\"What a sob story\" as she pierced the silence with her words, the realization that she had heard every word shot through my mind. \"After i asked about you they told me that you couldn't even afford food. I brought some takeout in exchange for your story but *cough* your father beat me here.\" ......but I'm invisible. \"Yeah. Followed your thoughts. You aren't exactly quiet in there you know.\" she said through fits of coughing. I guess she wasn't exactly accustomed to running. \n\"Come on, lets get you to my place. We can talk there.\" That night, what i thought was just another trashed house and three years off my life became the beginning of everything.", "edited": 1492453084.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two faces shone before me in the moonlight.

No matter, now that i know she&amp;#39;s fine i can at least eat for the day. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m leaving now, best of luck&amp;quot; i replied. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s Bianca. My name.&amp;quot; I said nothing and returned to my car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Michelin stars are awarded to restaurants with the best tasting food. If a restaurant is awarded even one people will drive for miles to taste their cuisine. It&amp;#39;s supposed to be the best in the world. Clearly people with that opinion have never been starving before. Anyone who has been through starvation will tell you that no meal is quite as sweet as the one that breaks your fast. I mused as i wolfed down my reward for verifying her safety in the sanctity of the decaying shambles i called a home. That&amp;#39;s when i heard it. Footsteps. The only sound to break the symphony of crickets, stray dogs, and the wind rolling through the fields of vastly overgrown grass. I quickly undressed. No one visits me, ever. This reeks of danger, i have to hide. &lt;em&gt;BOOM&lt;/em&gt; At once, the annoying nuances of the countryside paled in comparison to the sound of my door caving in. My parents entered. They had found this hideout too, it seems. &amp;quot;Come out Son, you have tarnished our reputation far enough.&amp;quot; my father uttered. I quietly made my way through the front door and into the fields beyond. I ran as fast as i could to the sounds of my home being destroyed once more.&lt;br/&gt;\nNaked, alone, afraid, and invisible i ran through the night. How long had it been since i had last used my power? Four years? Five? I can&amp;#39;t recall. My power had been considered a breakthrough in selective breeding, a miracle the doctors had said. Until my childhood evaluations i was considered a prodigy and i thought my parents were the most wonderful people in the whole wide world. Then, the doctors told us the harsh truth of the situation. Every time i used my power my body would age exponentially. In the five days that follow the use of my power, my body would age the equivalent of three years of normal growth. We grew deathly silent as we all tried to count how many times i had used my power. Instead of being incredibly smart, tall, and gifted for my age, i came to the realization that instead of being a gifted eight year old, I was a rather normal seventeen year old. My father screamed that there was no way I could be his son, my mother cried that it wasn&amp;#39;t her fault, and i ran. That was the day i turned twenty, and the day I left my old life behind. I had never agreed with them, with the life i was &amp;quot;born&amp;quot; into. I decided to rebel. Rebel against them, against society, against their immense expectations. With limited options, the education level of an eight year old, and even worse funds I couldn&amp;#39;t even manage to leave my hometown. I drifted from place to place doing jobs for the organization and tarnishing my parents name. They had found me occasionally, and each time they tried to end my shameful life. I had lost track of how old I was. How many times had i used this power just to escape the people who created me? All of these things ran through my mind as my feet carried me through the night. I turned around to make sure i had not been followed, but instead of my fathers face i found the face of a girl. &amp;quot;....Bianca?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What a sob story&amp;quot; as she pierced the silence with her words, the realization that she had heard every word shot through my mind. &amp;quot;After i asked about you they told me that you couldn&amp;#39;t even afford food. I brought some takeout in exchange for your story but &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; your father beat me here.&amp;quot; ......but I&amp;#39;m invisible. &amp;quot;Yeah. Followed your thoughts. You aren&amp;#39;t exactly quiet in there you know.&amp;quot; she said through fits of coughing. I guess she wasn&amp;#39;t exactly accustomed to running. \n&amp;quot;Come on, lets get you to my place. We can talk there.&amp;quot; That night, what i thought was just another trashed house and three years off my life became the beginning of everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgdv1sk", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492481382.0, "created_utc": 1492452582.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65verk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65verk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdx6f0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jdm5544", "parent_id": "t1_dgdw11g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "*Black Knight POV*\n\nWith each blow, the heavens echoed.

Its...Jesse Greenman...\n\nI show up to Jesse's house and make a proposition. \"You know the buisness,\" I started, \"and I know the chemistry.\" I was determined to leave my family with enough money to live comfortably after my death. \n\nOne rolling meth lab and Spanish psychopath later, Jesse and i were finally employed by a high-end drug manufacturer. His name was Gustavo Ding. He owned a series of restaurants stretching across the midwest.

I had to save Jesse by killing Gustavo. I succeeded, and there was now a hole in the midwest drug trade that needed to be filled. \n\nOne year later, I was America's most wanted man.
