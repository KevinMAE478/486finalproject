A hero? On a Wednesday afternoon? \n\nShe snapped her fingers.\n\n\"I'm here to- *urp!*\"\n\nUltraman paused in his story. \"Did you say something, Rime?\"\n\nRime gave him an apologetic smile. \"It wasn't me. I think it's from outside. I'll just pop out to see what it is, won't be a moment.\"\n\nShe stepped out of the study and shut the door behind her gently before leaning back on it, taking a deep breath. She could feel the familiar weight of her mask clipped to her belt. It was designed to cover her whole face with dark, jagged crystals, all harsh lines and sharp edges, black ice as twisted and as dangerous as she was supposed to be. She put it on.\n\nRime briskly made her way to the hero she'd flash frozen in a cube of ice in her hallway. She couldn't\u200b quite make out the mask underneath the murky surface, but the costume was gaudy, the colors garish. She couldn't help but sigh. An amateur, but that was only to be expected - the veterans in the United League of Heroes knew better than to disturb her on Wednesdays.\n\nShe snapped her fingers. \n\nThe cube melted in an instant, freezing water gushing across the floor, draining quietly through the numerous storm drains she'd had installed. \n\nThe hero inside it coughed, a series of violent, hacking sounds, and Rime felt her lips curl into a sneer. She'd only frozen the hero for a minute at best. Newbies nowadays...\n\n\"Rime!\" the hero called - well, wheezed. \"I'm here to-\"\n\n\"Your name?\" Rime said. \n\n\"Stop you- huh?\" the hero faltered. This close, their voice was young, high pitched, still slightly squeaky. \"My... what?\"\n\n\"Your. Name.\" Rime said, enunciating the words clearly. She gestured at the hero's bedraggled costume.\n\nThe hero blinked up at her. \"I'm- I'm Phoenix.\"\n\nRime rolled her eyes. Seriously? \"Let me guess. You had some sort of traumatic incident in your life most likely due to a supervillain, a superhero saved you, and since then your lifelong dream was to become a superhero just like them?\"\n\nPhoenix stared at her, mouth slightly open, as though halfway through objecting but not sure to what.\n\nRime waited a moment. It was only polite.\n\nWhen no response was forthcoming, she continued. \"Let's see if I'm on a lucky streak. Lo and behold, you're one of the lucky few that get usable powers, you realize you have a knack for fire, and you have the brilliant idea to come here to try to get rid of me once and for all because I'm the President of the Confederation and hence must be the worst villain around, and fire, after all, completely negates ice? Or so you'd think, at least?\"\n\n\"Uh.\" said Phoenix.\n\n\"Did you listen at all during class? They teach you this on the first week.\"\n\nThe blush was a dead giveaway.\n\nRime sighed. \"Oh, dear. You went off to find me the moment you got your powers, didn't you? Did you have the costume ready made?\"\n\nIt was disappointing. The quality of fledgling heroes kept dropping with every passing year. There were just too many heroes convinced they were experts on fighting crime after reading a how-to guide on the internet.\n\n\"So, Phoenix,\" Rime continued. \"Usually, as retribution, I'd freeze you in a block of ice and keep you that way until the League realized you're missing, but my afternoon is already fully booked. I need to deal with Ultraman's latest attempt to foil my plans. Do feel free to come back around tomorrow if you fancy being frozen again.\"\n\n\"Ultraman?!\" Phoenix exclaimed, suddenly talkative once more. \"He's like... old, and washed up, and senile! He's not even part of the League anymore!\"\n\nRime had to restrain herself from freezing Phoenix - oh, but how she hated that name - right then and there. \"He's also been fighting crime for more than fifty years,\" she said coldly, \"Which you would know if you actually went to class. And when the League decided he wasn't useful to them anymore, they discharged him without so much as a pension or even a thank you. Fifty years and it meant nothing to them. The League isn't government funded. It runs for profit, and at the end of the day, it cares about money. The League didn't much fancy taking care of an elderly, senile hero... so it let him go.\"\n\nPhoenix gaped at her. It only lasted for a moment. \"The League would never do something like that!\"\n\n\"Ask the League where Ultraman's pension is,\" Rime said. \"Or Wonderlady's, or Crowstorm's, or any of the older heroes for that matter. The League doesn't care. But we at the Confederation remember, and we at the Confederation care - we have a caretaker rotation. The enemy of my enemy and all that, as they say, because the League most certainly hasn't been friendly in its dealings with its older heroes. One might even say it's been quite villainous.\"\n\n\"You're lying!\" Phoenix cried out. \"The League wouldn't do that, and you're just saying it because you're, you're a villain! And evil!\"\n\nRime had lost what little patience she had left for that conversation. \"If that helps you sleep at night, then by all means keep telling yourself that. Just remember to ask yourself why none of the League veterans ever come to challenge me on a Wednesday. Now get out of my lair before I decide I do actually have enough time to freeze you.\"\n\nA wave of her hand sent a barricade of ice slamming up from the floor, a wall of jagged frost that blocked Phoenix from her sight. \n\nRime stepped back into the study a few minutes later. \"Sorry, Ultraman. That took a little longer than I expected...\" she trailed off, finding Ultraman asleep in his armchair.\n\n\"Huh?\" Ultraman grunted, rousing himself. \"Whassat?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Rime said. \"Sorry for waking you.\"\n\n\"You younglings nowadays, and your nothing.\" Ultraman grumbled. \"It's always nothing with you. Back in my day, we didn't sit around doing nothing, we found ourselves something to do.\"\n\nRime smiled, turning away to hide it. \"I'm sure you did,\" she said. \"I'm sure you did.\"\n\n\"You kids nowadays have it so easy, sitting around all day.

And evil!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rime had lost what little patience she had left for that conversation. &amp;quot;If that helps you sleep at night, then by all means keep telling yourself that. Just remember to ask yourself why none of the League veterans ever come to challenge me on a Wednesday. Now get out of my lair before I decide I do actually have enough time to freeze you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A wave of her hand sent a barricade of ice slamming up from the floor, a wall of jagged frost that blocked Phoenix from her sight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rime stepped back into the study a few minutes later. &amp;quot;Sorry, Ultraman. That took a little longer than I expected...&amp;quot; she trailed off, finding Ultraman asleep in his armchair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Huh?&amp;quot; Ultraman grunted, rousing himself. &amp;quot;Whassat?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing,&amp;quot; Rime said. &amp;quot;Sorry for waking you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You younglings nowadays, and your nothing.&amp;quot; Ultraman grumbled. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s always nothing with you. Back in my day, we didn&amp;#39;t sit around doing nothing, we found ourselves something to do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rime smiled, turning away to hide it. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure you did,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure you did.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You kids nowadays have it so easy, sitting around all day. Back then, being a hero meant work! We had pride, a real pride in what we did, and...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg7cvtc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492105422.0, "created_utc": 1492076622.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8588}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65458n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65458n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65458n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65458n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7tjro", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 28, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rarelyfunny", "parent_id": "t1_dg7rzey", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you!

Kaaboom couldn\u2019t help but pause every couple of steps to admire the handicraft of nature, the fine, delicate details which were usually lost in the great flurry of activity that defined the city.\n\nA hot-dog wrapper, curling in the wind. A gutter rat poised to spring, eyes fixed on a stray morsel. A fully turgid, vibrating middle-finger, leading back to his grumpy, impatient brother-in-arms, Vorlax.\n\n\u201cNo, please, Kaaboom. Please take your time to inspect every little thing which crosses our path. Oh, is that a leaf I see there? No way\u2026 a *fluttering* leaf? Post-haste, my friend, let\u2019s check it out, I\u2019m sure Chronotron doesn\u2019t mind waiting for you at all!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s alright,\u201d laughed Chronotron, good-naturedly. \u201cI\u2019m used to people doing that. They tell me it\u2019s like a scene right out from some old classic movie, back in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nThe unlikely trio turned the corner, and the neighbourhood park loomed ahead. Vorlax glanced down at the poorly-photocopied map passed to him when he had first volunteered to join the roster, and said, \u201cYeap, we\u2019re here. This is where we usually part ways with Vortex Man. Sometimes he forgets, and invites us over for a cup of tea, but we usually decline.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? You guys feel uncomfortable getting so close to someone who\u2019s arrested you before?\u201d\n\n\u201cPartly,\u201d Kaaboom said, piping up from the back. \u201cMostly though, it\u2019s because we have to go check on whoever\u2019s designated as the bad guy that day. Vortex Man always says that he\u2019ll get home then call for the League to round us up, give us medical attention, but er, he frequently forgets.\u201d\n\nKaaboom knew first-hand the fraility of Vortex Man\u2019s memory. Once, after Vortex Man had subdued him and left him trussed up next to a tree in the park, Vortex Man had simply forgotten to follow through on his promise to summon the League for assistance, opting instead to return to his original program of strolling in the park. It had poured shortly after, which also meant that no one had noticed Kaaboom soaking in the rain for the next few hours.\n\nKaaboom and Vorlax had come up with a buddy system shortly after.\n\n\u201cWhat made you guys decide to keep tabs on Vortex Man anyway?\u201d asked Chronotron, as he ambled down the street, peering at the nameplates next to the entrances of the apartment buildings. \n\nVorlax responded first, and Kaaboom was glad for that \u2013 Vorlax had always been the one who was sharper, better with words. \u201cWell, Chronotron, you ever get cut off in traffic while you\u2019re driving, and you think to yourself, \u2018You bastard, if there\u2019s a fire I\u2019m saving you last\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not really. But if you\u2019re asking whether I ever think bad thoughts about others, then yes, I guess, sometimes. I\u2019m only human.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same for us, then, eh? We may be supervillains, but there are times we look at others, and we kind of want to do something nice for them too. We\u2019re not so different, Chronotron, life just took us down different paths.\u201d\n\nA certain hard-edged spite had entered Vorlax\u2019s voice, and Kaaboom thought he understood why. It was tiring to always have the world look at you a certain way, judge your actions before you were even done doing them. Chronotron wouldn\u2019t have understood if he tried \u2013 he came from a different world, where lines were always clear, and people were always worth saving.\n\nIt was different in their world. The way Vorlax told it, no one had ever actually told him that his powers were meant to be used for good, not evil. Powers were just\u2026 tools, a means to help him get what life had denied him from the start. Those who could sing got famous, those who were shrewd got rich, so why couldn\u2019t the empowered get what they wanted to? And so when Vorlax came into his heritage, discovered his ability to shapeshift, he simply proceeded to take from the world what was rightfully his.\n\nVortex Man had been different. The other superheroes, they were caught up with efficiency, putting as many supervillains behind bars as quickly as possible. It was always *wham, bam, in the lam* for them. Vorlax never revealed what exactly Vortex Man said to him the night the two duelled and the forces of good prevailed, but Kaaboom had an idea.\n\nAfter all, he too had been in the same position, vanquished and bloodied, body wracked with pain, when Vortex Man had extended a hand, open-palmed. Vortex Man had pulled him up, righted him, made him return the monies he had stolen, then bought him a mug of beer to take the edge off the headache.\n\nToo much time had passed for Kaaboom to remember what exactly Vortex Man had said that night, huddled as they were in a corner of the bar, but it was something along the lines of, \u201cSon, you can be so much more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is it,\u201d said Chronotron, stopping in his tracks, as his finger trailed the nameplates of a building near the end of the street. \u201cI think I recognise this name. Ready?\u201d\n\nThe three of them started up the stairs, given that the elevators couldn\u2019t work while Chronotron\u2019s powers were activated. Kaaboom kept closely behind Vorlax, and they worked hard at keeping pace with Chronotron, who seemed overeager to sprint upwards.\n\nThey turned a corner, and realised they were lagging behind. Chronotron was already a couple of steps ahead, hand on the doorknob, letting himself into the small, humble apartment. The plaques and trophies which adorned the surface of the kitchen counter confirmed that this was Vortex Man\u2019s abode.\n\nKaaboom braced himself for the worst, but a quick search soon revealed that there was no unpleasant discovery waiting for them. Instead, the only item which seemed out of place was a letter on the table, written in halting script. Chronotron scanned through it, then passed it to Vorlax, who devoured it as quickly. \n\n\u201cWell, Vorlax, what\u2019s it say? Come on, don\u2019t make me read it, I\u2019m not good with letters.\u201d\n\nVorlax sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s gone, Kaaboom. He ain\u2019t returning.\u201d\n\n---\n\nKaaboom and Vorlax sat on the bench in the park. Nature was in full swing again, birdsong trilling, fountains splashing, noisy kids screaming as they chased each other endlessly. The sun hung low, scattering its rays through the thick foliage.\n\nKaaboom briefly wondered if he would ever see the world through Chronotron\u2019s eyes again. The afternoon had bonded them, and he had invited the superhero to join them for a bit, but Chronotron had declined, citing urgent business at the League Headquarters. On some level, he already missed the good-natured beast of a superhero.\n\n\u201cI hope Vortex Man really enjoys the Bahamas,\u201d said Kaaboom, idly plucking the petals off a flower, the most villainous act he had committed that afternoon. \u201cHe deserves every bit of his retirement there.\u201d\n\nVorlax was silent, staring at the skies. Kaaboom spoke again, louder this time, in case Vorlax didn\u2019t hear him.\n\n\u201cI said, I hope Vortex Man really enj-\u201d\n\n\u201cDammit, Kaaboom! How dumb can you get! Vortex Man didn\u2019t retire to the Bahamas, he\u2019s dead!\u201d \n\nThe petals fell from Kaaboom\u2019s hand. The children, startled by Vorlax\u2019s outburst, and his momentary shapeshift into a starfish, the saddest creature he knew, ran off. The tears had begun to streak down Vorlax\u2019s cheeks.\n\n\u201cDe\u2026 dead? But the letter, it said\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe letter was a fake, you idiot! I should have seen it then, but it only just occurred to me\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Vorlax. You know I\u2019m not as smart as you. What do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remember when we got to the floor?\u201d said Vorlax, straining with the effort of remaining civil, \u201cwhen we thought Chronotron had suddenly sped up in front of us? That wasn\u2019t it. The bastard had trapped us again in another chronocage, just before we turned the corner. He was in the apartment before us! He must have found Vortex Man alone, passed out or dead, then cleaned up so we wouldn\u2019t see!

Your feedback really spurred me on to continue with this. =)", "edited": 1492099342.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a certain serenity which permeated the city, now that it was out of step with time, suspended like bubbles in ice, alive but not quite living. Kaaboom couldn\u2019t help but pause every couple of steps to admire the handicraft of nature, the fine, delicate details which were usually lost in the great flurry of activity that defined the city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A hot-dog wrapper, curling in the wind. A gutter rat poised to spring, eyes fixed on a stray morsel. A fully turgid, vibrating middle-finger, leading back to his grumpy, impatient brother-in-arms, Vorlax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, please, Kaaboom. Please take your time to inspect every little thing which crosses our path. Oh, is that a leaf I see there? No way\u2026 a &lt;em&gt;fluttering&lt;/em&gt; leaf? Post-haste, my friend, let\u2019s check it out, I\u2019m sure Chronotron doesn\u2019t mind waiting for you at all!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh it\u2019s alright,\u201d laughed Chronotron, good-naturedly. \u201cI\u2019m used to people doing that. They tell me it\u2019s like a scene right out from some old classic movie, back in the 21st century.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The unlikely trio turned the corner, and the neighbourhood park loomed ahead. Vorlax glanced down at the poorly-photocopied map passed to him when he had first volunteered to join the roster, and said, \u201cYeap, we\u2019re here. This is where we usually part ways with Vortex Man. Sometimes he forgets, and invites us over for a cup of tea, but we usually decline.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy? You guys feel uncomfortable getting so close to someone who\u2019s arrested you before?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPartly,\u201d Kaaboom said, piping up from the back. \u201cMostly though, it\u2019s because we have to go check on whoever\u2019s designated as the bad guy that day. Vortex Man always says that he\u2019ll get home then call for the League to round us up, give us medical attention, but er, he frequently forgets.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kaaboom knew first-hand the fraility of Vortex Man\u2019s memory. Once, after Vortex Man had subdued him and left him trussed up next to a tree in the park, Vortex Man had simply forgotten to follow through on his promise to summon the League for assistance, opting instead to return to his original program of strolling in the park. It had poured shortly after, which also meant that no one had noticed Kaaboom soaking in the rain for the next few hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kaaboom and Vorlax had come up with a buddy system shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat made you guys decide to keep tabs on Vortex Man anyway?\u201d asked Chronotron, as he ambled down the street, peering at the nameplates next to the entrances of the apartment buildings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vorlax responded first, and Kaaboom was glad for that \u2013 Vorlax had always been the one who was sharper, better with words. \u201cWell, Chronotron, you ever get cut off in traffic while you\u2019re driving, and you think to yourself, \u2018You bastard, if there\u2019s a fire I\u2019m saving you last\u2019?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, not really. But if you\u2019re asking whether I ever think bad thoughts about others, then yes, I guess, sometimes. I\u2019m only human.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe same for us, then, eh? We may be supervillains, but there are times we look at others, and we kind of want to do something nice for them too. We\u2019re not so different, Chronotron, life just took us down different paths.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A certain hard-edged spite had entered Vorlax\u2019s voice, and Kaaboom thought he understood why. It was tiring to always have the world look at you a certain way, judge your actions before you were even done doing them. Chronotron wouldn\u2019t have understood if he tried \u2013 he came from a different world, where lines were always clear, and people were always worth saving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was different in their world. The way Vorlax told it, no one had ever actually told him that his powers were meant to be used for good, not evil. Powers were just\u2026 tools, a means to help him get what life had denied him from the start. Those who could sing got famous, those who were shrewd got rich, so why couldn\u2019t the empowered get what they wanted to? And so when Vorlax came into his heritage, discovered his ability to shapeshift, he simply proceeded to take from the world what was rightfully his.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vortex Man had been different. The other superheroes, they were caught up with efficiency, putting as many supervillains behind bars as quickly as possible. It was always &lt;em&gt;wham, bam, in the lam&lt;/em&gt; for them. Vorlax never revealed what exactly Vortex Man said to him the night the two duelled and the forces of good prevailed, but Kaaboom had an idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all, he too had been in the same position, vanquished and bloodied, body wracked with pain, when Vortex Man had extended a hand, open-palmed. Vortex Man had pulled him up, righted him, made him return the monies he had stolen, then bought him a mug of beer to take the edge off the headache.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too much time had passed for Kaaboom to remember what exactly Vortex Man had said that night, huddled as they were in a corner of the bar, but it was something along the lines of, \u201cSon, you can be so much more.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI think this is it,\u201d said Chronotron, stopping in his tracks, as his finger trailed the nameplates of a building near the end of the street. \u201cI think I recognise this name. Ready?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The three of them started up the stairs, given that the elevators couldn\u2019t work while Chronotron\u2019s powers were activated. Kaaboom kept closely behind Vorlax, and they worked hard at keeping pace with Chronotron, who seemed overeager to sprint upwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They turned a corner, and realised they were lagging behind. Chronotron was already a couple of steps ahead, hand on the doorknob, letting himself into the small, humble apartment. The plaques and trophies which adorned the surface of the kitchen counter confirmed that this was Vortex Man\u2019s abode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kaaboom braced himself for the worst, but a quick search soon revealed that there was no unpleasant discovery waiting for them. Instead, the only item which seemed out of place was a letter on the table, written in halting script. Chronotron scanned through it, then passed it to Vorlax, who devoured it as quickly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, Vorlax, what\u2019s it say? Come on, don\u2019t make me read it, I\u2019m not good with letters.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vorlax sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s gone, Kaaboom. He ain\u2019t returning.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kaaboom and Vorlax sat on the bench in the park. Nature was in full swing again, birdsong trilling, fountains splashing, noisy kids screaming as they chased each other endlessly. The sun hung low, scattering its rays through the thick foliage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kaaboom briefly wondered if he would ever see the world through Chronotron\u2019s eyes again. The afternoon had bonded them, and he had invited the superhero to join them for a bit, but Chronotron had declined, citing urgent business at the League Headquarters. On some level, he already missed the good-natured beast of a superhero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI hope Vortex Man really enjoys the Bahamas,\u201d said Kaaboom, idly plucking the petals off a flower, the most villainous act he had committed that afternoon. \u201cHe deserves every bit of his retirement there.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vorlax was silent, staring at the skies. Kaaboom spoke again, louder this time, in case Vorlax didn\u2019t hear him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI said, I hope Vortex Man really enj-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDammit, Kaaboom! How dumb can you get! Vortex Man didn\u2019t retire to the Bahamas, he\u2019s dead!\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petals fell from Kaaboom\u2019s hand. The children, startled by Vorlax\u2019s outburst, and his momentary shapeshift into a starfish, the saddest creature he knew, ran off. The tears had begun to streak down Vorlax\u2019s cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDe\u2026 dead? But the letter, it said\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe letter was a fake, you idiot! I should have seen it then, but it only just occurred to me\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPlease, Vorlax. You know I\u2019m not as smart as you. What do you mean?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou remember when we got to the floor?\u201d said Vorlax, straining with the effort of remaining civil, \u201cwhen we thought Chronotron had suddenly sped up in front of us? That wasn\u2019t it. The bastard had trapped us again in another chronocage, just before we turned the corner. He was in the apartment before us! He must have found Vortex Man alone, passed out or dead, then cleaned up so we wouldn\u2019t see! He knew Vortex Man wasn\u2019t just a superhero, he was &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; superhero\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A headache blindsided Kaaboom, and fumes began to pour out from his shirt, the surest sign of agitation for a pyromancer like him. \u201cHow did you know all that?

Is it? Maybe... she's the one who usually tries to shake up the government right? Or was that Freyja? Where'd she get that name I wonder. Maybe it it could be a clue to her secret identify. Could it be a... What are those things called when you jumbled the letters and get a new word? Lisa would know I bet, my brilliant little professor. I should call her. When was the last time we spoke? At Mary's funeral? No, couldn't be. She wouldn't ignore her father so long.*\n\nCK stood in the midst of the trapped human stampede, lost in his disconnected thoughts. Austr\u014d made her way slowly through the crowd, grabbing people at random, stripping them of their highend jewelry and shoving it into a satchel she was wearing. The brown leather bag didn't quite match the Saxon warrior maiden costume she wore, but some times function must won over form.\n\nThe sky suddenly split with a mighty *crackoom*, and three strangely dressed people decedent from the clouds unto the scene. The ruckus was enough to bring the captain back to the world, but he briefly forgot where he was or why he was there. When it came to him, his anger rose.\n\n\"Now see here!\" CK advanced on the newcomers wagging a finger at them. \"The League has no business stepping in and sending people to things I already have covered. This is an insult to my  standing as a board member.\"\n\nOne of the trio, a muscle bound young blonde man wearing little more than bearskin underwear turned to the captain. The hint of a sneer played about his face. \"You aren't a board member anymore, Mr. Kaiser.\"\n\n\"That's CAPTAIN Kaiser to you, sonny!\" the elderly hero extended himself to his full height, and felt a twinge in his back. He fought to hide the pain and to keep himself ramrod straight before the indignant youth. Even so he barely came up to the nearly-naked man's Adam's apple. \n\n\"Fine, Captain. Whatever. The fact is you are no longer in the League and have no business doing hero work. Further, if you are so capable, why is it this scene was here for us to arrive to?\"He gestured about himself.\"\n\nAustr\u014d stood watching the encounter since the mighty boom crashed down from the sky to reverberate off the mansion walls. Now, growing bored, she stepped forth. \"Ahem. I presume you four are from the League?\" \n\nCK responded by trying to shout \"I was here first\", but the walking bicep in animal cloth was louder.  \"Three. the three of us are from the League. This geezer has nothing to do with us. Pay him no mind.\" \n\nAustr\u014d grinned. \"I don't think  I should pay any of you any mind.\" She turned and grabbed the nearest base human, ripped an emerald necklace from her throat. \n\nThe ensuing altercation was over nearly before it began. CK could barely follow it as the League trio bolted at Austr\u014d. She laid them all out in a matter of seconds, then turned to face him, poised for combat. \n\n\"These three couldn't stop me. Do the smart thing and walk away, old man.\" \n\nCaptain Kaiser, snapped to attention, clicked his heels together twice and saluted. \"You fought those three well young miss. But you will find the Kaiser a worthier foe!\" \n\nThe captain ran forward suddenly and swung hard. Austr\u014d had just enough time to parry the blow and strike out with her own left hook as a counter. CK deflected the shot with his elbow and lashed out again. \n\nFor over half an hour the two swung, parried, and grappled with each other. The Captain landed few hits, but allowed even fewer to strike himself. Finally, he managed to get Austr\u014d into a submission lock. \"Give in now and I promise the League will take it into consideration when picking out your confinement cell.\" \n\nWith sudden and astonishing strength, Austr\u014d broke from the lock. \"Damn you\" Was all she had to say before gaining a running leap, and flying off to the south. The League trio were just coming to. The satchel full of precious stone and metals had fallen to the ground in the struggle, and the contents given back to their rightful owners. \n\n...\n\nCaptain Kaiser, more commonly called Hans in his secret daily life, sat in his rocking chair on the porch and waited for his daughter, Lisa, to arrive. She came from inside a few moment later carrying two lemonades. Hans looked at her with confusion a moment before recalling that she'd been with him over an hour, and had only stepped away to get them drinks. \"Thank you my little spring dawn.\" That had been his pet name for his daughter since she was born with the sunrise one beautiful May morning. \n\n\"My pleasure, dad.\" She kissed his cheek and sat on the porch railing next to him. \"I saw in the news you almost bagged Austr\u014d. And after she took out three young League heros.\" She shook her head. \"Serves them right after how they kicked you out. And with no pension either. I'm glad the university was kind enough to put you up for life in thanks for saving the place from The Flaming Khan. Save their necks once forty years ago and they have more respect than the League. You helped found the League for goodness sake and they just kick you out and...\n\n\"Now, now. They did what they had to do.\" Hans frowned and suddenly looked his age. \"We both know my body and my power aren't the only things starting to go, little dawn. Before the fight with Austr\u014d... I ha forgotten altogether that I wasn't a board member in the League anymore. And I have to use that Geepass thing just to find where crime is happening these days.\" He put his face into his hands and began to weep. \"I just wanted to prove I could still do it. That with your mother gone I still have a purpose.\"\n\nLisa slipped off the railed and wrapped her arms around her father. \"Come on dad, don't think like that. You saved the day, remember. Austr\u014d kicked those League cronies behinds and you managed to fight her on your own and win! You can still hack it with the best of them!\" \n\nShe picked up the GPS that her father used to find his way to crime scenes and pushed it into his hands. \"You may not be everything you used to, but the people still need you.\" She hugged him again. \"And I still need you.\" \n\nHans smiled at his daughter as she wiped away the tears from his lined faced. \"Thank you my little spring dawn. I don't know how I'd manage without you.\" \n\n...\n\n\"How's he doing?\"\n\nLisa's husband, Jeff, had always been fond of Hans. Even so, he had found it hard to face the old hero's deteriorating health, and so rarely went with his wife to see him. All he could do was ask her how the aging man was doing. \n\n\"He's still slipping away, slowly. We exercised the other day though and I think it did him some good. I am going to do it a couple times a week for a while and see how things go. But I'm hopeful.\"\n\nJeff smiled sadly. \"Me too. I'm sorry I can't stay for dinner, have to go back to work. We have a conference call with Japan in an hour.\" Jeff threw a few more things into a backpack and zipped it shut. \"Can't believe I am using this thing to go into work.\" Jeff looked over to his wife. \"You haven't seen my satchel anywhere have you? The brown leather one?\"\n\n\"...Uhh, no. Sorry dear.\" Lisa smiled sweetly.

Looking again at the gadget his daughter gave him, he harumphed. In his heyday he could have found his way to the altercation by sound alone, but even superhearing goes with age, and now at eighty five.  he could only hear about as well as your average twenty year old. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His flying too had wakened with age, but that hardly mattered. Flight was flight, he told himself. If he could get to the scene of a crime in progress while beating the traffic, he was still ahead of the cops, ahead of the game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And besides, he was still stronger and faster than a base human, and many powered villains. The youngsters these days were nothing to worry about, not like the villains of old. But there were a few who were a danger.

They continued walking Neroman walked faster increasing his speed until he was in front of shade walking more dramatic as his towel turned cape blew in the wind. Neroman was escorting Shade to the local precinct after catching him in the dastardly act of J-walking. It must've been an odd sight Shade was easily taller than the old man, and with his reputation he could snap him in half with no effort. Shade's soulless eyes would usually be sucking the hope out of all around him his ethereal mass less shadow head floating on a disconnected cape. However, Shade didn't mind letting this old man and his makeshift cape escort his nightmarish form to a police station. \n\n\"Shade you dastardly, disgusting, deviant!\" A small man yelled from behind him.\n\n\"That can't be grammatically correct\" Shade spoke sarcastically the darkness in his hand returning, burning like the fires of hell ready to snap the upstarts neck. \n\n\"I am PlastoMan, and I-\" PlastoMan started before Neroman ran in front of Shade. \"I've got him fellow Hero don't worry I'll make sure he gets to the proper authorities\" Neroman stated proudly. \"Hero's never change always showing off\" Shade thought staring fondly at Neroman. \n\n\"Move Gramps let the real heroes fight crime okay?\" PlastoMan pushed Neroman. Neroman began to trip before he could touch the ground Shade had caught him helping him up. Plastoman's body had been flung into a near by building both legs shattered. Neroman looked up into Shade's eyes almost embarrassed and, Shade knew the walk was over.\n\n\"Oh thank you sir! Must've tripped, You must be one of those new heroes that I hear about!\" Neroman responded, his hero persona dropping out of him as his mind snapping to another personality almost instantly. The doctor had said something about this happening if Norman kept heroing about. Almost like his mind would shut off his hero persona if it felt his pride was being threatened, like a ego shield.\n\n\"No, Nero- I mean Yes, Norman I am\"  Shade hated moments like these. Norman would be here then gone in an instant, with no one knowing for how long. The old man seemingly lost in his own mind like a hamster in a maze. Cerberus had told him about this to take it easy on him and to cherish what was there. \n\n\"I have a son like you, you know? Costume like yours and everything except you know less menacing\" Norman said almost nervous-like. \n\n\"Yeah my old man has been telling me I should try warmer colors\" Shade responded. \n\n\"Good advice sounds like a swell guy, HAHAHA\" Norman laughed.\"...I hope he's doing okay though he doesn't come to see me. I don't blame him it'd break his heart, flaws of a hero right? Care way too much...\" Norman continued walking forward. Shade walking next to him listening silently. \n\n\"Can I bother you for the time young sir? I need to be at the hospital at 6:30 my wife was supposed to take me but, I think I walked off without her! HAHAHA\" Norman spoke chuckling. \"Come to think about it where am I going?\" Norman seemed confused looking around. \n\n\"We were going to Metropolitan on 6th, you asked me to walk you there\" Shade responded pulling out his arm from underneath the cloak checking his watch. \"..and you've got time it's 5:47\"\n\n\"I did? Oh, your right I did! Well I'm sorry my stories I must've gotten us lost\" Norman said drooping his head like a sad puppy. \n\n\"It's okay Norman looking at the signs we should only be a block or two away\" Shade spoke truthfully. Norman immediately perked up happy to know he hadn't wasted a strangers time. The two continued chatting, walking towards the hospital like comrades in arms. Turning the corner they saw a concerned looking woman, her pudgy round frame tucked into a pink sweater and mom jeans standing in front of the hospital. \n\n\"There's my firecracker she's gonna beat me silly HAHA!\" Norman laughed staring fondly at his wife. \"Norman?\" His wife responded almost tentatively turning to her husband. \"Of course, sugarbug who else looks this good in a towel?!\" Norman responded hugging her. His wife hugged him back tightly, happy that she wouldn't have to talk Neroman down and into the hospital. She stared at Shade standing off to the side just out of arm's length, but to her seeming miles away. \n\n\"Thank you, And- I mean Shade for walking this headache back here.\" She said holding Norman's hand. Shade nodded preparing to warp away until Norman stopped him. \"Hey Shade was it?\" Norman spoke to Shade like an old friend he was seeing for the first time in awhile. \"Thank you for walking me here, I just wanted to ask that if you see my kid out there tell him to come by, I'd like that\" Norman spoke a slight tinge of sadness in his voice. \n\n\"Sure old man what's his name? Hero I mean of course can't go yelling his identity all over the city! HA- um sorry....\" Shade said swallowing the laughter. Norman's face lit up his wife staring at shade with eye's that dripped compassion, Shade wouldn't look at her, not anymore.\n\n\"It's fine! He goes by Shadowman, Moon Warrior, or something dark and forbidding like that.\" Norman's scattered mind tried to pull the old memory forward. Flashes of memories whipped past him like a train he needed to catch but, wouldn't slow for him. His son's powers manifesting, the accident that made him use them in public becoming a hero, Christmas a purple bow on a dark box, a young man crying near his bedside, fire cooking his flesh....\n\n\"It's okay Norman I think I know a guy who could help me find him\" Shade broke his thought process seeing the memories almost breaking the old man. \"Focus on your wife and getting better I'll tell your son you miss him.\" Shade waved them away Norman and his wife walking through the doors of the hospital. Shade sighed before disappearing he didn't need another hero running at him in front of the hospital.\n\n\n--\nEdit: Thanks for the editing advice guys I'll try and clean it up my grammar was never good, as you can probably tell\n\nEdit 2: MY FIRST REDDIT GOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

That was the day the mayor realised I could get to him and anyone of his little\nLeague at will. I played my hand and played it hard put 14 of the fuckers in hospital before they found him. He had been saving his neighbours kid from the local bullies. After that the mayor even made sure the league cleaned up the streets around Max&amp;#39;s hood so he wouldn&amp;#39;t miss an appointment.  It must seam funny this impenetrable fortress surrounded by the worst of the worst guarding its location and this old man walks straight through all the defences. I make sure the boys put up a little show but they know if they touch him they answer to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maximum Damage the last of the league of legends my fathers greatest advisory. They nearly killed each other countless times. My fathers powers of radiation manipulation and Max&amp;#39;s unlimited strength meant they matched each other well. When my old man was finally caught Max visited him every day in prison and some how when dad escaped 20yrs later he found him and still came by every day. By that stage I was running the show and dads powers were killing him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Towards the end I told my dad I&amp;#39;d take Max out for him as one last gotcha.  He said &amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t kill family&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg7il2r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492117833.0, "created_utc": 1492089033.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 90}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65458n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ksb0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 70, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mpaolino88", "parent_id": "t3_65458n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The people were screaming as the ran past the man, the only one that seemed to wade through the crowd toward the Chaos.

But I Gotta Question For You Now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, Mike?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My Dad used to tell me stories about you, back in your prime. The good old days. There were real legends then, on both sides. The battles, the evil schemes, the heroic rescues... It all seemed to mean something back then. He was your biggest fan, in a weird sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Asshole Used To Send Me Christmas Cards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It was me that did the crayon drawings of Santa.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Really?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wow.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But you know what Dad would tell me, in-between planning to take over the world?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That I Was His Arch Enemy?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That and this - you&amp;#39;re only ever as good as your opposition.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re Getting Near To The Hospital, I Think.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been an honour, Mike.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Look, I - I Need To sleep. The Painkillers Are Making Me Drowsy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shall I call Cassie?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah.

The park was full of people milling about and enjoying their Saturday morning, some were out on dates hoping to find true love, others were simply enjoying their time. Towards a wide river, many tables were set up so people could have a view of the mega city, enjoy a bite to eat, or play chess. Two older gentlemen were at one such table.\n\n\"Ah! Your hand left the piece!\" Said one man. His hair had greyed, but still held its dignified form of his youth, his hands had a slight tremble that comes with age. He wore an overcoat with a scarf tied around his neck.\n\n\"Matthias, how long must you attempt to distract me?\" The man who sat across from Matthias was bald, but his eyes still held the bright passion of youth. He was clad in simple monk robes, and wore spectacles on his nose. Matthias simply smiled at his companion.\n\n\"Just like old times, eh Monk?\" Monk looked up and smiled at his old nemesis turned friend.\n\"With you coming up with some scheme and becoming overconfident in your abilities?\" His hand shook as he captured a knight with his pawn. Matthias was dumbfounded.\n\"Wha...how...when...\" His voice trailed off in confusion.\n\nMonk smiled, crossed his arms, and leaned back.\n\"You always did overlook many things in your plans. Ironic isn't it? You were once known as The Front for you cleverness and wit.\" Monk began to chuckle as Matthias scrambled to recover.\n\"Ahh...i see now...\" The Front made his move after many moments of deliberation.\n\n\"Checkmate.\" Matthias was dumbfounded once again, as Monk had taken no time to decide his move. Matthias looked up to meet Monk's eyes, full of mischief.\n\n\"You always laid plans for certain events, but you never had plans for unaccounted happenings.\" Matthias sighed, this was the fifth time in a row he had been beaten.\n\nSuddenly a woman screamed, and a man clutching a purse began running along the path adjacent to the old timers. Suddenly the thief held a hand to his eye and ran headlong into a tree.\nMatthias looked over to see a piece missing from the board, and observed a hidden smile on Monk's face. Monk held a finger up to his lips.\nA young hero began running towards the recovering miscreant. \n\n\"Foul villain\" he began, \"you should never have attempted any misdeeds while I, Steelboy, yet draw breath!\"\n\nWith a single movement, he threw the vagabond over his shoulder, and threw the purse back to the crowd that was forming. He turned to leave when he spotted two elderly gentlemen enjoying a game of chess. He recognized one of them.\n\n\"The Front! Evil Front, you shall be captured by me this day!\" He struck up a fighting pose, and his former prisoner fell off his shoulder and ran off into the crowd.\nMatthias looked over to see the young hero challenging him.\n\n\"I believe he is looking for you.\" Matthias gave a look at Monk who had just delivered the sarcastic remark. He never knew Monk could be playful.\n\"Go away kid, i've done my time.\" He gave a dismissive wave and attempted to go back to enjoying his morning.\n\n\"Thought you could fool me eh? Steelboy never backs down!\" With this, he lunged towards the unsuspecting Matthias. As he reached the table a cane caught him in the gut, swung him around and threw him to the ground. Surprised, Steelboy looked up to see Monk standing know, both hands on his cane.\n\"Wait a minute, you're Monk! Why are you defending this man? You and he fought for years!\" Monk's face was as an elderly grandfather, attempting to teach his grandchildren.\n\n\"Young man, do you believe evil men will always be evil?\"\nThe question was blunt, and Steelboy attempted to respond as he stood up.\n\"Of course!\" He shouted.\n\"If you fall behind on a payment, does the bank not come after you?\" Matthias was as confused as Steelboy.\n\n\"Yet, if you pay the amount, is it not forgiven?\"\nSteelboy had no response.\n\n\"So if a man commits an evil act, he is behind on his payment, but should he atone for his misdeeds, he is paying the amount in the hopes of forgiveness. I believe this man has wronged many, but many years ago, he saw the errors of his ways, and turned his life around. His debt is large, but he is paying it back.\"\nSteelboy looked at him, then to Matthias, and then back to Monk.\n\n\"What on earth are you going on about? Loans? Payments? Who cares you old foggy, i'm taking him in!\"\n\nOnce again he lunged forward, aiming for Matthias, but Monk had other plans. He grabbed Steelboy's fist, and effortlessly threw him into the river.\nMonk sat back down, \"shall we play another game?\" He asked with a twinkle in his eye.\n\n", "edited": 1492093297.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a brisk October morning.

I have come to stop you - for the millionth time!\"  \nThe eyes of the scared, shivering citizens in the bank light up with hope as they turn to see Captain Thunderbolt, the superhero of the city\u2026 50 years ago.\n\n\"How many times do I, do I have to teach you two a lesson, before you finally learn, that crime\u2026 is not the way to go!\"  \nCaptain Thunderbolt rumbles as he points his cane at Hothead Fawkes and Chubby Shark.  \n\"Okay, okay Thunderbolt, you got me again,\"  \nHothead puts his gun on the floor, and Captain Thunderbolt slowly walks towards him and breaks the gun with a powerful thrust of his cane.\n\nSeeing this, Chubby Shark makes a confused face.  \n\"Hothead, you're just gonna give up like that?\"  \nHothead Fawkes turns towards Shark, nodding.  \n\"Face it Shark. We grew up robbing banks and fighting Thunderbolt, and we've never won. What do you think makes this time different?\"\n\nShark lets out a long sigh, then drops his gun. He proceeds to hand the cash-filled bags to the bank staff.  \n\"Okay. You got us, Thunderbolt. Arrest us, do whatever you do.\"\n\n\"You know what, you two? I'll let you off this one time, because you surrendered. But, if I ever see you robbing banks again\u2026\"  \n\"Then you'll zap us with lightning?\"  \n\"\u2026yes, I'll zap you with lightning! Now get outta here, you little punks! Promise to yourself, that you'll\u2026 never commit a crime again!\"  \nCaptain Thunderbolt maintains his authoritative tone that he's been using for 50 years, even before his first encounter with Hothead and Shark.\n\nAs the two embarrassed criminals walk out of the bank, they are blinded by a flash. As the bright light fades away, they see a person blocking the way.  \nIt's a teenager wearing a bright blue jacket and long gym pants, hovering a few feet from the ground. She is Dawn, the girl born with mystical powers, and she has recently started to fight crime.\n\n\"Halt, bank robbers! Hand over the cash!\"  \nDawn yells with an inherited authoritative tone.  \n\"We already did. We're going home now, if you'd excuse us,\" says Hothead Fawkes, gesturing to the inside of the bank.  \nConfused, Dawn glances into the bank's glass doors and sees Captain Thunderbolt, slowly walking out.\n\n\"Grandpa? What are you doing here? Weren't you just at home watching TV?\"  \n\"I told you, Dawn. I'm Captain Thunderbolt! I've been fighting crime in this city before your father even met your mother!\"  \n\"Yeah, whatever, Gramps. Always rambling about your *'good old days'*. I'm gonna arrest these guys.\"\n\nChubby Shark taps Dawn on the shoulder.  \n\"You should listen to your grandpa, you know. He let us go.\"  \n\"Yes, I let them go! I even got them to return the cash they just robbed the bank for!\"  \nCaptain Thunderbolt shouts at Dawn with anger.  \n\"They're criminals, grandpa! They belong in prison!\"  \n\"No, they deserve to learn a lesson and\u2026 become good people again! I've given them their lesson, you don't get to interfere, little girl!\"  \n\n\"I'm done listening to these two argue. Let's go, Shark,\" Hothead says while shaking his head.  \n\"Hey, don't think about escaping!\" Dawn ignores her grandfather and throws a punch at Hothead Fawkes. He cries in pain.  \n\"Hey! She attacked you first, you have every right to fight back!\" Captain Thunderbolt yells as he throws Chubby Shark's gun to its owner.\n\nDawn is quick and strong and can fly, but she isn't bulletproof. Chubby Shark shoots at Dawn, and she manages to dodge every one of the shots, except for the last one, which scrapes her left thigh, and she tumbles to the ground. The partners immediately flee the scene.\n\nCaptain Thunderbolt walks over to Dawn with the help of his cane. She is panting heavily, and he can tell that she is scared out of her mind. This is the first time Dawn has been shot, albeit very mildly.\n\n\"Silly grandchild.

You the hero, me your nemesis and the piss soaked boy who still hasn&amp;#39;t realized who you are.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ohh dear he does seem to have had an accident what a shame.&amp;quot; He sympathized while pulling on one of his blazers tweed sleeves. &amp;quot;And you say you&amp;#39;re my nemesis? I don&amp;#39;t recall having a nemesis.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Old friend what&amp;#39;s become of you? Our battles used to level city blocks. People would cheer when you appeared over the horizon to stop my outlandish plots. But anyway it turns out I can do more damage to the world with a business than as a super villian. Regardless I know better than to try and fight you even on your old age I can feel your power even if you and the boy can&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wh....Who is he?&amp;quot; The quivering figure  stammered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Child surely if you know who I am you can recognize the greatest hero of our time?

A raucous laughter drew his attention.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious!  Whenever Manman shows up, it\u2019s like all the villains just give up.  I swear to god!  I saw him use his \u2018super breath\u2019 - which can\u2019t even blow out the candles on his friggin\u2019 birthday cake anymore - and General Pain just lay down like Ma\u2026\u201d  \n\n\u201cNow, wait a minute, \u2018Agent Wonder\u2019.  You are brand new here.\u201d The Director piped in with a raised voice, biting off each word, \u201cManman was around before you were a twinkle in your Dad\u2019s eye.  He fought crime and cleaned up Cityburg before our headquarters existed.  He\u2019s the reason you have to leave the city to find work.\u201d  The Director, pausing for effect, met each pair of eyes at the table until their head lowered, \u201cHe has accomplished more in his lifetime than the whole group of you will think about accomplishing in your, no doubt, short \u2018super\u2019 existence.  You\u2019d do well to look upon Manman as a hero.  Study his moves.  Even imitate him.\u201d  With his point made, The Director walked briskly away.  \n\nThe Chameleon laughed internally at the shame he saw.  *These guys have no confidence. I could probably take them all out by myself.*  \n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you all tell me he was behind me?\u201d Agent Wonder asked accusingly.  \n\n\u201cDude\u2026 you know The Director can be listening at any moment.\u201d  Thunder Giant said as he watched The Director round the corner to the hall.  He continued in hushed tones, \u201cI know what you mean, though, Wonder.  About a month before he retired,\u201d using air quotes for the last word, \u201cI saw Manman hold off the Army of Evil in a cardboard fort using snow balls.  The entire Army of Evil.  Not just a couple of them.  ALL OF THEM.  And I\u2019m not certain of it, but I thought I heard the Army of Evil giggling.  Laughing even.  I mean, Manman still had a decent amount of strength back then, and a tightly compacted snowball to the face sucks, but, come on!\u201d   \n\nThe rest of the group sat, unconvinced, eying Thunder Giant doubtfully as the words sank in.  \n\nThe Chameleon saw a mixture of incredulity and disgust on the groups faces as he smiled at the memory of what would come to be known to every supervillain as The Great Fight.  A flurry of snowballs flew past his face.  The Chameleon rushed the enemy line completely hidden in camouflage.  He was just about to take Manman out when a flash of white and red covered his vision.  He opened his eyes and wondered why he was looking at sky.  He couldn\u2019t believe it when a laugh escaped his lips.  And not his villain laugh, either, but a full-on laugh from his belly.  He hadn\u2019t laughed like that in ages.  He didn\u2019t even know he was capable of it anymore.  Of course, Manman now had his position and he was pelted with snowballs as he ran away, but he did so while laughing with glee.  It was \u201cThe Great Fight\u201d not because they lost many comrades that day, and not because it was difficult experience, but because it was the most fun any of the villains had had since their innocence was stolen and they were forced into a life of crime.  The voices below brought him back to the cafeteria.  \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying!\u201d  Agent Wonder loudly whispered.  \u201cIt\u2019s like they just give him a free pass!  It makes me wonder if any of the stories of him are true.  I don\u2019t believe them.  He\u2019s washed up now and he was washed up back then.\u201d  \n\nThe rest of the group still didn\u2019t look convinced, but The Chameleon had heard enough.  \u201cHow dare you speak that way about Manman!  Manman gave me my first scar.  Manman was the reason I was given each of my life sentences and Manman did it with style!  I was able to keep my pride intact when Manman allowed me to turn myself in!  He even cleaned me up and told me, \u2018Next time just believe in yourself and you\u2019ll accomplish things you\u2019ve only dreamed about!\u2019  And that was exactly what I needed to hear, because I was just about to take a job as a computer technician!\u201d  \n \n*Uh-oh*, The Chameleon thought.  He now looked at an entire army of masked and caped men who were looking back toward him.  They couldn\u2019t see him, but it was only a matter of time before\u2026  *No way!*  \n\nManman rounded the corner in his super ill-fitting suit.  His belly was beginning to peek out from under his shirt and he was hunched over a walking cane\u2026 but his frame was still imposing.  Manman carried his Killerang in his free hand and had it drawn back, ready to throw.  \n\n\u201cYou rang?\u201d  Manman said in his whispery imitation of his once super voice.  \n\n\u201cUh\u2026 I didn\u2019t know you came out of retirement Manman.\u201d  The Chameleon said apologetically.  \n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m still retired.  I just heard my name!\u201d  Manman pointed with his Killerang to the extremely large hearing aids pushing down his ears.  \n\nBefore The Chameleon could respond, Manman threw his Killerang with all his might and The Chameleon fell from the rafters.  The Killerang bounced and clattered as it came to a rest only a few feet from Manman, but The Chameleon was now on the floor and in full view of the rest of headquarters.  \u201cAnd let that be a lesson to you The Chameleon!\u201d  Manman called over his shoulder.  \n\n*He is the only one who remembers my name.*  \u201cCurse you!\u201d  The Chameleon yelled while thinking, *God, I love that guy.*  \n\nThe onlookers, stunned, mouths agape, tried to figure out what had just happened.  The Chameleon smiled as they looked at the Killerang, then at The Chameleon, then back at the Killerang, then back at The Chameleon.  They all turned toward the door in unison as The Director said, \u201cStill got it,\u201d and high-fived a smiling Manman.\n", "edited": 1492114976.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chameleon hung from the rafters of the headquarters cafeteria, listening in on various superhero conversations.  A raucous laughter drew his attention.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m serious!  Whenever Manman shows up, it\u2019s like all the villains just give up.  I swear to god!  I saw him use his \u2018super breath\u2019 - which can\u2019t even blow out the candles on his friggin\u2019 birthday cake anymore - and General Pain just lay down like Ma\u2026\u201d  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNow, wait a minute, \u2018Agent Wonder\u2019.  You are brand new here.\u201d The Director piped in with a raised voice, biting off each word, \u201cManman was around before you were a twinkle in your Dad\u2019s eye.  He fought crime and cleaned up Cityburg before our headquarters existed.  He\u2019s the reason you have to leave the city to find work.\u201d  The Director, pausing for effect, met each pair of eyes at the table until their head lowered, \u201cHe has accomplished more in his lifetime than the whole group of you will think about accomplishing in your, no doubt, short \u2018super\u2019 existence.  You\u2019d do well to look upon Manman as a hero.  Study his moves.  Even imitate him.\u201d  With his point made, The Director walked briskly away.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Chameleon laughed internally at the shame he saw.  &lt;em&gt;These guys have no confidence. I could probably take them all out by myself.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you all tell me he was behind me?\u201d Agent Wonder asked accusingly.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDude\u2026 you know The Director can be listening at any moment.\u201d  Thunder Giant said as he watched The Director round the corner to the hall.  He continued in hushed tones, \u201cI know what you mean, though, Wonder.  About a month before he retired,\u201d using air quotes for the last word, \u201cI saw Manman hold off the Army of Evil in a cardboard fort using snow balls.  The entire Army of Evil.  Not just a couple of them.  ALL OF THEM.  And I\u2019m not certain of it, but I thought I heard the Army of Evil giggling.  Laughing even.  I mean, Manman still had a decent amount of strength back then, and a tightly compacted snowball to the face sucks, but, come on!\u201d   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the group sat, unconvinced, eying Thunder Giant doubtfully as the words sank in.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Chameleon saw a mixture of incredulity and disgust on the groups faces as he smiled at the memory of what would come to be known to every supervillain as The Great Fight.  A flurry of snowballs flew past his face.  The Chameleon rushed the enemy line completely hidden in camouflage.  He was just about to take Manman out when a flash of white and red covered his vision.  He opened his eyes and wondered why he was looking at sky.  He couldn\u2019t believe it when a laugh escaped his lips.  And not his villain laugh, either, but a full-on laugh from his belly.  He hadn\u2019t laughed like that in ages.  He didn\u2019t even know he was capable of it anymore.  Of course, Manman now had his position and he was pelted with snowballs as he ran away, but he did so while laughing with glee.  It was \u201cThe Great Fight\u201d not because they lost many comrades that day, and not because it was difficult experience, but because it was the most fun any of the villains had had since their innocence was stolen and they were forced into a life of crime.  The voices below brought him back to the cafeteria.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying!\u201d  Agent Wonder loudly whispered.  \u201cIt\u2019s like they just give him a free pass!  It makes me wonder if any of the stories of him are true.  I don\u2019t believe them.  He\u2019s washed up now and he was washed up back then.\u201d  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the group still didn\u2019t look convinced, but The Chameleon had heard enough.  \u201cHow dare you speak that way about Manman!  Manman gave me my first scar.  Manman was the reason I was given each of my life sentences and Manman did it with style!  I was able to keep my pride intact when Manman allowed me to turn myself in!  He even cleaned me up and told me, \u2018Next time just believe in yourself and you\u2019ll accomplish things you\u2019ve only dreamed about!\u2019  And that was exactly what I needed to hear, because I was just about to take a job as a computer technician!\u201d  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uh-oh&lt;/em&gt;, The Chameleon thought.  He now looked at an entire army of masked and caped men who were looking back toward him.  They couldn\u2019t see him, but it was only a matter of time before\u2026  &lt;em&gt;No way!&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Manman rounded the corner in his super ill-fitting suit.  His belly was beginning to peek out from under his shirt and he was hunched over a walking cane\u2026 but his frame was still imposing.  Manman carried his Killerang in his free hand and had it drawn back, ready to throw.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou rang?\u201d  Manman said in his whispery imitation of his once super voice.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUh\u2026 I didn\u2019t know you came out of retirement Manman.\u201d  The Chameleon said apologetically.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, I\u2019m still retired.  I just heard my name!\u201d  Manman pointed with his Killerang to the extremely large hearing aids pushing down his ears.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before The Chameleon could respond, Manman threw his Killerang with all his might and The Chameleon fell from the rafters.  The Killerang bounced and clattered as it came to a rest only a few feet from Manman, but The Chameleon was now on the floor and in full view of the rest of headquarters.  \u201cAnd let that be a lesson to you The Chameleon!\u201d  Manman called over his shoulder.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He is the only one who remembers my name.&lt;/em&gt;  \u201cCurse you!\u201d  The Chameleon yelled while thinking, &lt;em&gt;God, I love that guy.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The onlookers, stunned, mouths agape, tried to figure out what had just happened.  The Chameleon smiled as they looked at the Killerang, then at The Chameleon, then back at the Killerang, then back at The Chameleon.

Why had Tempest turned his back? The na\u00efve inexperience of a young villain? No, he had won this fight. He wasn\u2019t stupid. What was his game? \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter\u2026 you\u2019ve hurt plenty with your villainous actions.\u201d He spat.\n\nTempest turned back to the hulking figure sitting propped up against the wall; an artifact, a stalwart defender of a time long past. \u201cWhy do you fight?\u201d He asked the old man, staring into his greying eye.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2026 fight for\u2026\u201d Captain Tomorrow stammered, looking for the words. \u201cI fight for justice. I fight for those who cannot. I fight to keep evil at bay and t-\u201c\n\n\u201cCut the bullshit!\u201d Tempest sneered for a moment before taking a breath and regaining composure. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that canned crap. I want to know why YOU fight. This world is broken. Things aren\u2019t like they were. Lines have crossed, black and white have fused into a blurry grey. Heroes and Villains don\u2019t exist anymore.

The world is not on your side. The PEOPLE are not on your side\u2026 why are you on theirs?\u201d\n\nCaptain Tomorrow stared with a wide eye at the young man standing before him. There was such passion in his words. A tear escaped the big man\u2019s eye, followed by another and another. Soon a steady stream of tears flowed down his cheeks as he ran a hand through his sparse, greying hair and let out an exasperated laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s all I know\u2026\u201d He cried. \u201cIt\u2019s all I know.\u201d\n\nTempest frowned at the big man out of pity. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d he said, gesturing towards the broken relic of a man \u201cThis is why I fight.\u201d He walked over and slid down the wall to sit next to Captain Tomorrow. As the man wept next to him, Tempest pulled out a cigarette and lit it with a spark from his thumb. \u201cYou\u2019ve been at this for 50 years, started while you were just a kid. You got picked up by the Coalition of Defense and made a career out of stopping Villains who wanted to destroy the world or rule it. But as time went on, those Villains found other ways to make their mark. They traded in their capes and lairs for three-piece suits and skyscrapers. Turns out ruling the world or destroying it is a lot easier than anyone thought.\u201d He took a long drag of the cigarette and passed it to the old man who took it warily and began to smoke.\n\n\u201cSo why do you fight?\u201d The hulking figure asked, wiping the tears from his face. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. You say that the villains are no more but you steal and destroy property, you cause mayhem. Why do you do it?\u201d\n\nTempest sighed and looked at the ground. \u201cMy father taught me to stand up for what I thought was right. He said that sometimes people would try to tell me I was wrong but if I listened to my heart, I could never fail. Those villains he fought are running the show now. They\u2019re in the corps, the government, and the law enforcement. Even our once renowned heroes don\u2019t get the care and respect they deserve because those who could get it done don\u2019t care. Not all of them are corrupt but like I said, everything is grey now. It\u2019s hard to distinguish between the good and the bad. All I have left to follow is my heart.\u201d\n\nThe old man put his head in his hands. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m too old for this. I\u2019ve been defending this city for so long and not once has it defended me.

Oh, excuse me!\u201d An aged voice called out. \n\n\u201cBarrier breached,\u201d a soft artificial voice warned Alchemist. \n\nAlchemist looked down and her helmet zoomed in on her robbery. Five stories bellow her all fifteen mercenaries whipped out their guns out and pointed them at the intruder, a tottering old lady. Her high jacked facial recognition software found a match for the senior citizen. \n\n\nBrenda Long\nEx-Enhanced Police Force Officer\nCode name: Sorceress \nService record: 1972 \u2013 2000\nBlack Star Officer\nOver 1,000 crises averted\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me! Ms. Alchemist?\u201d the old lady said. \n\n\nAlchemist frowned. Heroes and villains didn\u2019t mix, even after retirement. What was she doing here? Did she think she was the Sorceress again? It would be crazy for the old bat to announce her position and then try to pull off an attack. She was probably just senile. \n\n\n\u201cHold your fire, stand down.\u201d Alchemist said. \n\n\nThere was a burst of stun bolts from a grunt guarding the perimeter. Fortunately the bolts sprayed around the old lady leaving her unharmed. \n\n\u201cI said stand down!\u201d Alchemist barked. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so terribly sorry but I need to talk to you,\u201d the lady continued. \n\nAlchemist sighed and leaned forward on her hover board beginning her decent. \n\n\n\u201cSkuts, you\u2019re fired.

I heard you were looking for me?\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019m so lucky I heard about your robbery on the news.

Not like the other villains these days with their pointy outfits and murdering and ignoring the quiet hours.\u201d \n\n\nMrs. Long\u2019s words were finally cut short by the roar of the cargo rockets taking off. Cargo rockets were Alchemist\u2019s personal brainchild. Do you have any idea how fucking hard it is to catch/stop a missile full of stolen loot? Even for superheroes it was practically impossible. \n\nHer henchmen exchanged a look. So Mrs. Long was just senile. Whatever. Alchemist waved away the guards. She could handle this.\n\n\n\u201cWell I do pride myself on pulling off the cleanest jobs in the city. I always say if you have to resort to indiscriminate killing create fear you then you just aren\u2019t a real villain,\u201d Alchemist said. \u201cNow I appreciate the attention but I really need you to go-\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just so good at finding things that don\u2019t belong to you,\u201d Mrs. Long said with a dangerous glint in her eye. \n\n\nAlchemist froze.  \n\n\n\u201cThe hoover board looks so much better without Nightmare Punch\u2019s green and pink paint job.

But I don\u2019t think he would appreciate you stealing his design, oh no.\u201d\n\n\nSuper battles were always messy. Both sides had to abandon weapons and gear in the heat of the fight.

Loser who would very much like Alchemist\u2019s severed head on a plate. \n\nSirens sounded in the distance marking the arrival of the police.

Fifty feet bellow the gold-plated villain a group of mercenaries worked within a force field to strip an armored truck of all its valuables. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alchemist heard a ding as her helmet HUD altered her to the ETA of the police, both normal and super. She shook her head. The officers of the law were like clockwork, dependable and predictable. She touched the side of her multifaceted helmet activating her com.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAll right boys we\u2019ve got just under five minutes. I want that gold sky high and this wrapped up in three,\u201d she ordered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a chorus of grunts and affirmatives. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cExcuse me! Oh, excuse me!\u201d An aged voice called out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBarrier breached,\u201d a soft artificial voice warned Alchemist. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alchemist looked down and her helmet zoomed in on her robbery. Five stories bellow her all fifteen mercenaries whipped out their guns out and pointed them at the intruder, a tottering old lady. Her high jacked facial recognition software found a match for the senior citizen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brenda Long\nEx-Enhanced Police Force Officer\nCode name: Sorceress \nService record: 1972 \u2013 2000\nBlack Star Officer\nOver 1,000 crises averted&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cExcuse me! Ms. Alchemist?\u201d the old lady said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alchemist frowned. Heroes and villains didn\u2019t mix, even after retirement. What was she doing here? Did she think she was the Sorceress again? It would be crazy for the old bat to announce her position and then try to pull off an attack. She was probably just senile. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHold your fire, stand down.\u201d Alchemist said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a burst of stun bolts from a grunt guarding the perimeter. Fortunately the bolts sprayed around the old lady leaving her unharmed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI said stand down!\u201d Alchemist barked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m so terribly sorry but I need to talk to you,\u201d the lady continued. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alchemist sighed and leaned forward on her hover board beginning her decent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSkuts, you\u2019re fired. Flint and Joana will escort you back to base. I want your paperwork, gun, and uniform on my desk tomorrow morning. Glenn, Swanson, Cuevas guard the lovely old lady. Everyone else get the gold back to base. Sing you\u2019re in charge.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alchemist\u2019s overcoat fluttered in the wind as she dove down to the ground. It was a pain in the ass to clean but damn it made her look dramatic. She pulled back slowing her decent then she jumped off her board, tucked it under arm, and landed in a single smooth motion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGood afternoon madam. I heard you were looking for me?\u201d she said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019m so lucky I heard about your robbery on the news. You see I need some help and my old contacts aren\u2019t answering me and the Force just doesn\u2019t have time for a washed up officer like me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI see.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m so glad it was you, the marvelous Alchemist. You\u2019re a bit of a showboat, with all the gold and your fancy thingy-bobbers.\u201d Mrs. Long gestured to Alchemist\u2019s suit and the force field. \u201cBut you are a professional young lady. Not like the other villains these days with their pointy outfits and murdering and ignoring the quiet hours.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Long\u2019s words were finally cut short by the roar of the cargo rockets taking off. Cargo rockets were Alchemist\u2019s personal brainchild. Do you have any idea how fucking hard it is to catch/stop a missile full of stolen loot? Even for superheroes it was practically impossible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her henchmen exchanged a look. So Mrs. Long was just senile. Whatever. Alchemist waved away the guards. She could handle this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell I do pride myself on pulling off the cleanest jobs in the city. I always say if you have to resort to indiscriminate killing create fear you then you just aren\u2019t a real villain,\u201d Alchemist said. \u201cNow I appreciate the attention but I really need you to go-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re just so good at finding things that don\u2019t belong to you,\u201d Mrs. Long said with a dangerous glint in her eye. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alchemist froze.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe hoover board looks so much better without Nightmare Punch\u2019s green and pink paint job. And the upgrades you\u2019ve made to Dr. Dread\u2019s stungun are noting short of amazing. But I don\u2019t think he would appreciate you stealing his design, oh no.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Super battles were always messy. Both sides had to abandon weapons and gear in the heat of the fight. And well, you know what they say, Finders keepers, Looser weepers. But that didn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t sore losers. Loser who would very much like Alchemist\u2019s severed head on a plate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sirens sounded in the distance marking the arrival of the police.

Too bad all of this is necessary to keep him in check.\n\nThe man he was going to see had been the most notorious and destructive villain of an age flooded with heroes and villains alike. The Maroon Marauder had been taken too lightly at the beginning of his career. He was nothing more than a bankrobber, and had never gone up against a superhero. It was believed that his powers were trivial at best, even his name was laughable. But When the Marauder transitioned from bank robbing to plans of world domination and other larger schemes, he demolished almost every hero he came up against. Few could claim to have faced him in pitched battle and lived to tell the tale. \n\nWhen Warhead finally made it to the end of the hall, and saw the man that this high tech prison had been specifically designed to contain, he could not help but feel the same sense of disappointment he always felt. \n\n//This is the man who\u2019s name caused the world to tremble in fear? \n\nThe Marauder\u2019s powers had slowed his aging, both physically and intangibly. While other villains of his age lost control of their powers with the advancement of time, the Marauder had only grown more powerful, discovering and honing new abilities over the course of what would have been many lifetimes. \nWarhead and the Marauder stared at each other for minutes before either spoke. The villain was built like your average middle aged man- obviously with some strength in him, but not in the best shape. In his pale grey prison jumpsuit, the man looked even less like a super villain than he did the day Warhead had finally apprehended him. Then, the man had looked like any other average Joe in a black suit. He was nowhere near as visually intimidating as some of his contemporaries, but his eyes betrayed a cold intelligence that was enough to make even Warhead doubt himself. \n\nThe villain finally broke the silence. \u201cSo you\u2019ve finally come to see me? I had estimated you would have made an appearance to gloat over your victory long before this.\u201d \n\nWarhead just chuckled. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for that. You know why I\u2019m here. Give up the location of your doomsday devices. The League believes them too dangerous to be left in the world, even if no one has ever discovered your \u2018lair of dismay\u2019.\u201d His voice dripped with sarcasm and arrogance, and it did not go unnoticed.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give them up, but first you and I need to talk.\u201d The villain finally said, an air of frustration around him. \u201cWhat you did that day was disgusting, and I need to know how anyone could justify your actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat actions?\u201d Warhead roared with laughter, \u201cBringing down the most notorious villain in the galaxy? I did something no hero before me could. Not even Captain Fission could stop you, and I did it before any of your henchmen even had a chance to react!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe disrespect you still show him is unacceptable! Captain Fission was the greatest hero this world has ever seen! The measure of a hero does not only lie in strength, boy. That is the one lesson it seems you failed to learn from him.\u201d The Marauder tossed back, anger now visible in his eyes.\n\n\u201cLEARN FROM HIM?\u201d The air around Warhead began to shimmer with radiation. Warhead didn\u2019t notice until the alarms started blaring and flashing red light. Warhead reigned in his signature heat, but his rage was still palpable. \u201cThat man taught me nothing. Everything I am, I made myself. What is more important in a hero than the strength of his power?\u201d He asked through gritted teeth.\n\n\u201cCompassion. Loyalty. Duty. Honor. Any of these, and so many more! Fission was more than just a bomb, you oaf! He truly believed in what he was doing. He did it to protect innocents, not to win fame and glory! You cast him out of the league that he founded!\u201d The Marauder spat, with growing animosity.\n\n\"He was useless! Old, weak, unable to control his powers! He was a danger to everyone in the same room as him. He gave Wonderboy radiation poisoning! Who knows how many others he could have hurt if we had kept him around!\u201d Warhead retorted. \n\n\"The league was his life! His friends, his family! And you just threw him on the street!\u201d The Marauder responded. \u201cA man who had done that much good deserved more respect. A pension at the least, and visits when he took a turn for the worst. His lifelong friends even stopped coming to see him. His children\u2026\u201d\n\n\"What is the point in this? I\u2019m growing impatient, old man.\" Warhead spat. The air was beginning to shimmer again. \u201cJust tell me the location of your hideout so I can leave and be done with all of this.\u201d\n\nAt this the Marauder\u2019s composure broke. Tears streamed down his face- \u201cYou and the league showed no respect for him in life, but even the worst villains can honor the dead. How dare you interrupt his funeral? How many of us did you arrest that day? We showed up to honor that man, the one man who truly made each and every one of us question why crime was our career. The one man capable of teaching regret\u2026 The one man who ever showed me compassion\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t act like you knew him.\u201d Warhead fired back, with venom in his voice. \u201cNo one knew him.\u201d\n    \n\u201cBut I grew to know him. I visited him every day in the hospital. I designed the suits that made it safe for doctors and nurses to be within a mile of him. Every one of the villains you arrested that day did more for him when he was vulnerable than any of his \u2018friends\u2019 did when he was strong.\u201d The Marauder retorted, his voice barely more than a whisper. He was crumpling, eyes glistening. \u201cYou know he spoke of you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Nothing you say can make me forgive him. I gave him everything he ever gave me.\u201d Warhead retorted. His skin now began to shimmer and glow, setting off the alarms again. \n\n\u201cHe did. He regretted missing so much of your life. The baseball games, the choir concerts, everything. He still had all of your trophies, and your sister\u2019s too. Even the soccer participation trophy from the one season you played in the fourth grade.\u201d Tears were rolling down the Marauder\u2019s face at this point. \u201cHe was sorry. Fission- your father- he was trying to make the world safe for you, so you wouldn\u2019t have to live the life he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cSHUT YOUR MOUTH!\u201d Warhead roared. \u201cHe was never there for me, for my sister, for anyone! He spent so much time saving his \u2018precious innocents\u2019 that he forgot to raise his children!\u201d \n\nMemories flash before Warhead\u2019s eyes, but they were not his. A projection, probably an unknown power of the Marauder\u2019s. He sees an old man struggling along with a walker, slowly hobbling next to the Marauder, with a relaxed smile on his face. \nThe same man, now with tears streaming down his face and look of confusion and hurt as his own powers cause him to be wracked with pain. \nThat man again, proudly holding a newspaper with a photo of Warhead in his hands, saying \u201cThis is my son! I'm so proud of him!\u201d\n\nThe man, now lying still, apparently sleeping peacefully.\nThis man again, lying in his best suit in a wooden box. The viewpoint turns, scanning the vast sea of empty chairs. Few people are in attendance- Warhead recognized them all as Super villains, all of whom Captain Fission had arrested at one point or another.\n                \nSuddenly the ground shakes and the sky turns red. The man\u2019s coffin collapses and he falls into the freshly dug grave, and Warhead sees himself sprinting into view, followed closely by a few other heroes. The projection goes black, and then fades from view.\n\nWarhead straightened up, cast one last heartless glance at the Marauder, and began to walk away.\n\n//What a complete waste of time. I guess I'll have to find the devices the old fashioned way.\n\nThe Marauder wilted like an unwatered flower. \u201cI see this is futile. Well, if you won\u2019t remember all of the good that he did, or the lives he saved, we will. He deserved more than you gave him. He deserved a family that loved him the way he loved you.\"\n\n// Sorry about the father/son trope, but I thought it would add weight to the story.

I visited him every day in the hospital. I designed the suits that made it safe for doctors and nurses to be within a mile of him. Every one of the villains you arrested that day did more for him when he was vulnerable than any of his \u2018friends\u2019 did when he was strong.\u201d The Marauder retorted, his voice barely more than a whisper. He was crumpling, eyes glistening. \u201cYou know he spoke of you?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDon\u2019t. Nothing you say can make me forgive him. I gave him everything he ever gave me.\u201d Warhead retorted. His skin now began to shimmer and glow, setting off the alarms again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe did. He regretted missing so much of your life. The baseball games, the choir concerts, everything. He still had all of your trophies, and your sister\u2019s too. Even the soccer participation trophy from the one season you played in the fourth grade.\u201d Tears were rolling down the Marauder\u2019s face at this point. \u201cHe was sorry. Fission- your father- he was trying to make the world safe for you, so you wouldn\u2019t have to live the life he did.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSHUT YOUR MOUTH!\u201d Warhead roared. \u201cHe was never there for me, for my sister, for anyone! He spent so much time saving his \u2018precious innocents\u2019 that he forgot to raise his children!\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Memories flash before Warhead\u2019s eyes, but they were not his. A projection, probably an unknown power of the Marauder\u2019s. He sees an old man struggling along with a walker, slowly hobbling next to the Marauder, with a relaxed smile on his face. \nThe same man, now with tears streaming down his face and look of confusion and hurt as his own powers cause him to be wracked with pain. \nThat man again, proudly holding a newspaper with a photo of Warhead in his hands, saying \u201cThis is my son! I&amp;#39;m so proud of him!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man, now lying still, apparently sleeping peacefully.\nThis man again, lying in his best suit in a wooden box. The viewpoint turns, scanning the vast sea of empty chairs. Few people are in attendance- Warhead recognized them all as Super villains, all of whom Captain Fission had arrested at one point or another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the ground shakes and the sky turns red. The man\u2019s coffin collapses and he falls into the freshly dug grave, and Warhead sees himself sprinting into view, followed closely by a few other heroes. The projection goes black, and then fades from view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warhead straightened up, cast one last heartless glance at the Marauder, and began to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;//What a complete waste of time. I guess I&amp;#39;ll have to find the devices the old fashioned way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Marauder wilted like an unwatered flower. \u201cI see this is futile. Well, if you won\u2019t remember all of the good that he did, or the lives he saved, we will. He deserved more than you gave him. He deserved a family that loved him the way he loved you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;// Sorry about the father/son trope, but I thought it would add weight to the story. Sorry for any typos/awkward formatting, I&amp;#39;m on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*edit: formatting, spelling&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg8svda", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492175822.0, "created_utc": 1492147022.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65458n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7epl7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 54, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sharp7", "parent_id": "t3_65458n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sure Captain Honor admitted the young heroes caught more criminals in quantity, but Captain Honor was adamant about beating them in quality. He caught more real super villains than anyone else. The real big names like DoubleShot, BadBaller, KingCruel were caught by none other than Captain Honor himself. And he did it with just his tried and true powers of enhanced strength and agility without the need for fancy new technology. Although, for some reason the criminals he caught seemed to be able to escape prison whenever they wanted.\n\nBut one day the scariest most violent villain of them all, Sin, kidnapped the mayor of the city and after executing several prominent businessmen and politicians. Sin demanded chemicals and equipment which seemed to obviously be for weapons by the end of the day. The heroes guild only managed to recruit 3 super heroes in time to make a rescue attempt before Sin's ransom timer was up. Though the honorable captain was ready they didn't recruit him for the cause. Dishonored, the captain decided to force his way into the group.\n\n\"Why didn't you guys call me for help?\" he asked them. The 3 other heroes grew awkwardly silent until their leader, HellMan responded \"we didn't want to disturb your retirement\" to which Honor replied \"I'm not retired. I'll never retire.\" Hellman's patience ran out, though to be fair he was half demon and didn't have much to start with, and he said \"Look old man, you're just going to get in the way\". The Captain looked to the other two heroes and asked \"WaterGirl, SteelHawk, do you really agree with this guy?\" They looked away from him too bashful to say anything, but in obvious agreement with HellMan. \"I remember when these guys were just a bunch of kids trying to fit-in with the normals in school\" thought Honor. \"I'm coming whether you're greatfull for it or not\" said Captain Honor.\n\nThe plan was ready, SteelHawk with his powersuit that gave him flight and advanced weaponry was going to surprise and distract them from above. WaterGirl was going to sneak by turning into water. After WaterGirl found the Mayor, HellMan was going to teleport to her and teleport the hostage out leaving WaterGirl and SteelHawk to escape on their own as HellMan could only teleport one other person per day. WaterGirl was immune to bullets and physical attacks as she was made of water, and SteelHawk was extremely agile in his flight suit so escaping without HellMan's help would be the easy part.\n\nCaptain Honor, not included in their plan at all, decided he was going to fight his way to Sin and take the guy out directly. \n\nThe operation began with SteelHawk shooting rockets from very high in the air. WaterGirl sneaked in through the plumbing system until she made her way to the room with the Mayor. The plan was going well, they didn't fire any anti-air shots at SteelHawk and the room with the Mayor seemed unguarded. Meanwhile, Captain Honor sneaked his way in, beating up some dumb guards on the way. \n\nWaterGirl ran up to the Mayor and freed him. He started to laugh. The Mayor ripped at his own hair. His head hair and beard came off, and underneath was the bald and clean shaven face of Sin himself. WaterGirl wished she had payed more attention to local politics so she could have recognized he wasn't the Mayor. Sin's laughing continued as he hit a button on a panel on his arm and the entire room burst out in electric shocks. WaterGirl screamed, as electricity was her weakness. She quickly lost consciousness. Sin on the other hand seemed to enjoy the pain from the electric shocks, as he was a bit of a masochist. Sin put his hand inside WaterGirl's liquid head and his hand started to heat up. It was so hot the room lit up in unbearable brightness. When the light dissipated WaterGirl's head was no more, and her body turned into regular lifeless water.\n\n\"WATERGIRL? WATERGIRL ARE YOU THERE? WATERGIRLLLL\" screamed HellMan unaware of her demise. Through the rashness of his youth he decided to teleport to her last location, unaware of it's disposition. He teleported to the location, but the room seemed empty other than a peculiar puddle of water next to an unoccupied chair in the center. HellMan's eyed the puddled and assumed the worse, which made him unbearably angry. \"SteelHawk, come in through the window at my location!\" he screamed into their communication's line. \"What? Why?\" asked SteelHawk \"WaterGirl's.... down\" replied HellMan. HellMan charged up a fireball, as he prepared for battle.\n\nSteelHawk burst in through the window only to find a thoroughly destroyed room with burnt grunts about. He dashed through the halls looking for his companion. Just more burnt thugs, although he noticed a strange human-shaped imprint charred onto the wall. He payed it no mind and ran along. Only a few rooms later he started running into active guards. He shot them down with no mercy. He took a few shots himself in the process, but his suit blocked them easily. Eventually he ran into a room with just Sin standing in wait. Sin shot him with a strange looking gun, but the bullet didn't go through his suit either. \"Where's HellMan\" screamed SteelHawk. \"He's dead. Didn't you see his cremation a few rooms back?\" replied Sin. Tears began to drip down SteelHawk's face, he was glad his helmet prevented Sin from seeing them. Sin started to laugh \"I can tell you're crying under that helmet boy\". SteelHawk started to get scared. He always thought HellMan and WaterGirl were unkillable. He decided he was probably walking into some kind of trap and flew out the nearest window. \n\nSteelHawk flew extremely high and finally got control of his panic. \"Ca- Captain Honor are you there?\" he asked. \"Yes I'm here SteelHawk\" readily replied The Captain. \"I don't know what to do Captain, I think... I think WaterGirl and HellMan are... dead...\" Captain Honor felt horrible on the inside, but knew now was not the time for weakness. So he said \"Don't worry SteelHawk, I'll deal with this\". Just as he heard the message SteelHawk started to fall. He spent the seconds he had while falling to fiddle with his suit and didn't have the time to message Captain Honor. SteelHawk found the problem, it seems whatever Sin shot him with was lodged in his suit, activated, and was now shutting down his flight capabilities. SteelHawk managed to pry the invading device from his suit, but just as his suit started up again he crashed into the concrete.\n\nCaptain Honor heard a loud crash outside, and asked SteelHawk what was going on. There was no reply. He ran into a few more guards but they all ran away from him. \"Wow looks like these thugs finally learned to not mess with Captain Honor\" he said to himself. Eventually he reached Sin. Sin let out a gasp of very dramatic surprise. \"How did you make it here!\" Sin yelled. \"Hah, your pathetic guards ran away from me. I guess you should up their pay huh?\" joked Captain Honor. \"I guess loyalty is more expensive than I thought now adays\" replied Sin with a smirk. Captain Honor chuckled and then got into fighting stance. Sin did the same and they started exchanging blows with there fists. \n\nIt went back and forth. They seemed evenly matched in kick boxing techniques, though both seemed to be tiring. Captain Honor then threw a wild hay-maker, Sin saw it coming from a mile away and dodged preemptively. But the punch was a  trick and turned into a grab. Captain Honor held Sin's collar and perfectly performed a hipthrow slamming Sin onto the ground. Captain Honor then stuck his knee onto Sin's chest and proclaimed victory as he said \"It's over Sin, I got you\". \n\n\"Oh darn, you got me again Captain Honor!\" yelled Sin. \"What have you done with my comrades Sin?\" asked Honor. Sin looked around awkwardly not sure what to say. \"OUT WITH IT SCUM!\" yelled The Captain. Sin sighed and said \"Do you really want to know?\", \"OF COURSE I DO TELL ME NOW!\". Sin got a very somber and serious look on his face and said \"They're dead\". Captain Honor was shocked, he was so sure SteelHawk was just exaggerating and panicking like an amateur when he said they were dead earlier. \"That's impossible, how could a lowly villain like you defeat them?\" asked Captain Honor. \"I don't want to tell you\" said Sin. \"What why not?\" asked The Captain. \"Cause you were always my favorite hero going up...\" Honor almost blushed at the genuine heart to heart compliment, but eventually regained his composure to ask \"But, what's that got to do with anything?\" Sin kept saying he didn't want to tell Captain Honor, but Honor kept asking getting more and more angry. Sin even started to say he would give up the hostage and leave if Honor just dropped the questions. But Honor was far too angry for that and instead started slapping and eventually punching Sin in the face until Sin finally started getting mad himself. \n\nHis eyes watery Sin told Honor the truth. \"Look, most of us villains were just normal kids growing up. And... like normal kids we all had our heroes. And me, like a lot of my associates really looked up to you Captain Honor. The world has become a fucked up place sir, but you and the few old heroes who are left somehow stayed above all that. So we've sort of... been going easy on you\". \"Easy on me? I don't believe you!\" replied Captain Honor. A forcefield suddenly appeared around Sin, and expanded out pushing Captain Honor back. Honor tried punching the force field, but did nothing but hurt his own hand. \"Why... why if you really look up to me did you do all this!?\" yelled Captain Honor. \"Honestly, I don't think you could understand me without becoming a villain yourself. I don't want to ever see that happen\". Sin activated his jet-boots and blasted out of the room. His group scattered, but not before executing the Mayor. \n\nAfter having a similar conversation with other villains, Captain Honor decided to retire.\n\nFor More Stories: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sharpWriting/", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure Captain Honor admitted the young heroes caught more criminals in quantity, but Captain Honor was adamant about beating them in quality.

Here, just sign in on the log.\"\n\nHe signed in with his false identity made for this purpose.  Henry Holcomb.  It was his original name, before the shifting series of names, fronts, shell corporations, and endless amounts of paperwork had obscured him for decades.  He paid taxes under this name, had a retirement account, and subscribed to three magazines.  It was a carefully cultivated lie.  It was iron clad if anyone from the police to the United Nations should look.  It was only transparent to one person, who had known his name many years earlier.\n\n\"Give it up, Green Error!\"\n\n\"That's the Green Terror!\"\n\n\"It's actually Henry Holcomb.

You can see all of New York from up here, as well as parts of Connecticut and New Jersey.  Do you know why I brought you up here?\"\n\n\"Are you gonna kill me?\"\n\n\"Oh no, ha ha!

You must be a fan.  I like your costume, by the way.  It looks great!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks.  I made it myself.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;d love a visit.  Just be mindful if he falls asleep.  Let a nurse know so we can move him to bed. We take good care of that man.  He&amp;#39;s in room A24.  It&amp;#39;s down that hallway there and then take a left at the end. Here, just sign in on the log.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He signed in with his false identity made for this purpose.  Henry Holcomb.  It was his original name, before the shifting series of names, fronts, shell corporations, and endless amounts of paperwork had obscured him for decades.  He paid taxes under this name, had a retirement account, and subscribed to three magazines.  It was a carefully cultivated lie.  It was iron clad if anyone from the police to the United Nations should look.  It was only transparent to one person, who had known his name many years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Give it up, Green Error!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s the Green Terror!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s actually Henry Holcomb.  Here, let me show you something.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\nThe Atomic Crusader lifted the Green Terror high into the sky. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve just destroyed the wiring of your suit, by the way.  When you untangle it at home, you&amp;#39;ll find it&amp;#39;s been transformed into spaghetti!  Ha ha!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Green Terror wiggled his toes, testing the switches in his boots, but to no avail.  His suit was suddenly unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Down the hall, then left at the end.  A courtesy knock, probably unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Robert?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes? Oh, is that you Henry?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes sir. I thought I&amp;#39;d drop in for a hello.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, pull up a chair, kid.  Have some lemonade.  They make a pitcher every afternoon.  I&amp;#39;m happy to share.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Henry, aka the Green Terror, sat and humbly accepted a glass of very sweet lemonade.  He always did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey kid, dya remember when you stole that truck full of lemons? That was a real laugh riot!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do!  I had forgotten about that. I&amp;#39;m not even sure I was gonna do with all those lemons. Probably try to sell them on the black market.  That was a harebrained scheme.&amp;quot;  He left it himself, and his young and eager hubris, sometimes woefully misguided.  &amp;quot;Who would buy lemons on the black market?&amp;quot;  They both laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;See that, Henry?  You can see all of New York from up here, as well as parts of Connecticut and New Jersey.  Do you know why I brought you up here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you gonna kill me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh no, ha ha! Look!&amp;quot;  Atomic Crusader&amp;#39;s eyes glowed white.  The planet below, lit by moonlight, changed.  The land was gone.  A vast ocean churned beneath them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What did you do?  What the hell happened?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I erased the land masses of planet.
