He placeshis feet on his desk as he considers his actions.  Normally, he would be thinking of ways to complete his assignment - no, not for this job, his &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; job. It makes good pay, and he always thought that at the very least, he could give his targets a modicum of respect by doing his job clean and well. But this time, things might get messy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The room is getting stuffy.&lt;/em&gt; He took off his tie and unbuttons his top collar. he checks his phone, looking through bank accounts, and seeing if whoever it is, they had wired cash into the anonymous bank account. &lt;em&gt;Fuck.&lt;/em&gt; two hundred thousand.

If he is still alive, you will join him by dawn&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, that gives off some hope. He slides down the phone and checks the time. 3 PM. That means he had options.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He can travel anywhere. He is a professional negotiator, after all. It also gives him good cover for his &amp;quot;Assignments&amp;quot;. No. They will find out the target and the assassin is one and the same. He cannot let them touch his coworkers, nor his family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have the time to track whoever sent this either, so there goes plan B.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plan C it is.

Sharing an office with this woman was like being trapped in a coffin with speakers playing a pop song in a handful of different languages all at the same time. *Did she have to guffah just when I was getting to the good part?* he thought.

Sure, it was his choice to work in this office, but that didn't mean he wasn't allowed to grumble about it from time to time. Though he knew it wasn't Maria or Keith that really rankled him this morning. The night Cody was previously reliving in his head had happened more than two months ago. It had NEVER been that long between assignments.

His heart took off faster than kindergartners being released for recess. *Finally!* Coffee being the furthest thing from his mind now, he quickly rerouted towards the office's front door to check his parcel in privacy. Almost jogging in excitement, Cody tried to contain himself as he strode out the double glass doors to a cloudy day that smelled of day-old rain.
