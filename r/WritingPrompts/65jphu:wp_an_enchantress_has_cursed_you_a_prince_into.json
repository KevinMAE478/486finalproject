He was more upset when she turned him back into a human. She thought making him into a beast would change things.\n\n\"Ah, never mind, maybe something else,\" she told herself, as she pulled a cloak over her and started her journey back to Prince Adam's castle. Different creatures ran over her mind, as she deliberated on the next creature to turn the into. A cockroach perhaps, they are gross, or even a spider. Prince Adam hated spiders.\n\nFrom two trees behind the hut, Kroak watched as his master trekked down the forest.

He'd not believed people actually *did* that, not until he'd been transformed into an eight foot tall, overly muscled leonid-human hybrid and realized he could induce that reaction in others simply by leaning over them and grinning. He was still a prince, of course - third in line, maybe, although he'd stopped keeping track of such things after his rather fortunate accident - and though he'd told the honor guard they needn't bother, they still insisted on protecting his castle. So he loomed. Whenever possible.\n\n\"Out of my way, little men,\" he rumbled, the deep bass of his voice shaking dust from the stones of the outer gate. \"I'm hungry.\"\n\nThe guard scattered like quail, and he barely restrained himself from giving chase. He'd tamed most of the strange impulses inherent in his leonine aspect, but some were hard to control. Cats, it seemed, simply loved hunting, and the sight of so much meat running so slowly was nigh irresistible. \n\nBut he had other prey today.\n\nHeinrich closed the gate with a flick of his paws and bounded off into the forest. Gwydion's curse included exile, but only by day, and he'd always been a night owl. He'd become fully nocturnal, and found his new schedule quite agreeable. The capital was only an hour's lope away, with all its temptations and delights, and the real parties started after sundown anyway. He bounded over the wall just as the bells were ringing nine o'clock. Perfect.\n\nThe low quarter of the city had become accustomed to his visits. He had no intention of eating a human, lest it trigger thoughts best left unthought, and so his presence went unremarked except for the odd shout of surprise and alarm as he passed. He made it to his destination without even having to intimidate the city watch.\n\nThe tavern went dead silent as he entered. The serving wenches froze in place, as did the patrons, some happily in mid-grope, and the bartenders exchanged uneasy glances. \n\n\"Heinrich?\" \n\nHe glanced into the corner and saw a booth full of women with smiling faces. A blond was waving at him. Lena. He grinned, lamplight dancing off the sharp points of his teeth, and as if that were a trigger the tavern swept back to life. \n\n\"Over here,\" Lena called, leaning forward to show off her cleavage. \"Saved you a spot!\"\n\nHeinrich padded through the crowd, which parted in front of him like a school of fish before a shark, and sat on his haunches by the booth. Lena leaned over and scratched his ears, lips slightly parted. He purred.\n\n\"Evening, ladies,\" he said, in as much of a whisper as his form allowed. \n\n\"We were worried you weren't coming,\" said a red haired girl with a dress that left little to the imagination. \"You promised to be here at eight!\"\n\n\"Fashionably late,\" said a brunette. She stared into his eyes, either mesmerized or trying to mesmerize. \"I like that.\"\n\n\"Let the beast drink,\" Lena admonished. \"My apologies, prince. They're a mite bit eager, is all.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" he chuckled. A pot full of ale was placed in front of him and he lapped at it languidly, letting the women scratch his ears and stroke his pelt. He refused to imagine a better life, lest the spell be broken and he actually have to live it, focusing instead on the sensation of their touch and the scent of their desire. Pure ecstasy, liquid bliss. \n\nThe tavern door swung open and once again silence fell. Heinrich glanced over his shoulder and his pupils dilated slightly.\n\n\"Gwydion,\" he growled, muscles tensing and claws splintering the floorboards. Lena cooed appreciatively, but he had forgotten her entirely.\n\nA raven haired woman stood in the door, dressed in black leather and holding a gnarled staff. She frowned and stalked through the tavern towards Heinrich, the crowd parting in front of her as if plowed out of the way by a magical force. Curses and spilled ale rippled in her wake, but none dared raise a hand.\n\n\"What the bloody hell are you doing here?\" she demanded, prodding Heinrich with her staff. It sizzled when it touched his hide, but he barely felt the pain.\n\n\"Enjoying myself,\" he growled, turning to face her. \"You?\"\n\n\"You're supposed to be in your castle,\" Gwydion snapped. \"The guard is in a tizzy and your father is not pleased.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So get your furry ass back there!\" Gwydion barked. She planted her staff on the floor and blue lights flickered up and down its length. \"What part of contemplative exile don't you understand?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Heinrich said, yawning cavernously. \"Contemplation, I suppose. Gave that up ages ago. As for exile, well. Here I am.\"\n\n\"And you!\" Gwydion snarled, pointing her staff at the women in the booth. \"What kind of harlots are you, consorting with a beast? Have you no shame?\"\n\n\"Shame?\" Lena blurted, indignantly. \"Are you discriminating against alternative lifestyles?\"\n\n\"Yeah, don't judge,\" said the red haired girl, blushing furiously. \n\n\"Enough of this,\" Gwydion muttered. The blue lights grew more intense. \"You don't appear to be learning anything, Heinrich, despite my best efforts. I've obviously made a mistake.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Heinrich purred. \"You have.\"\n\nGwydion's eyes widened slightly as Heinrich launched himself forward. The spell she had been brewing cooked off into the crowd, turning several onlookers into twisted gnomes and creating a stampede for the door. She swung her staff up to bar his path. Too late. Heinrich batted it aside and swatted her across the chest with his other paw. His claws raked her leathers, sending sparks flying as her protective magic interacted with his enchantment, but even though the leather held it could not absorb the full force of the blow. Gwydion slammed into a table and bounced hard to the floor. Heinrich pinned her down with a paw and brought his jaws close to her face.\n\n\"There is a lesson in this, somewhere,\" he growled. Gwydion's lips moved, and Heinrich felt a spell building, so he extended one razor sharp claw to touch her throat. Gwydion froze, fear finally dawning in her eyes. \"But you know what? I'm not even going to think about it. Safer that way.\"\n\n\"You fool,\" Gwydion wheezed. \"You cannot escape that form without my help.\"\n\n\"Escape?\" Heinrich said, chuckling. \"Why, I'm having the time of my *life*, dear Gwydion. I'm sure some day I'll accidentally divine whatever it is you and father meant to teach me, but until then I'll be enjoying myself. Thoroughly. Now, do we have an understanding? I'd hate to get blood all over this fine establishment.\"\n\nGwydion stared at him, struggling to breathe against the weight of his paw. She glanced at Lena, and then at his teeth. \n\n\"You're disgusting,\" she said. \"Vain, arrogant, totally lacking in empathy, unfit - \"\n\n\"Shhh,\" Heinrich whispered, although it came out more like a hiss. Close enough. He pricked her throat with his claw and she fell silent. \"That's better. I'm not keen on lectures, for obvious reasons. One last chance.\"\n\nGwydion shut her eyes and said, \"Fine. Have it your way.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" Heinrich purred. He stood back and let her struggle to her feet. \"I hope we don't have to repeat this conversation.\"\n\n\"I doubt we will,\" Gwydion muttered. She turned on her heel and stalked out of the tavern, slamming the door behind her. Heinrich turned to Lena and winked. \n\n\"Now where were we?\"\n\n", "edited": 1492310055.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heinrich loved looming over the guards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their fear smelled sweet, almost like honeycakes in the oven, and many of them would quite literally shake in their boots.

He grinned, lamplight dancing off the sharp points of his teeth, and as if that were a trigger the tavern swept back to life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Over here,&amp;quot; Lena called, leaning forward to show off her cleavage. &amp;quot;Saved you a spot!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heinrich padded through the crowd, which parted in front of him like a school of fish before a shark, and sat on his haunches by the booth. Lena leaned over and scratched his ears, lips slightly parted. He purred.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Evening, ladies,&amp;quot; he said, in as much of a whisper as his form allowed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We were worried you weren&amp;#39;t coming,&amp;quot; said a red haired girl with a dress that left little to the imagination. &amp;quot;You promised to be here at eight!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fashionably late,&amp;quot; said a brunette. She stared into his eyes, either mesmerized or trying to mesmerize. &amp;quot;I like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Let the beast drink,&amp;quot; Lena admonished. &amp;quot;My apologies, prince. They&amp;#39;re a mite bit eager, is all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So am I,&amp;quot; he chuckled. A pot full of ale was placed in front of him and he lapped at it languidly, letting the women scratch his ears and stroke his pelt. He refused to imagine a better life, lest the spell be broken and he actually have to live it, focusing instead on the sensation of their touch and the scent of their desire. Pure ecstasy, liquid bliss. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tavern door swung open and once again silence fell. Heinrich glanced over his shoulder and his pupils dilated slightly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gwydion,&amp;quot; he growled, muscles tensing and claws splintering the floorboards. Lena cooed appreciatively, but he had forgotten her entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A raven haired woman stood in the door, dressed in black leather and holding a gnarled staff. She frowned and stalked through the tavern towards Heinrich, the crowd parting in front of her as if plowed out of the way by a magical force. Curses and spilled ale rippled in her wake, but none dared raise a hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What the bloody hell are you doing here?&amp;quot; she demanded, prodding Heinrich with her staff. It sizzled when it touched his hide, but he barely felt the pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Enjoying myself,&amp;quot; he growled, turning to face her. &amp;quot;You?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re supposed to be in your castle,&amp;quot; Gwydion snapped. &amp;quot;The guard is in a tizzy and your father is not pleased.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So get your furry ass back there!&amp;quot; Gwydion barked. She planted her staff on the floor and blue lights flickered up and down its length. &amp;quot;What part of contemplative exile don&amp;#39;t you understand?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh,&amp;quot; Heinrich said, yawning cavernously. &amp;quot;Contemplation, I suppose. Gave that up ages ago. As for exile, well. Here I am.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And you!&amp;quot; Gwydion snarled, pointing her staff at the women in the booth. &amp;quot;What kind of harlots are you, consorting with a beast? Have you no shame?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shame?&amp;quot; Lena blurted, indignantly. &amp;quot;Are you discriminating against alternative lifestyles?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, don&amp;#39;t judge,&amp;quot; said the red haired girl, blushing furiously. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Enough of this,&amp;quot; Gwydion muttered. The blue lights grew more intense. &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t appear to be learning anything, Heinrich, despite my best efforts. I&amp;#39;ve obviously made a mistake.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; Heinrich purred. &amp;quot;You have.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwydion&amp;#39;s eyes widened slightly as Heinrich launched himself forward. The spell she had been brewing cooked off into the crowd, turning several onlookers into twisted gnomes and creating a stampede for the door. She swung her staff up to bar his path. Too late. Heinrich batted it aside and swatted her across the chest with his other paw. His claws raked her leathers, sending sparks flying as her protective magic interacted with his enchantment, but even though the leather held it could not absorb the full force of the blow. Gwydion slammed into a table and bounced hard to the floor. Heinrich pinned her down with a paw and brought his jaws close to her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is a lesson in this, somewhere,&amp;quot; he growled. Gwydion&amp;#39;s lips moved, and Heinrich felt a spell building, so he extended one razor sharp claw to touch her throat. Gwydion froze, fear finally dawning in her eyes. &amp;quot;But you know what? I&amp;#39;m not even going to think about it. Safer that way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You fool,&amp;quot; Gwydion wheezed. &amp;quot;You cannot escape that form without my help.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Escape?&amp;quot; Heinrich said, chuckling. &amp;quot;Why, I&amp;#39;m having the time of my &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;, dear Gwydion. I&amp;#39;m sure some day I&amp;#39;ll accidentally divine whatever it is you and father meant to teach me, but until then I&amp;#39;ll be enjoying myself. Thoroughly. Now, do we have an understanding? I&amp;#39;d hate to get blood all over this fine establishment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwydion stared at him, struggling to breathe against the weight of his paw. She glanced at Lena, and then at his teeth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re disgusting,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Vain, arrogant, totally lacking in empathy, unfit - &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shhh,&amp;quot; Heinrich whispered, although it came out more like a hiss. Close enough. He pricked her throat with his claw and she fell silent. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s better. I&amp;#39;m not keen on lectures, for obvious reasons. One last chance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gwydion shut her eyes and said, &amp;quot;Fine. Have it your way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Excellent!&amp;quot; Heinrich purred. He stood back and let her struggle to her feet. &amp;quot;I hope we don&amp;#39;t have to repeat this conversation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I doubt we will,&amp;quot; Gwydion muttered. She turned on her heel and stalked out of the tavern, slamming the door behind her. Heinrich turned to Lena and winked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now where were we?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgbjxxy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492338632.0, "created_utc": 1492309832.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jphu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbhk9r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 28, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SeptemberBard", "parent_id": "t3_65jphu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Eleanora's plan had been a success.

Such a strange turn of events had taken place, all of which I suppose I should have seen. Lifting myself from the soft green grass, my gaze travels over the ridges and folds of my new flesh. Old flesh and new form, or same flesh with new purpose? I didn't catch the incantation sadly. Where once I was weak, now I am strong beyond all doubt. \n\nI suppose I should let you know. I have not often been a good person. I let myself become shaped by others and regret it with my entire soul. In the Kingdom that was a home to me, I was a prince. My word spared and sentenced lives, my gestures a word of law. Though with all that power, I never had much inclination to use. While my elder brothers toiled away with their arts of war, combat, and strife, I enjoyed a quite life in the archives. Studying to my hearts content, learning of histories long past and magic long forgotten, lost to times endless ravages. To be a gifted mage was never in the cards, I'm ashamed to say. I always tried, but I could do no more than but light a candle. I am-was a frail child, given to sickness and weak blood. A single half-ment blow from one of my brothers would lay me in the sickbed for a score of days, sometimes longer. Thus in the shadows I was endlessly mocked. To do so to my face would openly invite my ire, or the ire of some of my more defensive siblings. But in the murky half-light world of court intrigue, rumors wore the badge of truth. \n\nI was often described of being cursed, or an ill gotten half breed produced from a dalliance between my mother, bless her dearly departed soul, and the ugly beasts in the stables. Some days I was the changeling child of the Fey, a lurking hobgoblin that would never show his face. I will admit, these jabs at my appearance and figure did do quite a number on me. See, the Archives existed far below ground and oft the only light to behold was that if a candle or lamp. I grew unbearably pale, so much so that to much light was a cause of physical pain. Long robes, shawls, and thick tunics helped me block out the hideous light of day. Ruinous thing, daytime. Or so I thought until now. \n\nEventually, something that always lurked under my skin, a need tearing free from my flesh unwanton, arose. I desired a friend. I knew nobody would love my for my appearance. Even my own brothers hadn't seen my visage in years, after I started taking supper in the Archives with my studies. So after some careful, unknown research, I devised a simple theory. Adults socialized in court, their children ever present as to learn their ways so that they to could survive and hopefully thrive beside their colleagues. Before my father I offered up a solution so that I might come out of my shell, and that the children of the nobles would come to treat me with respect, and not as some malovent dark force, lurking in the shadows. The Archives were part of an ancient underground city, most of it crumbled away to the endless abyss. However, there were a few grand sections left usable. \n\nMy father granted this request, that I might form a Night Court underneath the castle, to convene my own company and build reputation with my peers. This was announced to court the next day, the nobles sons and daughters loved the idea. While they frantically sought each other out to spread the wonderful news, I had a most important issue. My appearance would lead to nothing but the shunning of the Night Court, and to the endless rumors of my hideousness confirmed. So I devised a mask, a three sectioned piece of delicately artificed materials to present my face. Our castle smith helped me, using his skills to create a frame to hold each individual piece of the mask together. The left eye, the right eye, and the nose/mouth guard to form up a perfect concealment devise. \n\nToday was the day, dressed in my favorite robes. An affection of monks habits, though spun in gold and trimmed in onyx shade. My mask, with vibrant eyes of maroon and jade, a mouthguard ever stoic blackness sat over my features. I welcomed my guests, my practiced speech flowing from my lips. \n\n\"Welcome, Lords and Ladies of the Nights Court! Here we are free to do as we please! No more are we our fathers and mothers eager attendants, but rather people of our own. So, eat and drink and make merry. Soon we should make up some discussions, to propel our Court into legitimacy!\" \n\nI sat down, glad to be surrounded by those of my own, though I do miss my books. However, such a brilliant speech could not be followed without ill-conceived discourse. Lord Branson's son, Cadly Branson was a brash, arrogant man who hated the thought of any above him. His seeming goal in life was to bring those above him down. \n\"Tell me, oh great Prince of the Kingdom, why do you cover your face? Why do you sit upon that granite throne in this Undercroft and proclaim yourself above us? Bare your face sir, so we might know our glorious leader.\" I was shocked at this brash display. Sure he knows that I could have him killed for this. My guards.... Oh no. I had forgotten that I wished for these meetings to be unguarded, to allow the progeny of Lords to speak freely. \n\nCadly marched up my throne, his face a magnificent grin. Jubilantly, he reached out to me. I thrust out my arms, as if I could hold him at bay. With a blow to my temple, he wrenched my mask, my wonderfully beautiful mask asunder. What was revealed to Nights Court that day would scar them for the rest of their, albeit short lives. Livid red eyes sunken deeply in my skull, patchwork motheaten white flesh, doughy  and lump filled. Snargled teeth and a hideous stink arouse from my monstrous features. My face was bared to Night Court. \n\nMany started vomiting, ladies screaming but knew not where to run. If I had been paying attention, I would have noticed someone creepy back towards the dreadful, bleak surface. Cadly pointed at me, not in jest or insult, but in fear. \"A monster! Your surely are no get of the royal line. You must have taken the true prince! Someone, help me kill this abomination!\" With this declaration, Cadly drew his elaborate Court sword and pointed it at my heart. All this time, I was still recovering from the blow dealt to the head. \"CADLY!\" I roared at him. \"I AM YOUR LIEGE AND YOU WILL BOW BEFORE ME, OR ELSE!\" Spittle was thrown from my mouth in rage, as a boy no more fit to lick my boots threatened my life. Cadly took a step back, but then his resolve stiffened. With a elaborate and artful thrust, his blade chased my heaving heart. What a shame for Cadly. So much show, but no efficiency. His blade sunk deep yes, but into the stone of my throne. I let loose a demonized smile before wrapping my long, delicate arms around his neck, and the knife in my right hand sunk deep into his neck. Cadly struggled, pounding on my frail ribs and chest, shattering and fracturing my insides. Till eventually, he slumped down and breathed his last.

This is not the end of my story, merely a beginning to something greater.  ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wild woodlands of my wonderful green home, I laid on my back contemplating. Such a strange turn of events had taken place, all of which I suppose I should have seen. Lifting myself from the soft green grass, my gaze travels over the ridges and folds of my new flesh. Old flesh and new form, or same flesh with new purpose? I didn&amp;#39;t catch the incantation sadly. Where once I was weak, now I am strong beyond all doubt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I should let you know. I have not often been a good person. I let myself become shaped by others and regret it with my entire soul. In the Kingdom that was a home to me, I was a prince. My word spared and sentenced lives, my gestures a word of law. Though with all that power, I never had much inclination to use. While my elder brothers toiled away with their arts of war, combat, and strife, I enjoyed a quite life in the archives. Studying to my hearts content, learning of histories long past and magic long forgotten, lost to times endless ravages. To be a gifted mage was never in the cards, I&amp;#39;m ashamed to say. I always tried, but I could do no more than but light a candle. I am-was a frail child, given to sickness and weak blood. A single half-ment blow from one of my brothers would lay me in the sickbed for a score of days, sometimes longer. Thus in the shadows I was endlessly mocked. To do so to my face would openly invite my ire, or the ire of some of my more defensive siblings. But in the murky half-light world of court intrigue, rumors wore the badge of truth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was often described of being cursed, or an ill gotten half breed produced from a dalliance between my mother, bless her dearly departed soul, and the ugly beasts in the stables. Some days I was the changeling child of the Fey, a lurking hobgoblin that would never show his face. I will admit, these jabs at my appearance and figure did do quite a number on me. See, the Archives existed far below ground and oft the only light to behold was that if a candle or lamp. I grew unbearably pale, so much so that to much light was a cause of physical pain. Long robes, shawls, and thick tunics helped me block out the hideous light of day. Ruinous thing, daytime. Or so I thought until now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, something that always lurked under my skin, a need tearing free from my flesh unwanton, arose. I desired a friend. I knew nobody would love my for my appearance. Even my own brothers hadn&amp;#39;t seen my visage in years, after I started taking supper in the Archives with my studies. So after some careful, unknown research, I devised a simple theory. Adults socialized in court, their children ever present as to learn their ways so that they to could survive and hopefully thrive beside their colleagues. Before my father I offered up a solution so that I might come out of my shell, and that the children of the nobles would come to treat me with respect, and not as some malovent dark force, lurking in the shadows. The Archives were part of an ancient underground city, most of it crumbled away to the endless abyss. However, there were a few grand sections left usable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father granted this request, that I might form a Night Court underneath the castle, to convene my own company and build reputation with my peers. This was announced to court the next day, the nobles sons and daughters loved the idea. While they frantically sought each other out to spread the wonderful news, I had a most important issue. My appearance would lead to nothing but the shunning of the Night Court, and to the endless rumors of my hideousness confirmed. So I devised a mask, a three sectioned piece of delicately artificed materials to present my face. Our castle smith helped me, using his skills to create a frame to hold each individual piece of the mask together. The left eye, the right eye, and the nose/mouth guard to form up a perfect concealment devise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today was the day, dressed in my favorite robes. An affection of monks habits, though spun in gold and trimmed in onyx shade. My mask, with vibrant eyes of maroon and jade, a mouthguard ever stoic blackness sat over my features. I welcomed my guests, my practiced speech flowing from my lips. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome, Lords and Ladies of the Nights Court! Here we are free to do as we please! No more are we our fathers and mothers eager attendants, but rather people of our own. So, eat and drink and make merry. Soon we should make up some discussions, to propel our Court into legitimacy!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat down, glad to be surrounded by those of my own, though I do miss my books. However, such a brilliant speech could not be followed without ill-conceived discourse. Lord Branson&amp;#39;s son, Cadly Branson was a brash, arrogant man who hated the thought of any above him. His seeming goal in life was to bring those above him down. \n&amp;quot;Tell me, oh great Prince of the Kingdom, why do you cover your face? Why do you sit upon that granite throne in this Undercroft and proclaim yourself above us? Bare your face sir, so we might know our glorious leader.&amp;quot; I was shocked at this brash display. Sure he knows that I could have him killed for this. My guards.... Oh no. I had forgotten that I wished for these meetings to be unguarded, to allow the progeny of Lords to speak freely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadly marched up my throne, his face a magnificent grin. Jubilantly, he reached out to me. I thrust out my arms, as if I could hold him at bay. With a blow to my temple, he wrenched my mask, my wonderfully beautiful mask asunder. What was revealed to Nights Court that day would scar them for the rest of their, albeit short lives. Livid red eyes sunken deeply in my skull, patchwork motheaten white flesh, doughy  and lump filled. Snargled teeth and a hideous stink arouse from my monstrous features. My face was bared to Night Court. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many started vomiting, ladies screaming but knew not where to run. If I had been paying attention, I would have noticed someone creepy back towards the dreadful, bleak surface. Cadly pointed at me, not in jest or insult, but in fear. &amp;quot;A monster! Your surely are no get of the royal line. You must have taken the true prince! Someone, help me kill this abomination!&amp;quot; With this declaration, Cadly drew his elaborate Court sword and pointed it at my heart. All this time, I was still recovering from the blow dealt to the head. &amp;quot;CADLY!&amp;quot; I roared at him. &amp;quot;I AM YOUR LIEGE AND YOU WILL BOW BEFORE ME, OR ELSE!&amp;quot; Spittle was thrown from my mouth in rage, as a boy no more fit to lick my boots threatened my life. Cadly took a step back, but then his resolve stiffened. With a elaborate and artful thrust, his blade chased my heaving heart. What a shame for Cadly. So much show, but no efficiency. His blade sunk deep yes, but into the stone of my throne. I let loose a demonized smile before wrapping my long, delicate arms around his neck, and the knife in my right hand sunk deep into his neck. Cadly struggled, pounding on my frail ribs and chest, shattering and fracturing my insides. Till eventually, he slumped down and breathed his last. He did his own damage, my racking coughs spouting out blood. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guards stormed into the Night Court, to find my mouth covered in what looked like Cadly&amp;#39;s blood. I was bound and chained and dragged to the local temple. It&amp;#39;s a wonder I survived really. Layed upon a table, a Priest Mantled Green entered.
