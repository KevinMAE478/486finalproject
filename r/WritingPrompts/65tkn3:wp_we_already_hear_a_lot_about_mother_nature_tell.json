He was big and round, with an endless smile and a booming laugh that could come out of no where. \n\nMother told me to stay away from Uncle Space. She said Uncle Space was too \"out there\" and irresponsible. \"Look here,\" she'd say, pointing outside our home, \"You see those trees? I made those trees. I made the birds, the grass, the clouds. I've worked myself to the dirt, and I made that too! Trying to provide a good life for you kids. Those are the sort of goals you should be setting for yourself. Not to,\" She hesitated there. As much I could tell that she didn't like Uncle Space, she was too kind to truly speak poorly about him. That was why he was at Uncle Sun's birthday party. She would never not invite family to a party. \"Not to spend your days with fantasies in your head.\"\n\nBut I couldn't help myself. Uncle Space fascinated me. \"Life?\" He'd scoff. \"Nature's always been good at it, I'll admit that, but it's so *done*. Like, who hasn't seen life these days? You know what's cool? A volcano that shoots out ice! Two universes, swirling around each other, until BOOM!\" He'd clap his hands together, making the younger cousins jump. \"They crash into each other! What else could you ask for? And no life to keep you tied down! Once you finish one job you move onto the next.\"\n\nUncle Space inspired me. I'd never tell my mother, but life bored me to death. I was never good at it. My brother Earth could create forests of trees, mountains filled with creatures, or jungles teeming with life. Even my sister Sea had found her own path. But I wasn't like them. I was different. I hated it. \n\nSo I leaned forward, setting my book down. \"Yes, please!\" I loved Uncle Space's jokes. \n\nHe leaned in, as if he were about to tell me a secret. \"How,\" he whispered, \"do you have a party in space?\"\n\nI shook my head, rapt as ever when talking to Uncle. \n\nHe spread his arms and leaned even closer, \"YOU PLANET!\" He doubled over laughing, wiping tears from his eyes. The funniest part of an Uncle Space joke was never the joke, just how much he cracked himself up. \n\nAfter a few more jokes and puns, he finally sat down next to me. This was out of character for Uncle Space, who would usually orbit the room a few times before finding the next recipient of a space joke. But now he was silent, staring straight ahead as he mused, and I was too, realizing something very important was happening. \"Tell me, what do you want to do in the future?\" He asked, finally looking towards me.\n\nI looked down. I couldn't help it. Despite my mother's encouragement, I knew I was a family failure. The one child of the great Mother Nature who couldn't create life. \"I don't know.\" I finally whispered. \n\nUncle Space lifted up my chin. \"Hey now,\" He said, uncharacteristically gentle. \"Don't be like that. There's no reason to look down. Everybody has a purpose. It's just that everyone has different purposes. Otherwise everything would be the same! How awful would that be?\" He gave me a look of horror that was so silly and exaggerated that I had to laugh. \"There's my girl!\" He smiled, and I found myself smiling despite myself. \"Listen, I was thinking. When I was a kid I was a lot like you. I was no good at this life stuff. I liked creating and destroying things, finding ways to reach new heights and go further than anyone else! Once I realized that was what I loved and wanted to do, I went for it!\" He looked at me again, his eyes more serious than I had ever seen them. \"What do you love?\"\n\nI contemplated for a moment. My family had always been so obsessed about life, I had never thought about what I loved. What I wanted. What was out there for me besides life? \"I love helping my family,\" I said quietly. I expected some follow up question, but Uncle Space only nodded, so I continued. \"But I don't know how. Mother will complain to Sea about the beaches being too dry, so I try to find some sort of fish or frog that can splash water, or act like a sponge, but it never works. Meanwhile Sea creates mudskippers and sea sponges! I could never do that!\" For the first time, I let myself be frustrated, giving up on trying to be perfect. \"Earth complains that the forests are too dark at night, so Mother creates lightning bugs! Can you believe it? Sun used to be the only one who could create light! I couldn't even do that! I want to help, but I'm just so useless!\" My eyes found the floor again, teeth clenched and arms crossed. Tears were welling up in my eyes, and I tried and failed to stop them. \n\nDespite my outburst, Uncle Space didn't sound mad or sad. \"You want to help your family do those things?\" I looked at him out of the corner of my eye and saw that he was smiling. It was an even bigger smile than when he had showed us Saturn's rings. \"Luna, I think I have the perfect solution for you.\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for reading, this was my first writing prompt!
