I looked down at the middle-aged bespectacled woman with a quick, noncommital smirk at her lame attempt at humor. As I moved onto the next check-in station, I quickly glanced at my watch. It was 12:06. I was late. My Uber driver, in all the hustle and bustle of the lunch rush, had missed the final turn leading to the convention center, forcing us to loop around the crowded downtown block. He had profusely apologized, claiming that he was new to the city. I accepted his apology and repeatedly assured him that it was alright, but I couldn't help but let the frustration build within my already stressed and frantic mental state.  \nAs I entered the double-wide doors of the ornately designed convention center, my jaw dropped, figuratively that is. I was adamant that I remain calm and cool on the surface. But how could I? Looking around the vast hall, I saw my face, my body, my mannerisms, over and over again. I shuddered as I saw hundreds upon hundreds of Tylers, 6 foot 3 inches, about 200 pounds. Some were wearing glasses, while I had opted for contacts today. I had always been wary of cloning, and my suspicions had been immediately confirmed. Unlike the Clone Army in Star Wars Episode II, the carbon copies of myself had no real purpose or intent. Some were on their phones, most likely pretending to text. Others were hovering around the snack and refreshment area, painstakingly weighing risk and reward between the mini hot links bathed in barbecue sauce and the veggie platter. In the center of the hall, stood several scores of brave Tylers, attempting to make the most of the afternoon by partaking in that awkward, fabricated meet-and-greet fashion, as is the norm with these events.\nPoor saps, I thought to myself. Oddly enough, they seemed to be genuinely enjoying themselves. I overheard one particularly loud Tyler, who was sharing an anecdote that only another Tyler would appreciate.\n\"So I spit out my gum and wrapped it in a napkin. I was getting a coffee and a water cup, so I knew I would be out of cupholder real estate. I asked the lady at the drive-thru window if she could throw it away for me, and she freaked out! She looked at the napkin like it had the plague. I'm like, 'Lady, it's just a piece of gum. You won't even touch it! It's completely ensconced in the napkin!' I bet she didn't even know what ensconced meant.\"\nI shuddered at the douchey and pretentious story. I shuddered again after realizing that it was some skewed version of myself who had subjugated a minimum wage worker into disposing of my chewed gum. The Tyler who was listening intently to the considerably uneventful tale shook his head periodically as a sign of solidarity with 6331, the Drive-Thru Dick. \nWhy had I even come here? As an introvert, the last thing I wanted to do was see 7000 identical duplicates of myself, with all my flaws and shortcomings apparent as ever. To the outsider, I assume the convention would appear to have the semblance of hosting a group of agreeable, pleasant, humorous, and lanky people. But I had the insider's perspective. Internally, we were all judging the other, desperate to scoop up any reason to believe we were superior to our neighbor, despite our 99.99% similarity.\n\"My shirt is nicer than his.... I could definitely beat him in 1 on 1 basketball....This one is such a simpleton.\"\nThis was a bad idea, I turned around to leave. What obligation did I have to stay? It's not like anyone would notice I left! As I stormed through the crowd towards the exit, I was stopped dead in my tracks. The trio of speakers above us began to blare an all too familiar tune. It was \"Feelin Myself\" by the late, great Mac Dre. A brave Tyler had determinedly rushed the unattended DJ booth and started to play the track that would unite us all. I felt a surge of pride and admiration for the valiant #125. I looked around hesitantly at the array of Tylers in close proximity. They were doing the same. \nThen 125 paused the song, grabbed the microphone in the booth and shouted fiercely, \"Guys, let's be real, this sucks. I love you all, but gathering here today was a terrible idea. Tylers were not meant to come into contact with each other like this. It's my humble opinion that the only way for this to be a success is for all of us to engage in the one act that binds us all: the dancing to Bay Area Hip Hop.\"\nThis was received by a chorus of cheers. The air of apprehensiveness present in the almost immediately dissipated. Suddenly, Tylers by the dozen were trickling towards the sheet vinyl dance floor to get down. \n\"Ahh, what the hell,\" I said aloud with a grin. I turned to join my brethren on the dance floor.\nThere's a part of me that detested being in a room with all these mirror images of myself, but looking around, I noticed one thing: I sure could dance.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay, you&amp;#39;re number 3323.

In the center of the hall, stood several scores of brave Tylers, attempting to make the most of the afternoon by partaking in that awkward, fabricated meet-and-greet fashion, as is the norm with these events.\nPoor saps, I thought to myself. Oddly enough, they seemed to be genuinely enjoying themselves. I overheard one particularly loud Tyler, who was sharing an anecdote that only another Tyler would appreciate.\n&amp;quot;So I spit out my gum and wrapped it in a napkin. I was getting a coffee and a water cup, so I knew I would be out of cupholder real estate. I asked the lady at the drive-thru window if she could throw it away for me, and she freaked out! She looked at the napkin like it had the plague. I&amp;#39;m like, &amp;#39;Lady, it&amp;#39;s just a piece of gum. You won&amp;#39;t even touch it! It&amp;#39;s completely ensconced in the napkin!&amp;#39; I bet she didn&amp;#39;t even know what ensconced meant.&amp;quot;\nI shuddered at the douchey and pretentious story. I shuddered again after realizing that it was some skewed version of myself who had subjugated a minimum wage worker into disposing of my chewed gum. The Tyler who was listening intently to the considerably uneventful tale shook his head periodically as a sign of solidarity with 6331, the Drive-Thru Dick. \nWhy had I even come here? As an introvert, the last thing I wanted to do was see 7000 identical duplicates of myself, with all my flaws and shortcomings apparent as ever. To the outsider, I assume the convention would appear to have the semblance of hosting a group of agreeable, pleasant, humorous, and lanky people. But I had the insider&amp;#39;s perspective. Internally, we were all judging the other, desperate to scoop up any reason to believe we were superior to our neighbor, despite our 99.99% similarity.\n&amp;quot;My shirt is nicer than his.... I could definitely beat him in 1 on 1 basketball....This one is such a simpleton.&amp;quot;\nThis was a bad idea, I turned around to leave. What obligation did I have to stay? It&amp;#39;s not like anyone would notice I left! As I stormed through the crowd towards the exit, I was stopped dead in my tracks. The trio of speakers above us began to blare an all too familiar tune. It was &amp;quot;Feelin Myself&amp;quot; by the late, great Mac Dre. A brave Tyler had determinedly rushed the unattended DJ booth and started to play the track that would unite us all. I felt a surge of pride and admiration for the valiant #125. I looked around hesitantly at the array of Tylers in close proximity. They were doing the same. \nThen 125 paused the song, grabbed the microphone in the booth and shouted fiercely, &amp;quot;Guys, let&amp;#39;s be real, this sucks. I love you all, but gathering here today was a terrible idea. Tylers were not meant to come into contact with each other like this. It&amp;#39;s my humble opinion that the only way for this to be a success is for all of us to engage in the one act that binds us all: the dancing to Bay Area Hip Hop.&amp;quot;\nThis was received by a chorus of cheers. The air of apprehensiveness present in the almost immediately dissipated. Suddenly, Tylers by the dozen were trickling towards the sheet vinyl dance floor to get down. \n&amp;quot;Ahh, what the hell,&amp;quot; I said aloud with a grin. I turned to join my brethren on the dance floor.\nThere&amp;#39;s a part of me that detested being in a room with all these mirror images of myself, but looking around, I noticed one thing: I sure could dance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg8co9b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492152060.0, "created_utc": 1492123260.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654qhu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8ltqs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "crisolice", "parent_id": "t3_654qhu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is what I'm like.

Thankfully, most of us didn't come. It's rather like us to cancel social plans, and in the end only about a hundred of me showed up. My first thought--all of our first thought I assume--was that now I could really go crazy on the hors d'oeuvres.\n\nIt was something to help me escape from having to talk myself. Mirrors, in daily life, are not unlike the funhouse mirrors of a carnival. They distort your features and reflect your own perception of yourself, rather than your objective form. When I'm depressed, the longer I gaze at a mirror, the more I despise myself and the closer to the brink of insanity I feel.\n\nWell, now I'm seeing myself as someone else sees me. It's an indescribable feeling, and it sits in my stomach all wrong. It's tough to talk to these people. It's tough to look at them. All I see is a weird, alien appearance. A weird, alien voice. My awkward mannerisms. My lack of confidence about anything in life. I see everything about myself that makes me a failure.\n\nYet we talked earnestly for hours. It was like the first time I took ecstasy. I talked to my brother as if my heart was wide open and we stayed up clear through to the morning. It was the closest we've ever been. It's a wonderful feeling to be able to speak with no reservations, no concern of judgment. And that's how we spoke today. We just picked any Chris and we laid bear our soul, and we waited silently and with complete empathy as they did the same. We didn't ask many questions, because we didn't know the answers to anything we knew to ask.\n\nAnd as the hours passed, I began to find myself pathetic. The total sum of fears and failures in this undecorated conference room could do just fine replacing the sum total of mankind. All I seemed to be sure of was that I wasn't happy with my life. I even knew the sorts of things that would fix the problem, or at least put me on a better path, but I just couldn't seem to do them. None of us knew why. We were just broken somehow. My Chris said so, and it seemed like an appropriate time to give him a hug or something, but I didn't do anything. I just said, \"Yeah.\"\n\nWe talked about why Janelle left us. We weren't really sure, but we had a strong guess. Probably something to do with not making people feel loved. I mean, I had trouble giving myself a hug. She probably thought I was a psychopath.\n\nAnd I see it all. I see so much in my face. I see the bright eyes, the goofy smile, the desperation to be liked. I see the scar by my nose--a deep pockmark where I picked at a scab over and over until the flesh went totally missing. I see the abuse, the sadness, and the inadequacy. It all shines through so clearly somehow, and I see it all at once, but also separately, the way a dog can smell each individual scent clearly, no matter how you try to mask them. They always shine through.\n\nI see it all and my stomach turns. This is me. This is who I am. I now realize how merciful a mirror truly is. Every day a mirror gives you a chance to see yourself in a new way. When you're feeling good, it lets you be handsome. When you're feeling bad, it lets you revel in your sadness. You can never quite be sure how people see you. What a gift.\n\nAnd within just a few minutes of each other, we all decided to leave. There were no goodbyes. We all understood how sick this was becoming. My brother once said to me, \"Leave while you're still having fun.\" Well, we just missed it, but still we left. I had stared into the mirror too long and everything I saw was turning ugly. But it didn't make me depressed. I certainly wasn't happy either. I was feeling something I can't really relate. It was like I was suddenly sure about everything,  even though I hadn't specifically figured anything out. I felt like I could walk right through a brick wall. I wanted to dig up my dad and spit on his bones. I suddenly felt as if I had nothing to apologize for. That I wasn't sorry for being alive.\n\nIt was as if every part of my broken soul suddenly united under the philosophy of absolute rejection. Rejection of the thought that I had to be this way and that there were all these good reasons why I couldn't do better. None of us said goodbye because there was nothing to say anymore. We had reflected and contemplated and dissected and analyzed and yearned and pined and waxed until there was nothing left at all but the truth. It sent us marching out the door and none of us looked back at each other.\n\nI can't say I'll be different from now on. I can't say it because words cheapen everything that seems pure. I don't think I learned anything that I can explain well enough for you to understand. I just know I don't accept what I saw today, and if I ever do accept it, it'll probably be the last time you hear from me. But I won't go like this. And I won't go over it and over it in my mind. I won't dissect it anymore. I don't know if I'm too objective, or too stupid, but my ability to do the right thing has been compromised at some point in my life and I'm cutting out as many links in the chain as I can. That means all the voices of fear and doubt no longer get equal representation in my thoughts. This is no longer a democracy. This is martial law. I won't die like this. I am not my dad.\n\nI'm still talking too much. That's fine, I had one last thing to say but I'm done now. \n\nI hope the building is empty next year.\n\n\n", "edited": 1492293256.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what I&amp;#39;m like.

I stopped myself short of asking him how he knew this was my fourteenth year, realizing that the professionally laminated badge hanging on a lanyard around my neck clearly broadcasted that information to anyone taking the time to look. His badge, hanging off-center over the dizzying, checkered button up shirt that seemed to be the unofficial uniform for this year\u2019s convention goers, told me that his name was Geoff. Geoff \u2013 that special brand of unintuitively spelled name that the Flower Children liked to burden their children with in a pathetic attempt to make them unique.  \n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I replied, not even trying to match his fervor, \u201cI\u2019ve been around for a while. The event committee puts a lot of effort into keeping the programs pretty different year to year so there\u2019s always a new workshop or something that makes it worth coming back. It must be a little overwhelming for you as a new experience. I don\u2019t know what I would have done if it was this hectic my first year.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, not at all! I think it\u2019s amazing! I just wish I could get to more of the programs, it\u2019s so tough to decide which ones to choose. I think I\u2019m going to the Levi\u2019s seminar next \u2013 I hear that they have a new line of products specially designed for people with our\u2026condition.\u201d As Geoff said the word \u2018condition,\u2019 he lowered his voice and his wide, bespectacled eyes instinctively scanned our immediate area as though to make sure no one had heard him. I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at his timidity.  For some reason I found this green conventioneer\u2019s conditioned nervousness comically endearing. \n\n\u201cYou know, I run into that problem every year.\u201d I quickly followed, seeing Geoff wince at the sound of my laughter. \u201cYour best bet is to follow your gut. If you overthink it you\u2019ll just end up regretting whatever you decide to check out. I\u2019ve always had a great time at the Levi\u2019s programs, though, they have some great tips on keeping yourself comfortable. I haven\u2019t had any ride-up issues in years thanks to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great to hear! I think it\u2019s starting in twenty minutes over in the big ballroom,\u201d he said, glancing down to reference his program guide. \u201cAre you going? We could walk over there together\u2026I want to get there before all the seats fill up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m actually going to head to Nike\u2019s exercise seminar, I\u2019ve been having a chaffing problem recently and I want to see if they have any strategies for preventing it. I\u2019ll be at the hotel bar afterward, though, so come find me and we can trade notes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds great, I\u2019ll see you in a little bit then! It was nice to meet you!\u201d\n\nGeoff turned to walk away, his badge swinging pendulously around his thin neck. As he walked away, I could see the faint, tell-tale creases on the back of his khakis that all us Never Nudes bear as a consequence of our denim base layers. And to think just fourteen years ago I thought there were only dozens of us. Dozens! Those were the dark days, before Never Nudes Anonymous and the convention got going and changed all of our lives. Now we know, though. We know that we are really thousands strong and we\u2019ve built a vast denim clad consortium from those numbers. In those numbers\u2026we\u2019ve found strength. \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHi there, Ryan!

I think I\u2019m going to the Levi\u2019s seminar next \u2013 I hear that they have a new line of products specially designed for people with our\u2026condition.\u201d As Geoff said the word \u2018condition,\u2019 he lowered his voice and his wide, bespectacled eyes instinctively scanned our immediate area as though to make sure no one had heard him. I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at his timidity.  For some reason I found this green conventioneer\u2019s conditioned nervousness comically endearing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou know, I run into that problem every year.\u201d I quickly followed, seeing Geoff wince at the sound of my laughter. \u201cYour best bet is to follow your gut. If you overthink it you\u2019ll just end up regretting whatever you decide to check out. I\u2019ve always had a great time at the Levi\u2019s programs, though, they have some great tips on keeping yourself comfortable. I haven\u2019t had any ride-up issues in years thanks to them.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s great to hear! I think it\u2019s starting in twenty minutes over in the big ballroom,\u201d he said, glancing down to reference his program guide. \u201cAre you going? We could walk over there together\u2026I want to get there before all the seats fill up.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI think I\u2019m actually going to head to Nike\u2019s exercise seminar, I\u2019ve been having a chaffing problem recently and I want to see if they have any strategies for preventing it. I\u2019ll be at the hotel bar afterward, though, so come find me and we can trade notes.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSounds great, I\u2019ll see you in a little bit then! It was nice to meet you!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Geoff turned to walk away, his badge swinging pendulously around his thin neck. As he walked away, I could see the faint, tell-tale creases on the back of his khakis that all us Never Nudes bear as a consequence of our denim base layers. And to think just fourteen years ago I thought there were only dozens of us. Dozens! Those were the dark days, before Never Nudes Anonymous and the convention got going and changed all of our lives. Now we know, though. We know that we are really thousands strong and we\u2019ve built a vast denim clad consortium from those numbers. In those numbers\u2026we\u2019ve found strength. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg8hxtj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492159166.0, "created_utc": 1492130366.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654qhu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654qhu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654qhu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8863y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BIessthefaII", "parent_id": "t1_dg84isy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I literally only read the last 3 lines, but that's a reference to the movie *The Revenant.* Stop reading now if you don't want a spoiler\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n^^^In ^^^the ^^^movie, ^^^Leonardo ^^^DiCaprio ^^^gets ^^^mauled ^^^by ^^^a ^^^bear", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I literally only read the last 3 lines, but that&amp;#39;s a reference to the movie &lt;em&gt;The Revenant.&lt;/em&gt; Stop reading now if you don&amp;#39;t want a spoiler\n.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;In&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;movie,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Leonardo&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;DiCaprio&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;gets&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;mauled&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;by&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;bear&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg8863y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492146366.0, "created_utc": 1492117566.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg84isy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zomaarwat", "parent_id": "t1_dg7z87c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't get it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dg84isy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492142264.0, "created_utc": 1492113464.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7z87c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "9xWCWChampion", "parent_id": "t3_654qhu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry\" the other Andrew nervously squealed as he picked up my books he dropped after running into me.  \n\nAfter picking up my books he continued \"Again, sorry about that.
