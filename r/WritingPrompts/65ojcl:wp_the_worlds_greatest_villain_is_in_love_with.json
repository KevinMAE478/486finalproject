How are you.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said the said sidekick, also known as Miss Ice or just Ice, though she was often (to her very secret bitterness) not really known at all. \u201cHow are you, Thief?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Thief, \u201cI\u2019m, um, great. Fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d Ice replied, and closed her eyes. The ground was cool against her warm palms, and she could hear the sound of water hitting water, quiet and peaceful. She could also hear Thief moving around, but they had been in too many situations like this for Ice to think she would do anything harmful.\n\nReally, Phoenix was so exhausting. *I\u2019m going on a date with my boyfriend but we sure do need to scout this area in this one mountain but don\u2019t worry no one will be there so go check it out Ice please I beg you I haven\u2019t seen him in a week come on don\u2019t be a jerk GO THERE oh my god you\u2019re so stubborn ok I\u2019m sorry please I humbly beg you and no don\u2019t worry about it it\u2019s safe!* \n\nThis was why she was the one that made calculations; he was so prone to making judgments without proper analyzation.\n\n\u201cSo, um, what did you do last week?\u201d Thief asked, and Ice opened an eye to catch her looking at her. She looked away immediately, and Ice felt a strange impatience rise inside of her. She closed her eyes to rid of it, and calmed; and only then did she speak.\n\n\u201cYou will not grasp any of our plans,\u201d Ice said, steady and cold. \u201cI will not divulge any information, no matter how much you ask.\u201d Really, Ice never understood: how could the world\u2019s greatest mastermind be so terrible at interrogation? Her strategy was abysmal.\n\nThief\u2019s face was drawn and panicked, a sign that she had realized that herself yet again. \u201cRight,\u201d Thief said meekly. \u201cUh, sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t guilt-trip me into forgoing our secrets!\u201d Ice snapped, feeling very guilty.\n\n\u201cOh, no, that wasn\u2019t my, um, intention, I-I really, really did not mean to--to imply--I didn\u2019t. Well.\u201d\n\nIce would never understand: she had watched Thief render perfect and eloquent speeches without a single error in front of the watching world, yet every time they ended up together, she spoke like a besotted schoolgirl. It was, Ice hated to admit, a little endearing.\n\nPerhaps her strategy was good. Damn it.\n\n\u201cI just meant like,\u201d Thief murmured, \u201clike, non-work related stuff. Like going to the movies, or getting lunch, or something. I-I\u2019m not trying to say we should do that, haha, haahaha--\u201d and how strange this nervous laugh was, compared to her near-constant cackle during battle, \u201c--b-but like, you know, like, um, non-work-related stuff. You know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not do anything unrelated to work except when Phoenix requests me to,\u201d Ice said, though what that usually meant was Phoenix yelling \u201c*get a life*\u201d or \u201c*you need to go outside*\u201d or \u201c*go take a vacation for the love of god*\u201d or \u201c*let\u2019s get lunch I\u2019m hungry*\u201d. \u201cAnd I see through you, Thief. I will not give you personal information for you to weaponize against me.\u201d\n\n\u201cUmm,\u201d Thief said. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Ice replied.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Thief said, \u201cI, um, think it\u2019s great you always work so hard. That\u2019s really admirable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one that causes me to,\u201d Ice reminded.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Thief said.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Ice replied.\n\n\u201cBut, um, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Thief said, beginning to twiddle her thumbs. Her cheeks were red. Was she cold? She was dressed warmly now, though. Ice did not understand how she could always bear to wear those stupid outfits during her crimes, the ones that showed off her collarbones and stomach and calves (not that Ice was looking, except to gauge strength and weakness), when it could be so cold. They were so impractical. Phoenix had the same kind of problem, though. \u201cI just think it\u2019s great that you put in so much effort. I mean, um, a lot of the work I do deals with you, you know? Once I realized beating Phoenix was actually beating you, everything kind of changed.\u201d\n\nIce willed herself to not be happy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re intergral,\u201d Thief said, \u201cand it\u2019s all because you work so hard. I just, um, think you\u2019re great.\u201d\n\nOh, no.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Ice said, tightly, but this time because she felt like she had no air to breathe. Of course. It was a small space. Her collar was a little too tight this morning.\n\n\u201cI mean it,\u201d Thief said, voice suddenly earnest, and she turned to Ice. For all Ice saw her, the one thing that would startle her over and over again with always be Thief\u2019s eyes, dark and glittering and sharp, and so impossibly beautiful. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Ice said, unsure now where this script was going. \u201cI think we can break this rock if we try really hard. I know you said it was impossible earlier but I\u2019m starting to think it might not be. Do you want to try it. I--\u201d\n\n\u201cIce,\u201d Thief whispered, \u201cCan\u2019t it be me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not join the side of evil!\u201d Ice replied, a little hysterically, to her own frustration.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Thief cried, \u201cI meant--\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not join the side of evil!\u201d\n\n\u201cArghhghhgh,\u201d Thief said, and put her face into her hands. Ice assumed unconsciously a fighting position. After a while, she rose her head. \u201cOkay,\u201d Thief said, \u201cLet\u2019s break the rock.\u201d\n\nThey did.\n\n\u201cHow could you calculate that as being impossible,\u201d Ice said, after they were out. The wind whipped around them furiously, snow landing in the dark nest of Thief\u2019s hair. \u201cSurely, you are aware of your own strength, and surely of mine. I already knew when I said it that it was most likely destructible, but I just believed you would not make an error--\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an error,\u201d Thief said, using that stupid earnest voice again.\n\n\u201cThen what could it be?\u201d Ice asked.\n\nThief\u2019s face was red again. She really was catching a cold. Somewhere deep down, Ice knew that would be a good thing; it would put her out of business for certainty for the next few days. Yet\u2026\n\nIce unwound her scarf and thrust it at Thief, who stared at it blankly.\n\n\u201cTake it,\u201d Ice said.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Thief said, and did. Her face only got redder when she put it on. Was she allergic to the fibers? \u201cThank you,\u201d Thief said, and eradicated that thought. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you cold? Your face is a bit red--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Ice said. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t get cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm,\u201d Thief said, \u201cthen why--oh.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nThief just looked at her for a long time, and this time, Ice looked away. There was the sound of snow crunching, and Thief said, \u201cIce?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d Ice said, still looking to the downside of the mountain, white as the morning sun and just as bright.\n\n\u201cHappy belated birthday,\u201d Thief said, and she felt a weight in her palms.\n\nIce turned to look at it. It was not a bomb as she initially expected, but a snowglobe. *Miss Ice*, read the engraving on the bottom, and within it was her own self, striking and daring and heroic.\n\n\u201cIs there a GPS in this?\u201d Ice asked suspiciously.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll analyze this back at the lab,\u201d Ice said, \u201cbut, in case it comes back negative, then...Thank you, Thief.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Thief said, smiling in a way that definitely did not make Ice's chest twist. \u201cThen, farewell.\u201d\n\n\u201cBye,\u201d Ice replied. When Thief disappeared in a twist of ink and smoke, Ice wondered briefly why Thief hadn\u2019t simply left Ice in the cave, even after failing to extract information from her, but found her eyes to return to the snowglobe, at her small replica, and the thought faded.\n\nReally, it felt a little embarrassing. To see herself made so incredible; it was like looking through an admirer's eyes.\n\n---------\n\n\u201cDid you get a number?\u201d Phoenix asked when she came back to him, his boyfriend sleeping on the couch, his hand scrambling his hair.\n\n\u201cNot specific data, because I didn\u2019t see a need to,\u201d Ice replied. \u201cI ran into Thief, by the way. I\u2019ll never let you send me anywhere without me double-checking your risk calculations again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny number from Thief?\u201d Phoenix tried again.\n\n\u201cI think her bangs are a centimeter shorter,\u201d Ice tried.\n\n\u201cYou noticed that but you don\u2019t notice why,\u201d Phoenix said. At Ice\u2019s confusion, he rolled his eyes. \u201cDid you get, like, a phone number?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? For what reason would I do that? She would never. It\u2019d be a security concern for the both of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he sighed. He ruffled his boyfriend\u2019s hair. \u201cYou hear that, Brett? My sidekick is an honest-to-god idiot.\u201d\n\nIce snorted. \u201cSays the man who has sent me into Thief\u2019s hands over forty times in the past year.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, Brett?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018See, Brett?\u2019!\u201d", "edited": 1492369836.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cUm,\u201d stammered the world\u2019s greatest villain, who had stolen countless precious treasures from extravagant museums and secret caves and sleepy homes, was known as &lt;em&gt;The Thief&lt;/em&gt; in every language from Armenian to Zulu, and who had doggedly avoided the grasp of the superhero Phoenix and his sidekick for the past year. \u201cHow. How are you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFine,\u201d said the said sidekick, also known as Miss Ice or just Ice, though she was often (to her very secret bitterness) not really known at all. \u201cHow are you, Thief?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh,\u201d said Thief, \u201cI\u2019m, um, great. Fine.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWonderful,\u201d Ice replied, and closed her eyes. The ground was cool against her warm palms, and she could hear the sound of water hitting water, quiet and peaceful. She could also hear Thief moving around, but they had been in too many situations like this for Ice to think she would do anything harmful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, Phoenix was so exhausting. &lt;em&gt;I\u2019m going on a date with my boyfriend but we sure do need to scout this area in this one mountain but don\u2019t worry no one will be there so go check it out Ice please I beg you I haven\u2019t seen him in a week come on don\u2019t be a jerk GO THERE oh my god you\u2019re so stubborn ok I\u2019m sorry please I humbly beg you and no don\u2019t worry about it it\u2019s safe!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was why she was the one that made calculations; he was so prone to making judgments without proper analyzation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo, um, what did you do last week?\u201d Thief asked, and Ice opened an eye to catch her looking at her. She looked away immediately, and Ice felt a strange impatience rise inside of her. She closed her eyes to rid of it, and calmed; and only then did she speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou will not grasp any of our plans,\u201d Ice said, steady and cold. \u201cI will not divulge any information, no matter how much you ask.\u201d Really, Ice never understood: how could the world\u2019s greatest mastermind be so terrible at interrogation? Her strategy was abysmal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thief\u2019s face was drawn and panicked, a sign that she had realized that herself yet again. \u201cRight,\u201d Thief said meekly. \u201cUh, sorry.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou won\u2019t guilt-trip me into forgoing our secrets!\u201d Ice snapped, feeling very guilty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, no, that wasn\u2019t my, um, intention, I-I really, really did not mean to--to imply--I didn\u2019t. Well.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ice would never understand: she had watched Thief render perfect and eloquent speeches without a single error in front of the watching world, yet every time they ended up together, she spoke like a besotted schoolgirl. It was, Ice hated to admit, a little endearing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps her strategy was good. Damn it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI just meant like,\u201d Thief murmured, \u201clike, non-work related stuff. Like going to the movies, or getting lunch, or something. I-I\u2019m not trying to say we should do that, haha, haahaha--\u201d and how strange this nervous laugh was, compared to her near-constant cackle during battle, \u201c--b-but like, you know, like, um, non-work-related stuff. You know.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI do not do anything unrelated to work except when Phoenix requests me to,\u201d Ice said, though what that usually meant was Phoenix yelling \u201c&lt;em&gt;get a life&lt;/em&gt;\u201d or \u201c&lt;em&gt;you need to go outside&lt;/em&gt;\u201d or \u201c&lt;em&gt;go take a vacation for the love of god&lt;/em&gt;\u201d or \u201c&lt;em&gt;let\u2019s get lunch I\u2019m hungry&lt;/em&gt;\u201d. \u201cAnd I see through you, Thief. I will not give you personal information for you to weaponize against me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUmm,\u201d Thief said. \u201cRight.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRight,\u201d Ice replied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell,\u201d Thief said, \u201cI, um, think it\u2019s great you always work so hard. That\u2019s really admirable.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re the one that causes me to,\u201d Ice reminded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRight,\u201d Thief said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRight,\u201d Ice replied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut, um, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Thief said, beginning to twiddle her thumbs. Her cheeks were red. Was she cold? She was dressed warmly now, though. Ice did not understand how she could always bear to wear those stupid outfits during her crimes, the ones that showed off her collarbones and stomach and calves (not that Ice was looking, except to gauge strength and weakness), when it could be so cold. They were so impractical. Phoenix had the same kind of problem, though. \u201cI just think it\u2019s great that you put in so much effort. I mean, um, a lot of the work I do deals with you, you know? Once I realized beating Phoenix was actually beating you, everything kind of changed.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ice willed herself to not be happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re intergral,\u201d Thief said, \u201cand it\u2019s all because you work so hard. I just, um, think you\u2019re great.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThanks,\u201d Ice said, tightly, but this time because she felt like she had no air to breathe. Of course. It was a small space. Her collar was a little too tight this morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI mean it,\u201d Thief said, voice suddenly earnest, and she turned to Ice. For all Ice saw her, the one thing that would startle her over and over again with always be Thief\u2019s eyes, dark and glittering and sharp, and so impossibly beautiful. \u201cI do.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRight,\u201d Ice said, unsure now where this script was going. \u201cI think we can break this rock if we try really hard. I know you said it was impossible earlier but I\u2019m starting to think it might not be. Do you want to try it. I--\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIce,\u201d Thief whispered, \u201cCan\u2019t it be me?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI will not join the side of evil!\u201d Ice replied, a little hysterically, to her own frustration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo!\u201d Thief cried, \u201cI meant--\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI will not join the side of evil!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cArghhghhgh,\u201d Thief said, and put her face into her hands. Ice assumed unconsciously a fighting position. After a while, she rose her head. \u201cOkay,\u201d Thief said, \u201cLet\u2019s break the rock.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow could you calculate that as being impossible,\u201d Ice said, after they were out. The wind whipped around them furiously, snow landing in the dark nest of Thief\u2019s hair. \u201cSurely, you are aware of your own strength, and surely of mine. I already knew when I said it that it was most likely destructible, but I just believed you would not make an error--\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an error,\u201d Thief said, using that stupid earnest voice again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThen what could it be?\u201d Ice asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thief\u2019s face was red again. She really was catching a cold. Somewhere deep down, Ice knew that would be a good thing; it would put her out of business for certainty for the next few days. Yet\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ice unwound her scarf and thrust it at Thief, who stared at it blankly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTake it,\u201d Ice said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh,\u201d Thief said, and did. Her face only got redder when she put it on. Was she allergic to the fibers? \u201cThank you,\u201d Thief said, and eradicated that thought. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you cold? Your face is a bit red--\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat,\u201d Ice said. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t get cold.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUm,\u201d Thief said, \u201cthen why--oh.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thief just looked at her for a long time, and this time, Ice looked away. There was the sound of snow crunching, and Thief said, \u201cIce?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYes?\u201d Ice said, still looking to the downside of the mountain, white as the morning sun and just as bright.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHappy belated birthday,\u201d Thief said, and she felt a weight in her palms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ice turned to look at it. It was not a bomb as she initially expected, but a snowglobe. &lt;em&gt;Miss Ice&lt;/em&gt;, read the engraving on the bottom, and within it was her own self, striking and daring and heroic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIs there a GPS in this?\u201d Ice asked suspiciously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ll analyze this back at the lab,\u201d Ice said, \u201cbut, in case it comes back negative, then...Thank you, Thief.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOf course,\u201d Thief said, smiling in a way that definitely did not make Ice&amp;#39;s chest twist. \u201cThen, farewell.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBye,\u201d Ice replied. When Thief disappeared in a twist of ink and smoke, Ice wondered briefly why Thief hadn\u2019t simply left Ice in the cave, even after failing to extract information from her, but found her eyes to return to the snowglobe, at her small replica, and the thought faded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, it felt a little embarrassing. To see herself made so incredible; it was like looking through an admirer&amp;#39;s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDid you get a number?\u201d Phoenix asked when she came back to him, his boyfriend sleeping on the couch, his hand scrambling his hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot specific data, because I didn\u2019t see a need to,\u201d Ice replied. \u201cI ran into Thief, by the way. I\u2019ll never let you send me anywhere without me double-checking your risk calculations again.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAny number from Thief?\u201d Phoenix tried again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI think her bangs are a centimeter shorter,\u201d Ice tried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou noticed that but you don\u2019t notice why,\u201d Phoenix said. At Ice\u2019s confusion, he rolled his eyes. \u201cDid you get, like, a phone number?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat? For what reason would I do that? She would never. It\u2019d be a security concern for the both of us.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he sighed. He ruffled his boyfriend\u2019s hair. \u201cYou hear that, Brett? My sidekick is an honest-to-god idiot.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ice snorted. \u201cSays the man who has sent me into Thief\u2019s hands over forty times in the past year.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSee, Brett?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018See, Brett?\u2019!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgcegay", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492397363.0, "created_utc": 1492368563.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 201}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ojcl", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ojcl", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ojcl", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ojcl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdom0r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bombastedd", "parent_id": "t1_dgdnb6o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hell of a honeymoon...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hell of a honeymoon...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgdom0r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492474240.0, "created_utc": 1492445440.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdnb6o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "H3imdallr", "parent_id": "t1_dgcghgx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Duke sat nervously at the table, it didn't show externally but it was clear enough for the empath in the room.

He was slightly taller, wearing the bottom half of Eagle&amp;#39;s suit a T-shirt and a hastily put together mask consisting of a strip of cloth over his eyes with rough eyeholes holes and a scarf over the lower face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey&amp;quot; shouted what was unmistakably eagles voice, especially since Lady Malerebus&amp;#39; mouth visibly didn&amp;#39;t move. &amp;quot;I forgot to tell you that the... er... former villain Lady Malerebus... surrendered herself to my... erm, custody last week and we&amp;#39;ve been... negotiating as to her future plans regarding...&amp;quot; Eagle looked unsurely from the collected heroes to the former super villain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Regarding my reintroduction to society and future as a law abiding citizen.&amp;quot; Malerebus finished and took a step back so she was leaning against Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a pregnant pause while the collected heroes took in what they had just heard. It was broken by Mrs. Ultra &amp;quot;Fuck this&amp;quot; she grabbed her husband Mr. Ultra, equipped with super strength, and flew up and away from the island. Most of the other heroes seemed to agree with the statement and relaxed, realising there was no fight to be had here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How are we getting home?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;I was expecting something a bit more interesting really.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Can I borrow someone&amp;#39;s phone, I want to tell my mum I&amp;#39;ll be back for tea.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Is there a restaurant on the island?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the ensuing hubbub Eagle subtly pulled Malerebus back into the hut. It went unnoticed for about five minutes until the thunders started rumbling ominously. The heroes looked up at the heavy rain clouds, it looked like a wet one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgdnb6o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492472752.0, "created_utc": 1492443952.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcghgx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Yoshimods", "parent_id": "t1_dgcetr2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm going to need a continuation of this please.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to need a continuation of this please.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgcghgx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492400048.0, "created_utc": 1492371248.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ojcl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcuz6r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kagemoto", "parent_id": "t1_dgcetr2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Haha!\nDuke seems like a stoic guy but he's a bit of a tricksy bastard ain't he?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haha!\nDuke seems like a stoic guy but he&amp;#39;s a bit of a tricksy bastard ain&amp;#39;t he?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgcuz6r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492419357.0, "created_utc": 1492390557.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ojcl", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ojcl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdnebq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "H3imdallr", "parent_id": "t1_dgdghuh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well you don't get to see the date, just a little aftermath.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well you don&amp;#39;t get to see the date, just a little aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgdnebq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492472855.0, "created_utc": 1492444055.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdghuh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bombastedd", "parent_id": "t1_dgcetr2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would love to see that date!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would love to see that date!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgdghuh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492463559.0, "created_utc": 1492434759.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcetr2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 58, "report_reasons": null, "author": "H3imdallr", "parent_id": "t3_65ojcl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Lady Malerebus whipped up a storm around her and relished the feeling of fist sized raindrops splashing against her black caped shoulders.

He was dressed in a simple grey Kevlar wetsuit with his face uncovered. He was closely followed by his sidekick Eagle, in a similar gold and black dappled suit. Duke was almost oblivious to the water, his nine ft frame and almost unlimited strength and stamina meant very little could stop him. He was notable among heroes in that he had never lost a fight.

There was no point being subtle, she had grounded Eagle with the rain but knew there was nowhere in the city that he couldn't find her, not that she had a particular problem with being found.\n\nNow only 20 meters away Duke and Eagle stopped, or Duke stopped and Eagle started to sink before he floated up next to The giant so their heads were both at the same level. \n\n\"Lady Malerebus, I never would have guessed\" his vocal cords didn't have the agility to put on a sarcastic tone but his demeanour was clear enough. \n\n\"My my, Eagle, you do look very dashing there, floating next to your Duke. I almost want to take up falconry.\"\n\nEagle blushed at the compliment but was glad that it didn't show much through the pelting water. Having a crush on a villain was not the kind of thing you wanted known about widely. For a civilian it might be frowned upon, even if it were widely accepted that Malerebus' skin tight black costume showed a magnificent form, but for a cape like him it would be scandalous. Every engagement,past or future, would be overshadowed by the idea that he might have let her win. Maybe she had got inside his head, maybe he was a mole sabotaging the hero's plots. That would be a particularly bad rumour because there were a few occasions now when Duke and Eagle had gone toe to toe with Malerebus and she had escaped by the skin of her teeth. Not this time though, this time was for good. \n\n\"So as we planned?\" Eagle asked. Duke nodded \"As we discussed previously.\" Duke lifted an arm and pushed Eagle forward with similar force to a small car at 50mph. Eagle shot forwards and grappled straight into Malerebus. Eagle held on with one hand while snapping a set of cuffs around her wrist and his, while she was powerful she was vulnerable in close quarters like this. Her powers could level a city but would break her in the process if she tried anything.\n\nEagle smiled victoriously, he'd captured her! They had caught her off guard and Malerebus' reign of terror was over. Then he saw her face; she smiled sweetly at him, then she smiled slyly at him and then he realised he had made a mistake.\n\nStorm winds whipped them up and away, he could fly, but so could she. Significantly, he couldn't fly agains the winds that she could create. It was about thirty seconds after he had been taken hostage that he realised that he had been taken hostage. As part of his own plan.\n\n---------------\n\nDuke watched the storm race away towards the horizon, 'As we discussed previously'. He hadn't told Eagle that he was speaking to Malerebus. This had been her last heist. He was aware that she had a crush on Eagle and that Eagle had a crush on her. The deal was that he would arrange a 'date' and that if Eagle impressed then she would change to the Hero side. On parole of course but she would be an invaluable tool for prevention of natural disasters. If it didn't work out then Duke knew Eagle would find a way to escape, he was after all very good at finding things.\n\n[part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/65ojcl/comment/dgdnb6o?st=J1MAM01H&amp;sh=62d16a1d)", "edited": 1492444025.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Malerebus whipped up a storm around her and relished the feeling of fist sized raindrops splashing against her black caped shoulders.

I held up the newest addition to my ever increasing wardrobe of terrible outfits. This one was basically just a three piece suit with holes for my wings. What was even the point? This was basically regular clothing. My sister, being the \u2018hero\u2019 of our arrangement, was the only one with access to the League\u2019s Costume Creator. Since I was only the sidekick, I had to deal with whatever she thought was good.\n\nI finished filling up her car, a tricked out automobile just as flashy as my new costume. She hadn\u2019t decided if she was going to call it the Dragon-Mobile or the Diva-Mobile, but either way as the sidekick I was stuck taking care of it.\n\nAs soon as I hung the gas nozzle back on the wall of the cave, the alarm rang. It wasn\u2019t the global alarm installed by the league, but the one that was activated from upstairs, which meant that the mighty Dragon Diva just wanted to make a cool entrance.\n\n\u201cNo time to waste, Wingman!\u201d She commanded as she flew down the stairs. Our similar genes meant that her powers gave her wings, same as mine. However, where mine were feathery, white and beautiful, and could sometimes be shot out as razor sharp projectiles if I was in the mood, hers were large, red and leathery. She also had fire breath, for some reason. Couldn\u2019t figure that one out.\n\nShe jumped in the car and motioned for me to do the same. Damn, her new costume was cool. I hurriedly dressed in my own boring outfit and climbed into the passenger seat. \n\n\u201cMastermind is attacking the city!\u201d she yelled as we sped out of the mouth of the hideout. Mastermind was an S-Level villain, a real threat. Normally she\u2019d have been conducting her villainy in New York or L.A., where all the really powerful villains are, but for some reason ever since she crossed paths with my sister and I last month she\u2019d stuck around Chicago. \n\n\u201cThat explains why you\u2019re bringing me this time,\u201d I realized. Dragon Diva was the most well known and popular hero in Chicago. Probably the most powerful, too, but she wasn\u2019t prepared to take on what could be the greatest villain in the world alone.\n\n\u201cIt does indeed,\u201d she teased. She said it in the same tone that she\u2019d used when I had a crush on Claire Stevens in fourth grade.\n\n\u201cI never should have told you that I thought she looked hot last month,\u201d I said, annoyed. \u201cShe\u2019s a villain, and we have to stop her. I was merely observing that her looks may be one of the reasons she\u2019s able to convince so many minions to follow her.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuuuureee,\u201d my sister replied before flinging one such minion off the hood of our care with a quick puff of flame.\n\n\u201cHey, sis?\u201d I asked as we drove deeper into the horde of minions piling out from Mastermind\u2019s flying ship. \u201cWhy do we need the Diva-Mobile if we can already fly?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe **DRAGON**-Mobile has two reasons for its existence,\u201d she answered. \u201cNumber one, because it\u2019s awesome.\u201d She dragged out the last word as she powerslid the vehicle to a stop, directly below the floating fortress. \u201cSecondly, because it has an ejector seat.\u201d She hit the red button on the console before I had time to unstrap myself, sending myself and the seat flying straight upwards. \n\nI flew right up into the mouth of Mastermind\u2019s space ship, getting caught by the tractor beam and deposited directly into the brig. She was already there, leaning against the bars of my new cage. She wore her usual outfit for these kind of affairs, a long black dress that mirrored the color of her hair. It accentuated her curves wonderfully. Mastermind was never one for costumes.\n\n\u201cDid Diva just eject you directly into the fortress?\u201d She asked incredulously. \n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWings were caught in the seat, so you couldn\u2019t change course?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is like the third time she\u2019s deposited you directly into my clutches this week, then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I was prepared this time,\u201d she said with confidence, motioning to the corner of my cell. She had apparently set up dinner. Mastermind pressed a button on a device in her console and phased through the bars of my cage. She took a seat at the table, and waited for me to do the same.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not going to eat anything you serve me,\u201d I declared. I did sit down, though. Not because I wanted to or anything. After all, she had already shut down my powers with this cage. She could pretty much make me do whatever she wanted. \u201cIt could be poisoned.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh...I just thought\u2026\u201d she started before pausing. She almost looked hurt, but that was probably just my imagination. \u201cIf I wanted to kill you, I would have done it already,\u201d she said with a return of her usual confidence.\n\n\u201cFair point,\u201d I admitted, cautiously taking a bite of the pasta before me. \u201cWow, this is incredible!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really like it?!\u201d she asked, her eyes lighting up.\n\n\u201cYeah, you should really give a raise to whichever minion does the cooking.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I, uh. I made it myself,\u201d she said with trepidation. She swirled her fork and looked down at her own dish.\n\n\u201cOh, that, that must have taken a while,\u201d I mused. I couldn\u2019t cook for the life of me, but based off the taste alone I assumed she must have worked hard at it. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have to, like, plan out this attack and everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just kind of told them to go wild,\u201d she admitted.\n\n\u201cSo there isn\u2019t even a reason for this attack?\u201d I exclaimed. The nerve of this villain, attacking the city without even a reason. \n\n\u201cI mean, there was kind of a reason,\u201d Mastermind explained, still looking down at her pasta. \u201cSee, I accidentally ran into Diva yesterday. I wasn\u2019t prepared, so she took me out in no time. But she didn\u2019t take me to jail. In fact she just let me go. She told me to attack the city today, and that she had a gift for me.\u201d\n\nI looked down at my new costume, realizing what my sister had been up to. I was Wingman, Chicago\u2019s best sidekick, but I had to admit that my hero had her wingman moments as well.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This had to be the worst hero costume in the world. I held up the newest addition to my ever increasing wardrobe of terrible outfits. This one was basically just a three piece suit with holes for my wings. What was even the point? This was basically regular clothing. My sister, being the \u2018hero\u2019 of our arrangement, was the only one with access to the League\u2019s Costume Creator. Since I was only the sidekick, I had to deal with whatever she thought was good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finished filling up her car, a tricked out automobile just as flashy as my new costume. She hadn\u2019t decided if she was going to call it the Dragon-Mobile or the Diva-Mobile, but either way as the sidekick I was stuck taking care of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as I hung the gas nozzle back on the wall of the cave, the alarm rang. It wasn\u2019t the global alarm installed by the league, but the one that was activated from upstairs, which meant that the mighty Dragon Diva just wanted to make a cool entrance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo time to waste, Wingman!\u201d She commanded as she flew down the stairs. Our similar genes meant that her powers gave her wings, same as mine. However, where mine were feathery, white and beautiful, and could sometimes be shot out as razor sharp projectiles if I was in the mood, hers were large, red and leathery. She also had fire breath, for some reason. Couldn\u2019t figure that one out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She jumped in the car and motioned for me to do the same. Damn, her new costume was cool. I hurriedly dressed in my own boring outfit and climbed into the passenger seat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMastermind is attacking the city!\u201d she yelled as we sped out of the mouth of the hideout. Mastermind was an S-Level villain, a real threat. Normally she\u2019d have been conducting her villainy in New York or L.A., where all the really powerful villains are, but for some reason ever since she crossed paths with my sister and I last month she\u2019d stuck around Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat explains why you\u2019re bringing me this time,\u201d I realized. Dragon Diva was the most well known and popular hero in Chicago. Probably the most powerful, too, but she wasn\u2019t prepared to take on what could be the greatest villain in the world alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt does indeed,\u201d she teased. She said it in the same tone that she\u2019d used when I had a crush on Claire Stevens in fourth grade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI never should have told you that I thought she looked hot last month,\u201d I said, annoyed. \u201cShe\u2019s a villain, and we have to stop her.

A single wooden chair sat center of the room, often crusted with red flakes and strips of fabric, stood above the drain as it often did before the beatings ensued. At times it would end up lying on its side, trembling at the brute force applied to the hostage it would house. Gruesome sounds came from this room: the heart wrenching crack of a severed leg. The deafening gurgle of a severed neck. The chilling silence of a job well done was even audible somehow. \n\n\nThis wasn't the first time a sidekick of a famous hero was dragged away from their home or place of work to be held hostage for information. And here another was sat down with wrists tied behind her back, a sack over her head, and a hot lamp shining down on her. The tall boots that reached up her legs had been removed, showing only swollen and bruised toes on the filthy floor. \n\nA uniform of breathable spandex was torn, ripped, burned, almost to the point of no recognition. But the vibrant blue stripes down her arms and hips with the dark fabric base were the signature colors of The Willow. Unfortunately, The Willow was out scouting the city and signing autographs for excitable young women while activists protested his less than heroic methods. He ignored their chants on him being an executioner and brainwasher.\n\nThis was The Wisp, T.W. for short, The Willow's sidekick. \n\n\"The boss will be here soon.\" Her head lifted at the sound of one of her captors. \"I suggest you mind your manners.\" \n\nT.W.'s swears and curses were muffled by the gag stuffed in her mouth. Perhaps it was a good thing. She listened to her captor laugh and step across a mushy substance on the floor, pacing back and forth behind her. \"The Willow will be getting a call soon about this and will come to rescue you, again. I mean, if he cares about you, that is.\" \n\n*I'm dead. This is it. I'm dead and no one is going to care. I've been kidnapped five times and this is the furthest it's gone. Willow stopped caring about me two kidnappings ago.* T.W. accepted her fate and hung her head low. Being a sidekick to a pompous, borderline antihero meant two things. One: no one took her as a serious help to society due to being aligned with a murdering sociopath. And two: she was a menace to society thanks to her powers and no police or FBI or SWAT were going to negotiate with criminals for her rescue. \n\n*I should have worked with Symphony. Or, I guess, maybe The Winged Man. He's kind of lame at times but at least he's a hero.* The more she thought about it, the worse it began to sound. \n\nThankfully, a heavy door grinding against the floor made the thoughts stop for a moment. *Another brute here to do the dirty work? I really want to have an open casket, so, maybe if I beg to not be hit in the face anymore. Begging helps. Sidekicks beg all the time!*\n\n\"What d-did you do to her?\" The voice was familiar, a little quiet, very pained, all misleading when knowing the acts behind the voice. \"She looks so b-broken.\"  \n\n\"Sorry, Boss. I didn't expect her to fight so much.\"\n\n\"D-Did you have t-t-to put her here?\"\n\n\"Protocol, Boss. You told us no exceptions after the last hostage... You said so.\" There was fear there. An emotion T.W. knew best. But it wasn't her handy work this time. She backed further into her chair, pushing it across the floor, before rocking her head back to try and shake off the sack on her head.\n\n\"She's sh-sh-shaking. You hurt her. I d-don't like that.\" \n\n\"I'm sorry, Boss. I've only been working here a few days I didn't know. It won't happen again.\" T.W. could only listen to the sound of the tiled wall behind her become crushed at the force of her captor being thrown against it. There was an agonizing groan, like a note stuck on a piano, that droned on and on and on. Until, suddenly, it was gone.\n\n\"I'm s-sorry.\" T.W. flinched and jerked back, but a pair of cold hands removed the sack from her head and pulled out her gag, exposing the super villain of her territory frowning before her. \"Oh... he h-hurt you. So bad. Your makeup... B-But it's okay! I still think you're beautiful...\" The stuttering villain was one who rarely spoke, often masked by the white featureless face he wore in the city. \n\nHe grinned with a scarred face, exposing deep cuts over his cheeks and eyelids. He appeared to be the survivor of a vicious attack from a long nailed scorned woman. T.W. stared back, finally able to see and embrace the powers restricted from her before.\n\n\"I will not hesitate to fight you, Bone. I may have lost to you in the past but this time I won't hold back. I'm done feeling sorry for you so don't\u2014\"\n\n\"Please, d-d-don't be so mean to me.\" *Please? You must be joking! You've crossed the line bringing me here!* T.W. focused her attention onto his face, bringing forth the hands of the dead at her side to drag his soul to Hell where it belonged. But the translucent hands wouldn't dare touch or move from her sides. \n\nBone only watched with a sympathetic smile on his disfigured face. \"It's kind of f-funny, right? No one wants to t-t-touch me. Not even the d-d-dead.\"\n\n\"Well, even those damned in Hell have their limits.\" T.W. released her grip on the souls under her possession, wielding them back to the pits below to wait to be used again. \"So, you aren't going to kill me?\"\n\n\"N-Not unless you w-w-want me to. But even th-then I will protest.\" She sat, still bound to her chair, watching on as he stood there with his hands behind his back. Somehow he managed to stay clean in such a filthy room. His white cloak, never stained from blood or soot, was always so pristine and inviting to the blind people who followed his every command. Most people called him a god. Others a demon. \n\nT.W. however could only see the blood of his victims stained on his putrid soul. *He's hideous on the inside and the out.*\n\n\"Then you're just after The Willow?\" T.W. chuckled a bit, \"You should have kidnapped his cat, or maybe held his lawyer hostage. He'd have come running.\" \n\n\"I'm not after t-t-that.\" Bone rose a hand and exposed the bleached texture of his skeleton and the patches of skin that remained attached. The binds holding her back were broken, and she shot to her feet. \n\n\"Then you want money? Publicity? To show you could? What?! We've done this multiple times now and I don't know what you want!\" She took a brief look behind her and gagged at the sight of the managed and twisted brute buried under the debris of the room. \n\n\"I just want you t-t-to be comfortable, Wisp. I'm sorry you were brought here... it's... dirty.\"  \n\n\"What do you mean comfortable?\"\n\n\"You seem t-t-tense. Maybe you're angry... I know how it f-f-feels when someone you trust abandons you. Leaves you t-t-to die.\" T.W. watched him fish into the seam of his cloak and place the mask over his face. No eyeholes, no mouth, no nose, just a white face shaped mask that somehow corrected his stutter. \"I can't let you leave. I love you too much to let you go this time. I'd die if you left me just to go back being abused by him.\" \n\n\"You can't hold, me hostage! I won't allow it!\"\n\n\"I only want you to be happy, with me.\" He took a few steps forward, cornering her. \"Whatever you want, I can provide for you. You know I can. So tell me,\" she took a step back but paused as he crouched down to take a knee before her, \"what can I do for you to make you happy?\"\n\n\"Me? Uh,\" *let me go!* But then a selfish whisper tickled the inside of her ear. *Go back to Willow... am I crazy? He never says I'm beautiful...* \"Am I allowed to leave?\"\n\n\"Only if you promise to come back. Or call me if you will be home late. I don't want dinner to be cold.\"\n\n\"Can I have a puppy?\"\n\n\"I love puppies.\"\n\n\"Um... Can I have my own uniform?\"\n\n\"Wisp when you're with me, you don't need a uniform.\"\n\n---\n\n\"So I tell the guy, 'Hey! If all you want is a quick fling with my sidekick to calm you down every now and then, then I can get you that.' So, that's when I started to throw my sidekick to this hungry wolf, Bone.\" The Willow laughed with another shot being refilled at the bar. The women at his arms giggled and laughed, being charged by the hour to escort him around town.\n\n\"Now, Wisp is a sweet girl. I mean, we dated for like a hot minute but it wasn't too serious.

A single wooden chair sat center of the room, often crusted with red flakes and strips of fabric, stood above the drain as it often did before the beatings ensued. At times it would end up lying on its side, trembling at the brute force applied to the hostage it would house. Gruesome sounds came from this room: the heart wrenching crack of a severed leg. The deafening gurgle of a severed neck. The chilling silence of a job well done was even audible somehow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This wasn&amp;#39;t the first time a sidekick of a famous hero was dragged away from their home or place of work to be held hostage for information. And here another was sat down with wrists tied behind her back, a sack over her head, and a hot lamp shining down on her. The tall boots that reached up her legs had been removed, showing only swollen and bruised toes on the filthy floor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A uniform of breathable spandex was torn, ripped, burned, almost to the point of no recognition. But the vibrant blue stripes down her arms and hips with the dark fabric base were the signature colors of The Willow. Unfortunately, The Willow was out scouting the city and signing autographs for excitable young women while activists protested his less than heroic methods. He ignored their chants on him being an executioner and brainwasher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was The Wisp, T.W. for short, The Willow&amp;#39;s sidekick. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The boss will be here soon.&amp;quot; Her head lifted at the sound of one of her captors. &amp;quot;I suggest you mind your manners.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T.W.&amp;#39;s swears and curses were muffled by the gag stuffed in her mouth. Perhaps it was a good thing. She listened to her captor laugh and step across a mushy substance on the floor, pacing back and forth behind her. &amp;quot;The Willow will be getting a call soon about this and will come to rescue you, again. I mean, if he cares about you, that is.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m dead. This is it. I&amp;#39;m dead and no one is going to care. I&amp;#39;ve been kidnapped five times and this is the furthest it&amp;#39;s gone. Willow stopped caring about me two kidnappings ago.&lt;/em&gt; T.W. accepted her fate and hung her head low. Being a sidekick to a pompous, borderline antihero meant two things. One: no one took her as a serious help to society due to being aligned with a murdering sociopath. And two: she was a menace to society thanks to her powers and no police or FBI or SWAT were going to negotiate with criminals for her rescue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I should have worked with Symphony. Or, I guess, maybe The Winged Man. He&amp;#39;s kind of lame at times but at least he&amp;#39;s a hero.&lt;/em&gt; The more she thought about it, the worse it began to sound. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, a heavy door grinding against the floor made the thoughts stop for a moment. &lt;em&gt;Another brute here to do the dirty work? I really want to have an open casket, so, maybe if I beg to not be hit in the face anymore. Begging helps. Sidekicks beg all the time!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What d-did you do to her?&amp;quot; The voice was familiar, a little quiet, very pained, all misleading when knowing the acts behind the voice. &amp;quot;She looks so b-broken.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry, Boss. I didn&amp;#39;t expect her to fight so much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;D-Did you have t-t-to put her here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Protocol, Boss. You told us no exceptions after the last hostage... You said so.&amp;quot; There was fear there. An emotion T.W. knew best. But it wasn&amp;#39;t her handy work this time. She backed further into her chair, pushing it across the floor, before rocking her head back to try and shake off the sack on her head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s sh-sh-shaking. You hurt her. I d-don&amp;#39;t like that.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, Boss. I&amp;#39;ve only been working here a few days I didn&amp;#39;t know. It won&amp;#39;t happen again.&amp;quot; T.W. could only listen to the sound of the tiled wall behind her become crushed at the force of her captor being thrown against it. There was an agonizing groan, like a note stuck on a piano, that droned on and on and on. Until, suddenly, it was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m s-sorry.&amp;quot; T.W. flinched and jerked back, but a pair of cold hands removed the sack from her head and pulled out her gag, exposing the super villain of her territory frowning before her. &amp;quot;Oh... he h-hurt you. So bad. Your makeup... B-But it&amp;#39;s okay! I still think you&amp;#39;re beautiful...&amp;quot; The stuttering villain was one who rarely spoke, often masked by the white featureless face he wore in the city. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He grinned with a scarred face, exposing deep cuts over his cheeks and eyelids. He appeared to be the survivor of a vicious attack from a long nailed scorned woman. T.W. stared back, finally able to see and embrace the powers restricted from her before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will not hesitate to fight you, Bone. I may have lost to you in the past but this time I won&amp;#39;t hold back. I&amp;#39;m done feeling sorry for you so don&amp;#39;t\u2014&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please, d-d-don&amp;#39;t be so mean to me.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Please? You must be joking! You&amp;#39;ve crossed the line bringing me here!&lt;/em&gt; T.W. focused her attention onto his face, bringing forth the hands of the dead at her side to drag his soul to Hell where it belonged. But the translucent hands wouldn&amp;#39;t dare touch or move from her sides. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bone only watched with a sympathetic smile on his disfigured face. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s kind of f-funny, right? No one wants to t-t-touch me. Not even the d-d-dead.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, even those damned in Hell have their limits.&amp;quot; T.W. released her grip on the souls under her possession, wielding them back to the pits below to wait to be used again. &amp;quot;So, you aren&amp;#39;t going to kill me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;N-Not unless you w-w-want me to. But even th-then I will protest.&amp;quot; She sat, still bound to her chair, watching on as he stood there with his hands behind his back. Somehow he managed to stay clean in such a filthy room. His white cloak, never stained from blood or soot, was always so pristine and inviting to the blind people who followed his every command. Most people called him a god. Others a demon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T.W. however could only see the blood of his victims stained on his putrid soul. &lt;em&gt;He&amp;#39;s hideous on the inside and the out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then you&amp;#39;re just after The Willow?&amp;quot; T.W. chuckled a bit, &amp;quot;You should have kidnapped his cat, or maybe held his lawyer hostage. He&amp;#39;d have come running.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not after t-t-that.&amp;quot; Bone rose a hand and exposed the bleached texture of his skeleton and the patches of skin that remained attached. The binds holding her back were broken, and she shot to her feet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then you want money? Publicity? To show you could? What?! We&amp;#39;ve done this multiple times now and I don&amp;#39;t know what you want!&amp;quot; She took a brief look behind her and gagged at the sight of the managed and twisted brute buried under the debris of the room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I just want you t-t-to be comfortable, Wisp. I&amp;#39;m sorry you were brought here... it&amp;#39;s... dirty.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you mean comfortable?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You seem t-t-tense. Maybe you&amp;#39;re angry... I know how it f-f-feels when someone you trust abandons you. Leaves you t-t-to die.&amp;quot; T.W. watched him fish into the seam of his cloak and place the mask over his face. No eyeholes, no mouth, no nose, just a white face shaped mask that somehow corrected his stutter. &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t let you leave. I love you too much to let you go this time. I&amp;#39;d die if you left me just to go back being abused by him.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t hold, me hostage! I won&amp;#39;t allow it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I only want you to be happy, with me.&amp;quot; He took a few steps forward, cornering her. &amp;quot;Whatever you want, I can provide for you. You know I can. So tell me,&amp;quot; she took a step back but paused as he crouched down to take a knee before her, &amp;quot;what can I do for you to make you happy?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Me? Uh,&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;let me go!&lt;/em&gt; But then a selfish whisper tickled the inside of her ear. &lt;em&gt;Go back to Willow... am I crazy? He never says I&amp;#39;m beautiful...&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Am I allowed to leave?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Only if you promise to come back. Or call me if you will be home late. I don&amp;#39;t want dinner to be cold.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can I have a puppy?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I love puppies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Um... Can I have my own uniform?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wisp when you&amp;#39;re with me, you don&amp;#39;t need a uniform.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So I tell the guy, &amp;#39;Hey! If all you want is a quick fling with my sidekick to calm you down every now and then, then I can get you that.&amp;#39; So, that&amp;#39;s when I started to throw my sidekick to this hungry wolf, Bone.&amp;quot; The Willow laughed with another shot being refilled at the bar. The women at his arms giggled and laughed, being charged by the hour to escort him around town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, Wisp is a sweet girl. I mean, we dated for like a hot minute but it wasn&amp;#39;t too serious. She got too emotional though, talked about marriage and having super babies! Then dumped me when I was, like, &amp;#39;Listen I&amp;#39;m just trying to have fun and tap that not, like, commit.&amp;#39; And then she dumps me! I mean, who would dump me?&amp;quot; The girls giggled and laughed, affirming his words without ever hearing them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All these kidnappings I set up for this creep just so she&amp;#39;d get all scared and come crawling back to me. Turns out, the dude is like &amp;#39;Hey I l-l-like her and you shouldn&amp;#39;t t-t-treat her that way.&amp;#39; So I said &amp;#39;Fine. You take her when I&amp;#39;m busy around town, she ain&amp;#39;t my problem.&amp;#39; Guy&amp;#39;s a little slow or something\u2014but I ain&amp;#39;t complaining. He took her off my hands, ya know? By time he&amp;#39;s done this time though, she&amp;#39;ll be begging to come back to me.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He let out a hiccup, and a forced smile. &amp;quot;Just you wait.
