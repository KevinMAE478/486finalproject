Dammit, I feel like I made a bad first impression.  \"Uh, are you mad?\" The booming voice stayed silent still, and I stared back into the light. \"I uh, want revenge.\"\n\n\"OF COURSE YOU DO!\" The booming voice returned. Whew. I'm not saying I'm not bummed about it, it is a bummer to bend over and die, but I just expected the afterlife to either be nothing or at least not this.  \"You will be sent back to earth in the form of small animals to enact your revenge.\" WHY!?\n\n\n\"G-Great, t-thank you for this opportunity.\"  I don't want to upset anyone.\n\n\"Go forth!\" The voice boomed and the light grew brighter and brighter til it was all I could see.

I scurried up the tree and hid overlooking her house. I may have a body now, but revenge won't come easy, I'll have to stake out the place to find an opportunity.\n\nI staked out her house day in and day out, mimicing what I think chipmunks eat and getting various forms of stomach discomfort as I guess wrong. There!  The opportunity I've been waiting s-some form of time for, I'm still not sure how much time has passed, arose.

I don&amp;#39;t know why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stumbles out of the crumpled black Ferrari, cans bouncing across pavement as she falls to her knees. I know her - she dated Ross. She lives in a too-nice house with too-nice parents, and greets everyone with that too-nice smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My death is interrupted by a sound that takes too long to recognize. She&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;laughing&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;m dying, and she&amp;#39;s alive, and she&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;laughing&lt;/em&gt;. Suddenly I don&amp;#39;t care about pain or fear or dying. There is only hate. Hate follows me to darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dream of blood, and then of forests. Night becomes day becomes night. Time ceases to have meaning until one day I suddenly awaken. An awkward scream bleats out of me as I recover from the terror of death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How long was I asleep? No. Not asleep. How long was I &lt;em&gt;alive?&lt;/em&gt; I stumble forward on hoofed feet until the connection hits me. I find my footing and begin to walk - the land is familiar. These hills are mine, and I am theirs. But I was not like this. I find a stream and see my reflection, proud horns a heavy crown on my head. I am Deer, Prince of the Forest. I have known this all my life - this life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I remember the stream from another life. I remember cold water on hairless skin. I remember the clatter of cans, shared in secret. I remember the clatter of cans on pavement. I remember her laugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember where she lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walk, and eat, and wait for night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find the neighborhood. It is still too nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The morning mist makes me shiver, but I am undaunted. A jogger passes me and stops to take a picture. I ignore him. He is not her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find the house. There is a red Ferrari. It is too early - so I lay down and wait. Another jogger passes. I stare until he leaves. I rest my head and feel the cool grass on my chin. There is no peace here - only patient fury.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hear an engine, and I jump awake. My eyes flit frantically - I find the red Ferrari. The hood is down. She is driving towards me. She hasn&amp;#39;t noticed - the mist conceals me. I break into a galloping run. I leap, horns forward, vaulting through the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am Deer, Prince of the Forest. But I was once something more. Something was stolen from me - a life more rich, more potent than this one. I cannot begin to remember it all. But I remember her laugh. She will remember me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "WritingPrompts", "name": "t1_dgd9ehv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492444176.0, "created_utc": 1492415376.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3nb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ry7x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdd0e6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "alice_op", "parent_id": "t3_65ry7x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Bring me back to life, I thought.
