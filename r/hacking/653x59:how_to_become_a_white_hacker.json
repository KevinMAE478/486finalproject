But understand it's more or less the InfoSec equivalent of the Bar Exam, it's one of the most difficult exams in IT.\n- Figure out what you want to do. \"Hacking\" doesn't narrow it down much, that's akin to saying you want to work with cars. Most people think of Red Teams when they think of white hat work. but there's also Blue Team work, Info Analysts, there's a lot of positions that use some form of hacking. Do research, figure out what sounds good to you.\n- Master Kali Linux. There are tons of tutorials online that will help with other essential tools as well, like nmap, Metasploit, and Wireshark.\n- Learn Python. If you want to be a pentester worth your salt, Python is a good starting language to learn the fundamentals of coding. SQL wouldn't hurt either. Websites like w3schools.com can give you a *basic* understanding of these languages. \n- Set up a Virtualbox Lab. Sweet merciful heavens I cannot emphasize this enough, because trying to mess around with stuff in an apartment complex or neighborhood is an astoundingly fast way to get in very serious legal trouble. You can set up images for Windows, Linux-based OS's, and more to play around with and figure out common exploits.\n- College is quickly becoming a better way to get into pentesting. If you're into the whole college thing, look into local college programs, and see if any of them have a Cybersecurity program. WGU, for example, has a Bachelors and Masters in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance that come with a ton of certifications within the program for absolutely free, it's definitely worth investigating.\n- Internships. Several companies are starting to pick up internships for Information Security Analysts and other \"entry level\" positions. But make no mistake, these positions require a lot of knowledge about computers that most entry level positions couldn't ever justify asking for.\n- Study, practice, study, and practice. Hacking and InfoSec requires a fundamental knowledge of nearly every facet of computer science and information technology, and the more knowledge you have, the better. If you're a master at exploiting vulnerabilities in websites, awesome. If you're a master at creating custom Python scripts for network pentesting, fantastic. \n\nHope this helps!\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You got a long road ahead of you.
