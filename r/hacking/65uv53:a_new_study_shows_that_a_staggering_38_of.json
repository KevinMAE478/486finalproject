What impresses me about this whole situation is that ransomware distributors have a good enough reputation that people are going through the trouble of confidentially paying off ransomware, and knowing that they&amp;#39;re actually going to be getting their files back.  This also means that they&amp;#39;ve found an ideal price point that can fund further ransomware campaigns, while being cheap enough that people are still paying it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m actually curious to see what the reinfection rate of ransomware vs other types of malware.  Do people who pay off ransomware finally learn their lesson, or are people getting reinfected over and over again, and just paying it off each time?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hacking", "name": "t1_dgdew2s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492460589.0, "created_utc": 1492431789.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 98}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhva", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uv53", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdscjn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MarilynMerlot", "parent_id": "t3_65uv53", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hacking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "University of Calgary paid [$20,000](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/university-calgary-ransomware-cyberattack-1.3620979) in ransomware last year.
