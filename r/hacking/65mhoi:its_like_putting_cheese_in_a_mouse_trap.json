They still have a free version, but it looks a bit crippled by comparison. The one I had could absolutely do everything I said minus the rubber ducky HID bit without the phone needing to be rooted. \n\nhttps://appsec-labs.com/appuse/#av_section_5 Their site looks iike shit, but it's a virtual machine linux distro with a bunch of specific tools installed. That Dashboard and emulator alone can blow minds despite what it looks like. It literally can operate the phone over usb and jump right past the the lock screen. \n\nI used to use it all the time.\n\nedit: Not quite sure what I'm being downvoted. I highly recommend you don't pay this company, so I am absolutely not shilling for them. I am just saying it was insanely useful before when they weren't a for profit organization like a year or two ago. The version I have absolutely, without a doubt, does what I am saying. I can probably find a server with the old vm slice stored on it and if I can't I am willing to give anyone who wants a link to download it from me. I have a massive dropbox  share from an old job back in the day and can happily give a fast link to it when I'm home from Easter shit. It's right on my old box in my den along with a handful of other really useful VMs. The version that I have continued to update and I believe still can update to have the full features, so long as you're updating from the original package and not their new bullshit.\n\nMore important update: Here is a much better look at the one I've got, although now it has been updated to contain a little more. \n\nhttps://appsec-labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/appuse_userguide_v3.4.pdf?version=3.0&amp;src=appuse_page\n\nTake a thorough look at this and note the sections on how it loads an active plugged in device into the emulator and can restart ADB. You're essentially loading the phone into an emulator and then working with the emulated device rather than the phone, but all of the phones data is still at play. You can automatically root the emulation and all sorts of other shit too. It started just as an emulator for pentesting, but they expanded it to support real devices. \n\n\"From AppUse version &lt; 3.0 a new feature implemented in order to support real devices and\nmultiple Android devices (emulators or real devices), it is possible to connect real devices\nand turns multiple Android emulators and easily select the targeted device that will be\nattached and targeted via AppUse Dashboard.\"\n\nIf it doesn't work anymore, that sucks, but it definitely used to, very recently even.

The Android Penetration Security (I that&amp;#39;s the acronym) is still an option and for sure worked as recently as last year for me. Unfortunately they have taken another route and gone pro and ask for money, but I am sure I still have their free vm on my other box. It&amp;#39;s called AppUse.  They still have a free version, but it looks a bit crippled by comparison. The one I had could absolutely do everything I said minus the rubber ducky HID bit without the phone needing to be rooted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://appsec-labs.com/appuse/#av_section_5\"&gt;https://appsec-labs.com/appuse/#av_section_5&lt;/a&gt; Their site looks iike shit, but it&amp;#39;s a virtual machine linux distro with a bunch of specific tools installed. That Dashboard and emulator alone can blow minds despite what it looks like. It literally can operate the phone over usb and jump right past the the lock screen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to use it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: Not quite sure what I&amp;#39;m being downvoted. I highly recommend you don&amp;#39;t pay this company, so I am absolutely not shilling for them. I am just saying it was insanely useful before when they weren&amp;#39;t a for profit organization like a year or two ago. The version I have absolutely, without a doubt, does what I am saying. I can probably find a server with the old vm slice stored on it and if I can&amp;#39;t I am willing to give anyone who wants a link to download it from me. I have a massive dropbox  share from an old job back in the day and can happily give a fast link to it when I&amp;#39;m home from Easter shit. It&amp;#39;s right on my old box in my den along with a handful of other really useful VMs. The version that I have continued to update and I believe still can update to have the full features, so long as you&amp;#39;re updating from the original package and not their new bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More important update: Here is a much better look at the one I&amp;#39;ve got, although now it has been updated to contain a little more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://appsec-labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/appuse_userguide_v3.4.pdf?version=3.0&amp;amp;src=appuse_page\"&gt;https://appsec-labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/appuse_userguide_v3.4.pdf?version=3.0&amp;amp;src=appuse_page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a thorough look at this and note the sections on how it loads an active plugged in device into the emulator and can restart ADB. You&amp;#39;re essentially loading the phone into an emulator and then working with the emulated device rather than the phone, but all of the phones data is still at play. You can automatically root the emulation and all sorts of other shit too. It started just as an emulator for pentesting, but they expanded it to support real devices. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;From AppUse version &amp;lt; 3.0 a new feature implemented in order to support real devices and\nmultiple Android devices (emulators or real devices), it is possible to connect real devices\nand turns multiple Android emulators and easily select the targeted device that will be\nattached and targeted via AppUse Dashboard.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it doesn&amp;#39;t work anymore, that sucks, but it definitely used to, very recently even. I&amp;#39;ll look into it soon if anyone is still interested. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hacking", "name": "t1_dgc2swy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492381457.0, "created_utc": 1492352657.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbvw54", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "px403", "parent_id": "t1_dgbuxk8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hacking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "USB HID (required for rubber ducky) has been disabled on locked Android phones for a while now, and you're going to have a hard time doing any of that with out at least ADB up and running, and you're probably going to need root to do some of that as well.
