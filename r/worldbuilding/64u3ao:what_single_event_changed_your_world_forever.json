The strangest thing of all is that there is little to no clue as to what actually happened during it; Few artifacts and records dating back to the Calamitus Era exist, and those that do give little explanation. The Calamity is a blackhole in global history that has perplexed philosophers and historians across the world for a thousand years.\n\nOne of the biggest changes seen during this period was in Highland, an empire that spanned across the vast continent of Virtualad and had been built up over the course of centuries of blood, sweat, blood, tears, and blood. Under the banner of the Hornhorse, no force, not even the great Capervan armies of the east, could hope to rival against the might of the Highish nation.

The star was visible even during the day for a month, and it&amp;#39;s appearance heralded the end of magic for half-a-century to come. The cancellation of magic sent the elves into a new dark age, all of the magical fauna lost their tonal powers (such as dragons turning unintelligent), and sciences where given a chance to thrive.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The re-occurrence of the Sand Waves at the Illyrisian Temple of the Singing Sands, marked the end of the no-magic era 40 years ago. Magic wasn&amp;#39;t as strong as it had once been, but it&amp;#39;s gaining strength and might once return to it&amp;#39;s former glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dg5pmnw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492022571.0, "created_utc": 1491993771.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64u3ao", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64u3ao", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64u3ao", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64u3ao", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg65rja", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "OOB-II", "parent_id": "t1_dg65fad", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Working out the science\" - I feel you, man.
