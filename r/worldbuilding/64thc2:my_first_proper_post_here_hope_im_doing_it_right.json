Created by a race of elves in 472 it quickly dominated most of the warring human realms on its southern border as the disciplined elven legions won almost every battle with the use of advanced battle tactics.

The Grand Rebellion of 971 lead to the collapse of the Luthenian Empire and the humans finally regaining freedom in 975.\n\nTo protect their independence the newly formed nations have created The New Empire (marked with an orange outline on the map). Crowned emperor was the grandmaster of The Steel Order (that was one of the most prominent forces of the rebellion), a religious organisation with an army of fanatic fighters and skilled mages on its disposal.

Their territories (marked with a dark blue outline) are not only torn apart by artificial states created by the Empire, but also a conflict of traditionalista and those, who realize that without adapting new technologies the elven states will never regain their former glory.
