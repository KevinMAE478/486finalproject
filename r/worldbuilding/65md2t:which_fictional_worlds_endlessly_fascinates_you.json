The way I pitch this series to friends is basically &amp;quot;imagine a world in which lawyer, businessperson, and wizard was one job&amp;quot; though there&amp;#39;s obviously a lot more too it then that.  It&amp;#39;s a really great fusion of made-up elements with enough of our world still in it to be relatable and draw the reader in, a balance that I&amp;#39;ve made it a goal to strike in all the worlds I create.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgboelb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492345567.0, "created_utc": 1492316767.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65md2t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbnzsn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Chaniatreides95", "parent_id": "t3_65md2t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dune", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dune&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgbnzsn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492344862.0, "created_utc": 1492316062.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65md2t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65md2t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65md2t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbgb0p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bluebe123", "parent_id": "t1_dgbg6ue", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I guess that's a plus...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;#39;s a plus...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgbgb0p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492333331.0, "created_utc": 1492304531.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbg6ue", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "surrogate667", "parent_id": "t1_dgbg1y7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But that's the fun part, filling in the gaps yourself of lore that's not complete :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s the fun part, filling in the gaps yourself of lore that&amp;#39;s not complete :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgbg6ue", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492333163.0, "created_utc": 1492304363.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65md2t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65md2t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbgct3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bluebe123", "parent_id": "t1_dgbgb5u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I sure hope there is.
