This is primarily done for two reasons. First, their adorability endears them to the public, and makes it all the more horrifying if one is killed in the line of duty. Secondly, criminals are more likely to underestimate their capabilities, making them overconfident and more likely to make mistakes when facing them. \n\nEven with their capabilities, however, Peacekeepers are not always able to face the most heinous of criminals.
