In order to be a full warrior among the Iron Law orcs, you have to be able to draw back the war bow to full. Now orcs in general are very strong, so I decided to ramp my orcs strength up a notch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve never been fully conquered just because of the fact that they can shoot an arrow at full strength from so great a distance the enemy can&amp;#39;t get set up properly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the other races and kingdoms have somewhat adapted to this with magic and moving at night when orcish vision is less super. Still, the prospect of war with the Iron Law Orcs is enough to make even the most capable of Dokkalfar generals sweat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dg9ojeg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492229625.0, "created_utc": 1492200825.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ig32", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "surrogate667", "parent_id": "t1_dg98c55", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Are your orcs extremely good archers due to being very physically powerful?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are your orcs extremely good archers due to being very physically powerful?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dg9ig32", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492222302.0, "created_utc": 1492193502.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg98c55", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "floofenheim", "parent_id": "t3_65cd2c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"They're at least a mile away.
