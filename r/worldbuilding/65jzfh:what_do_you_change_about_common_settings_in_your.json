There's over 25 of them. I'll just try to give brief descriptions. :P\n\n- Astral Kingdoms: Basically heaven. A bunch of floating islands with waterfalls, beautiful marble/gold buildings, etc. Basically heaven. A bunch of floating islands with waterfalls, beautiful marble/gold buildings, etc. The angels here go into what is basically VR when they try to sleep in their beds.\n\n- Gardens of Peace: A never-ending garden where you won't experience a ton of happiness, but no real suffering. It's like Limbo, but more on the good side than the bad.\n\n- The Lunar Capital: An extremely advanced civilization on the moon, where the Lunarians live. It is a pure land, which means that nothing ages or decays, although out of the principle of *wabi-sabi* some of them might artifice that appearance in their work.\n\n- The Pure Lands: A beautiful land where everything seems to be perfect and timeless. This is the stepping stone for attaining enlightenment by those who worship gods that uphold purity of spirit as a virtue above all.\n\n- Krigareheim: Basically Valhalla. A bunch of floating islands, a massive mead hall that can be endless, ethereal warriors fighting one another and then returning for feasts.\n\n- Wildegaard: A nastier version of an afterlife for warriors. It's all like a Frank Frazetta painting, the entire world is a rocky wasteland, with broken down stone buildings and ruins of castles and fortresses. This is where wild, savage berserkers go, to kill each other and respawn over and over again forever.\n\n- Gnostidium: The eternal library. Knowledge on anything can be found here. Just don't open the cellar door, or you'll open up the Realm of Chaos and everything will go horribly wrong.\n\n- The Eternal Forge: This is where the first deity, Anima the Worldsmith, lives. It could also be described as \"the plane of metal\". The walls, floor and ceiling are metal, and everyone is a machine-like being who maintains the clockwork of existence or blacksmiths/builds endlessly. \n\n- The Slime Pits: A realm of nothing but slime, it looks like a massive cavern with no exit, puddles or lakes of slime everywhere, slime dripping from the walls and ceiling in huge globs, etc. The cavern is made up of dried, hardened slime, rather than any sort of stone.\n\n- The Snake Pits: The ground is made of snakes because there's so many of them, so the ground is constantly moving. The snakes will cannibalize one another to survive. It's like a big version of that one snake.io or whatever game that you can play on your phone.\n\n- The Insect Pits: Like the snake pit, but with insects everywhere instead. The ground is made up of dead insects.\n\n- The Feywild: A crazy land where there's trees, plants, animals everywhere, but on steroids. \n\n- Realm of Power: This is where all of the elements converge and destructive wizards duke it out on large platforms until they become assimilated.\n\n- Plane of Earth: A rocky, sandy realm with no visible sky, there are no plants here, and the only beings wandering around are stone golems, sand elementals, stone titans, etc.\n\n- Plane of Air: The entire realm is endless sky, with thick layers of clouds at the top and bottom, and extremely powerful winds constantly blowing in every direction. If you fall through the bottom layer of clouds, you'll fall back through the top layer again. Only air elementals and wind titans live here.\n\n- Plane of Water: An endless ocean without a solid bottom, if you go far enough down, there's an extremely large and powerful whirlpool which sucks water into itself and then rains from a dark sky onto the surface. It is constantly raining heavily onto the surface of the ocean. Water elementals and water titans live here.\n\n- Plane of Ice: Every part of it is a field of ice, with huge spikes or boulder-like formations jutting up from the landscape, and it is extremely cold here. Ice golems, ice jotnar and ice titans live here.\n\n- Plane of Fire: An extremely hot place where it's all lava and fire, there may be some hardened lava to stand on but it doesn't matter, anyone here without extreme protection will die anyways. Fire elementals, lava golems, fire jotnar and fire titans live here.\n\n- Plane of Thunder: The ground all looks like fulgurite, and it is perpetually battered by lightning and thunder. Only lightning elementals, storm jotnar and thunder titans will be found here.\n\n- Plane of Poison: An endless, greenish white ocean, with a thick soup-like air that will instantly kill nearly anyone. Poison elementals live here. \n\n- Limbo: A black and decaying realm with acid for water, dead trees, and many undead beings like skeletons, ghosts, wraiths, etc, as well as shades, the spirits of those damned to dwell here, wandering around.\n\n- Circle of Greed: Hell for greedy people. There are oceans of hot, molten gold, with islands of silver and mountains of gold coins. Yellow imps, demons and gluttons dwell here, throwing gold at the damned while laughing at them.\n\n- Circle of Lust: Hell for lustful people. There are oceans of wine, with islands of people packed together and having sex like in that one weird animated .gif. Pixies instead of imps, purple demons, succubi, and huge, terrifying monstrosities resembling penises or vaginas with teeth dwell here, perpetually raping the damned.\n\n- Circle of Torment: Hell for violent people. There are oceans of blood, with lakes of lava beset in islands of brimstone. Forests of bone jut out from fleshy landscapes, while piles of bones and skulls are abound. Red demons, oni, devils, gajasura and pit lords dwell here, torturing the damned or ruling with an iron fist.\n\n- Circle of Betrayal: Hell for those who have betrayed someone with serious consequences as a result. The realm is made up of blackened ice, with people frozen in place. Blue demons, oni and devils wander about here, while the damned are generally waist-deep in ice, more deep or less deep in accordance to the degree of their sin.\n\n- Realm of Chaos: Also called Pandemonium, it is an insane realm where the ground is made of flesh, the sky is dark, and eldritch abominations float through the air. There are perpetual psionic storms which would instantly kill even people with incredible willpower.\n\n- Enlightenment: No one really knows what this place looks like. Just think of the \"expanding brain\" meme, it's like that maybe. But wait, it could be a peaceful white space, or just a blank void!

It&amp;#39;s like Limbo, but more on the good side than the bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lunar Capital: An extremely advanced civilization on the moon, where the Lunarians live. It is a pure land, which means that nothing ages or decays, although out of the principle of &lt;em&gt;wabi-sabi&lt;/em&gt; some of them might artifice that appearance in their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pure Lands: A beautiful land where everything seems to be perfect and timeless. This is the stepping stone for attaining enlightenment by those who worship gods that uphold purity of spirit as a virtue above all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krigareheim: Basically Valhalla. A bunch of floating islands, a massive mead hall that can be endless, ethereal warriors fighting one another and then returning for feasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildegaard: A nastier version of an afterlife for warriors. It&amp;#39;s all like a Frank Frazetta painting, the entire world is a rocky wasteland, with broken down stone buildings and ruins of castles and fortresses. This is where wild, savage berserkers go, to kill each other and respawn over and over again forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gnostidium: The eternal library.

The walls, floor and ceiling are metal, and everyone is a machine-like being who maintains the clockwork of existence or blacksmiths/builds endlessly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Slime Pits: A realm of nothing but slime, it looks like a massive cavern with no exit, puddles or lakes of slime everywhere, slime dripping from the walls and ceiling in huge globs, etc. The cavern is made up of dried, hardened slime, rather than any sort of stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Snake Pits: The ground is made of snakes because there&amp;#39;s so many of them, so the ground is constantly moving. The snakes will cannibalize one another to survive. It&amp;#39;s like a big version of that one snake.io or whatever game that you can play on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Insect Pits: Like the snake pit, but with insects everywhere instead.
