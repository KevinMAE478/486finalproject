Moreaus (so called as reference to the old novel The Island of Doctor Moreau) are humans who were spliced with animal DNA to create hybrid forms with certain advantages and disadvantages from their animal portion.\n\nHomo sapiens chiroptera or Chiropterans:\n\nChiropterans are humans who were spliced with bat DNA in an attempt to increase their sensory perception.  They often have enlarged ears and flattened noses.  Some even have vestigal webbing between their upper arm and chest.  All Chiropterans are sensitive to bright light sources and prefer worlds around cooler stars, such as red dwarfs.  In more Sol-like systems, they will often have to wear eye protection at all times when planetside.  They also can make use of echolocation as needed.\n\nHomo sapiens ursa or Ursans:\n\nUrsans are humans who wee spliced with bear DNA in an attempt to increase their muscular output.  Their ears tend to be higher on their heads with slight snouts.  Most Ursans have poor vision and nonretractable claws instead of finger/toenails.  Ursans also are often larger than other humans.\n\nHomo sapiens canis or Canids:\n\nCanids are humans who were spliced with wolf DNA in an attempt to increase physical resilience.  They tend to be lean and muscular with narrow, elongated skulls.  Many Canids have slightly thicker body hair and vestigal tails.  All Canids have enhanced olfactory senses, much like the canines they were spliced with.\n\nHomo sapiens delphus or Delphins:\n\nDelphins are humans who were spliced with dolphin DNA in an attempt to increase overall intelligence.  They tend to have distinctive skin colors and vestigal webbing between their digits.  All Delphins are completely hairless and a few have tiny external ears.  Delphins are able to hold their breath significantly longer than other humans and can use a mild form of echolocation.\n\nHomo sapiens felinis or Felinids:\n\nFelinids are humans who were spliced with feline DNA from large cats in an atempt to increase animal magnetism.  They are often lithe individuals with objectively attractive features.  Some will have patterns in their body hair reminiscent of tigers or leopards.  All Felinids have retractable claws instead of finger/toenails.\n\nHomo sapiens muris or Murins\n\nMurins are humans who were spliced with rats in an attempt to increase finesse and fine motor control.  They tend to have black eyes and triangular ears higher on their head.  Some will have thick, sleek body hair.\n\nHomo sapiens osteo or Osteos:\n\nOsteos were another genotype illegally created by Project Prometheus.  According to incomplete records, Osteos were modified to have increased aggression and muscle mass while maintaining Promethean proportions.  Due to the increased metabolism and strain on the body such modifications produced, Osteos have the shortest lifespan, averaging around 50-60 years.  Some features from Homo sapiens neanderthalis were enhanced within their genetic code giving them a more bestial appearance.\n\nOsteos tend to be consumed by wanderlust after reaching puberty and will often travel great distances to find new challenges.  Due to their shorter lifespans, reproducing is a central pillar of their communities with one male often taking up a harem of females.  Osteo communities also tend to be nomadic due to their wanderlust and it is not uncommon for them to claim a starship as their home rather than a planet or orbital habitat.  Also their heightened aggression tends to manifest highly stuctured hierarchal communities, with positions within the hierarchy, as well as most other disputes, being decided by personal combat.\n\nOsteos make up the majority of the Imperial military forces due to both their tendency for travelling and their instinctual approach to military hierarchies.  In fact, military recruitment centers will often prioritize Osteo recruits over others due to the Osteos' natural tendencies.\n\nHomo sapiens cryptus or Cryptians:\n\nCryptians are an attempt to further modify the Phytonian genome.  What sort of experiments were done and modifications were made are highly classified, but it is known that Cryptians share many traits with the Phytonians, but also have even further increased potential toward psychic abilities.\n\nThe primary differences between Cryptians and Phytonians center around the Cryptians latent psychic potential.  The majority of Cryptians have at least a mild form of emapthic ability to understand other people's motive, desires and thoughts.  While some might assume that this would lead to a more open, understanding type of community, Cryptians are actually more isolationist and paranoid of even their own genotype.  Cryptian communities are often vast, sprawling, lightly-populated underground complexes.

Previously categorized as Homo sapiens sapiens, the scientific name was changed when the Emperor took power over the Sol system after the interplanetary civil war. The reasoning behind the change, as stated by the new Emperor, was to allow humanity to never forget the sins of Project Prometheus.\n\nPrometheans occupy the majority of Imperial governing positions and the noble houses of the Imperial court are strictly Promethean. Due to the status quo for the past few millenia, many Prometheans see themselves as the purist for of humanity, and thusly more fit to rule over the other genotypes. However, due to humanity's rapid expansion, Prometheans also are the least populous genotype.\n\nHomo sapiens phytonis or Phytonians:\n\nPhytonians were the first successful artifical genotype created by Project Prometheus. Their base genome was altered to increase comfortability on lower gravity worlds like Mars or Luna. They are often shorter and slimmer than Prometheans, and their agility and hand-eye co-ordination is typically superior. The downside to this is that they are often physically frail. Due to Project Prometheus's initial wild tampering, they also have an extended lifespan that was never able to reproduced fully in any other genotype. On average a Phytonian will live up to 10 times longer than a Promethean, although they do take longer to reach physical maturity.\n\nBecause of their extended lifespans and growth cycles, Phytonians tend to have very insular communities. Most attempt to be welcoming to outsiders, but many Phytonians have found that when your children are older than your guests, it can be difficult to relate.\n\nPhytonians don't often have long-term romantic relationships and this is reflected in their marriage contracts. The average Phytonian marriage lasts for 3-5 decades before the couple splits and moves on. Since some of these marriages result in children and the parents don't often stay together for the child's entire growth to adulthood, children are often raised by an entire community in order to ease the psycological impact on the children. The idea is, if a child considers all the adults in the community as his caregivers, the blow from his birth parents seperation will be less. This is not always the case, but as a whole has worked out very well for the long-lived Phytonians.\nFinally, due to the average physical frailty, Phytonians tend to have acute cognitive capabilities. Having a long perspective on life also tends to help this aspect. Because of this, Phytonians are more likely to manifest psychic abilities than Prometheans.\n\nHomo sapiens radix or Radix:\n\nRadix were the second successful genotype created by Project Prometheus. Their base genome was altered in an attempt to increase survivability on terrestrial planetoids with harsher average environmental conditions than Earth. Radix (plural and singular) are often stockier and hardier than Prometheans and, due to random mutations during initial testing of the genotype, all seem to have a modified version of dwarfism. While Project Prometheus did attempt to correct this out, they could never successfully bring out the desired traits without also activating this gene. Since the Radix were the second genotype created, Project Prometheus attempted to give them extended lifespans also, but were unable to replicate their success to the same degree as the Phytonians, thusly Radix only average around 5 times the Promethean lifespan.\n\nRadix tend to be insular for similar reasons as Phytonians, although with the added stigma that the genotype-wide dwarfism brings this has also led to them being more gruff and stand-offish. Radix will often put forth extra effort in their lives in order to prove to other genotypes that they are just as capable, even with their stature. This has led to a common stereotype that Radix are stubborn and willful, a stereotype the Radix are most proud of.\n\nDue to their reputation for stubbornness, Radix tend to stick with relationships and careers long after most humans would have given up. Because of this, they often seem stressed and angry. To combat this, they often take to imbibing alcohol or partaking in other narcotic substances. Due to their hardier genomes, they will often be able to withstand the effects better than most other humans. However during the early centuries, before medical science was able to mitigate most of the problems with these substances, the most common cause of death for Radix was narcotic overdose.\n\nHomo sapiens penitus or Pentians.\n\nPentians were the third and final official genotype that Project Prometheus released. They were designed to adapt better to higher gravity worlds and withstand radiation heavy environments. They are often taller and more muscular than Prometheans, though as a side effect, their mental capabilities are slightly diminished. Also, due to the increased metabolism needed to maintain such a muscular frame, Pentians tend to have an average lifespan of only 70-80 years.\n\nPentians are often seen as brutish or neanderthal-esque, but no-one actually wants to get rid of the genotype due to their utility in both combat and colonization of heavy gravity worlds. So most Pentians are treated with either hostile indifference or grudging respect. Their communities tend to be more violent than the human average, due in part to their thicker hides. Since physical punishment tends not to injure them as much, they often don't think much of it. However they have learned to restrain themselves when interacting with the more fragile genotypes.\n\nPentians often do not create long-term relationships, preferring a short, intense whirlwind of passion to an extended commitment. Thusly most Pentian children only ever know their mothers.
