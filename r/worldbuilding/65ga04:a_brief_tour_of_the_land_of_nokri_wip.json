Hope you guys enjoy my creation\n-----\nA brief Guide of the Land of Nokri.\n\nFrom the Northernmost Free Towns  of Keter to the Southernmost Republic of Malkut, civilization flourished, thrived and sometimes perished in this strange land blessed by the visionary  work of a man called The Walker.\nThe whereabouts, comings or goings of The Walker are unknown, his destiny and fate even more obscure, but what is certain is that during his wanderings he decided to bless (or curse, depending on who you ask) this vast tract or land. \nThough it land was inhabited long before the Walker arrived, it was sparsely populated, (supposedly the  forefathers of the  modern day Independent Clans  are the original natives of this land) but only after The Walker tamed  the lands by the power of the Energy Nodes of Life  he discovered or created here  did the foundations for civilization truly  began.\nThe Walker arrived from the South hundreds of years ago and proceeded slowly to create a semblance of order to chaotic spots, balance to troubled areas and unleashed chaos on rigid vastnesses. What he actually did  is not very well known or even understood, but upon each  major spot of land he walked he brought forth artifacts of unknown origin. Legends retell he brought these items himself, others that he plucked them out of the sky and others that he brought them forth from the earth. No matter where, each of the nexus energy points he  left with a landmark that locals afterward  enshrined, enclosed or built upon and many kingdoms were birthed by their presence.  \n\nIt was said the artifacts brought forth wealth, power and much more to those that properly cared for them. \n\nThese focal points of energy are today sadly destroyed, displaced, hidden or simply forgotten, by the hand of mankind, monsters or time itself, but their names remain somehow in the current civilizations that sprung near them.\n\nFrom the Bottom and the first point, was Malkuth, its artifact was said to be a an arch, a portal or a gate of sorts. Supposedly it was through this portal that The Walker arrived and began his journey north. \nMany tribes, clans and petty kingdoms  formed around this ancient gate, but it was lost in the mists of time, war and chaos.  Today the only entity to exist in the nearby area is the Republic of Malkuth, a vast merchant empire that is considered by some the epitome of civilization.

It is a small world I have created based on real world mysticism mixed with the fantasy tropes of Legend. English is not my first language, so please bear in mind this and feel free to help me by giving me critiques both of the map as well of the text. Hope you guys enjoy my creation&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A brief Guide of the Land of Nokri.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the Northernmost Free Towns  of Keter to the Southernmost Republic of Malkut, civilization flourished, thrived and sometimes perished in this strange land blessed by the visionary  work of a man called The Walker.\nThe whereabouts, comings or goings of The Walker are unknown, his destiny and fate even more obscure, but what is certain is that during his wanderings he decided to bless (or curse, depending on who you ask) this vast tract or land. \nThough it land was inhabited long before the Walker arrived, it was sparsely populated, (supposedly the  forefathers of the  modern day Independent Clans  are the original natives of this land) but only after The Walker tamed  the lands by the power of the Energy Nodes of Life  he discovered or created here  did the foundations for civilization truly  began.\nThe Walker arrived from the South hundreds of years ago and proceeded slowly to create a semblance of order to chaotic spots, balance to troubled areas and unleashed chaos on rigid vastnesses. What he actually did  is not very well known or even understood, but upon each  major spot of land he walked he brought forth artifacts of unknown origin. Legends retell he brought these items himself, others that he plucked them out of the sky and others that he brought them forth from the earth. No matter where, each of the nexus energy points he  left with a landmark that locals afterward  enshrined, enclosed or built upon and many kingdoms were birthed by their presence.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was said the artifacts brought forth wealth, power and much more to those that properly cared for them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These focal points of energy are today sadly destroyed, displaced, hidden or simply forgotten, by the hand of mankind, monsters or time itself, but their names remain somehow in the current civilizations that sprung near them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the Bottom and the first point, was Malkuth, its artifact was said to be a an arch, a portal or a gate of sorts. Supposedly it was through this portal that The Walker arrived and began his journey north. \nMany tribes, clans and petty kingdoms  formed around this ancient gate, but it was lost in the mists of time, war and chaos.
