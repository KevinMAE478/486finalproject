A standing army only costs money. The only time an army produces is when they are on campaign and are raiding and pillaging. The Spartans solved this with the helots, which were basically slaves by another name. A helots only job was to make money by producing food and goods for their Spartiate master.\n\nAlso, if you're going to have some fighting, then the conflict is inevitably going to increase in scale. Spartiates who couldn't pay taxes were kicked out of the army, lost their status, and also could no longer run for office. So if a Spartiate lost his helots to a small conflict, he would be furious, and demand a proportionate, or greater, response, as his status is now in jeopardy.\n\nDoes your society have lords or nobles? A noble who lives on the border is only going to stand his people being attacked for so long, even in a minor skirmish, before he either accidentally escalates, or gets enough noble support to force the King to respond more strongly.\n\nHow much control do your generals exert over the army? Bloodlust is very much a real thing, and it only takes one too many rapes, skinnings (yes, men would skin people alive for amusement), beheadings, piles of bodies, and other unsavory acts by an out-of-control army before one side will decide they had enough. Generals would also allow all this to happen because then the men would \"get it out of their system\" and would be easier to control down the line. Some rape, pillage and murder now means the army stays enough under control to move to the new location. If you don't allow it, then the army will inevitably do it without the General's consent.\n\nFinally, on a more pleasant note, a horse and rider will be faster than a chariot for messengers. Chariots are useful for warfare, and wagons for hauling goods, but both not very useful as delivery boys. Horses get too tired too quickly pulling a chariot than just holding a single rider.\n\nedit: slight clarification ", "edited": 1492012840.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a warrior caste like the Spartiate, don&amp;#39;t forget that the man who you have in a standing army is a man not producing food or trade goods, so somebody else has to do it. A standing army only costs money. The only time an army produces is when they are on campaign and are raiding and pillaging. The Spartans solved this with the helots, which were basically slaves by another name. A helots only job was to make money by producing food and goods for their Spartiate master.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you&amp;#39;re going to have some fighting, then the conflict is inevitably going to increase in scale. Spartiates who couldn&amp;#39;t pay taxes were kicked out of the army, lost their status, and also could no longer run for office. So if a Spartiate lost his helots to a small conflict, he would be furious, and demand a proportionate, or greater, response, as his status is now in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does your society have lords or nobles? A noble who lives on the border is only going to stand his people being attacked for so long, even in a minor skirmish, before he either accidentally escalates, or gets enough noble support to force the King to respond more strongly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much control do your generals exert over the army? Bloodlust is very much a real thing, and it only takes one too many rapes, skinnings (yes, men would skin people alive for amusement), beheadings, piles of bodies, and other unsavory acts by an out-of-control army before one side will decide they had enough. Generals would also allow all this to happen because then the men would &amp;quot;get it out of their system&amp;quot; and would be easier to control down the line. Some rape, pillage and murder now means the army stays enough under control to move to the new location. If you don&amp;#39;t allow it, then the army will inevitably do it without the General&amp;#39;s consent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, on a more pleasant note, a horse and rider will be faster than a chariot for messengers. Chariots are useful for warfare, and wagons for hauling goods, but both not very useful as delivery boys. Horses get too tired too quickly pulling a chariot than just holding a single rider.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: slight clarification &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dg62854", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492041336.0, "created_utc": 1492012536.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6078j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOO", "parent_id": "t1_dg5zrdg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is really interesting.
