Some maintain their role of scout whilst also taking on the role of saboteurs and terror weapons. Some have dedicated their lives to stalking the creatures of the waste, trying to understand and catalog that which they usually just shoot. However, the majority are a living incarnation of genocide, killing all who stand in their way with stealth and efficiency.

Elvish Fire Dancers are a terrifying shock trooper, being literally on fire as they tear through infantry in a melee, but they still fall when you shoot them. Not even the human bombers or armored vehicles compare, being both the target of specialists who can take them down. See, most of these are visible and die when you shoot them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now a Veteran Pathfinder? That&amp;#39;s where the real terror is. There are very few people that have even seen more than their handy work. Veterans rarely die (for the 73 out of 532 Pathfinders that have ascended to Veteran status, only 2 have died in combat after a massive bombardment and 3 were given desk jobs due to severe injuries), and unlike the regular variety of Pathfinder, very few have been (un)lucky enough to see one in the flesh. What they usually remember, is a masked figure with a soulless face hidden behind a layer of glass and plastics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are the myths of the Wastes, a mortal that appears as an omen of death. The mere idea of one being in your postal code is enough to drive men to refuse to follow orders and hunker down in fear of a strike from the darkness. Entire campaigns have been devoted to trying to kill one team (2 Pathfinders/Veteran Pathfinders), including the incineration of an entire area the size of Los Angeles in one instance. Roads once deemed safe seem littered with explosives after one is thought to be in the region. A gunshot cracks in the middle of the night, and the only trace of the killer left is the corpse of a dead general. Scouting parties disappear, only to reappear down river or hanging from a tree. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While in all actuality, they aren&amp;#39;t nearly as powerful as they are blown up to be, the mythology surrounding them tends to do most of the work for them. Some maintain their role of scout whilst also taking on the role of saboteurs and terror weapons. Some have dedicated their lives to stalking the creatures of the waste, trying to understand and catalog that which they usually just shoot. However, the majority are a living incarnation of genocide, killing all who stand in their way with stealth and efficiency. They are angels of death, so it seems fitting that one of their rank actually becomes a champion of Death (but that&amp;#39;s a story for another time). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dg6l5gv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061009.0, "created_utc": 1492032209.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650b6b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6naxg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Meatballmaximus", "parent_id": "t3_650b6b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Echidion is a being who isn't just from an alternate universe.
