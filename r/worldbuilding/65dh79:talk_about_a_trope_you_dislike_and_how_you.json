One of my favorites was the Elves who were mostly barbaric, living short, brutal lives mostly, except the few who lived long enough to reach their full mental maturity (as opposed to physical maturity) and then (because the other elves around them are so immature, violent, and dangerous), go to live as isolated hermits, learning more and more about the forest around them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the Rome-style Dwarven Empire that, at its height, was ruled by Werewolves who lead great armies in conquest, only to eventually be overthrown by a mix of external enemies, internal unrest, and poorly timed political greed and bureaucratic incompetence.  The successor was a much less mighty state that staved off the external enemies with armies of undead, and staved off the internal enemies with harsh politics and secret police.  Somewhat Russian-esque at that point, channeling the Russia-as-a-successor-to-the-legacy-of-Rome thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dg9znrc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492244000.0, "created_utc": 1492215200.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dh79", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9nl49", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jouchiro", "parent_id": "t1_dg9dpya", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Heck yeah, I'm with you there.

After all, it wasn&amp;#39;t really their fault that they looked so much like the Gods that he despises. So he decided to leave, and let the Humans become something else other than a lookalike of the Gods he hate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, these kinds of things weren&amp;#39;t really that rare across the multiverse, and the Humans weren&amp;#39;t the only species that were treated this way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, there was a surprisingly huge amount of species that had origins like these. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as for the Humans? Eventually, they got into wars with the other Aliens, some of which were rather major(the Alien, which was a Kren, destroyed their homeworld a long time after they ended). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that-is another story altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgaig9a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492280003.0, "created_utc": 1492251203.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dh79", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9e0ph", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mareck_", "parent_id": "t3_65dh79", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 1, "body": "I disliked the fantasy trope so I did realistic fiction instead.\n\nI try to present topics like mental disorders and gender/sexuality issues as realistically as possible, without burying or trivializing them.
