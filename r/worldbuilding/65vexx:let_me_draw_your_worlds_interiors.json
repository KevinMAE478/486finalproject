Crystal columns supporting an underground chamber, with large crystals hanging from the ceiling of varying sizes and shapes. Within the crystals are opaque forms barely more visible than shadows. In the center of the back wall stands a projection crystal shining a display along the flat back wall. It stands on a slightly raised platform with small stairs leading up. Also on the platform is a small stone podium with a thin crystal rod on a stand. This is the storage facility of the gene-altered creatures known as changelings.
