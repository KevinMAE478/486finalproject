The castle of Rague was constructed against these cliffs, rising high above the city. Due to this topography, the upper city is sloped and tiered.\n\nThe climate and proximity to the ocean creates wicked storms during the summer seasons. Due to the large amounts of rain over short periods of time, the city is prone to flash floods. To mitigate the damage from the waters, the city has constructed a network of canals through the city to capture and funnel water safely into the bay. For most of the year these canals are dry, but during storms they can fill with several feet of water.\n\nAt one point in the expansion of the city, the Keeper\u2019s Span was constructed, giving the city easy access to the other side of the strait. This structure was only possible due to the contribution of the Talented that resided in the city. On this new land, the Council\u2019s Tower was built, high on the cliffs as a mirror to the castle.

He was caught in the act though, and in self-defense was killed. King Teren, afraid that he had provoked the Council to action, immediately ordered the execution of the Council and any citizen that practiced magic. This lead to the largest conflict in Cestran\u2019s history, lasting half a decade and costing tens of thousands of lives, both Talented and Untalented alike. \n\nDuring that time, the wall was constructed and the Council tower and the surrounding building were torched and destroyed.

A hundred years later China regained native sovereignty (from a historical perspective, as future genocides guaranteed Han Chinese as the preeminent Chinese ethnic group in both the North and South China) and had ~65 million people over ~6 million km^2. Notice that China is a country the size of a continent\n\n**Aside** from Chinese demographics, it would really depend on the geographic situation of your country, does it have a lot of plains, fertile valleys, and rivers? If yes, then it can support a hella lot of people. 10 - 30 people per km^2 is a good rule of thumb, closer to 20 - 30 by the Late Medieval Era.\n\nThen you have to factor the cuisine, how many people eat meat, and how often? Japan in the 15th century had a population density of about 25 people per km^2 (if not more!), but almost everyone ate rice and fish. Meat (especially four-legged animals, cultural reasons) was practically non-existent and even then, most of it came from chicken. Keep in mind that 25/km^2 population density is **misleading**, most of Japan is mountainous and non-habitable; the true population density would be closer to 40 - 50 if we only include habitable land.\n\nMeanwhile, the definition of poor in Medieval France was someone who could not eat meat at least once a week, according to a r/AskHistorian quote.\n\nHigher population densities also mean lower quality of life. The English had less people (partly due to less fertile land) than the French, but during the High Medieval Ages, their peasants were much better off (they ate more meat on average) than the French peasants.\n\nNote 1: Desert countries HAVE similar population densities to non-desert countries, but only in **habitable** land. Like the Japanese situation, the lower population density comes from claiming heaps of sand as your sovereign land, not because most of your population lives in the desert. To give you perspective, Egypt is one of the most populated Middle Eastern countries (behind Pakistan and arguably Ethiopia), and the majority people live near the Nile, [map for reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt#/media/File:Egypt_2010_population_density1.png). \n\nSo it's just a matter of figuring out how big the rivers/lakes in your country are when doing demographics of the desert; of course, some crazy people do live nomadic lifestyles in desert lands, but they're practically negligible when you're doing large scale demographics like these.\n\n**TL;DR:** Determine how many km^2 is your country and multiply that by 25 if you want average Late Medieval Europe demographics with good soil. Multiply by 15 if your land is just \"meh\", many mountains or not a lot of rainfall.
