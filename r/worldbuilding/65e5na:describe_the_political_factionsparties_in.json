Firstly, he must keep in mind the eponymous **Nine Kings**, of which he is not one. These Nine (which actually include two Lords and a Prince) are descended from the quasi-mythological Khymeragh hero known as the Brennus, and are simultaneously the monarchs of the Nine Kingdoms and chieftains of specific tribes of those those kingdoms (though they are not always the head of the clans within these tribes!). These Nine include the disparate interests of Star Khymeraghs (such as the King of Suns and the Fire Prince) and the Void Khymeraghs (such as the Raven Lord and the Flayer King), as well as all the various combinations thereof, but in general they prefer to centralize their power over their Khymeragh subjects, often by tightening up the rules of succession (some are elected monarchies, or tanistries) and by introducing non-Khymeragh servants who are loyal entirely to them, and who supersede clan divisions. This is not to say that the Kings are unfied; they bicker endlessly (and not always bloodlessly) amongst themselves, and whilst none but the manic Vercyngetorix have openly defied Tleukos yet, they are highly suspicious of his marriage to the Raven Lady (a fluke which inadvertantly makes him appear to be seeking equal status with them), and his popularity with the half-bloods. Nonetheless, they are a valuable bulwark against the more traditional elements of Khymeragh culture.\n\nAs mentioned above, **Tribal and Clan Divisions** are central to Khymeragh culture, moreso than any Royal government (clan wars are onto slightly less common between Kingdoms than within them), and these prove the greatest challenge to any central Khymeragh kingdom. Not a day goes by without reports of one clan fleet firing upon another, and it is only the skillful hands of all Nine Kings and Tleukos which prevent open war from breaking out.\n\n**The Druids** were once far more important to society; in pagan days they were virtual despots, and when the Khyemraghs became Trioists, the division's between the Refinery and Syncretic parties gave them only slightly less power. After the mass purging of the Refinerists a generation ago, however, the power of even Syncretic Druids has begun to sink, as clan divisions move back to the forefront.\n\nThe next faction are the elusive **military orders**, of which the Boar Warriors, Raven Warriors, and Salmon Warriors are the most prominent. These favor heavy honor codes, as well as rules on who can own certain weapons (mainly swords) and who can wear what type of clothing. They have an odd relationship with the Druid factions which they used to be a part of back in pagan times, but since the mass conversion of the Khymeraghs to Triost faith, the exact relationship between these two groups has grown a bit blurred. They are generally disfavorable to Tleukos, who they view as too happy with using Human military science, though he is able to accrue the loyalty of some of them by playing off of the jealousies between the various orders, and by bribes out of his own pocket, wherewith he acquires the aid of their highly skilled warriors.\n\nThe next most imporant faction is the **mix breeds**, part human and part Kymeragh, who are some of Tleukos' most ardent supporters, as it is commonly though that he is of mixed blood himself. As the mix-bloods are eager to prove that they are not at all like their human cousins, these are often the most fanatically anti-human, massacring human captives and strewing their body parts across their ships. Some radicals even insist on making Tleukos king in place of the Nine, though Tleukos himself repeatedly denounces this group. This fanaticism obviously offsets humans, but pure-blood Khymeraghs often find their over-enthusiasm rather gauche, or even hypocritical.\n\nFinally, their are the vast populations of **Void Humans**, who, whilst invariably spoken of in the same breath as the hated Eternal Human Empire, are often of bloodlines which plied the Void before Cleombrotus ever founded that empire; some say the Void was full of Humans before Khymeraghs even existed. The position of Humans in Khymeragh society varies greatly, from the totally meritocratic (which nonetheless often results in Humans in less honorable positions, as they cannot hope to match Khymeraghs in warfare), to ritually enforced servitude. These hold little power, but their sheer number means their compliance is nonetheless valuable to any potential ruler. However, as the Khymeragh factions grow more and more disparate, Tleukos finds that the only way to hold them together is increasingly vehement anti-human rhetoric.
