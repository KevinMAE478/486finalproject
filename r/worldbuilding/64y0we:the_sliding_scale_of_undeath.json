Accounts of the few survivors can recall only fuzzy memories of their infected state, as though they had woken up from a vivid nightmare. At stage 2 and beyond, the damage done is permanent.\n\nStage 2 (12 to 36 hours after exposure): The patient is permanently insane, behaving like a cannibalistic ghoul. Some language and tool use may still be possible, but the original personality no longer exists.\n\nStage 3 (36 hours to 3 days after exposure): the infected is now a zombie; technologically on life support. Organic metabolism has ceased, while the nanoplague maintains the existing muscular and nervous systems to keep the host mobile and dangerous, having replaced the digestive system, until it can construct synthetic muscles. The nanoplague consumes nonessential tissues for energy (plus any carrion or live prey the infected can consume for food).\n\nStage 4 (3 days to 6 weeks): at some point the nanoplague will have picked clean what it can use to keep the host body in play, and replaced all organic muscles. What's left is a desiccated, animated skeleton, which the nanoplague continues to use as a vehicle to hunt for fresh hosts to spread to.\n\nStage 5 (6 weeks to 6 months): normal wear and tear, and possibly combat, will eventually take its toll on the host's skeletal system. The nanoplague is not designed to replace bones completely, only repair fractures as raw materials and available energy permit. A skeletal nanoplague host will fall apart sooner or later, forcing the nanoplague to adapt to crawling or flying through its environment as it continues to search for more hosts or materials. Stage 5 nanoplague swarms appear as anything from a partial skeleton or pile of limbs or bones able to move under its own power, to a whirlwind of tiny, metallic clusters of nanobots flying low across the ground like a dust devil. (The nanobots are individually microscopic but self-configured to combine into miniature drones networked together into a localized superorganism.) A stage 5 nanoplague colony is deceptively slow, barely 1 or 2 meters per second on a full charge, but its fuzzy, shimmering, spectral appearance can impose a deadly delusion of safety for potential victims.\n\nWhen energy is scarce, a nanoplague swarm will resort to crawling or 'pouring' across surfaces (even vertical and inverted ones), or the nanoplague swarm will go into hibernation until a new energy source presents itself. A nanoplague swarm is also capable of draining most of its member units of energy to keep a few sentry and infector units alive for an extended period (on the order of months and even years for very large swarms).
