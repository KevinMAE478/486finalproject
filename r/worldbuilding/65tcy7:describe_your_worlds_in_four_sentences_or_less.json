The modern world is an unwelcoming place for such beings of magic and legend, but it's what their stuck with at the moment. Not that they haven't helped fund and support groups that would see the Veil overthrown, but they're more cautious now, more patient. And some dragons have even adopted to the modern world, using human guise to run businesses, serve in governments, and generally live the lives of luxury they believe is their birthright. For some young dragons, the age where they could lord over the other races as gods is long gone--but they can still show their might through wealth, power, and influence. You can't sleep on piles of stocks and investment, but they're a fair bit more secure than piles of gold. Also less likely to have crazy adventurers hunt you down for them as well.

Of course, that turned out to be a miscalculation, as the alliance of horrors and angels ended the Magical Age in 821 and established the Technological Age (or the modern age) with the Veil. Dragons were the ones who most opposed the Veil, and so the angels made an example of them, teaching mankind how to hunt dragons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And over the next 600 years, the dragons of Eurasia were almost hunted to extinction before they either begged for peace, or fled for the Americas--which didn&amp;#39;t do them much good when the Europeans followed them over and brought the Veil with them. Basically, the dragons received a great big cosmic karmic comeuppance thanks to the race they formally enslaved--with the help of fear and virtue, of course. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dragons have thus spent the past several centuries rebuilding, and playing by the rules--as much as that chafes their egos. The modern world is an unwelcoming place for such beings of magic and legend, but it&amp;#39;s what their stuck with at the moment. Not that they haven&amp;#39;t helped fund and support groups that would see the Veil overthrown, but they&amp;#39;re more cautious now, more patient. And some dragons have even adopted to the modern world, using human guise to run businesses, serve in governments, and generally live the lives of luxury they believe is their birthright. For some young dragons, the age where they could lord over the other races as gods is long gone--but they can still show their might through wealth, power, and influence. You can&amp;#39;t sleep on piles of stocks and investment, but they&amp;#39;re a fair bit more secure than piles of gold. Also less likely to have crazy adventurers hunt you down for them as well.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgd8skz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492442408.0, "created_utc": 1492413608.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd5m7l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PMSlimeKing", "parent_id": "t1_dgd52l2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Loch Ness Monster has moon bases?

There is also a quieter, less-visible problem: Old Pellauros, the navigable tunnels, ruins, caves and lava tubes beneath the city, is home to a great many people, and worse than people, which may not have the citizens' best interests at heart, and occasionally something dangerous will emerge from beneath the streets.\n\n* The city does have a large navy.

These rituals are performed slowly, so that every innocent involved has time to witness fully all the acts before them and know that there is no escape. Mhau exists in a realm filled with dark shadows and dull lights, all to inflict a sense of dread on any who dare traverse it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second was Tarmal, the God of Anguish. Tarmal and his followers are responsible for the moral and hope crushing acts of the world, such as setting fire to food stores in the cold Bakar winters, or poisoning town&amp;#39;s water supplies. Tarmal plays host to a realm where food crumbles to ashes in one&amp;#39;s mouth, disease strikes the body mercilessly, and water will never quench a thirst.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third was Puopat, the God of Deceit. Host of lies, Puopat and his minions are those who spread false word wherever they go. They use a quick tongue and a persuasive will to gain power over others. Puopat lives in a realm where nothing is as it seems and every new obstacle exists purely as a trap for the unsuspecting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, there was Ratagh, the God of Anger. Ratagh promises power and glory to his followers, asking only for their obedience in return for giving them the might to cause the pain and havoc the Cultists desire. Rage overcomes all in the end though, and they are lost to their own power. Ratagh inhabits a desolate, burning realm, full of course, rough sand that gets everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgd6ggh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492437069.0, "created_utc": 1492408269.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd5vdf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Batrouse", "parent_id": "t1_dgd58u1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Tell me about the Gods the cultists worship.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell me about the Gods the cultists worship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgd5vdf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492435860.0, "created_utc": 1492407060.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd58u1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hi_Im_Wall", "parent_id": "t3_65tcy7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "**The Valley of Bakar**\nPowerful Clans and Guilds, deadly Magicians, terrifying monsters, and dark Cultists bent on following the will of their Gods all come together in The Valley of Bakar, a country residing entirely in a thick, towering, circular mountain range.

They are arctic nomads that get energy from burning coal and other combustibles, instead of food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Drake is a domestic dragon species. It acts very doglike. Dragons, as well as wyverns, wyrms, leviathans, basilisks, and lindbeasts, are descended from placoderms. They all keep the bony head from this ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Diamondback Wyrm, and the basic wyrm shape, are inspired by an older creature I made for another setting. This older creature is what caused me to come up with the placoderm ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Noctoid is an oceanic amphibian that can fly. I especially like the night sky pattern on its wings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Rivatli are my newest race. They are dinosaurs, but are considered primitive birds in-world. They are mostly based on birds in general, but get their (male) colours from macaws.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While not my favourite, the Hexaplate and Metallurgist Bee seem to be everyone else&amp;#39;s favourite. The hexaplate is a species of iguana that has a symbiotic relationship with bees, letting them live inside it. The lizard provides a mobile hive, and the bees offer protection, both in the form of the bees themselves, and in the metal-like wax armour that gives the bees their name. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgd6oa8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492437541.0, "created_utc": 1492408741.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd5whn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hi_Im_Wall", "parent_id": "t1_dgd5qf3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Talk to me about some of your favorite creatures!
