You can chalk it up to me being too young when the movie came out, you can even accuse me of being blinded by some sort of forgiving adoration for the series in general although I'd contest that last point. \n\nI'm Qu\u00e9becois. I've worked as a translator. I grew up living the words Pidgin and Cr\u00e9ole. As a kid watching those movies I saw that the Gungans had been invaded by whatever the heck that universe calls humans and that they'd been oppressed by the invaders. To me it made sense that they would communicate in pidgin. For me it was a feature, not a bug. \n\nGalactic Basic is just the nonsense term they use to handwave that everyone is just speaking English. It's the same principle as Common in D&amp;D. It's dumb and has really only come up in Expanded Universe stuff as far as I know. \n\nI don't believe that Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace is a misunderstood classic or whatever, there was clearly a severe lack of oversight or check on Lucas' creative control that led to a flawed final product. I'm just not on the Red Letter Media side of things. The movie isn't burning garbage, it just couldn't possibly sustain the expectations. Early reviews of the film were positive from both fans and critics, it took a while for people to digest and process the idea that the new Star Wars movie kinda sucked. It's only my opinion, not some consensus I'm making up, that those criticisms were a tad overzealous and that some of the critics were grasping at straws focusing unduly harshly on perceived flaws as a result of trying to wrap their heads around the fact that they just didn't like it and lacking to tools to really talk about what was wrong with it. \n\nI don't think that Americans are uniquely naive or the driving force behind Episode I criticism, it's just that to my ear Jar Jar and his compatriots suffer from a whole host of contradictory speech affectations that I have never felt comfortable labelling ''West Indian'' or any real-world accent. \n\nSince I've failed to follow my own, I suppose ''advice'', to you I'll admit here that I don't know why I felt the need to respond, I guess it's what I perceived as a hostile passive-aggressive tone but intent is notoriously difficult to read so feel free to take me to task once again if you wish, I feel like I've said everything I could possibly have to say about how I feel about Star Wars Episode I vis-\u00e0-vis criticism of lazy or malicious overt racism in its depiction of members of alien species.
