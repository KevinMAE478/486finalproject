Note that this world is currently in its mid-to-late Bronze Age.\n\nBefore being taken over by **Minoklos**, the realms of **Alataea** and **Aegeus** were fairly similar in terms of their governing structure, ruled by a king/queen while the aristocracy formed a senatorial body that helped dictate the rules and determine social and foreign policies with the king ultimately having right of say in terms of accepting or vetoing the law.  In this regard they have similar laws; the right of property, the right of free enterprise, outlawing murder and thievery, etc.  Of course there are some parts where they diverge, and sometimes it can be very drastic.\n\nIn Alataea women have a fair few more rights than in most parts of the world.  Women are able to own property and commit themselves to a business rather than a relationship with children (though are required to pass the business to the husband if she marries and bears offspring, though she may choose who inherits or purchases property with said business's funds).  Of course, they have stereotypical roles in society - the most common forms of business women could partake in are as priestesses, acolytes, cooks, fishmongers, and goatherds (one of the few jobs that they can legally have children with and still run on their own, allowing single mothers to feed their offspring), but they have many freedoms and a right to contest men for their children during a divorce.  The wives of senators may also stand and take the place of their husbands if they are at war or with illness and are allowed to hold that post uncontested for five years during their husband's death (though they must remarry if they wish to keep it), and they may even suggest laws and vote for policy in their husband's name, acting on their authority, and are welcome to be present to all forums save those of war.\n\nIn the various nations of Aegeus this is frowned upon.
