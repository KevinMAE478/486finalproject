It is a city placed on three gigantic stone formations by the western coast of Raebeus - A continent, previously referred to as an island. \n\nThe three islands of the city are named Aksaran, Karakay and Siyankay - Aksaran being the largest and Siyankay the smallest. Augustgrad is divided in three main sections, each section belonging to a different island. The Citadel of Augustgrad is built into Aksaran, the Palace on Karakay and the Academy on Siyankay.\n\nThe only residential building in the city is the Palace, which houses the aristocrats from the Senate and the Council. The Religious Leader, as titled Their Holiness the Abraxii, resides in the highest tower of the Temple in the Citadel. The monarch, Their Excellence the King/Queen, resides in the Monarchical Seat in the Citadel.\n\nApart from the Citadel and Palace maids, everybody else, including  minor politicians, workers, students of the Academy is housed in the adjacent city Septembergrad. Unlike Augustgrad, Septembergrad is a normal city - located on the shore. It is the largest city by population and one of the most luxurious and expensive places to live in the Empire, as it is closely linked to its' Capital.\n\n# The Citadel of Augustgrad\n\nThe Citadel of Augustgrad is the largest building in the entire world. Built into the island of Aksaran, The Citadel contains the Imperial Senate, the Monarchical Council, the Monarchical Seat of the EUNR and the Religious Center of the Empire.\n\n**The Senate**\n\nThe Senate is a tall and slender wing of the Citadel. In the most basic sense it is a hollow circular tower with balconies attached to the inner walls. This Hall of sorts is where the Senate Hearings occur.\n\nThe Senate as an organization consists of Regional representatives, or with other words Regional Aristocrats, which give forward propositions to create new laws, retire old ones or change those existing. \n\nIt was created in order to unify the four nations that form the Empire, while giving it a form of democracy as well. The Menothi, the Kalari, the Asahi and the Baikals are the four nations, each one holding twenty five seats in the Senate.\n\n**The Monarchical Council**\n\nThe Council wing is significantly smaller than the other wings in the Citadel. Placed right under the natural bridge of the island, it has three sectors - the Western, the Eastern and the Central sector.\n\nThe function of the council is to advise the Monarch towards or against executing the actions proposed by the Senate. The Western follows more conservative views and is in opposition to the Eastern sector. The Central sector has a neutral and objective point of view, and the Monarch usually listens to the centrists.\n\n**The Monarchical Seat**\n\nThe Monarchical Seat is the largest wing of the Citadel. It holds the Royal chambers, War-halls, Feast-halls, and most importantly the Throne Room. The Royal chambers are at the uppermost part of the wing, overlooking the sea. The war-halls are the first two halls one sees upon entering the Seat - One facing right, one left. Apart from the Royal chambers they are the most heavily fortified rooms in the entire city, used for hiding women, children, maids and priests during a siege, for war meetings during times of unrest and for holding balls during times of peace. The Feast-halls are just for  that - feasts. They also include twenty four apartments for Royal guests.\nNotable monarchs:\n\n\n\t1.  Anansi Augustus, the second Monarch of the EUNR. She ordered the construction of Augustgrad. She was also a distant relative of Eugus Kalwin - an ancient king of the Menothi nation, who ordered the construction of a very similar palace, the Academy of Eugustian Astronomy and Abstract Knowledges. Ended riots by an extremist Kalari group\n\t\n\t2. Zara Julien, the seventh Monarch of the EUNR. She felt that it was stupid for the Royal chambers to overlook the sea, rather than the land it rules, so she ordered the construction of a small balcony on below the Temple that has a view towards Raebeus and Septembergrad. She also fortified the entrance halls in case of a siege, naming them war-halls.\n\t\n\t3. Lazarus Bastia, twelfth Monarch. He successfully ended a civil war sparked by Kalari separatists. He also created the Senate after the civil war.\n\t\n\t4. Saat Xaron, thirtieth Monarch. There was no pressure, civil unrest, war, economic downfall, recession or crisis under his fifty year rule.\n\n\t5. Octavia Asahi, fortieth Monarch. She created the Academy of Augustgrad.\n\t\n\n**The Temple**\n\nThe Temple is the Religious Center of  the EUNR. It is a large domed structure with only one tower. The dome is the highest manmade structure in the world, standing at roughly 600 meters above sea level. \n\nThe High Priest, also called the Abraxii is the leader of religion in the EUNR. He commands every religious action the Empire makes. He has twelve counselors that he communicates his ideas with - They are called Shadow Priests.\n\nThe religion itself worships one god, Abraxas, but recognizes more in its' mythology. It refers to them as False Gods. \nIn a nutshell, the mythology states that at first there were many gods, living on the moon and Earth, feasting and killing and destroying and creating chaos over millennia. They created humans as slaves and put the \"bad stock\", aka the most disobedient and vulgar ones on Earth. One day Abraxas came and fought the gods by himself. After ascending triumphant over them, he exiled the ones who survived into the cosmos. With the help of humans he created the City of Abraxas on the moon, and called it heaven. From that day onward he promised that if a person dies with honor, love, compassion and a good heart, his soul will ascend for eternity in the City of Abraxas.\n\nNotable Abraxii:\n\n\t1. Karl V. Easily one of the most charitable religious leaders, he helped the government raise enough money for the construction of a hundred hospitals and schools throughout the Empire simply by asking people to help with what they can. One of the most loved Abraxii in history.\n\t\n\t2. Xelios. He started the Holy Inquisition hunting down cultists and sectants during the rule of Anansi Augustus.\n\t\n\t3. Zorkii IV. She constructed two observatories with telescopes following the trajectory of the moon. With her help, the first solid evidence of the existence of the City of Abraxas was observed.\n\nThe Shadow priests have no notable members, since they have vowed to be anonymous. As soon as an individual becomes a Shadow Priest, he declines his name, heritage, personal life, and is given one of twelve Shadow Priest names:\n\nJanine, Julien, Augustus, Octavia, Decius, Marc, Aprius, Maya, Febrius, Jun\u00edn, Septembria, or Novena.\n\n# The Palace of Augustgrad\n\nThe Palace is a building built on the second largest island in Augustgrad, Karakay. It houses the apartments of fifty of the less influential Senators. \n\n# The Academy of Augustgrad\n\nThe Academy is built on the smallest island of the three, Siyankay. It is the most prestigious Political University in the EUNR. Its' Alumni are almost always guaranteed to be hired as ambassadors, governors or even senators and counselors as soon as they graduate.

That's why a lot of the minor politicians and workers live in Septembergrad, a city of ~ half a million.\n\nAugustgrad is perfect for parades, feasts, gatherings, spectacles though. The Temple alone can hold about five hundred people on the base floor, and that's usually what happens during big Holidays. The war-halls combined with the feast-halls in the Monarchical seat hold more than a thousand people every time a new King/Queen is coronated, dies or gets married.\n\nThis means it's got around 580 permanent residents, so it makes it a really, really small town.

They were only in it for the science and how it would make lives better, so no effort was made to incorporate their tech in military research, which made them weak. Thus, their country was destroyed by the ultra-religious Imperium Glassa, an Empire of Asahi and Baikal people. Imperium Glassa destroyed almost all written knowledge of the Menothi people, but before completely destroying their academy as well, they moved their forces to fight an incoming invasion of Kalari people from the east.\n\nAfter around a thousand years have passed and the Imperium Glassa is dissolved into Eastern and Western Glassa (Belonging to the Baikal and Asahi respectively), the four nations, Asahi, Baikal, Kalari and Menothi form a pact, thus creating the Empire we know today. At this point in time they are studying what's left of ancient Menothi books and academies and rediscovering their technology.
