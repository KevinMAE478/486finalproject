In times where dwarves have a grievance or some crime is committed a Dwarf is expected to cut off such a braid, the length of the cut, length of the overall braid, and the spot on the body where it is cut usually representing the intensity of the crime (Dwarves looking to seek to extend their recompense to the point of sincere apology will sometimes cut the braid&amp;#39;s twin on the opposite limb).  Clean shaven Dwarves are thankfully rare, because they must have accomplished such a terrible crime as to be unforgivable...so far, nobody really knows what crimes exist that can be so terrible save mass murder and kinslaying.  Hair extensions are generally frowned upon, because it implies you&amp;#39;re willing to be a fake to seek out levels of trust within your community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dg8f9nj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492155495.0, "created_utc": 1492126695.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656qfv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656qfv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656qfv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7x3s3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Celphernsghost", "parent_id": "t1_dg7voc1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is the Krilli flat chested thing to do with never having bred?
