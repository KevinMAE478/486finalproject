The short version can be summarized thusly: you know of how, in *Macbeth*, his encounters with the witches led him to falling into madness and tyranny, and caused a bunch of death and destruction for many people? Replace the witches with a trio of gods that opposed the 'glorious kingdom', and Macbeth with Lacart's closest equivalent to Jesus, and you have the Betrayal.\n\nLonger version goes that Gannus, the god-king of the North and appointed by the Panarch Lycrax (and possibly his son-on-Lacart; there's been schisms because of this dispute) encountered three beings on his way home from a failed rebellion. These beings mixed truth, lie, and possible future to unsettle him, then offered him the power to change what was coming. He refused. Cue the events mysteriously coming to pass because he tried to prevent them, trying to find the beings before they show up near the last point possible and he's the most desperate and freely giving help, and thus getting their hooks in him. Things go downhill slowly until he falls to madness and turns on his own people and Lycrax comes down from above to stop him, the ensuing fight devastating the North and making Lycrax turn away from Lacart in his sorrow.\n\n**Adhabu**: Born in the Congo basin, the man who'd become Adhabu's life was disrupted with the birth of the Congo Free State, colonializing the basin for King Leopold II of Belgium. In a world where, for the last twenty or so years people have started to gain powers from trauma, the bloody-in-our-world state gets even worse with the backlash and, after his life is torn through with a firsthand encounter with the violence, he gains the power to generate heat or cold, as well as teleport while controlling the cold and having a regeneration state while controlling the heat. He helped kick the colonialists out of the Congo and later assisted other areas in getting their freedom in exchange for working together against the outsiders, and a few decades later helped form a coalition of African states to provide a united front against the outside world. In terms of personal reputation, he's feared by the outside world like Magneto is for Marvel, considering his power level and attitude of '*never again*'.\n\n**The Stormcage**: In Cherbium, the Stormcage is the section between planetside Kerub and the floating islands above where thick clouds can cover hundreds (possibly thousands) of miles for anywhere from weeks to years, whether they decide to let storm on what's below or just hang ominously above. This is a problem because cherbium, the floating element that keeps sky-islands aloft and is the main reasons sky-ships can travel around - such as taking runs between planetside Kerub and the floating Islands above - can temporarily lose some to all of it's floating capability with electrical charge, meaning travel up or down in areas that aren't clear-skies can be...*interesting*.\n\nThe erratic and quick ability for a Cloudcage (a specific covering of the Stormcage region) to appear isn't fun, but there's sections of Kerub that maintain a Cloudcage for months on end if not just straight-up indefinite periods, making getting in and out of entire sections of the globe really dangerous unless one wants to get out of the covered radius on foot (or nearly skimming the ground to stay as far from the clouds as possible), something the treasure-hunters and explorers rather annoyed, and making those who live there wish less-overcast places, like Portland or Seattle.\n\n(If you'd like a good example, 0:50-57 of the [second Aliens: Covenant trailer](https://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=u5KPP6lxRVg) shows what a Cloudcage looks like rather nicely. Now, imagine that covering the sky for hundreds to possibly thousands of miles, looking like that *at best* for months to years.)\n\n**The Shattering**: Untold millennia ago, planetside Kerub used to not be a wild and generally uncivilized place and the sky-islands overhead didn't exist. Kerub *also* used to have four moons instead of just two. However, the destruction of Ialar and Saic led the two moons to rain down on Kerub, devastating the world and destroying the civilizations that used to be, and messing up the weather patterns. However, either some inherent factor of Ialar and/or Saic, or the nature of their destruction, led some of the rubble to have floating properties, and flying land hung over the devastated world. Some of the lifeforms dragged up started settling the islands and others who managed to get off Kerub did the same, and over time nations started forming above. Cut to thousands of years later and life has been carved out above and below the Stormcage, though both don't tend to care for the other.", "edited": 1492334276.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;The Betrayal of Lycrax&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: A major tale in Lycraxism and essentially the reason for the &amp;#39;fall of the golden age&amp;#39;.

In a world where, for the last twenty or so years people have started to gain powers from trauma, the bloody-in-our-world state gets even worse with the backlash and, after his life is torn through with a firsthand encounter with the violence, he gains the power to generate heat or cold, as well as teleport while controlling the cold and having a regeneration state while controlling the heat. He helped kick the colonialists out of the Congo and later assisted other areas in getting their freedom in exchange for working together against the outsiders, and a few decades later helped form a coalition of African states to provide a united front against the outside world. In terms of personal reputation, he&amp;#39;s feared by the outside world like Magneto is for Marvel, considering his power level and attitude of &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;never again&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stormcage&lt;/strong&gt;: In Cherbium, the Stormcage is the section between planetside Kerub and the floating islands above where thick clouds can cover hundreds (possibly thousands) of miles for anywhere from weeks to years, whether they decide to let storm on what&amp;#39;s below or just hang ominously above. This is a problem because cherbium, the floating element that keeps sky-islands aloft and is the main reasons sky-ships can travel around - such as taking runs between planetside Kerub and the floating Islands above - can temporarily lose some to all of it&amp;#39;s floating capability with electrical charge, meaning travel up or down in areas that aren&amp;#39;t clear-skies can be...&lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The erratic and quick ability for a Cloudcage (a specific covering of the Stormcage region) to appear isn&amp;#39;t fun, but there&amp;#39;s sections of Kerub that maintain a Cloudcage for months on end if not just straight-up indefinite periods, making getting in and out of entire sections of the globe really dangerous unless one wants to get out of the covered radius on foot (or nearly skimming the ground to stay as far from the clouds as possible), something the treasure-hunters and explorers rather annoyed, and making those who live there wish less-overcast places, like Portland or Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(If you&amp;#39;d like a good example, 0:50-57 of the &lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=u5KPP6lxRVg\"&gt;second Aliens: Covenant trailer&lt;/a&gt; shows what a Cloudcage looks like rather nicely. Now, imagine that covering the sky for hundreds to possibly thousands of miles, looking like that &lt;em&gt;at best&lt;/em&gt; for months to years.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Shattering&lt;/strong&gt;: Untold millennia ago, planetside Kerub used to not be a wild and generally uncivilized place and the sky-islands overhead didn&amp;#39;t exist. Kerub &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; used to have four moons instead of just two. However, the destruction of Ialar and Saic led the two moons to rain down on Kerub, devastating the world and destroying the civilizations that used to be, and messing up the weather patterns. However, either some inherent factor of Ialar and/or Saic, or the nature of their destruction, led some of the rubble to have floating properties, and flying land hung over the devastated world. Some of the lifeforms dragged up started settling the islands and others who managed to get off Kerub did the same, and over time nations started forming above. Cut to thousands of years later and life has been carved out above and below the Stormcage, though both don&amp;#39;t tend to care for the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit":
