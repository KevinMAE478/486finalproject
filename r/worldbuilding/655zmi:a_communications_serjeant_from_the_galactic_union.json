The radio channels received by the communicators were generally encrypted, so the communicators would be tuned to the correct frequency and decrypted using the configurators.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Communications serjeants were picked from the serjeanty, a class of soldiers made up of land owners, and those chosen needed to be loyal and obedient, as they would need to relay the orders as quickly as they could. The communications serjeants were equipped with a plasma pistol sidearm in order to defend themselves one handed. Unfortunately, the communications backpacks were particularly heavy making communications serjeants slow, and their standards made them clear targets, and if killed, would disrupt the chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/c2JzGyH.png\"&gt;Map of the Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some more posts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5klgbx/infographic_about_the_desolate_planet_lokridan/\"&gt;Lokridan&lt;/a&gt; - A barren wasteland&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5kxhye/infographic_about_the_tropical_planet_chejka/\"&gt;Chejka&lt;/a&gt; - A tropical paradise&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5la5zs/infographic_about_the_penal_world_turned_diamond/\"&gt;Irtnu&lt;/a&gt; - The diamond capital of the Galaxy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5lu3pg/infographic_on_the_forested_world_of_beganu/\"&gt;Beganu&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 A forested world&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5mrbub/infographic_about_the_capital_of_the_alliance_of/\"&gt;Korm&lt;/a&gt; - The flooded capital of the free worlds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5oyhg9/some_lore_about_the_nomadic_8_legged_xatachi/\"&gt;The Xatachi&lt;/a&gt; - 8 legged nomads from the Galactic North-West&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5sgxm6/the_state_of_the_galaxy_during_3_important_time/\"&gt;3 Political Maps of the Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; - The state of the Galaxy during 3 important time periods&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5uss0l/redesign_of_a_military_spaceship_a_kalmaris_brig/\"&gt;Kalmaris Brig&lt;/a&gt; - A military spaceship used by the Galactic Union&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/64suj7/standard_manatarms_from_the_tea_empire/\"&gt;Tea Empire man-at-arms&lt;/a&gt; - The backbone of the Tea Leagues&amp;#39; private army&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dg7nuaq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492124392.0, "created_utc": 1492095592.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655zmi", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7qt9f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "avilast99", "parent_id": "t3_655zmi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Love it!

You can swing a sword at someone all day and they'll take the armor off at the end with nary a bruise.\n\nThe best way to eliminate someone with plate armor is knock your opponent to the ground. Knights carried a tool like a railroad spike, which they would thrust into a grounded opponent's visor, or pierce through the top of the helmet to kill a fully armored foe. The best way to get a well armored opponent to the ground is with force, and swords don't have force like maces, hammers or polearms do.\n\nIs your plate strong enough to stop a spike? Sounds to me like it is, which means once the opponent is grounded, a spike's still not necessarily going to get into an eye slit or pierce the helmet, so your combatants would need something else to finish the job. I would imagine a plasma shot to the face would work well - eye slits and breathing holes will let the heat in to cook the guy. That said, in close quarters while pinning someone down, I would wager several-thousand-degree plasma isn't going to leave the attacker unscathed either.
