Celebrating it as the day Christ was resurrected is not an option for any human.\n\nThe Ezfi have a very tense relationship with human religions. In theory, the like it. It's good for humans to believe in things that give them hope and make them feel loved. However, human religions come with a lot of stuff that spits in the face of what the Ezfi believe, most notably the idea that humans are capable of sinning and being punished in the afterlife. \n\nThe Ezfi have incorrectly concluded that human religions are the way they are because human instinctually knew that other intelligent beings (the Ezfi) were supposed to be taking care of them. Because they hadn't met the Ezfi yet, they assumed other humans were supposed to hold that role, and then they became distraught when other humans acted in their own self-interest like they were supposed to. Religion was their way of assigning blame to other humans for their suffering. Therefore Earth religions are unhealthy, and must be weeded out and replaced with more wholesome Ezfi religious beliefs. \n\nSo, like all Earth holidays ported to Esria, \"Bunny Day\" has been made completely secular. Not all humans see it that way, though. There are a minority of humans who cling to old faiths like Christianity, using codes and alternate symbols to stay connected and worship the way they want to. The human in this picture is one of those people. Instead of a cross, Esrian Christians use an X symbol, as shown on the egg, to dodge censorship. While his caretaker relaxes, this human is using the decorated egg as a icon through which he can contemplate Christ's sacrifice and other religious topics. He's also wishing he could get his hands on a real bible someday, something that's next to impossible on Esria, so that he can be sure he's doing things right.
