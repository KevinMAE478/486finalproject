Some believe that, like Xiph mages, the priest hide their faces as to not anger the gods in their search for Devine knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others believe it is out of fear that the gods will punish them for their acquired knowledge, or burn the knowledge from their minds. Some believe that the powers granted to them (whatever they may be) are given by the gods, and the priests features are taken as payment. Some believe that the meteorite the priests caretake deforms them, giving them twisted appearances in exchange for otherwise unattainable knowledge or powers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people, away from too many listening ears, say that the high priests of Xiph can see the future, and that they have seen the deaths of the gods themselves, and hide their faces in fear of angering the gods, or even in embarrassment and shame that their masters, who are preached to be all powerful, will one day be no more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Questions and comments very welcome, the write up is pretty rough and rushed so I&amp;#39;m sure I left things out!
