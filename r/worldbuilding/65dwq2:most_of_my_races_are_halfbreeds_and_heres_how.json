That topic being half-breeds and how they&amp;#39;re handled in your setting. In my particular setting, (Tiron, a fantasy realm) there are only a few sapient races, but they&amp;#39;ve been able to mix into quite a few. It&amp;#39;s an integral part of my world and as far as I&amp;#39;ve seen, it hasn&amp;#39;t really been done before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gods and immortals don&amp;#39;t really follow these rules of sapient species. Gods made the immortals who in turn made the world and the races in it. The five immortal races are celestials, fiends, fey, dragons, and titans/giants. All tasked with creating their own portion of the material plane. But that&amp;#39;s another story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The celestials made the mortal races, those being humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and lesser giants (giantlings). Each one of those races had a continent all to themselves, but as they branched out and discovered each other, they found they could multiply with each other to create new species. These half-breeds or mixed races all have their own characteristics shared between their parent races, but have the distinct misfortune of not being able to breed with any other races other than their own half-race. Here&amp;#39;s a quick rundown of some of these half races.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nymphs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What most settings would call half-elves. Their name is given to them by their human parent race as a sort of insult, as most elves are considered objectively beautiful, their creation is seen as a sort of giving in to lust. A distinct feature of nymphs is a sort of natural marking on their skin. They are unique to the individual, and often telling of personality or ability. Elves call these markings &amp;quot;brands&amp;quot; and see them as signs of impurity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Halflings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Born of dwarven and human parents. Their social human side and dwarven propensity for celebration make them a general fun-loving race. Their parent races also put a large emphasis on family and tradition, so it&amp;#39;s common to see halflings come together to establish settlements of their own, quaint humble communties spread across Tiron and greater Myteria. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trolls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A common pairing, as humans and orcs were some of the first races to meet after the orcs were driven out of their homeland by dragons. Lighter-skinned, more intelligent orcs with legendary endurance. Some say their wounds heal faster than any other race. They serve as soldiers and guards in human societies, while taking up roles as diplomats, wise-men, and builders in orc cultures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goliaths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Human and giant cross. Appear as seven to eight-foot-tall humans. Very impressionable, as they usually inherit humans&amp;#39; adaptability and lesser giant complacency. Considered a race of servants, and pretty much become whatever it is the people around them want them to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gnomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Birthed from elves and dwarves. Brilliant, but very small and feeble. This makes them excellent scholars and spellcasters, as they are hindered even in their agility. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghouls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rare offspring of an elf and an orc. Cursed with a pitted, corpselike skin, they are given a name of the undead and feared by most society. This and their elven attunement to magic and their violent orcish tendencies make them excellent story fodder for outcast evil sorcerers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyclopes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t noticed the theme with the elven half-breeds, they don&amp;#39;t like when elves breed with other races. Elves rather prefer their races pure, so they long ago cursed their mixed offspring to have marking defects: the nymph&amp;#39;s brand, the gnome&amp;#39;s tiny and feeble nature, the ghoul&amp;#39;s corpselike appearance, and the single eye of the cyclops. Other than this glaring feature, cyclopes are a wise and strong species, taking up a nomadic lifestyle in the northern deserts. Sometimes they function as wisemen in wandering lesser giant herds. They are large in size, personality, wit, strength, and goals. Not known for their subtlety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Orcs and dwarves produce this devilish trickster race. Most settings would call these individuals &amp;quot;goblins,&amp;quot; but that is more of a slur for weaker lowland orcs. Imps are often employed as assassins and burglars, and are said to pursue dwarven greed with orcish ferocity. As such, they are at the other end of the spectrum from cyclopes in terms of subtlety. They love making deals and contracts and usually always have an escape route planned. I often draw on Star Trek&amp;#39;s Ferengi when writing or playing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ogres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The children of orcs and lesser giants. Very strong, very reclusive, but not very fast, mentally or physically. They don&amp;#39;t mesh well with giants&amp;#39; nomadic lifestyles, and usually go off on their own to live off the land in a lair (or a swamp, perhaps?). Often sought after as shock troops or arena fighters. Some less savory characters capture orcs and giants and make them breed to produce powerful ogre soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unmen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lesser giants and dwarves are not fond of one another. A long history of war and a massive size difference almost always puts them at odds. Thus, a cross between the two is so rare that no one is sure that they exist. There are many speculations of what may come from this pairing, but none are known to be true or false.\nI run tabletop games in this world of mine, and I use Unman as a free slot for players to play as a race, homebrew or otherwise, that doesn&amp;#39;t fall in line with the lore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, not super original, lots of fantasy tropes, but I feel like I&amp;#39;ve structured it in a unique way that is integrated into the world and feels logical and sequential. Plus, as playable races in a tabletop, it gives a new nuance to playing a gnome or similar race. Again, people are often interested in this particular facet of the world, so I thought I&amp;#39;d share. Feel free to borrow ideas.
