The buildings are enormous edifices of marble and white stone, though the Romanesque and Corinthian details have been smoothed away similar to what we call Striped Classicism.

Decorative towers and gothic elements are another common feature, particularly closer to the Palace in Dauntless, and James Cook, Wards, which were built later and deliberately ornate.\n\nThe most famous example is Marlborough Palace, the political and royal capital of the Commonwealth, whose 156 m dome makes it the tallest building in the nation.\n\nSouthern Tower of Marlborough Palace:\n\nhttps://shredworld.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/img_4484.jpg\n\n**First Commonwealth**\n\nA more generic, urban, building style combining the Victorian elements with economic practicality.
