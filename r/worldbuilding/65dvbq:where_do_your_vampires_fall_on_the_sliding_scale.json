The source does not matter as long as it is fresh (though creatures with corrosive blood and other dangerous properties are in most cases not optimal). A vampire requires fresh blood in order to maintain its lifelike appearance and vampiric abilities, and the longer it goes without blood the more dry and sunken its flesh appears, until eventually (usually around 20-25 years since the last solid meal) their vampire properties will fade away completely and they'll become a \"normal\" type of undead, usually a skeleton by this point. \n\n&gt; Craving Type\n\nVampires are fully aware that without blood they will lose their supernatural abilities (though not all are aware that they can survive without it). Their hunger is gnawing and persistent and strongest when they have recently fed, but will fade away gradually the longer they go without blood. \n\n&gt; Conversion\n\nVampirism isn't a disease, and anyone can be made into a vampire after death with the proper rituals, the same as a lich, mummy, or other manufactured (not naturally occurring) undead. Surviving a vampire bite is likely to give you a secondary infection (most vampires don't brush their teeth) but it won't transform you into their spawn. The belief that it will, however, is very common in Orare, due to the amount of vampires that are themselves capable necromancers. \n\n&gt; Morality Shifts\n\nThere's no morality shift upon becoming undead for any type of undead in Orare, but it does affect some of the parts of consciousness. Undead are incapable of feeling most of the emotions they are familiar with in life, like fear, love, and joy, and quickly slip into a depressive state as they feel like the whole world has been \"greyed out\" and made devoid of meaning. The undead state does have \"emotions\" of its own, it just takes time to understand them and to forget the absence of the old ones. \n\n&gt; Super Powers\n\nIn addition to normal undead qualities, vampires have incredible strength, supernaturally precise senses, are able to heal their bodies rapidly, and can transform into a shadowy cloud and back. Like any undead they grow gradually stronger the longer they exist, though their abilities are also dependent on regular consumption of living blood. Without blood they are no more powerful than a normal skeleton or zombie, though a particularly ancient vampire will still be hideously strong. Many magic using vampires wield spells that conjure or control blood, but these are the result of research by vampires and not an innate quality of the vampiric condition. Mortals can learn these spells (if they had the chance), but because they are usually designed for use by supernaturally durable undead they can be hazardous for living creatures to cast. \n\n&gt; Weaknesses\n\nVampires are damaged by sunlight as though they were set on fire. This is the result of their powerful senses, which also make them vulnerable to effects that directly attack those qualities, like loud sounds and other bright lights. A vampire that has lost many of its abilities due to infrequent blood consumption will lose these vulnerabilities as well. Destroying a vampire's heart will usually destroy it instantly, but very old vampires that have been reduced to skeletons seem to have lost this weakness. \n\n&gt; Appearances\n\nVampires that have consumed blood very recently will look much the same they did in life. Without blood, vampires slowly look more and more like normal undead: withered and grey. Powerful undead of any sort will exude a hazy aura around themselves of pure negative energy, appearing like an afterimage when they move. \n\n&gt;Can a vampire be a good person?\n\nSure, there's nothing stopping them. In most cases the path of vampirism isn't one that good people choose, and given the resources and work involved in turning it is always a conscious choice.

The Corsair's valley doesn't really have vampires, but there does exist a spiritual society within the Ganna city elite who regularly feed on human blood and flesh. The tribal peoples of the flatlands outside Ganna see them as vampiric and demonic, and the stories most likely get to them through escaped slaves from within the city. The cannibal society of The Blood Dancers is my industrial fantasy analogue to vampires, so they'll have to do:\n\n* Blood requirement: The elite society of Blood Dancers emerged from the idea that Ganna and the Iron empire's other metropolises are incredibly malnourished. It is also true that the stack cities are severely *overpopulated*. An elite club from the city's highest levels (literally) emerged from the suggestion that both problems could be solved at once. So they don't *need* to consume human blood, they *want* to. \n\n* Craving type: Blood Dancers are generally in the highest of social strata, causing their activities to be easily funded and organized. This is convenient due to the highly addictive nature of human flesh. Withdrawals can be intense, but Blood Dancers rarely experience symptoms, as they often have a whole district of slumdogs within their hungry gaze. Pork has been known to taste very similarly to manflesh, and can hold off cravings for a short while. \n\n* Conversion: The Blood Dance in question is a stomping, howling group dance, where members don devilish masks and mutilate a sacrifical human, flaying them alive and feeding their raw flesh to the audience. Most Blood Dancers preform their first ritual at a very young age. It spreads like a religion, with wealthy children attending events and receiving blood soaked brainwashing. By the time they're adults, their meat diet is almost exclusively human, and their friends and family tend to all be Blood Dancers themselves. The oldest families have their own dances and secret blood halls, scattered around the penthouses of Ganna. \n\n* Morality shifts: If one is not already severely psychopathic, participating in a blood dance pretty much seals the deal, especially if you are young and don't know any better. Children of Blood Dancers live very organized and planned lives, receiving world class education and inheriting massive sums of money. A massive secret society with a dress and diet code tends to make one a bit of an elitist. \n\n* Super powers: The social elite already have a certain level of power, but Blood dancers have the advantage of fear. They are secretive, quiet, and incredibly driven, causing many companies to desire having a few in their management. The status of a Blood Dancer spreads to their environment, and who doesn't want a classy cannibal on their team?\n\n* Weaknesses: Social isolation. They've lived their whole lives on the literal top of a neon metropolis, in a world where siege can happen at any moment, and where the city walls are half a kilometre thick for a reason. They thrive in the ultra-urban realm of their birth, but are found almost exclusively in Ganna, and rarely stray from a single block. \n\n* Appearances: Being Ganna natives, they all tend to be tall, raven haired and caramel skinned with very pronounced bone structure. It is not very easy to tell them apart physically, but blood dancers often wear very formal robes, shiny black ornamentation and extensive tattoos of their gory activities. Sunken eyes and pale complexion are common, but due to long ritualistic nights and religious sleep deprivation.

The Corsair&amp;#39;s valley doesn&amp;#39;t really have vampires, but there does exist a spiritual society within the Ganna city elite who regularly feed on human blood and flesh. The tribal peoples of the flatlands outside Ganna see them as vampiric and demonic, and the stories most likely get to them through escaped slaves from within the city. The cannibal society of The Blood Dancers is my industrial fantasy analogue to vampires, so they&amp;#39;ll have to do:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood requirement: The elite society of Blood Dancers emerged from the idea that Ganna and the Iron empire&amp;#39;s other metropolises are incredibly malnourished. It is also true that the stack cities are severely &lt;em&gt;overpopulated&lt;/em&gt;. An elite club from the city&amp;#39;s highest levels (literally) emerged from the suggestion that both problems could be solved at once. So they don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to consume human blood, they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craving type: Blood Dancers are generally in the highest of social strata, causing their activities to be easily funded and organized. This is convenient due to the highly addictive nature of human flesh. Withdrawals can be intense, but Blood Dancers rarely experience symptoms, as they often have a whole district of slumdogs within their hungry gaze. Pork has been known to taste very similarly to manflesh, and can hold off cravings for a short while. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversion: The Blood Dance in question is a stomping, howling group dance, where members don devilish masks and mutilate a sacrifical human, flaying them alive and feeding their raw flesh to the audience. Most Blood Dancers preform their first ritual at a very young age. It spreads like a religion, with wealthy children attending events and receiving blood soaked brainwashing. By the time they&amp;#39;re adults, their meat diet is almost exclusively human, and their friends and family tend to all be Blood Dancers themselves. The oldest families have their own dances and secret blood halls, scattered around the penthouses of Ganna. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morality shifts: If one is not already severely psychopathic, participating in a blood dance pretty much seals the deal, especially if you are young and don&amp;#39;t know any better. Children of Blood Dancers live very organized and planned lives, receiving world class education and inheriting massive sums of money. A massive secret society with a dress and diet code tends to make one a bit of an elitist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Super powers: The social elite already have a certain level of power, but Blood dancers have the advantage of fear. They are secretive, quiet, and incredibly driven, causing many companies to desire having a few in their management. The status of a Blood Dancer spreads to their environment, and who doesn&amp;#39;t want a classy cannibal on their team?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weaknesses: Social isolation. They&amp;#39;ve lived their whole lives on the literal top of a neon metropolis, in a world where siege can happen at any moment, and where the city walls are half a kilometre thick for a reason. They thrive in the ultra-urban realm of their birth, but are found almost exclusively in Ganna, and rarely stray from a single block. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appearances: Being Ganna natives, they all tend to be tall, raven haired and caramel skinned with very pronounced bone structure. It is not very easy to tell them apart physically, but blood dancers often wear very formal robes, shiny black ornamentation and extensive tattoos of their gory activities. Sunken eyes and pale complexion are common, but due to long ritualistic nights and religious sleep deprivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dg9j40o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492223091.0, "created_utc": 1492194291.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dvbq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ko17", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JesterOfDestiny", "parent_id": "t3_65dvbq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Blood requirement\n\nThey need it.

It's unknown if they die of old age as there's been no record of a Pureblood Vampire ever doing so. Greater Vampires are created when a Pureblood Vampire drinks about two-thirds of their victim's blood and then the victim feasts on the vampire's own blood.

The vampire prime is a true monstrosity - a hulking, deranged monster with large wings, an almost bat-like face and long claws and fangs. Higher vampires are usually very human-looking, if somewhat pale and &amp;quot;dry&amp;quot; looking. Lower level vampire have a descending hierarchy between the still rather human middle vampires, emaciated servitor vampires and skulking, bestial nosferatus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; vampire is either pretending or still fresh enough to not have settled into it yet. They may be lying to themselves as well and actually doing good deeds, but deep inside they&amp;#39;re doing it just to look better than you, &amp;quot;more than human&amp;quot;. And they still need that blood, which they can&amp;#39;t get without killing people. It&amp;#39;s the transfer of life that feeds them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can be friendly just fine, though. A powerful faction of vampire monarchs rules a world on the other side of the known space and enjoys friendly relations with galactic powers.

The Empire is about 95% human however, so if they were completely evil and hated they would have gone extinct a long time ago. \n\n**Blood Requirement:** They need to feed about once a month or so. They don't have to kill people. Rat's blood also can work as a lower quality substitute, some vampires breed rats for the same purpose (and \"rat eater\" is a vampire insult). \n\n**Craving type:** They straight up die if they don't get blood long enough, so it's the same sort of craving you or I would have for food.\n\n**Conversion:** Vampires are their own separate race, it's not possible to turn into a true vampire. I do have the concept of a \"lesser vampire\", essentially a human who has drank vampire blood and temporarily gained some of their powers (and weaknesses).\n\n**Morality shifts:** There's no inherent morality shift since vampires are their own race. Since they're immortal and prey on humans, they almost always look down on people. This can range from a patronizing sense of care to \"humans are nothing more than cattle\". They also tend to love power and try to install themselves as rulers or nobility.\n\n**Super powers:** \n\n* Immortality - vampires stop aging after about 30 but can still die from injury or disease.\n* Healing factor - vampires are very hard to kill, they can generally shrug off being shot, stabbed, hit by a car, falling off a building, diseases that will kill most men, etc. If they take enough injury they go into a comatose state for a while, giving the misconception that they're undead.\n* Super strength and speed - the average vampire is about Olympic athlete levels of strong and fast.\n* Night vision - Vampires have good nocturnal eyesight but they have poor color vision. Probably why they usually wear black and other muted colors.\n* Witchcraft - not inherent, but vampires are more commonly born with the ability to use magic compared to humans and are stronger witches.\n* Magical radiation - The idea with my setting is that vampires are a magical race that passively emit and aura of magical power. This has the effect of slowly warping and twisting the areas they live in (so everything ends up looking like Transylvania), and mutating humans as well.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:** \n\n* Sunlight - Causes severe fatigue and first degree burns. Also weakens their healing factor, making them much easier to kill in the daytime. A few hours of direct exposure will kill them.\n* Silver and garlic - Severely allergic, will cause anaphylactic shock.\n* Fire - Dampens their healing factor enough to kill them.\n* Decapitation or destruction of the heart - In fairness this will kill everything. \n\n**Appearances:** they're basically more ethereal looking humans, with pale skin, pointy ears and fangs, uniformly black hair, and amber or red eyes. They also have a pair of bat-like wings sprouting out of their back. They're also *all* female.

See, a vampire doesn't need *blood*, so much as the anima--or life force--found in blood. So taking blood from a pig or a cow is less effective than taking blood from a human is less effective than taking blood from a dragon or a fey. Of course, pigs are also less dangerous than humans, and humans are much less dangerous than dragons, so it's a catch-22.\n\nIn most cases, a vampire only needs to feed about once a week, but they need to take enough blood from the victim that their victim may very well be at risk of dying, which is why most vampires feed in smaller amounts more frequently. This keeps their cravings down and gives them more leeway--an unsuccessful night isn't going to be a threat.\n\n**Craving type**\n\nIt's straight up hunger. A vampire is effectively a walking corpse, and thus cannot get anima from the act of living *because they aren't alive.* So a vampire has to get their required anima through other means--specifically the blood of other living beings. It's basically like a nagging hunger--food and drink don't have the same invigorating properties that they had before, there's something missing in it. Blood, on the other hand, fills this empty place in the vampire, making them feel alive again.\n\nOf course, this feeling can be addictive, so while the basic drive might be hunger, vampires can begin to crave to the feeling they get when full on anima--the vigour of life, forgetting for a moment that one is an abomination against nature itself. So it's actually rather common for vampires to feed when they don't have to simply to get a fix. However, there are some vamps who will try to keep a firm hold on their morality and cravings, and through discipline, resist any addicting properties.\n\n**Conversion**\n\nVampirism is a curse, though its exact origins have been lost to history. It's known it first emerged in the Middle East some 10,000 years ago, and spread throughout the early city states of Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and India. Some claim it was a gift bestowed upon a powerful king who made a deal with Death himself, others claim it was created a mage trying to extend his life through grand blood magic rites, others believe it is the result of a demonic bargain, others say that the legendary Lilith spawned the first vampires, and still others argue it was a curse bestowed upon Cain for the first murder.\n\nRegardless of its exact origins, vampirism is spread when a vampire drains the anima of a human, leaving behind an empty, hungering void where their spirit once resided. Note that anima is separate from blood, so a vampire doesn't have to drink a body dry as some legends state--but in most cases, a small bite usually isn't enough to fully drain someone's anima either. And again, it depends on the person--a mage has more anima than a normal human unless they've tapped themselves out during casting, while a psychic is a veritable fountain of anima that would take *dozens* of vampires to run dry. It's usually hard to get a read on how much anima a human has, so most vampires keep their feeding limited because the last thing most of them want is for vamps to pop up--and thus have more mouths to feed. Accidental conversions are still a risk, but most new vampires were singled out and purposely transformed. \n\n**Morality Shifts**\n\nA vampire loses their animating spirit, not their soul, and therefor they remain the same person they were before their death and rebirth. However, given one's new hungers and predatory instincts--usually accompanied by the revelation that vampires aren't a myth and that everything you thought about the world was wrong--it's typical for new vampires to undergo a psychotic break: becoming incredibly depressed, developing a new personality to cope, creating a new identity, becoming irrational and violent, hallucinating, and the like. The person who emerges from this could be incredibly different from who they were before--but this has nothing to do with the curse of vampirism and everything to do with humans trying to come to terms with their new existence. And it doesn't happen to everyone--strong willed individuals may be able to fight their way through the rebirth without cracking.\n\nVampire society usually takes these new vampires and offers them support and allies during the first few trying weeks and months of their unlife--typically including indoctrination into vampiric customs and beliefs. Most vampires, after all, view themselves as the epitome of undeath, and their transformation not as curse but a blessing--they're better now than they were before. Stronger. Faster. Smarter. Immune to disease and the rigours of aging. Most vampires view themselves as the true masters of the night, and believe that they *deserve* to be worshipped, feared, and followed by mankind--the cattle that feeds them. While this might sound harsh, it's a way to cope with the transformation: you're better than you were before, you have more friends and power now, and those you feed on aren't *really* like you anymore, right?\n\n**Super powers**\n\nAs mentioned, vampires have increased speed, stamina, strength, and an immunity to most diseases, illnesses, and aging. And that's just your standard vampire offerings. See, vampires are tied to blood, blood has a lot of anima, and anima is the stuff of magic. So basically, vampires are just brimming with magical energy. Indeed, most vampires learn how to harness the anima in blood towards many fantastic, supernatural ends, from enhancing their resilience and keeping their corpses moving, to controlling the emotions and thoughts of others, to shapeshifting, to spreading disease, to the powers of foresight and prophecy. With blood magic, vampires can control the bodies, animate corpses, read thoughts, inflict curses and disease, and assume the forms of bats, wolves, jaguars, or mist. And that's just the start--blood magic is incredibly diverse in its powers, and few know blood magic better than vampires.\n\nIndeed, the whole thing about new vampires being enslaved to the one who turned them? Well, that's partially true, because of blood resonance. It's incredibly easy for a vampire to influence the thoughts and actions of one who they recently drank from. Why most victims either can't remember a feeding, or remember only positive things about it. Mind control is wickedly insidious, after all.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\nWith great power comes great weaknesses. And vampires have a slough of weaknesses. Most well-known is their weakness to holy objects and symbols--it's not the object itself, of course, but the wielder's faith empowering them to resist the vampire. Faith is an incredible defence, and works not only against vampires, but also spirits, ghosts, horrors, fey, jinn, and demons. And while holy water and crosses might common objects of faith in the West, in other regions, it may be a holy book, or a prayer, or a sacred place (Mecca has been free of vampires for millenia now). Heck, even faith in non-religious things, such as faith in your country, or your ideology, or your friends could be enough to work. There's been recorded cases of vampires being driven back by hammers-and-sickles, so if you ever wonder where the whole \"vampires are weak to garlic\" comes from, just remember that people can believe in the power of anything. \n\nOther than that, vampires are incredibly photosensitive and will find themselves burning to death under the glare of the sun or another bright source of UV radiation. While it's not immediately fatal to most vampires, it is incredibly painful, with their skin blistering and peeling away in minutes, and can usually kill a vampire in under an hour. Thus, most vampires restrict their activity to the nighttime hours, and if they must go out in the sun, they go out wearing heavy clothes with hoods, gloves, and gasmasks--letting no light through at all. It's a bit of a give away, honestly, and most vampires would much prefer to travel around in limos with tinted windows from one indoor parking garage to another. \n\nAnother common weakness is that vampires cannot enter a private dwelling if not invited in. Of course, most modern folks believe this applies to any enclosed location, but that's an incredibly common misconception: if it's a place where an open invitation is implied, like a restaurant, a courthouse, a mall, or even a church, a vampire can enter at will. Also, vampires cannot cross running water, but that's physically cross--standing at the other side of a river only works if the vampire can't find a bridge.\n\nAlso, steaks to the heart aren't fatal, but the original myths were right in that it bound a vampire and prevented them from moving or acting. So it's an effective way of binding them if you can't permanently kill them for whatever reason.\n\n**Appearances**\n\nA vampire's appearance depends on how recently they've fed, and how full on life and anima they are. A satiated vampire can appear almost human--skin a bit paler, eyes a bit dull, teeth a bit more pointed, skin a bit colder, but easily passable as human. Indeed, the transformation into a vampire usually makes one appear *healthier* than they were in life: a bit younger, stronger, more attractive in many regards. A hungry vampire, on the other hand, appears almost like a gaunt, feral beast with a maw full of fangs, fingers twisted into vicious claws, clammy skin clinging close to the bone, thinning hair, shallow cheeks and eyes blazing with unholy fire. Its not pleasant, and most vampires hate being seen in such a vulgar state. Interestingly, vampires who feed primarily on animals will often find themselves taking the traits of the animals whose blood they consume, appearing monstrous despite arguably being more humane.", "edited": 1492239282.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood Requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, it all depends on how active the vampire is, and how much of their own power they&amp;#39;re using, and what they&amp;#39;re feeding on. See, a vampire doesn&amp;#39;t need &lt;em&gt;blood&lt;/em&gt;, so much as the anima--or life force--found in blood. So taking blood from a pig or a cow is less effective than taking blood from a human is less effective than taking blood from a dragon or a fey. Of course, pigs are also less dangerous than humans, and humans are much less dangerous than dragons, so it&amp;#39;s a catch-22.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In most cases, a vampire only needs to feed about once a week, but they need to take enough blood from the victim that their victim may very well be at risk of dying, which is why most vampires feed in smaller amounts more frequently. This keeps their cravings down and gives them more leeway--an unsuccessful night isn&amp;#39;t going to be a threat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craving type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s straight up hunger. A vampire is effectively a walking corpse, and thus cannot get anima from the act of living &lt;em&gt;because they aren&amp;#39;t alive.&lt;/em&gt; So a vampire has to get their required anima through other means--specifically the blood of other living beings. It&amp;#39;s basically like a nagging hunger--food and drink don&amp;#39;t have the same invigorating properties that they had before, there&amp;#39;s something missing in it. Blood, on the other hand, fills this empty place in the vampire, making them feel alive again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, this feeling can be addictive, so while the basic drive might be hunger, vampires can begin to crave to the feeling they get when full on anima--the vigour of life, forgetting for a moment that one is an abomination against nature itself. So it&amp;#39;s actually rather common for vampires to feed when they don&amp;#39;t have to simply to get a fix. However, there are some vamps who will try to keep a firm hold on their morality and cravings, and through discipline, resist any addicting properties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vampirism is a curse, though its exact origins have been lost to history. It&amp;#39;s known it first emerged in the Middle East some 10,000 years ago, and spread throughout the early city states of Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and India. Some claim it was a gift bestowed upon a powerful king who made a deal with Death himself, others claim it was created a mage trying to extend his life through grand blood magic rites, others believe it is the result of a demonic bargain, others say that the legendary Lilith spawned the first vampires, and still others argue it was a curse bestowed upon Cain for the first murder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of its exact origins, vampirism is spread when a vampire drains the anima of a human, leaving behind an empty, hungering void where their spirit once resided. Note that anima is separate from blood, so a vampire doesn&amp;#39;t have to drink a body dry as some legends state--but in most cases, a small bite usually isn&amp;#39;t enough to fully drain someone&amp;#39;s anima either. And again, it depends on the person--a mage has more anima than a normal human unless they&amp;#39;ve tapped themselves out during casting, while a psychic is a veritable fountain of anima that would take &lt;em&gt;dozens&lt;/em&gt; of vampires to run dry. It&amp;#39;s usually hard to get a read on how much anima a human has, so most vampires keep their feeding limited because the last thing most of them want is for vamps to pop up--and thus have more mouths to feed. Accidental conversions are still a risk, but most new vampires were singled out and purposely transformed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morality Shifts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A vampire loses their animating spirit, not their soul, and therefor they remain the same person they were before their death and rebirth. However, given one&amp;#39;s new hungers and predatory instincts--usually accompanied by the revelation that vampires aren&amp;#39;t a myth and that everything you thought about the world was wrong--it&amp;#39;s typical for new vampires to undergo a psychotic break: becoming incredibly depressed, developing a new personality to cope, creating a new identity, becoming irrational and violent, hallucinating, and the like. The person who emerges from this could be incredibly different from who they were before--but this has nothing to do with the curse of vampirism and everything to do with humans trying to come to terms with their new existence. And it doesn&amp;#39;t happen to everyone--strong willed individuals may be able to fight their way through the rebirth without cracking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vampire society usually takes these new vampires and offers them support and allies during the first few trying weeks and months of their unlife--typically including indoctrination into vampiric customs and beliefs. Most vampires, after all, view themselves as the epitome of undeath, and their transformation not as curse but a blessing--they&amp;#39;re better now than they were before. Stronger. Faster. Smarter. Immune to disease and the rigours of aging. Most vampires view themselves as the true masters of the night, and believe that they &lt;em&gt;deserve&lt;/em&gt; to be worshipped, feared, and followed by mankind--the cattle that feeds them. While this might sound harsh, it&amp;#39;s a way to cope with the transformation: you&amp;#39;re better than you were before, you have more friends and power now, and those you feed on aren&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like you anymore, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super powers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, vampires have increased speed, stamina, strength, and an immunity to most diseases, illnesses, and aging. And that&amp;#39;s just your standard vampire offerings. See, vampires are tied to blood, blood has a lot of anima, and anima is the stuff of magic. So basically, vampires are just brimming with magical energy. Indeed, most vampires learn how to harness the anima in blood towards many fantastic, supernatural ends, from enhancing their resilience and keeping their corpses moving, to controlling the emotions and thoughts of others, to shapeshifting, to spreading disease, to the powers of foresight and prophecy. With blood magic, vampires can control the bodies, animate corpses, read thoughts, inflict curses and disease, and assume the forms of bats, wolves, jaguars, or mist. And that&amp;#39;s just the start--blood magic is incredibly diverse in its powers, and few know blood magic better than vampires.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the whole thing about new vampires being enslaved to the one who turned them? Well, that&amp;#39;s partially true, because of blood resonance. It&amp;#39;s incredibly easy for a vampire to influence the thoughts and actions of one who they recently drank from. Why most victims either can&amp;#39;t remember a feeding, or remember only positive things about it. Mind control is wickedly insidious, after all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With great power comes great weaknesses. And vampires have a slough of weaknesses. Most well-known is their weakness to holy objects and symbols--it&amp;#39;s not the object itself, of course, but the wielder&amp;#39;s faith empowering them to resist the vampire. Faith is an incredible defence, and works not only against vampires, but also spirits, ghosts, horrors, fey, jinn, and demons. And while holy water and crosses might common objects of faith in the West, in other regions, it may be a holy book, or a prayer, or a sacred place (Mecca has been free of vampires for millenia now). Heck, even faith in non-religious things, such as faith in your country, or your ideology, or your friends could be enough to work. There&amp;#39;s been recorded cases of vampires being driven back by hammers-and-sickles, so if you ever wonder where the whole &amp;quot;vampires are weak to garlic&amp;quot; comes from, just remember that people can believe in the power of anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than that, vampires are incredibly photosensitive and will find themselves burning to death under the glare of the sun or another bright source of UV radiation. While it&amp;#39;s not immediately fatal to most vampires, it is incredibly painful, with their skin blistering and peeling away in minutes, and can usually kill a vampire in under an hour. Thus, most vampires restrict their activity to the nighttime hours, and if they must go out in the sun, they go out wearing heavy clothes with hoods, gloves, and gasmasks--letting no light through at all. It&amp;#39;s a bit of a give away, honestly, and most vampires would much prefer to travel around in limos with tinted windows from one indoor parking garage to another. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another common weakness is that vampires cannot enter a private dwelling if not invited in. Of course, most modern folks believe this applies to any enclosed location, but that&amp;#39;s an incredibly common misconception: if it&amp;#39;s a place where an open invitation is implied, like a restaurant, a courthouse, a mall, or even a church, a vampire can enter at will. Also, vampires cannot cross running water, but that&amp;#39;s physically cross--standing at the other side of a river only works if the vampire can&amp;#39;t find a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, steaks to the heart aren&amp;#39;t fatal, but the original myths were right in that it bound a vampire and prevented them from moving or acting. So it&amp;#39;s an effective way of binding them if you can&amp;#39;t permanently kill them for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A vampire&amp;#39;s appearance depends on how recently they&amp;#39;ve fed, and how full on life and anima they are. A satiated vampire can appear almost human--skin a bit paler, eyes a bit dull, teeth a bit more pointed, skin a bit colder, but easily passable as human. Indeed, the transformation into a vampire usually makes one appear &lt;em&gt;healthier&lt;/em&gt; than they were in life: a bit younger, stronger, more attractive in many regards. A hungry vampire, on the other hand, appears almost like a gaunt, feral beast with a maw full of fangs, fingers twisted into vicious claws, clammy skin clinging close to the bone, thinning hair, shallow cheeks and eyes blazing with unholy fire. Its not pleasant, and most vampires hate being seen in such a vulgar state. Interestingly, vampires who feed primarily on animals will often find themselves taking the traits of the animals whose blood they consume, appearing monstrous despite arguably being more humane.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgaebck", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492267824.0, "created_utc": 1492239024.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dvbq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbgde9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SpaceCrom", "parent_id": "t3_65dvbq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Conversion: Blood magic is fairly well known and until recently commonly used.
