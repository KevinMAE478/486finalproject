These elements are supposed to remain in the Spirit World, but they want to enter the Physical World. Some smaller spirits can do, but it is more difficult for the more powerful to do so.

Here they witnessed someone eat a supposedly mythical Golden Apple and transform into a fearsome being of great power and destruction, into a being equal to those worshipped all around the world, into a god.
