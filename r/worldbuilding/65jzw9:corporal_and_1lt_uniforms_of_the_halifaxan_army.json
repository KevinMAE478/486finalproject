My set up is pretty expensive, and not necessarily ideal for anything other than drawing as a hobby every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started on paper though, with a pencil or micron pen. Ultimately, the best medium is the one that feels comfortable to you and is easy for you to pick up and work with when the desire strikes you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also yes, a stylus is necessary I would say, and I like the Apple Pencil a lot. There are other styluses out there for apple products though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgbcye8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492328585.0, "created_utc": 1492299785.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbcr8c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CrookedKeith", "parent_id": "t1_dgbckor", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is the Apple Pencil necessary and could I use my iPhone?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the Apple Pencil necessary and could I use my iPhone?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgbcr8c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492328307.0, "created_utc": 1492299507.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbckor", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LaZspy", "parent_id": "t1_dgbcb5m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I make them on the app Procreate with an iPad Pro and an Apple Pencil.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I make them on the app Procreate with an iPad Pro and an Apple Pencil.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgbckor", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492328054.0, "created_utc": 1492299254.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbcb5m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CrookedKeith", "parent_id": "t3_65jzw9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Quick question: how do you make this pictures?
