Turns out modern and fantasy mixing is harder than it looks, especially when the most writing you have ever done was a technical report. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for dumb things I&amp;#39;ve added, idk. Garter Nagas are ultimately just an excuse for me to add something silly and light hearted to a fairly depressing world (they are small, harmless, and just go around hugging things and chilling on hot objects). They aren&amp;#39;t really that realistic (an overly friendly creature is just going to get eaten by predators, and nagas do not reproduce quickly), and they aren&amp;#39;t plot central (the only way you would be introduced to them is an MC explaining why he doesn&amp;#39;t like snakes). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also a gimmick creature (yet another snake, idk if this is a pattern yet) called &amp;quot;The Eater of Worlds&amp;quot; but also known as &amp;quot;Private Plop&amp;quot;. Its an immortal god snake whose purpose is to consume the universe, ensuring the cycle of life and death continues. However, that won&amp;#39;t happen for a good long time so it just spends its days as the mascot of one of the few Arzian Elite armor divisions left. You&amp;#39;ll find it being lazy and eating ridiculous amounts of mice and treats that the tankers give it. I would consider this my spirit animal, if I had one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aer Terram doesn&amp;#39;t have any gimmicks yet because I haven&amp;#39;t added them. Rest assured, there will be dumb gimmicks and possibly some Warthunder references if I can squeeze them in. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgbrihr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492351566.0, "created_utc": 1492322766.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ncjv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ncjv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ncjv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbrnhr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wille179", "parent_id": "t1_dgbr943", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I haven't been to this sub in *months.* It was a meme even back then. \n\nThis is like r/hfy with Pancakes or Gold and Virgins.
