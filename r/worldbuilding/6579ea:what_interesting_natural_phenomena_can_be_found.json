The region where this effect is most visible is called &amp;quot;Veltheim&amp;quot;, meaning &amp;quot;Overturned Land&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most areas of the world are close enough to not enter the range of Veltheim&amp;#39;s gravity, so the effect of Veltheim&amp;#39;s gravity is mostly seen in the ocean, where the water flows sideways. This prevents people from sailing to far from shore, because it causes intense currents and waves that make maritime travel too difficult. Out into the ocean far enough, the water flows so intensely that to sail through it would be as difficult as sailing up a waterfall. It&amp;#39;s just not possible via boat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One noteable landlocked area with this quality is the Desert of Ansai-Bo, a branch of dry, arid land far from the world&amp;#39;s center. Water tends not to stay here when it flows ashore, because as it evaporates and re-precipitates, it travels too far inland to remain. Thus, the Desert of Ansai-Bo is a vast desert with sands that constantly shift and curl, with the addition of more loose sand as the distant peninsula erodes from the intense waves. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dg8rnfm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492173526.0, "created_utc": 1492144726.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6579ea", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg86l6x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "universal_stone", "parent_id": "t3_6579ea", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "**Rift Typhoons** happen when Rift energies try and become a form of primitive matter, causing wispy gray clouds and odd metallic balls to form due to gravity affecting said newly formed matter.
