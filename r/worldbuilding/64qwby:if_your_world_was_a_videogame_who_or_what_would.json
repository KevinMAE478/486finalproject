And Vassar had an idea.\n\nThe other Gods had died before the world was complete, so there were what could loosely be described as holes in the separation between what was inside the world, and what was outside.  Velir could fit through them, but Vassar was far too great.  But in intelligent life he saw an opportunity.  It would contort a portion of itself though one of these holes, and use it to take possession of a mortal.  Strictly speaking, Vassar was not suited to direct control of something so lesser in scale to his whole self as a mortal body, but he was able to warp the mortal's mind to make them translate Vassar's desires into physical action.  And thus did the first **Enthroned Shadow** come to be.\n\nAnd what did Vassar desire?  He wasn't sure at first.  Part of him wanted to tear the world asunder, but he knew that wouldn't return the other Gods of the Primieval to life.  What's more, he found himself rather taken with their creation, now seeing it up close.  So, he resolved, after some deliberation, to place the world under his control, and that he would be its steward.\n\nThe Enthroned Shadow approached Velir, and told him of Vassar's plan.  Velir was staunchly opposed, believing that Vassar, having not been involved with the creation world, was unfit to properly oversee it, to say nothing f the fact that he wasn't sure the world needed a Steward in the first place.\n\nThey parted in anger.\n\nThe Enthroned Shadow would return, and it would press Vassar's claim by force.  Velir gathered a coalition of mortals and Lesser Gods\u2014mortals which had taken up portions of he power of the dead gods, becoming something else entirely\u2014to oppose him.  The fighting was long and hard, but the Enthroned Shadow was eventually destroyed, scattering specks of Vassar's essence across the sky to create the stars.  As the Enthroned Shadow was connected to Vassar, these bits of essence were still connect to it, and in sleep mortal minds can wander along the path the form to journey outside the world, where they dream.\n\nBut that wasn't the end.  Vassar, after all, was still alive, and though he was dazed his desire was undiminished.
