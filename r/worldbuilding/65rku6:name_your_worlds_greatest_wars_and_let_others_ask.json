The USA is still without an official Pantheon, but millions of her people worship foreign Pantheons, and native Americans in the west are trying to bring about he rise of their own local weak Pantheons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgcxz8r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492423338.0, "created_utc": 1492394538.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcwyid", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Runnermann", "parent_id": "t1_dgcn1zu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Tell me more!

Republican Union of Earth pulled what is know as the \"Black Deception of the Earthlings\" against the First Alexandrian Empire. For five years prior the Republic and Empire were in the process of \"integrating-\" a ploy used by the oligarchs of the Republic to size up the Empire before trying to unseat them as the dominant power. \n\nFinally on Imperial New Years of 405, what was supposed to be the official treaty ratification became a surprise attack that sent the Empire reeling. Four members of the Council of Race, 62 Imperial Senators, 17 Imperial administrators were killed; but more importantly the Emperor escaped into FTL and vanished without a trace. With the capital of Alexandria abandoned and the Empire's forces spread too far, the Republic took opportunity of a three-month window to push an insidious strategy. The Republic laid siege to three home worlds and extracted treaties from them removing their worlds, and their race, from the Empire. The capitalists of the Zygoreen Hegemony pushed their exit from the Empire, but remained neutral in affairs to prevent internal strife. By the time the Empire had consolidated its' forces, four quadrants had seceded from the Empire, either by force or by choice. \n\nIt was not until the next decade in 415 that the Republic began to make major gains again. The Caastoraan worlds, where most of the Imperial ground forces came from had been devastated by bombardments and plague.

For five years prior the Republic and Empire were in the process of &amp;quot;integrating-&amp;quot; a ploy used by the oligarchs of the Republic to size up the Empire before trying to unseat them as the dominant power. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally on Imperial New Years of 405, what was supposed to be the official treaty ratification became a surprise attack that sent the Empire reeling. Four members of the Council of Race, 62 Imperial Senators, 17 Imperial administrators were killed; but more importantly the Emperor escaped into FTL and vanished without a trace. With the capital of Alexandria abandoned and the Empire&amp;#39;s forces spread too far, the Republic took opportunity of a three-month window to push an insidious strategy. The Republic laid siege to three home worlds and extracted treaties from them removing their worlds, and their race, from the Empire. The capitalists of the Zygoreen Hegemony pushed their exit from the Empire, but remained neutral in affairs to prevent internal strife. By the time the Empire had consolidated its&amp;#39; forces, four quadrants had seceded from the Empire, either by force or by choice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was not until the next decade in 415 that the Republic began to make major gains again.

When Overlord Voler ascended to the throne of Serpher, his first few actions as Overlord included breaking the Niyilos-Serpher Treaty, the Renhald Promise, and enslaving most of Ogtargal. This caused mounting tensions in Serpher. When Voler was threatend with assassination, he split Serpher into several factions. These factions fought amongst each other. Voler continued to enslave and conquer the lands to the north, reaching Yuipik. He was winning, before Lithanandria and Surlinden joined the fight against him. Voler, however, managed to convince all the nations that Serpher wasn't split into factions. This caused even more fighting. It ended with the 3rd Awakening. During the Battle of Hurn Field, every Celestial Pillar exploded, sending destructive magic swarming through Aethin. Voler died instantly. The aftermath was anarchy, complete anarchy everywhere but Renhald, who keep managing to pull themselves together somehow.\n\nGet Out of Our Country! is also known as Our Rebellion to the Lithanandrian's. After the War of Sorrow, Surlinden was among the first to recover from anarchy. The ruler at the time saw an opportunity to expand Surlinden's borders.

When Overlord Voler ascended to the throne of Serpher, his first few actions as Overlord included breaking the Niyilos-Serpher Treaty, the Renhald Promise, and enslaving most of Ogtargal. This caused mounting tensions in Serpher. When Voler was threatend with assassination, he split Serpher into several factions. These factions fought amongst each other. Voler continued to enslave and conquer the lands to the north, reaching Yuipik. He was winning, before Lithanandria and Surlinden joined the fight against him. Voler, however, managed to convince all the nations that Serpher wasn&amp;#39;t split into factions. This caused even more fighting. It ended with the 3rd Awakening. During the Battle of Hurn Field, every Celestial Pillar exploded, sending destructive magic swarming through Aethin. Voler died instantly. The aftermath was anarchy, complete anarchy everywhere but Renhald, who keep managing to pull themselves together somehow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get Out of Our Country! is also known as Our Rebellion to the Lithanandrian&amp;#39;s.

It was the first time most of the region was involved in belligerent actions, and it came down to who would get to rule the lands which had, for the past millennium, been ruled by Elves. There had been minor wars of succession before, between different Elven Houses, but this was the first time a true usurper had claimed the throne. This is gonna be a bit long, and there is a TL;DR at the end.\n\nOn one side you have that usurper, Is'hal Na'amore, first of the House of Tar'nath, ruler of the city of Izt. The guy had been allowed by his mom to found his own House, and had been ruling Izt as her steward for some years before she let him go independent. During that time, he had been in talks with his new non-Elven neighbors: the Dwarves of the Rugell Holds to the northeast and the Lizardfolk of the Kharnfor Swamplands to the true east. Up until this point, the Elven regime's official stance on non-Elves was that they were inferior beings, since they had the misfortune of being conquered. Many non-Elves were servants, most were slaves, and a few races, like the Gnolls and Lizardfolk, were seen as unintelligent, brutish monsters. Is'hal was able to deal with the Lizardfolk by removing his mother's eastern garrison and allowing free (underground) trade, and he was able to get on the Rugell Clans' good side by hosting great feasts in Izt and inviting them. When no assassination attempts on clan heads came of these feasts, the Rugell Dwarves started calling him \u201cthe Good Elf\u201d, and later as \u201cthe Good King.\u201d He even oversaw the election of the Rugell Holds' first true Patriarch, Einar Frosthold, which unified all the Rugell Clans, though there is modern speculation that he did follow up on those fears of assassination on Einar's chief opponents.\n\nThe War of the Good King began with the First Seige of Hu'Avren, [which I actually wrote up a while ago here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/4zhevk/what_are_the_most_important_historical_events_in/d6vz5fd/) Is'hal stormed the capital with a mixed-race force, combining all three groups' military strengths, and invoked the ancient Rule of Conquest. This technically circumvented the hereditary pretenders of the former King, who weren't too happy about this. And so, our other major side in this war are the Sons of Wal'ren, Tar'fel and Eyn'hal. Throughout the decade the War of the Good King took, these were the major threats to Is'hal's new-found power. Where Tar'fel lead House Wal'ren's military from afar, Eyn'hal was in the trenches, fighting with the Loyalists in most of the major battles on the western front. Civilian casualties that would usually come about from pillaging and foraging were actually minimized, as most of the former populace of those lands had, the previous year, been ousted from their homes. There are many tales told of these battles, epic cavalry charges, duels between what passed as archmages at the time, and acts of valor, both by commanders and regular soldiers.\n\nHouse Wal'ren did not fight alone, however. They found an opportunistic ally in House Gwe'cal, whose lands lay to the south of both Hu'Avren and Izt. While they nominally supported Tar'fel Wal'ren as the true Elven King, once the west was won by Is'hal, they instead put forth their own chosen son, Lep'lam. This guy made no distinction between military and civilian targets, and whoever stood in his army's way was brutally slaughtered. This included the Good King's armies, random towns, and even passing merchants coming from the north. Anyone who was not already on Gwe'cal land was an enemy, unless they were a known messenger or they could prove they were of or from House Wal'ren. And even then, friendly fire was pretty common.\n\nIs'hal Na'amore would eventually defeat both House Wal'ren and House Gwe'cal, along with the many minor Houses which joined in on their side. Many Houses, including his mother's, did fight under his banner, but most of these were not focused on their military might. Instead, most were prone to the arts, crafts, and arcanic mysteries, and so most of Na'amore's fighting force came from his non-Elven allies. After a few battles won in the west, the Orcs joined in under the promise of being slaves no longer, and they were swiftly followed by the Goblins and Halflings under similar promises. Both House Wal'ren and House Gwe'cal failed to see any real benefit from setting their slaves free, and those they did have in the field served mainly as cannon-fodder.\n\nThe battles were, for the time, massive and ferocious, though after the First Seige of Hu'Avren, there are really only three of any note: The Battle at the Klend, the Burning of Hu'Kari, and the Spoiling of the Gwikalwood. The Battle at the Klend was the first major victory Is'hal's forces had against the Loyalists, and it lasted several days. The tide ebbed and flowed day-by-day, always ending with many dead and wounded on either side. On the final day, messengers were sent to meet on the banks of the Klend River, and it was agreed that the commanders of both armies should duel to avoid any further bloodshed. Eyn'hal Wal'ren of the Loyalists and Lar'hom Dal'rent, Is'hal's younger half-brother, marched out with their retinues, Eyn'hal wielding a shortbow, and Lar'hom wielding a spear. It was a frenzy of loosed arrows and near-misses, and several bystanders were maimed by errant arrows, but when Lar'hom finally closed the distance and drove his spear through Eyn'hal's chest, there was a quiet which had not been felt in all those days of fighting. Eyn'hal told Lar'hom that he was glad to die honorably, and his army surrendered as he bled out.\n\nThe Burning of Hu'kari was less noble of an affair, but it was the battle which ended the western campaign. Upon hearing of his brother's death, Tar'fel Wal'ren slew the family of a small, neutral Elven House, House Rul'det, and re-dubbed their ancestral hometown Hu'Kari, the Diamond Seat. It served as his new capital for the rest of the war, but, as he lacked the determination of his brother, Tar'fel immediately began to lose ground. When Is'hal's forces, now with the boon of hardy Orcs, marched to Hu'Kari, Tar'fel sent word that he had stores for several years. It was Halfling spies which told them otherwise, that the populace had already begun to starve, and his men restless. Dwarven hammers immediately went to work on the walls, and Hu'Kari fell in a week, the Orcs stampeding through the town, burning everything they could not kill, grab, or eat later. Lar'hom, the commander of this army, simply watched from a hill until the last embers burned themselves out, and Hu'Kari was utterly razed. To this day, no one dares settle or work that land.\n\nThe final battle of the war, the Battle of Dourfield, was an unimpressive, typical battle for the age, and it resulted in House Gwe'cal surrendering to Is'hal. Five years before, however, was the last major conflict of the War of the Good King, the Spoiling of the Gwikalwood. Is'hal had been having trouble securing his southern trade routes, even far from Gwe'cal land, and saw Lep'lam's army more as a roving band of thieves than any true threat to his power. They were persistent, though, and he sent his most trusted Lizardfolk commander, Valrost, to Gwe'cal lands to deal with them. In all likelihood, he probably thought Valrost would engage in a guerrilla campaign in the area, snipping away at House Gwe'cal's armies bit by bit until he could focus his forces southward. Valrost did not do this, because, while Lizardfolk are great guerrillas, they fight only for what they care about, and Valrost thought he knew what Lep'lam's closest possession was: the very land he had so willingly abandoned. Most of that land was taken up by one of the region's lushest forests, the Gwikalwood, where some say Elves first emerged. Valrost found secluded villages of Druids, sacked them, and then set fire to everything flammable. When the fire did not spread far enough, he ordered his men to set up wicker-man-esque bonfires in the middle of groves, surrounded by dry twigs and leaves. When those fires failed to prompt Lep'lam's retaliation, he made them bigger. All-in-all, half of the Gwikalwood had been charred away by the time Lep'lam's sister, Quo'sha, finally came to do battle with Valrost's group, having scrounged up every half-trained warrior she could find. When the battle began to go poorly for her makeshift army, she prayed to Obad-Hi, the Elven nature god, for the power to drive these serial arsonists from her land. Quo'sha's prayers were answered, she Ascended on the field of the battle, and with her new divine powers she caused Valrost's forces to rout, many becoming lost in the Gwikalwood's unburnt reaches, never to be recovered. Quo'sha became Ehl'ona, \u201cShe Who Hunts\u201d, and the Gwikalwood became known afterward as the Ehlonnawood.\n\nIs'hal Na'amore, the Good King, did defeat all of his opponents in the end, and his promise of a second, fairer Elven dominion did come to pass. Non-Elves were still not given all the rights they should have had (this would take several more centuries and another huge war), but they were no longer considered property or inferior. Three centuries later, Is'hal would die in a horse-riding accident, and no King or Queen of the Second Elven Kingdom ever tried to measure up to him. He took Hu'Avren, he held Hu'Avren, and, for the first time, he used the Throne as a uniting tool instead of a symbol of fear.\n\nTL;DR: Usurper takes a racist Elven Empire to make it less racist, enemies immediately crop up. He beats them, though, and both sides commit war-crimes, as is usual. In the end, usurper keeps the throne, attitudes start to change, and a goddess gets made.

Slave uprisings throughout the rest of the empire sowed terror in the elven nobility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Toymaker&amp;#39;s Rebellion was reviled as mobs of rampaging slaves throughout elven halls, but nevertheless marked the point where the elven stranglehold on Nemora was forever broken. For many long and bloody years, the Toymaker&amp;#39;s armies struggled against the numerous kingdoms still in thrall to elvenkind before finally emerging victorious at the Siege of Elyseii.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgd0z3d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492427541.0, "created_utc": 1492398741.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcy8tw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HaloedBane", "parent_id": "t1_dgcxt1s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wow, well what did the toy makers rebel against??", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, well what did the toy makers rebel against??&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgcy8tw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492423711.0, "created_utc": 1492394911.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcxt1s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeltaBravo831", "parent_id": "t3_65rku6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Toymaker's Rebellion", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Toymaker&amp;#39;s Rebellion&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgcxt1s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492423099.0, "created_utc": 1492394299.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rku6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcy4cn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EarlOfHembarg", "parent_id": "t3_65rku6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There's a few I've fleshed out, specifically for Humanity.\n\n* The War of Liberation\n\n* The War of Reclaimation\n\n* The War of Enforcement\n\n* The Scarlet War\n\n* The Twilight War\n\n* The Arctic War", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a few I&amp;#39;ve fleshed out, specifically for Humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The War of Liberation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The War of Reclaimation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The War of Enforcement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Scarlet War&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twilight War&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arctic War&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dgcy4cn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492423536.0, "created_utc": 1492394736.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd6n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rku6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcy7lm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HaloedBane", "parent_id": "t3_65rku6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "For Incudea, the most important wars of the space age are: the Unity War, the First Dolentian War, the Second Dolentian War, the Third Dolentian War.

The Quasari are a deeply religious race going through a secular revolution. The Quasarian Empire spans many planets and is one of the major power brokers of the galaxy.

They won the skirmish, capturing Hyranus' respect early on. He pleads the humans to join his cause as his forces are crushed. \n\nAs the rebellion gains force, humans see the benefits of a strong ally in Hyranus.
