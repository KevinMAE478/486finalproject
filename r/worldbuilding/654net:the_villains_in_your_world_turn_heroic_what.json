The Dalshi were making huge advances and pushed two council races out of most of their systems, and were threatening to displace a third. The refugee crisis alone was eating up a lot of the council's resources and the refugees came with frightful stories of the war. The Shale had little military to defend themselves, the Ids fleet was crippled, the Vrom were tired and without relief they were in a losing war of attrition, humanity wasn't around, the Chtoric fleet was divided shuttling medical aid to the front and trying change momentum of the war in space so they could relieve the Vrom. Har'hi fleets moving to fortify the systems behind the front so the Chtoric could have a safe haven to fall back to. As a last ditch effort to save her homeworld, the Shale counselor appealed to the Mawlaac for aid. The Representative of the Mawlaac responded that the only way to unite the Mawlaac to and get them to come around to the idea was promising another world for them to settle on without needed their mobility suits, and that if this happened the Mawlaac were fighting this war their way. Once the council made that promise, word spread quick and the warring familial groups temporarily put their differences aside to combat the Dalshi.\n\nThe outcome was, well disturbing. The Mawlaac fleets struck deep into the contested space. When they hit planets with large pockets of resistance (see insecurity), they bombarded the planet until its tectonic plates fractured. The dust clouds poisoned the air and choked the planet. Then they deployed their shock troops to hunt down remaining Dalshi until none remained. Their sent Dalshi fleets back to their ports with skeleton crews while most of the occupants lay dead or missing. Once they made planet fall on the Dalshi home-world, the Dalshi leadership tried to ask for peace. Instead the Mawlaac marched them out and broadcast their execution to every home.(The Dalshi leader was believed to be their immortal god.) Shortly after they left, returning to their home systems before devolving back into the war like election cycle their civilization uses. The whole thing has deniability so the counsel doesn't have its hands dirty and it looks like the Mawlaac acted on their own.  \n\nIt looks bad(cause it is) but no one was innocent in the Dawn war, and the outcome really reflects poorly for the Mawlaac, but that's when what happens when you act the 'bad guys' save the galaxy. Hey the Dalshi are recovering and are accepted(Because of the horrible treatment they received from the Mawlaac. A lot of people identified with it.) .

The Dalshi were making huge advances and pushed two council races out of most of their systems, and were threatening to displace a third. The refugee crisis alone was eating up a lot of the council&amp;#39;s resources and the refugees came with frightful stories of the war. The Shale had little military to defend themselves, the Ids fleet was crippled, the Vrom were tired and without relief they were in a losing war of attrition, humanity wasn&amp;#39;t around, the Chtoric fleet was divided shuttling medical aid to the front and trying change momentum of the war in space so they could relieve the Vrom. Har&amp;#39;hi fleets moving to fortify the systems behind the front so the Chtoric could have a safe haven to fall back to. As a last ditch effort to save her homeworld, the Shale counselor appealed to the Mawlaac for aid. The Representative of the Mawlaac responded that the only way to unite the Mawlaac to and get them to come around to the idea was promising another world for them to settle on without needed their mobility suits, and that if this happened the Mawlaac were fighting this war their way. Once the council made that promise, word spread quick and the warring familial groups temporarily put their differences aside to combat the Dalshi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The outcome was, well disturbing. The Mawlaac fleets struck deep into the contested space. When they hit planets with large pockets of resistance (see insecurity), they bombarded the planet until its tectonic plates fractured. The dust clouds poisoned the air and choked the planet. Then they deployed their shock troops to hunt down remaining Dalshi until none remained. Their sent Dalshi fleets back to their ports with skeleton crews while most of the occupants lay dead or missing. Once they made planet fall on the Dalshi home-world, the Dalshi leadership tried to ask for peace. Instead the Mawlaac marched them out and broadcast their execution to every home.(The Dalshi leader was believed to be their immortal god.) Shortly after they left, returning to their home systems before devolving back into the war like election cycle their civilization uses. The whole thing has deniability so the counsel doesn&amp;#39;t have its hands dirty and it looks like the Mawlaac acted on their own.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks bad(cause it is) but no one was innocent in the Dawn war, and the outcome really reflects poorly for the Mawlaac, but that&amp;#39;s when what happens when you act the &amp;#39;bad guys&amp;#39; save the galaxy. Hey the Dalshi are recovering and are accepted(Because of the horrible treatment they received from the Mawlaac. A lot of people identified with it.) . Their society chilled out and aren&amp;#39;t as warmongering as they use to be. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dg7my70", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123387.0, "created_utc": 1492094587.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7hnfm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "VolCatharsis", "parent_id": "t1_dg7hbnd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What are the kinds of things they would do if they were truly heroic?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the kinds of things they would do if they were truly heroic?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldbuilding", "name": "t1_dg7hnfm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492116415.0, "created_utc": 1492087615.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7hbnd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Throw_AwayWriter", "parent_id": "t3_654net", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They committed genocide, crippled a couple planets ecosystems and left the galaxy to clean it all up.
