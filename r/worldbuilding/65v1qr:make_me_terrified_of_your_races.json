Braveheart.\n\n- Caelennach sounds very irish, quick DDG of it and Cael means slender - are these slendermen?\n\n**Hyperboreans**\n\n- Borean Tundra was a place in WoW wasn't it?\n\n**Faladrim**\n\n- Haradrim were some humans from Lord of the Rings, right? Fal- is often a prefix used in fantasy like Mal- to indicate somehting is evil.\n\t\n- Scaphism, the method of torture and murder\n\n**Lunarians**\n\n- Luna is almost too obvious to point out\n\t\n- I'm sure I've heard of rabbits being used like that somewhere but I honestly can't remember where!\n\t\n- Sound very similar to Quarians in that if they get injured it'll likely be fatal because of the purity of the land etc\n\n**Nazakken** \n\n- I've actually got nothing! (But it's nearly 4am, give me some fresh eyes in the morning!)\n\n**Uruqinids** \n\n- Uruk-hai were tolkien's Orcs\n\t\n- Very Nordic culture; a death through honourable comabt is a surefire way of getting into Valhalla\n\t\n- Seen the animal skulls as helmets used in a few things; difficult to pin down what exactly could be the influence here!\n\n**Voldurvolk** \n\n- I recognised Voldur; these guys were homebrew on some forums weren't they? Ok I just looked it up, yeah giant in the playground is where they came from! Interesting that you've made them Dwarves rather than Orcs or Elves like the initial race!\n\t\n- Seem very much like the Artemis Fowl race of Dwarves, I loved those guys!\n\t\n- Also seem very similar to the Dwemer from the Elder Scrolls series!\n\n**Gwerinbryn** \n\n- I recognised it as Welsh from looking up languages for my campaign (\"bryn\" gave it away) but I had to look up Gwerin; so these guys are hill folk then!\n\t\n- I'm *so* hoping that the spores emanating from plants putting you to sleep is a pokemon reference\n\n**Ashenzari** \n\n- ashen was obvious but had to look up zari and came up with a thread used in traditional asian garments? I think I'm barking up the wrong tree here..\n\t\n- Their appearance seems very similar to Final Fantasy black mages\n\t\n- The experiments are very similar to Japan's Unit 731 in WWII\n\n**Faeries** \n\n- I'm *sure* I've heard of mass illusion somewhere else but can't think of anything beyond Genjutsu in Naruto... \n\t\n- An all female race who live among trees is almost reminiscent of Amazoness'\n\n**Khurgazans** \n\n- I'm not 100% on this (my Turkish is a little off as I'm Greek Cypriot) but isn't a Khurgan a Turkish word for something like a castle or fortress?\n\t\n- Resembles monsters and sounds like death metal vocalists.. I know Lordi aren't death metal but could it be Lordi? I don't know too many death metal bands and Lordi are the first metal band to spring to mind who dress like monsters\n\t\n- Riding on horseback and doing essentially drive bys sounds like their attack patterns are based of the Huns?\n\t\n- Had to look this up because I knew it was a martyr but I couldn't remember who! St Hippolytus was dismembered by being tied to horses running in opposite directions\n\t\n- Killing someone by using many small cuts was an east asian torture and murder method (can't remember what country though, I'd guess Japan? - just looked it up and it was China. Ooops!)\n\n**Budokuro** \n\n- Japanese. Budo is to do with martial arts, right? Haven't done Judo in a long time but I remember that much! Kuro just means black\n\t\n- Sounds very similar to what I imagine Furyan culture would be like (though a quick peruse of the riddick wikia doesn't mention anything of the sort on the Furyan page)\n\n**Kokatsuna** \n\n- sounds Japanese? I thought it was going on about the hilt of a sword before I realised that's Tsuka... A quick DDG says it's related to an anime called Reborn!, but that's one I haven't heard of!\n\t\n- Kannushi I recognise, and I'm going to have to cheat again and DDG here... Ok so they're similar to monks of Shinto temples?\n\t\n- Yeah and Miko is a \"shrine maiden\" in Shinto practices, so I'm guessing I hit the mark there?\n\n**Saanlok** \n\n- I'm not sure, but San is japanese for three, and Lok is japanese for six.. That's a wild guess though!\n\t\n- Using chakrams, riding elephants and using poison sounds very middle eastern \"assassin-y\"?\n\n**Radoghirs** \n\n- Radoghir was one of the castles in Mount and Blade, correct?\n\t\n- The description of Catfolk is incredibly close to Khajiit, down to the fearlessness described in is it Ahzirr Traajijazeri?\n\n**Qieqzi** \n\n- I don't know to be honest\n\n**Jinchu** \n\n- Jinchuuriki meant something along the lines of power of human sacrifice, right? So this name could be just human sacrifice?\n\t\n- I remember seeing boomboom stick somewhere before but I'm not sure so I'd have to guess Boom&amp;Bewm from Borderlands 2\n\n**Vroth** \n\n- Nothing I spotted here\n\n**Nordennar** \n\n- Nord just means northern one, though I can't think (or find) anything to do with ennar\n\t\n- I've *definitely* heard of the bleeding ears thing before but I can't for the life of me remember where!\n\t\n- The blood eagle was a nordic method of execution\n\n**Lasaka** \n\n- Nope, not a clue\n\n**Tavros** \n\n- Well Stavros is \"cross\" in Greek (as in Jesus on the cross, not angry cross) and the minotaur was a greek myth, I'm guessing there's a connection?\n\n**Slatrari** \n\n- This means butcher in Icelandic, right? Hence all the butcher stuff!\n\t\n- They sound a lot like Abominations from World of Warcraft\n\n**Yeotens** \n\n- A giant, ogre like creature with two heads? Reminds me of the Ogre Magi from WoW\n\n**Grimyrians** \n\n- I'm sure the Grimyr were a race from Dr Who... failing that, *please* be Grimer from pokemon! :D", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ve missed a &lt;em&gt;tonne&lt;/em&gt; here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World in General&lt;/strong&gt;- Norse Mythology (Midgard, etc)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medecians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought it was Medea from Greek Mythology but a quick DDG says there&amp;#39;s a girl called Medecia in Sid Story&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christianity (nailing hands and feet to wooden crosses)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caelennach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bosmer sprang to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also charging, screaming, with red hair, blue and green tattoos ?

A quick DDG says it&amp;#39;s related to an anime called Reborn!, but that&amp;#39;s one I haven&amp;#39;t heard of!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kannushi I recognise, and I&amp;#39;m going to have to cheat again and DDG here... Ok so they&amp;#39;re similar to monks of Shinto temples?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah and Miko is a &amp;quot;shrine maiden&amp;quot; in Shinto practices, so I&amp;#39;m guessing I hit the mark there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saanlok&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure, but San is japanese for three, and Lok is japanese for six.. That&amp;#39;s a wild guess though!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using chakrams, riding elephants and using poison sounds very middle eastern &amp;quot;assassin-y&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radoghirs&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radoghir was one of the castles in Mount and Blade, correct?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The description of Catfolk is incredibly close to Khajiit, down to the fearlessness described in is it Ahzirr Traajijazeri?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qieqzi&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know to be honest&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jinchu&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jinchuuriki meant something along the lines of power of human sacrifice, right? So this name could be just human sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing boomboom stick somewhere before but I&amp;#39;m not sure so I&amp;#39;d have to guess Boom&amp;amp;Bewm from Borderlands 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vroth&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nothing I spotted here&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nordennar&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nord just means northern one, though I can&amp;#39;t think (or find) anything to do with ennar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; heard of the bleeding ears thing before but I can&amp;#39;t for the life of me remember where!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood eagle was a nordic method of execution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasaka&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nope, not a clue&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tavros&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Well Stavros is &amp;quot;cross&amp;quot; in Greek (as in Jesus on the cross, not angry cross) and the minotaur was a greek myth, I&amp;#39;m guessing there&amp;#39;s a connection?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slatrari&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means butcher in Icelandic, right?

They are basically fearless. Almost nothing will ever make them retreat. Religion isn't really the reason why, they are simply so hypermasculine that nothing seems to really scare them, which could have a psychological impact on opposing forces. If they can hurt their enemy even a little bit, it's worth whatever happens to them, and if they can hurt their enemies, they'll do it *a lot.* No interest in rape, but they may torture. They use big axes called bardiches, have horse archers and mammoth riders, and their wizards like to use ice magic the most while their shamans might call in beasts and monsters.\n\n*Alright, I am really running out of steam here... Send help...*\n\n- **Qieqzi** (merfolk): They're not so bad... maybe. They're just hard to invade because they live underwater. They don't rape, but they might torture their victims. Whenever they capture people with their throwing nets, that's the reason why they're doing it.\n\n- **Jinchu** (Toadmen): Psychological impact from boomboom sticks and stealthy assassins/monks killing in the night, plus their armies are disciplined and may have a fanatical fury at the concept of people being barbaric enough to invade them, the same mentality that the naga might have. No rape, just torture for their most hated enemies.\n\n- **Vroth** (Formicids): Being humanoid ants, they look a bit scary, and they fight with incredible cooperation and courage due to being hiveminded and not really having emotion (which is also a gnome trait.)\n\n- **Nordennar** (Giants): Big, scary dudes and dudettes with axes and shields and bows who can stun people, cause ears to leak blood, cause avalanches, or even cause death simply by shouting. The most psychological impact is achieved by them when they march while constantly shouting with that sort of power, like a deep and rumbling chant that sounds like \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\" No torture... generally, if they really hate someone, they will give them a blood eagle, which is tearing the lungs out from their backs and leaving them exposed to die. They have special druids known as Stormcallers who can bring down thunder and fierce winds by shouting, so do the Radoghirs and some other species as well. Female prisoners will almost always become concubines for them while males become thralls, occasionally concubines.\n\n- **Lasaka** (Centaurs): Savage, brutal warrior rapists who also love torturing enemies. Because of the way their bodies are, they're all as fast as horses are, but in sieges they'll rely on slave shock troops. What makes them different from Chimerans is that they don't need other females to reproduce, they have women too, they live in a different area, and they... ummm... hmm, maybe they aren't much different. Oh, well.\n\n- **Tavros** (Minotaurs): Their main deity besides their own ancestral one is the god of war, and they fight fanatically for him. Hammers are the most preferred weapon of minotaurs, with bigger heads and no spikes unlike warhammers. They'll swing two handed hammers called mauls, one handed hammers along with a shield, or they'll throw them. If they use a fustibalus, or staff sling, (their favoured ranged weapon) they can propel them with the same level of force as a bullet thanks to their ridiculous strength. They'd rather savagely kill male prisoners than torture them, but they will rape female ones until they die. \n\n- **Slatrari** (Ogres): No torture or rape, but they will eat you, and if they really hate you, they will eat you alive. They're all hideously obese and ugly, smell really disgusting from all the rotting meat that they eat, and can really take a beating. Meat cleavers are their preferred weapons, as if to say, \"you're all just livestock who are waiting to be butchered\". A minority of them serve as shamans or even wizards, usually it's ogresses who will do so.\n\n- **Yeotens** (Ettins): They're large, scary and strong like giants, ogres, minotaurs and dragonspawn. Maybe having a slightly freakier appearance with two heads would scare you. From a military perspective, they can appear to be unbeatable, with their most powerful vanguard troops wielding large spiked metal towershields in each hand as they march, and using them to bash their enemies as soon as they are close enough. Spiked metal maces like morningstars and eveningstars are their preferred weaponry. They don't have the patience for torture, like the other \"big\" species they would rather quickly smash someone to a pulp most of the time. They aren't interested in rape either, someone having only one head to them is like how we would view two-headed beings, total freaks.\n\n- **Grimyrians** (Dragonspawn): Dragonspawn were basically created for battle by dark wizards attempting to fuse humans and dragons, so their culture is extremely militaristic. They are physically powerful, and well-protected because not only do they wear armour, but they also have tough scales all over their bodies, but they can also breathe fire, ice, thunder or poison, depending on which great house of Thacskiri you've decided to fuck with. They have sergeants with warhammers or swords and large shields, crossbowmen who use large, powerful crossbows that could require more than one human to reload, battlemages that swing a weapon in one hand and cast spells with the other, and wizards who will excel in whatever element they consist of, fire, ice, thunder or poison.

Yes, I'm onto your silly spelling...* You have *got* to be *joking!* Their appearance is deceiving. They're all female and tend to be rather cute, but their druids, shamans and mages can equal or surpass those from other lands. Some of them will throw weapons or use small bows, like halflings, and they're always poisoned. They aren't too stealthy, but faeries can have incredible speed and mobility, thanks to flying/hovering everywhere they go. The real terror of faeries, though, arises from their illusionists. Their forests, which look like a wonderful, enchanted place at first, will become a horrifying hellscape where everything seems like a nightmare and wants to kill or eat you. Memories of horrific events will be brought to life before your men's eyes, loosening their resolve. There is no better way to cause psychological damage and reduce the desire for waging war than to use illusion magic. If that fails, there is always the possibility of being lulled by a blissful illusion and having your throats slit or your bodies pricked with deadly poisons from darts or arrows while you're distracted. If having illusionists play havoc with your mind isn't enough to make you want to turn and run, I don't know what would. They're all female, and particularly despise male combatants who invade their lands, especially those from a species with a reputation for rape, so they'll be excited to castrate any male prisoners of war. Of course, though, they don't want them hanging around, so they'll torture them or release them.\n\n- **Khurgazans** (chimerans): A species that resembles monsters and all sound like death metal vocalists is difficult to not be at least somewhat afraid of. Chimerans are generally all lancers or horse archers, everyone in their army who is a Chimeran is on horseback, so their armies can do lightning-fast hit-and-run attacks. Their preferred tactic is to attack a place, leave, come back, attack, repeat until the place's resources and manpower has been drained to the point where they have basically been conquered. Since they aren't too effective in sieges, they'll make great use of shock troops from other species whenever that time arises, while the Chimerans themselves dominate field battles. They have a reputation for being ruthless in war, and for being *absolutely savage* to prisoners who aren't being used as shock troops. Ripping apart people by tying both ends of them to horses that run in opposite directions is common, so is crushing, starving, death by many small cuts, or whatever they can think of. They are particularly horrible if you're female, Chimerans are the only species that can impregnate females from other species, (as long as they're mammals) and Chimerans do not have any females among them, so if captured and female you will become a baby factory for the rest of your life. Faeries can't give birth to chimerans, but they'll rape them anyways. \n\n*People may not even read all of these, so I'll try to make the next ones a lot shorter...*\n\n- **Budokoro** (tengu): Barbarians, the lot of them. They have very aggressive personalities, getting into fights with one another even at a young age. To them, if you are not capable of battle and you are not a slave or a woman, then you do not deserve to live and should be killed, so they only respect power and martial prowess. The exceptions in their society are their concubines, and their mages, who specialize in air magic, and their shamans, but even their spellcasters have proved themselves \"worthy of being alive\". All of the \"barbaric\" peoples are like this to an extent, but with the Tengu, it's brought to a whole new level. Unlike the kitsune living next to them who they've frequently waged war with or attacked in small raids, they do not use cavalry, but all of them can fly, so they have a great degree of mobility. They prefer speed over raw power when fighting, and they delight in cruelty, torture and rape. To them, fighting other species to test whether they can do battle or not is like teaching them to be stronger or making sure that they are on the right track. They really are a psychotic bunch.\n\n- **Kokatsuna** (kitsune): Like the faeries, their main terror lies in illusions. They prefer to use them to distract their enemies or make them believe that they aren't present, while they're really charging at them with a tachi or a naginata or priming an arrow or preparing to slit their throats. Invading them on their own territory is an awful thing to do, they have honed their skill in battle with thousands of years of having to wage war with their savagely violent neighbours who every now and then have had to be seriously put down. If you see a bunch of oni charging at you in a bloodrage during a battle with them, it's because their shamans, called kannushi or mikos if they're female, brought them under their control. Kitsune don't delight in torture or rape, but they will show no mercy and losing troops to assassins, illusions that never seem to end, horse archers, and berserkers will seriously reduce morale.\n\n- **Saanlok** (naga): They aren't really savage and barbaric, their civilization has plenty to boast of, but their fighters have plenty of discipline and zeal. Round metal wheel-like discs called chakrams are thrown by nearly *everyone* in their society. Their fighters, berserkers, mages, clerics, priests, women, children, the elderly, [okay, the last three are a bit of a joke] they're all going to be tossing these metal discs of varying sizes at you. They don't ride horses, so most of them are infantry, but that just means that their footsoldiers and archers are faster, stronger and more terrifying. The cavalry that they *do* use all ride on the backs of elephants, which should certainly scare any invading army. Their sorcerers will use any sort of magic, but they specialize in and prefer to use poison, or venomacy. They don't like to rape, they'll just put all non-complying prisoners to the sword, torture may be used sometimes.\n\n(continued in next comment)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faeries&lt;/strong&gt; (sidhe): Of course, people would think that they are the least scary of every species in Midgaard. &lt;em&gt;Fairies? Yes, I&amp;#39;m onto your silly spelling...&lt;/em&gt; You have &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; to be &lt;em&gt;joking!&lt;/em&gt; Their appearance is deceiving. They&amp;#39;re all female and tend to be rather cute, but their druids, shamans and mages can equal or surpass those from other lands. Some of them will throw weapons or use small bows, like halflings, and they&amp;#39;re always poisoned. They aren&amp;#39;t too stealthy, but faeries can have incredible speed and mobility, thanks to flying/hovering everywhere they go. The real terror of faeries, though, arises from their illusionists. Their forests, which look like a wonderful, enchanted place at first, will become a horrifying hellscape where everything seems like a nightmare and wants to kill or eat you. Memories of horrific events will be brought to life before your men&amp;#39;s eyes, loosening their resolve. There is no better way to cause psychological damage and reduce the desire for waging war than to use illusion magic. If that fails, there is always the possibility of being lulled by a blissful illusion and having your throats slit or your bodies pricked with deadly poisons from darts or arrows while you&amp;#39;re distracted. If having illusionists play havoc with your mind isn&amp;#39;t enough to make you want to turn and run, I don&amp;#39;t know what would. They&amp;#39;re all female, and particularly despise male combatants who invade their lands, especially those from a species with a reputation for rape, so they&amp;#39;ll be excited to castrate any male prisoners of war. Of course, though, they don&amp;#39;t want them hanging around, so they&amp;#39;ll torture them or release them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khurgazans&lt;/strong&gt; (chimerans): A species that resembles monsters and all sound like death metal vocalists is difficult to not be at least somewhat afraid of. Chimerans are generally all lancers or horse archers, everyone in their army who is a Chimeran is on horseback, so their armies can do lightning-fast hit-and-run attacks. Their preferred tactic is to attack a place, leave, come back, attack, repeat until the place&amp;#39;s resources and manpower has been drained to the point where they have basically been conquered. Since they aren&amp;#39;t too effective in sieges, they&amp;#39;ll make great use of shock troops from other species whenever that time arises, while the Chimerans themselves dominate field battles. They have a reputation for being ruthless in war, and for being &lt;em&gt;absolutely savage&lt;/em&gt; to prisoners who aren&amp;#39;t being used as shock troops. Ripping apart people by tying both ends of them to horses that run in opposite directions is common, so is crushing, starving, death by many small cuts, or whatever they can think of. They are particularly horrible if you&amp;#39;re female, Chimerans are the only species that can impregnate females from other species, (as long as they&amp;#39;re mammals) and Chimerans do not have any females among them, so if captured and female you will become a baby factory for the rest of your life. Faeries can&amp;#39;t give birth to chimerans, but they&amp;#39;ll rape them anyways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People may not even read all of these, so I&amp;#39;ll try to make the next ones a lot shorter...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budokoro&lt;/strong&gt; (tengu): Barbarians, the lot of them. They have very aggressive personalities, getting into fights with one another even at a young age. To them, if you are not capable of battle and you are not a slave or a woman, then you do not deserve to live and should be killed, so they only respect power and martial prowess. The exceptions in their society are their concubines, and their mages, who specialize in air magic, and their shamans, but even their spellcasters have proved themselves &amp;quot;worthy of being alive&amp;quot;. All of the &amp;quot;barbaric&amp;quot; peoples are like this to an extent, but with the Tengu, it&amp;#39;s brought to a whole new level. Unlike the kitsune living next to them who they&amp;#39;ve frequently waged war with or attacked in small raids, they do not use cavalry, but all of them can fly, so they have a great degree of mobility. They prefer speed over raw power when fighting, and they delight in cruelty, torture and rape. To them, fighting other species to test whether they can do battle or not is like teaching them to be stronger or making sure that they are on the right track. They really are a psychotic bunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kokatsuna&lt;/strong&gt; (kitsune): Like the faeries, their main terror lies in illusions. They prefer to use them to distract their enemies or make them believe that they aren&amp;#39;t present, while they&amp;#39;re really charging at them with a tachi or a naginata or priming an arrow or preparing to slit their throats. Invading them on their own territory is an awful thing to do, they have honed their skill in battle with thousands of years of having to wage war with their savagely violent neighbours who every now and then have had to be seriously put down. If you see a bunch of oni charging at you in a bloodrage during a battle with them, it&amp;#39;s because their shamans, called kannushi or mikos if they&amp;#39;re female, brought them under their control. Kitsune don&amp;#39;t delight in torture or rape, but they will show no mercy and losing troops to assassins, illusions that never seem to end, horse archers, and berserkers will seriously reduce morale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saanlok&lt;/strong&gt; (naga): They aren&amp;#39;t really savage and barbaric, their civilization has plenty to boast of, but their fighters have plenty of discipline and zeal. Round metal wheel-like discs called chakrams are thrown by nearly &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; in their society.

They fight fanatically, yet with discipline, and deliberately cause as much pain as possible, that's why they use serrated axes and swords and put agonizing poisons onto their crossbow bolts. Their mages prefer fire magic the most of all, while they have warlocks that will summon demonic beings, or just cause tremendous pain to their enemies by casting curses. Most often their method of warfare is quick, they'll enter a place, ravage it, and leave before a proper response can be mounted, entering portals that warp them back down into their spacious fortresses deep below the earth. They feed prisoners of war to their spiders that they use as mounts, carve them up piece by piece, or use pain curses on them until they eventually die if they're male. If they're female, they will literally rape them to death. If they decide to wound them while they're in this process, it's the most mercy that they'll ever show.\n\n- **Uruqinids** (orcs): From birth, their culture teaches them that death is not something to fear. In fact, it's *great* to die. There is no such thing as a pointless death for any of them, as long as it was on the battlefield while they were fighting their enemies. Of course, this belief is common among all warrior societies, but it's ramped up to a higher intensity with orcs. Most people would want to retreat if they were losing a dramatic number of men, even if they're extremely war-like and believe that only paradise awaits. That is not the case with orcs. As a result of this, they fight with a zeal that is difficult to match. They'll scream prayers to their deities as they're marching, fighting, and battering the gates of a castle. Their clerics, even more fanatical, may have taught that your people are demons who must be smited. The fact that they use prisoners of war and other slaves as shock troops, particularly delighting in putting those of the species they are fighting against in the front, can also have a major psychological effect. Their helmets have masks made from animal skulls to intimidate their enemies, the hands of those they've slain hang from the belts of their berserkers, and their cavalry, using lances and bows and wearing chainmail and bone lamellar, can match their infantry. Their archers excel, not in power like the wood elves, but in the sheer number of arrows they can release at foes. Enslaving and raping the women among your people could be one of the primary reasons why they are invading you, as sick and twisted as that sounds. They also delight in torturing males, and will castrate all male slaves.\n\n- **Voldurvolk** (dwarves): They prefer to fight a bit more indirectly, but they don't shy away from melee combat, embracing it with an iron discipline. They've always got armies of soldiers with large shields, polearms, one handed warhammers or axes, and crossbows. What sets them apart and makes them scary to fight is their use of technology. The most fear will be experienced if you fight them in their element, in caves and tunnels, where explosives could cause cave-ins and you could potentially face the situation of being utterly trapped and starving to death trying to dig your way out, or their crossbowmen would take pot shots at your troops, or even worse, lob grenades. You could come out of a tunnel and have large rocks falling on the heads of you and your soldiers. They use cannons the most out of any other species when they're fighting in spacious areas, and their gunners will prove the power of muskets and blunderbusses against your men. The most terrifying units of the dwarves would be their clockwork golems, which are essentially large robots. They have automatic firearms and simple yet powerful missile launchers attached to their frames, and if they punch one of your warriors, they are *dead.* Dwarves do not take prisoners, they are not interested in slaves or sex, they will just kill you. If they show interest in recruiting you rather than simply getting rid of you like an insect, then you're *lucky.*\n\n- **Gwerinbryn** (halflings): At first glances, these guys don't seem scary at all. They're a bunch of little light-hearted drug abusers who like to eat and sleep and not do much of anything, right? Invading them should be a piece of cake... said everyone who's never been to their homeland or heard about their method of warfare, ever. If you try to invade their land, the spores emanating from plants will put you to sleep. If you wake up naked with all your possessions stolen, you were lucky enough to have them rob you and leave you at the border while you were asleep. You could also wake up screaming as one of the flower beasts of their lands is chewing through your flesh. That's about their territory, though, what about the halflings themselves? Well, you'll face plenty of stealth attacks. They are *very* good at sneaking around, because they're small and their steps don't make a lot of noise. Even the most hardened soldiers will want to leave when they realize in the morning that a large portion of their army had their throats slit in their sleep, and that it continues to happen every night to a varying degree. While you're marching along, they'll use poisoned darts or throwing knives or little bows and arrows to kill your men, and retreat as swiftly and silently as they came. Halflings aren't at their best if forced to fight out in the open, but they can move *quite* fast, so in small groups, they will make fools of your men and kill them with stabs and cuts from their daggers and shortswords. They certainly aren't as cruel as other species are, but your losses compared to theirs will make you want to leave or surrender.\n\n- **Ashenzari** (gnomes): What, you aren't afraid of them already? How can you not be scared of a bunch of beings who are all capable of magic, bombed the land under their floating island with magic spells until it resembles a desert resulting from explosives testing, and regularly study and attempt to make use of eldritch magic? Their appearance and personalities lend to their reputation as well. No one really knows what they look like, if they're captured they'll figure out a way to escape magically or they'll self-destruct. People just see a black void underneath their pointed hoods, with two glowing yellow eyes. Sometimes there's a light grey beard sticking out of the void that is apparently their face. Anyways, don't invade them, do not go to war with them, they will absolutely destroy you unless you have *insane* numbers of troops, which would require having at least several other nations and their armies under your control. They definitely have a psychological impact on you and your troops if they can easily wipe out segments of your troops or pierce through lines of them like cannon balls with the magic spells that they use. For these spells that have more power and area of effect, they tend to cast together, but this doesn't lessen the blow at all. The fact is that as you march towards them, you will lose a great number of troops. Oh, and if they capture anyone, they'll use them for experiments, like Lunarians do. How much heat/cold/poison can one stand? What degree of pain can cause death? How long does it take for eldritch forces to overwhelm one's body? They have numerous questions like these and will use live subjects in attempt to find them out.\n\n(continued in next comment)", "edited": 1492460146.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nazakken&lt;/strong&gt; (abyss elves): These people have a savage hatred for people living on the surface of the world and perhaps the most terrifying reputation of every species in this world.

They have a type of soldier for every situation (you want to charge at us with berserkers? Okay, we'll use our huge shields and stab you once you waste your energy on them. We also have crossbows for those big, exposed bodies of yours. You want to use cavalry? Pikes and halberds. You want to use necromancers, warlocks and undead/demonic hordes? We've got clerics and paladins. We can play the horse archer game too, Byzhovian horse archers have beared the brunt of Chimeran assaults for centuries.) Also, they nail people's hands and feet to wooden crosses, then leave them to slowly die and be eaten by birds. They claim to be civilized, but they can be just as savage as anyone else.\n\n- **Caelennach** (wood elves): These guys are *crazy.* They're tall, lean, strong, practically snipers with longbows, and will charge at you, screaming, with long, wild red hair, their white bodies covered in blue and green tattoos. Some of their most elite warriors wear chainmail and full-faced helmets and wield two handed swords called claymores. If they need to, they'll transform into dryads, which are creatures made from wood that can rip apart armour with their claws. Their druids will bring every animal in the woods upon you while you're struggling to fend off their infantry and cavalry and getting sniped from the treetops. You probably already saw the heads and limbs hanging from tree branches when you intruded on their territory. \n\n- **Hyperboreans** (high elves): If a heavy cavalry shock charge would make you quake in fear, then you'd have plenty of reason to fear these guys. Their knights are covered head to toe in armour and ride on unicorns, so they don't even have to use their lances to pierce through your body. On foot, their warriors are incredible swordsmen, some of have been dueling with rapiers and other kinds of blades since they were young, and their crossbowmen are nothing to sneeze at. Also, they've got powerful wizards. They'll use all sorts of elements, but they seem to do the best with lightning and thunder magic. It's difficult to maintain discipline when thunder and lightning are striking your troops where they stand. They rarely go to war, but when they do, they kill without mercy, taking absolutely no prisoners. Naturally, the exception is if you'll fight alongside them. You can at least take solace in the fact that you won't be tortured and are less likely to be raped to death or kept as a concubine if you're a female or feminine-enough combatant. \n\n- **Faladrim** (dark elves): Try to keep your gall in the face of zombies, skeletons, wraiths, golem-like abominations assembled from many different corpses joined together, or worst of all, the resurrected corpses of your comrades. They like to use necromancy when they fight, it's proven to be an effective strategy for them, particularly against armies that make up for a lack of power with overwhelming numbers. Aside from the undead and the necromancers that mastermind or create them, they also specialize in heavy cavalry, with mageknights being their most iconic combatants. They ride on horseback, using a one handed weapon while leaving their other hand open, when they're throwing bullet-like clumps of rocks and sand, (their mages specialize in earth magic) fireballs, or thunderbolts you'll understand the reason why. If you're not scared yet, Medecian history tells of how they would take prisoners of war, put them in a boat, cover them in milk and honey and leave them to be consumed by insects. They *really* like to rape female, sometimes male prisoners too.\n\n- **Lunarians** (moon elves): You're either crazy or know nothing about these people if you're not afraid of them. They're all exiles who were banished from the moon, and the civilization on the moon is EXTREMELY advanced, their technology is enough to literally challenge the gods themselves in battle. How would a colony of criminals from such a world living on ours make you feel? Their technology isn't nearly as highly developed, but it's still very advanced. They have rifles and shotguns and missile launchers like the Dwarves do, they move with terrifying speed, can strike with incredible force, and have arcane abilities equivalent to gnomes or high elves. Their tech is advanced enough for vehicles, they have crystal armour and weapons, the very best in all of Midgaard, and they have a horde of genetically engineered humanoid rabbits outside of their colony, armed with rifles and shotguns, who **enjoy** hunting down and killing any intruders. If they ever decide to go to war, their enemies are doomed. The only thing to cheer you up in the face of them is that if they get wounded, they're screwed, because they're pure beings and this is an impure land. Also, like the high elves, they don't delight in rape or torture. They'd rather kill you than recruit you, but they might capture you and use you for vicious experiments.\n\n(continued in the next comment)", "edited": 1492476076.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a &lt;strong&gt;BIG WALL OF TEXT&lt;/strong&gt; because I have 25 different species in my setting, but I&amp;#39;m gonna write out all of this anyways because it seems fun, I just hope someone bothers to read it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medecians&lt;/strong&gt; (humans): They may seem short and somewhat weak, but their armies may have a &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt; level of discipline, enduring nearly all pain. They have a type of soldier for every situation (you want to charge at us with berserkers? Okay, we&amp;#39;ll use our huge shields and stab you once you waste your energy on them. We also have crossbows for those big, exposed bodies of yours. You want to use cavalry? Pikes and halberds. You want to use necromancers, warlocks and undead/demonic hordes? We&amp;#39;ve got clerics and paladins. We can play the horse archer game too, Byzhovian horse archers have beared the brunt of Chimeran assaults for centuries.) Also, they nail people&amp;#39;s hands and feet to wooden crosses, then leave them to slowly die and be eaten by birds. They claim to be civilized, but they can be just as savage as anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caelennach&lt;/strong&gt; (wood elves): These guys are &lt;em&gt;crazy.&lt;/em&gt; They&amp;#39;re tall, lean, strong, practically snipers with longbows, and will charge at you, screaming, with long, wild red hair, their white bodies covered in blue and green tattoos. Some of their most elite warriors wear chainmail and full-faced helmets and wield two handed swords called claymores. If they need to, they&amp;#39;ll transform into dryads, which are creatures made from wood that can rip apart armour with their claws. Their druids will bring every animal in the woods upon you while you&amp;#39;re struggling to fend off their infantry and cavalry and getting sniped from the treetops. You probably already saw the heads and limbs hanging from tree branches when you intruded on their territory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyperboreans&lt;/strong&gt; (high elves): If a heavy cavalry shock charge would make you quake in fear, then you&amp;#39;d have plenty of reason to fear these guys. Their knights are covered head to toe in armour and ride on unicorns, so they don&amp;#39;t even have to use their lances to pierce through your body. On foot, their warriors are incredible swordsmen, some of have been dueling with rapiers and other kinds of blades since they were young, and their crossbowmen are nothing to sneeze at. Also, they&amp;#39;ve got powerful wizards. They&amp;#39;ll use all sorts of elements, but they seem to do the best with lightning and thunder magic. It&amp;#39;s difficult to maintain discipline when thunder and lightning are striking your troops where they stand. They rarely go to war, but when they do, they kill without mercy, taking absolutely no prisoners. Naturally, the exception is if you&amp;#39;ll fight alongside them. You can at least take solace in the fact that you won&amp;#39;t be tortured and are less likely to be raped to death or kept as a concubine if you&amp;#39;re a female or feminine-enough combatant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faladrim&lt;/strong&gt; (dark elves): Try to keep your gall in the face of zombies, skeletons, wraiths, golem-like abominations assembled from many different corpses joined together, or worst of all, the resurrected corpses of your comrades. They like to use necromancy when they fight, it&amp;#39;s proven to be an effective strategy for them, particularly against armies that make up for a lack of power with overwhelming numbers. Aside from the undead and the necromancers that mastermind or create them, they also specialize in heavy cavalry, with mageknights being their most iconic combatants. They ride on horseback, using a one handed weapon while leaving their other hand open, when they&amp;#39;re throwing bullet-like clumps of rocks and sand, (their mages specialize in earth magic) fireballs, or thunderbolts you&amp;#39;ll understand the reason why. If you&amp;#39;re not scared yet, Medecian history tells of how they would take prisoners of war, put them in a boat, cover them in milk and honey and leave them to be consumed by insects. They &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like to rape female, sometimes male prisoners too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunarians&lt;/strong&gt; (moon elves): You&amp;#39;re either crazy or know nothing about these people if you&amp;#39;re not afraid of them. They&amp;#39;re all exiles who were banished from the moon, and the civilization on the moon is EXTREMELY advanced, their technology is enough to literally challenge the gods themselves in battle. How would a colony of criminals from such a world living on ours make you feel? Their technology isn&amp;#39;t nearly as highly developed, but it&amp;#39;s still very advanced. They have rifles and shotguns and missile launchers like the Dwarves do, they move with terrifying speed, can strike with incredible force, and have arcane abilities equivalent to gnomes or high elves. Their tech is advanced enough for vehicles, they have crystal armour and weapons, the very best in all of Midgaard, and they have a horde of genetically engineered humanoid rabbits outside of their colony, armed with rifles and shotguns, who &lt;strong&gt;enjoy&lt;/strong&gt; hunting down and killing any intruders. If they ever decide to go to war, their enemies are doomed. The only thing to cheer you up in the face of them is that if they get wounded, they&amp;#39;re screwed, because they&amp;#39;re pure beings and this is an impure land. Also, like the high elves, they don&amp;#39;t delight in rape or torture.

YOU INCLUDED TONNES OF MYTHOLOGY!\n\nI try to do that with the Horror Shop 'verse--I want to connect the supernatural not just to typical Western mythology, but folklore and myths from around the world.

They came about originally about 7 or 8 years ago, when I was working on a few D&amp;D settings, and I wanted to create an anti-fey. Basically, fey were the creatures of the Feywild who embodied life and light--so then what would the fey equivalent of Shadow be. D&amp;D always had a few races that lived in Shadow, but typically it was the place of the undead--which wasn't quite as evocative. Fey had their own culture, magic, and the like--undead were just dead humanoids with superpowers. So I set about to create a race that tied into Shadow in the same way that fey tied into Faerie. Creatures of darkness, of fear, of cities and civilization and rot and decay. They were the shades, the bogeymen, the nightmares, the horrors.\n\n&gt; The reality of layered planes is well known to those who journey beyond the mortal plane.

The prime material plane, or the mortal realm, is just one facet of the primordial realm known as creation.

It is here that the energy of life melds with souls and spirits from beyond \u2013 and reaches heights it couldn't without.\n\n&gt; However, all life must end, and once body and soul have passed beyond, the energy of life fades away, drawn toward its final resting place in the Pit \u2013 the point where creation meets the negative energy plane.

We could always use more bogeymen.\n\nExactly the thing that inspired the horrors--heck, they were even called 'bogeymen' for a while before I decided I wanted a simpler, broader term that could be applied to them. The leaders of the 30 houses--some of the most ancient and terrifying of horrorkind--still carry that title, though.\n\n&gt; What do the sack men do? Catch you in a sack and carry you away?\n\nIt's an incredibly common myth across the world: a wrinkled old man, carrying an enormous sack over his shoulder, in which he captures little kids who run away from home or don't listen to their parents. In Spain, he is El Hombre Del Saco, in Patagonia El Viejo del Saco, in Mexico El Roba Chicos, in Haiti Tonton Macoute, in Hungary Mumus, in Turkey \u00d6c\u00fc, in Poland Bebok, in Russia Babay, in Bulgaria Torbalan, in Lebanon Abu Kees, in India Bori Baba, in Sri Lanka Goni Billa, in Vietnam \u00d4ng Ba B\u1ecb, in South Africa Antjie Somers. He takes the naughty little children away from all across the world, and brings them to his hidden home, where he eats away their life, and leaves little monsters in their place. \n\nAnd he is so very old, and has so many little monsters under him he has to feed now.\n\n&gt; There's a horror specifically intended to exploit every fear? Even relatively uncommon ones like of balloons or butterflies?\n\nYep, even incredibly complex ones which you wouldn't think about. One of my main characters, Fringe, is the fear of being trapped in a collapsing building. And she's not the only horror with that particular fear--though she's the only who who expresses it like she does because, well, every horror has a soul, and every soul is unique, and so Fringe's own interpretation of her fear differs from another horror who might have the same one.\n\nAnd like I mentioned, fears don't have to be evil. You can have a horror who incarnates the fear of breaking the law, or having your crimes uncovered, or of having your secrets revealed. So it's not like they're all 'evil things out to get me'... some of them go far more cerebral than that. They're still monsters, but monsters don't always have to be the bad guys.\n\n&gt; What happens if I have a fear of something really unusual like palindromes, pepe memes, or the number 898? Are there preexisting horrors that exploit these phobias, or will a new one be created every time someone develops a novel phobia?\n\nThink about the why of those fears. Why are you afraid of palindromes or 898? Maybe it's because you're afraid of symmetry, and feel stuff like those are unnatural. In which case, yeah, there's probably a horror who will exploit those fears. Pepe memes? I dunno, is it the frog? Is it the art style? Is it the memes' connection to certain political movements? Because there's a horror for all of those. \n\nAn example I came up a few weeks ago here on the sub: another member asked the hypothetical 'what if my greatest fear is not being watched.' Well, in that case, the horrors would figure out you've probably got narcissistic personality disorder or egomania, and thus begin to isolate you from everyone and ensure you're ignored and forgotten. So while you may have an odd fear, it can usually be traced back to something, and horrors can exploit that.\n\nThe issue with new horrors arising is that, as a besouled race, horrors don't just pop into being in response to someone's new fear. They arise from more general trends influencing the world, which leave their mark on the anima--or life force--of the world. Then, when certain circumstances are met, a soul will bond to a particularly resilient shard of anima in the Pit, and a new horror will crawl out--as a child, who will probably need a few decades of training before they're ready to haunt on their own. \n\nI could go in to more detail on this (like seriously, I've written mini-essays on the topic of how new horrors come into being--I haven't even touched on a mature horror cleaving off an aspect of their own fear and tossing it into the Pit to be animated as a new horror and their child, or a human being drawn into the Pit and having their humanity stripped away and replaced with terror, becoming a horror in the process), so if you've got any questions here, just ask and I will be happy to answer.

Are there preexisting horrors that exploit these phobias, or will a new one be created every time someone develops a novel phobia?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about the why of those fears. Why are you afraid of palindromes or 898? Maybe it&amp;#39;s because you&amp;#39;re afraid of symmetry, and feel stuff like those are unnatural. In which case, yeah, there&amp;#39;s probably a horror who will exploit those fears. Pepe memes? I dunno, is it the frog? Is it the art style? Is it the memes&amp;#39; connection to certain political movements? Because there&amp;#39;s a horror for all of those. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An example I came up a few weeks ago here on the sub: another member asked the hypothetical &amp;#39;what if my greatest fear is not being watched.&amp;#39; Well, in that case, the horrors would figure out you&amp;#39;ve probably got narcissistic personality disorder or egomania, and thus begin to isolate you from everyone and ensure you&amp;#39;re ignored and forgotten. So while you may have an odd fear, it can usually be traced back to something, and horrors can exploit that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue with new horrors arising is that, as a besouled race, horrors don&amp;#39;t just pop into being in response to someone&amp;#39;s new fear. They arise from more general trends influencing the world, which leave their mark on the anima--or life force--of the world. Then, when certain circumstances are met, a soul will bond to a particularly resilient shard of anima in the Pit, and a new horror will crawl out--as a child, who will probably need a few decades of training before they&amp;#39;re ready to haunt on their own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could go in to more detail on this (like seriously, I&amp;#39;ve written mini-essays on the topic of how new horrors come into being--I haven&amp;#39;t even touched on a mature horror cleaving off an aspect of their own fear and tossing it into the Pit to be animated as a new horror and their child, or a human being drawn into the Pit and having their humanity stripped away and replaced with terror, becoming a horror in the process), so if you&amp;#39;ve got any questions here, just ask and I will be happy to answer.

No, it also refers to the race most commonly called the horrors.\n\nHorrors are the sentient incarnations of mortal fears and phobias. They are the monster in your closet and the creature under your bed; they are the face that watches out of every mirror when you turn away and the voice that whispers your name when you're alone at night; they are the black cat that brings ill fortune and the raven bearing omens of your untimely demise; they are terror ripped straight out of a legend and the man from the government agency that doesn't exist. They are the sack men, the babau, the shadow people, los cucuys, die Butzem\u00e4nner, the bogies, the jumbies, and the thing watching you right now from outside your window.\n\nThey are all very real, and they all hunger for your fear.\n\nHorrors dwell within a dark and twisted echo of creation known as the Twilit Realm, the Dark World, the Netherworld, Creation's Echo, the Darkness, Under the Bed, Beyond the Closet, the Nightmare Realm, and, most typically, Shadow. Shadow is a realm of fear and phobia incarnate, formed from the hazy memories of mortals as their life seeps towards its end in the Pit, and lorded over by the Bogeymen of the Nightmare Court.\nThe various Bogeymen each control a domain within shadow, which has been shaped by desires of these powerful horrors into a reflection of the various fears they incarnate. For example, Abu Rigl Masluka, the burned-legged man, is the fear of fire and destruction, and his domain is the Obsidian Desert, a vast wasteland of black sand constantly beaten down upon by an ever-present black sun which spreads oppressive heat without the welcoming light of the day, where strange and twisted rise above the shifting dunes hiding the lairs of other horrors and the many treasures they have retrieved from destroyed monuments in the mortal realm. Or, for a more classical approach to horror, one could always visit the sprawling fields and estates of Jack O'Lantern, the fear of the dark, where every day is a wonderful celebration of old Samhain, and every night is filled with screams of terror.\nThe domains of the Bogeymen only comprise a small part of the Netherworld, and in between these \"tamed\" realms lie ruins of lost towns haunted by echoes of the departed, barren plains of grey dust which blow between skeletal trees, or grand Gothic castles lorded over by vampire kings who fled the mortal world and its hateful light for a realm where they could rule openly. There are also countless towns and villages populated by horrors from all the myriad houses of terror, where they live and haunt together. Such towns appear like something out of a grim Victorian fairy tale, with mundane architecture accented with carved skulls, or illuminated by floating jack o'lanterns that cast their eerie light onto streets teaming with strange monsters and beasts... and also some humans or other supernatural beings who have reason to visit.\n\nNow, not all horrors are evil, but all enjoy terror and fear--it's what they are, after all. Just like humans, they have free will and are masters of their own destiny, and thus have a wide variety of worldviews. There are some who are cruel and enjoy inflicting pain and suffering on the weak, like a horror from the house of the wilds who hunts campers in the form of a great beast, or one from the house of anger who is the true hand behind a legendary serial killer; and there are some who are noble and just, such as one from the house of the sun and power who hunts down white-collar criminals and reveals their crimes to the mortal public, or one from the house of magic who works as an entertainer, surprising and frightening at various performances.\n\nHorrors can be as heroic or villainous as their hearts desire. After all, fear is not in and of itself an evil thing, sometimes it's virtuous. Sometimes fear can even save a life. That's not to say they're not horrific, but there are horrors out there who prefer to use their powers on those whom they feel deserve it, bringing terror into the hearts of mortal wrong-doers, preying on the terror of those who have earned the horror's personal wrath. \n\nOther horrors are not so amicable.\n\nThere are the Grey Men, the fears of conspiracies who infiltrate governments and other powerful organizations, with the ability to twist your memories so you forget the truth you have seen... or you remember things that never could have happened. There are the Rough Beasts, the ultimate predators whose forms are continually shifting and evolving to better capture and toy with their prey. There are the Ringleaders, who can promise you any delight, but will strip away your humanity with every gift until you are little more than a beast. There are the Commisars, who will happily fuse you to machines to improve your life and ensure your undying loyalty to Big Brother. There are the Lost Children, whose passing can take from you almost anything you value, from your keys to your memories to your children. There are the Horned Hunters, horrors who have willingly fused themselves with machines of war and live to bring bloodshed, chaos, and voice. There's the Plagewrought, who are living vessels for every disease known to man, and some horrific new concoctions created in Pugot's vile jungles. There are the Churgions, who live to find a cure for every ailment afflicting humanity, from the flu to cancer to blood loss and pain, and are always on the lookout for new subjects. There are the Yule Lads, who hunt down those lost to the cold, and drag their frostbitten victims back into the blizzards of Shadow so they may be part of the grand winter feast they serve to their eternally hungry mother, Gryla. There are the Ushers of the Parliament of Shadows, who have a key for every door, and have a door to every room... including your own. And there are the Prophets of the Apocalypse whose mad ramblings for tell the end of all things, from your own horrific demise through to the end of creation itself.\n\nSo the question then becomes: what are you afraid of, really?

You&amp;#39;re family is starving, you&amp;#39;r home is in disrepair, your father, mother and elder bother are all out of work. Civil unrest as food becomes scarce, and your friends tell you rumors of gangs beating and eating people to survive. Everyday you watch for family sacrifice so you can eat. Even though the meals aren&amp;#39;t filling, they fend off the worst of the hunger pains. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly out of the blue, someone delivers couple days rations to your house. He come in and talks to your parents about a woman named Tiss and how she is going to change everything. You don&amp;#39;t here much but you can make out Tiss is the coming of god to deliver us to into the heavens. He leaves after a couple minutes, and promises someone will deliver another meal in a few days.

An announcement came on the T.V. where she perosnally announced the successful test of a FTL capable engine. She has delivered you to the heavens. In the coming years massive fleets would be built up to came the heavens, your birthright. You finish your training as sign up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the rapid expansion of your goddess empire, you&amp;#39;ve run into two other intelligent species.
