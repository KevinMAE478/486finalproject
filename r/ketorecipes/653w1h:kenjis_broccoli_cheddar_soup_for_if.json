I saw his [Broccoli Cheddar](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/10/broccoli-cheddar-cheese-soup-food-lab-recipe.html) recipe and realized it could be slightly modified to suit us keto weirdos without sacrificing much of what the master concocted.  I was worried that by sacrificing one on the central techniques he credits this recipe with (adding potato for thickening) would take away some of the panache of the recipe, however I think it stands up just fine with the modifications.  I've looked at other Broccoli Cheddar soup recipes on this sub and they are great, however I believe Kenji's has nuance to it that really sets it apart.\n\n\nThe key to this is as I understand it is simmering the stalks separately from the florets.  I seriously adds a dual broccoli flavor that I could not believe someone like me could notice, and makes eating vegetables downright pornographic.\n\n\nI followed the technique he describes to the tee, only modifying some of the ingredients.  The key to this is the immersion blender which I understand is a barrier for some.  Seriously, get one.  It's relatively cheap and worth it for making mayo alone.\n\n\nI'll also add that the servings are pretty calorie heavy and are perfectly suited for doing IF.  I look forward to coming home and getting my big bowl of soup, followed up with some meat and cheese treats to fill out the rest of my daily caloric intake.\n\n\nI'd recommend simply reading the linked recipe for the specific instructions as Kenji has a great video to help you. Ingredients I used with modifications(!) are:\n\n\n* 1.5 lbs broccoli\n* !2 tbsp coconut oil (in place of vegetable oil for searing florets)\n* 3 tbsp unsalted butter\n* chopped onion (about 6 ounces I suppose)\n* 3 cloves garlic (or however much you like, powder works too I have found)\n* 2 cups chicken stock/broth\n* !2 cups heavy cream and 1 cup water (in place of three cups whole milk)\n* 1 tsp mustard powder\n* 8 ounces American cheese, grated\n* 8 ounces sharp cheddar, grated\n* !8 ounces Monterrey jack cheese, grated (original calls for 12 oz cheddar, I added this)\n* !1 rope smoked sausage (this isn't in the original recipe but works great)\n* However much salt and pepper you would like (I also tossed some cayenne in)\n* !I omitted the carrots and potato from original to reduce carbs\n\n\nTo summarize the technique, chop up the broccoli so you've separated the stalks (roughly chopped up) and the florets.  Make the florets whatever size you can tolerate spooning into your mouth.  \n\n\nKenji uses one pot for everything, I find using a pot and a pan makes it a bit more speedy.\n\n\nBoil everything but the cheese and the florets in the pot and then simmer for about a half an hour, making sure the broccoli stalks are soft enough to get eaten up easily by the blender.\n\n\nIn the meantime, char the florets on high heat in a pan with the oil to get some blackening, and then set them aside.  Also chop up the sausage (if you want to add it) and brown that up in a pan.  Set that aside as well.\n\n\nOnce you've softened the onions/stalks, start blending everything up while in the pot with the immersion blender.  Then use the technique Kenji so politely has in his video to slowly add in the cheese and blend it up good.  After its a nice consistency, toss in the florets.  Give it a few pulses with the blender to make the florets as tolerable to eat as you like.  Then dump in the optional sausage and toss that garbage around.\n\n\nRoughly, depending on what sausage and cheese you use, the macros will come out to about \n\n* 85g Fat\n* 39g Protein\n* 22g Carbs\n\nand around 1100 calories if you turn it into 6 servings.  I make it 4 myself and its just about all I eat all day.\n\n\nFirst post so any comments or internet shamings are welcome.\n\n\nedit: formatting rookie", "edited": 1492065910.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenji Lopez-Alt &lt;a href=\"/u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt\"&gt;/u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt&lt;/a&gt; is a culinary whirling dervish of genius and passion.
