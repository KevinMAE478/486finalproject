(Delish or some other channel, I tried checking Delish already) Anyways the chicken thighs were red, I believe they had paprika on them (not entirely sure), but the recipe definitely did use heavy cream to sauce things up and it was topped off with spinach. Also, does anyone know of any good chicken breast recipes? They&amp;#39;ve been tasting so bland and dry to me lately.
