I think every PC at the HS has an i5-4460 in them with 8GBs of RAM.&lt;br/&gt;\nMy college is another story, i7s ranging from i7-860s to i7-6700s. The Library has Q6600&amp;#39;s and 4GBs of RAM though they&amp;#39;ll likely be thrown out/sold soon. CAD classes/Video editing classes ect have i7-5820k&amp;#39;s and 780Tis and 970s &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "name": "t1_dg42km1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491932944.0, "created_utc": 1491904144.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
