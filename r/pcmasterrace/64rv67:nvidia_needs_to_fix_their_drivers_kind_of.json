That&amp;#39;s... so weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, something else of interest, it appears just in general that AMD GPUs (at 720p to keep them from being bottlenecked so much) shift the performance delta of the 1800X vs the 6900 by about 10% in the 1800X&amp;#39;s favor:   &lt;a href=\"https://thetechaltar.com/amd-ryzen-1800x-performance/2/\"&gt;https://thetechaltar.com/amd-ryzen-1800x-performance/2/&lt;/a&gt; At the bottom &amp;quot;Ryzen RX480 Comparison&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\nNot the crazy outliers you see with Nvidia GPUs, but marginal improvements when you tend to see the 1800X a bit behind the 6900k in the same games if you put it with a 1060 at 720p.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "name": "t1_dg4ohmc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491963934.0, "created_utc": 1491935134.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sgp1", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rv67", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4zkvl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Reanimations", "parent_id": "t1_dg4i5ns", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcmasterrace", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; rig benchmarks\n\nTypical AMD fangirl", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;rig benchmarks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typical AMD fangirl&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "name": "t1_dg4zkvl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491976319.0, "created_utc": 1491947519.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sgp1", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rv67", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sgp1", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rv67", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5gke5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "amaROenuZ", "parent_id": "t1_dg4rf4y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcmasterrace", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Rigging is Corsair's thing.\n\nSeriously, have you **seen** those sails on their logo?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rigging is Corsair&amp;#39;s thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously, have you &lt;strong&gt;seen&lt;/strong&gt; those sails on their logo?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "name": "t1_dg5gke5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491999515.0, "created_utc": 1491970715.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4rf4y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dravarden", "parent_id": "t1_dg4i5ns", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcmasterrace", "controversiality": 0, "body": "what rigging...?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;what rigging...?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "name": "t1_dg4rf4y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491967058.0, "created_utc": 1491938258.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sgp1", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rv67", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5m5py", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ptrkhh", "parent_id": "t1_dg4i5ns", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcmasterrace", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ashes anyone?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashes anyone?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "name": "t1_dg5m5py", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492011886.0, "created_utc": 1491983086.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4i5ns", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mtrai", "parent_id": "t3_64rv67", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcmasterrace", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Not the first time **NVIDIA** has tried to rig benchmarks.
