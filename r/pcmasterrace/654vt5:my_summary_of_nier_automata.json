I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to modify the game&amp;#39;s files in order to play it decently...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bethesda games suffer the same problem and people just accept it. Having no FOV slider or independent keybindings on an FPS shooter in 2015 is nothing but ridiculous. I&amp;#39;m tired of having to deal with Bethesda&amp;#39;s (and other developers&amp;#39;) incompetence when I pay the same as the console people, but get their shitty version that is made for the consoles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to release your game on X platform, you better support options that have become standard on that platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, FOV sliders and raw mouse input have been a must since 2010. Fallout 4 (2015) doesn&amp;#39;t support that. HELL, Skyrim Remaster doesn&amp;#39;t support it either.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "name": "t1_dg7rbjv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492128137.0, "created_utc": 1492099337.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sgp1", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654vt5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sgp1", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654vt5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8gvvd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ZeldaMaster32", "parent_id": "t1_dg8fvst", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcmasterrace", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've already replied to this response.
