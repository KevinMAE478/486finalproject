Scorpio also has 11% more shaders (Assuming Scorpio uses the same number of shaders per compute unit as Polaris though seeing as AMD has stuck with 64 for all GCN product this is likely) It&amp;#39;s clock speed is 7.5% slower than the rx 480. Micro architecturally it superficially resembles more a cut down Hawaii or perhaps a future small Vega than Polaris. (11 vs 8 CU&amp;#39;s / Shader Engine) This means it is likely that it will include the same number of ROPs and TMU&amp;#39;s as Hawaii/Fiji as opposed to the smaller amount found in Polaris however this is just speculation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "name": "t1_dga08b5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492244752.0, "created_utc": 1492215952.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ptv5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nullSword", "parent_id": "t1_dg9isod", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcmasterrace", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's going to be one expensive console if it has a 580.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s going to be one expensive console if it has a 580.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "name": "t1_dg9ptv5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492231179.0, "created_utc": 1492202379.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9isod", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Issac1709", "parent_id": "t1_dg98x41", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcmasterrace", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I am suspecting the RX580 is powering it since it's slightly more powerful than a 480 and we know a 580 is going to be a 480 with more cores and higher clocks ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am suspecting the RX580 is powering it since it&amp;#39;s slightly more powerful than a 480 and we know a 580 is going to be a 480 with more cores and higher clocks &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "name": "t1_dg9isod", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492222717.0, "created_utc": 1492193917.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg98x41", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Computeria", "parent_id": "t1_dg94q7g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcmasterrace", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Same here.
