The desktop environment is (to drastically oversimplify) the graphical part of the operating system.  I suppose the closest analogy for Windows would be everything graphical that &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; a program you installed yourself.  The code that lets you manage windows and how they&amp;#39;re drawn, (non-Internet) Explorer, the start menu, control panel, Notepad, system accessories, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Linux, common choices are GNOME, Xfce, and KDE, among others.  I&amp;#39;ve found KDE is the most &amp;quot;Windows-like&amp;quot;, so that&amp;#39;s what I want to go with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding programs, this is actually why I&amp;#39;ve spent the last... decade and a half or so deliberately weaning myself off software that doesn&amp;#39;t also run under Linux where possible.  As it stands, the biggest problem for me &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; is games and a few programs I can realistically live without.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the black magic, you&amp;#39;re thinking of PCI express pass-through.  I don&amp;#39;t know much about it, but you can basically route a hardware device through to a VM directly, so that instead of emulating the device in software, the VM just uses it directly.  The idea being to run a Windows VM at almost full speed.  The catch is that the host OS can&amp;#39;t use that device at all (hence two GPUs).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcmasterrace", "name": "t1_dgbpj7l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492347583.0, "created_utc": 1492318783.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbpbdt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Chocobubba", "parent_id": "t1_dgbp4ue", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcmasterrace", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What's KDE?\n\nIf I knew I could get all my stuff working in Linux properly I'd switch.
