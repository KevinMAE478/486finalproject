It doesn't take a year to understand how to build a PC.\n\n&gt; What game got you into PC gaming?\n\nNot one in particular, I just liked all the benefits of the platform. I've been getting into Overwatch recently though. \n\n&gt; And why Xbox over PS4?\n\nAll my friends moved from Xbox 360 to Xbox 1, so I just picked based on that.\n\n&gt; How much are your friends willing to throw down on your one man sweatshop you got planned?\n\nMost of them haven't given a number yet, but have started saving up. I told them that even beginning to pick out parts yet is borderline pointless since we have no numbers on how the game will perform, and what hardware will be necessary/recommended. Some of them want a PC to push a 4k60 tv, some just want 1080p60, and one actually wants 1080p144hz. I've informed them that the $500-$800 price point is where the competition gets spicy, with price/performance ratios being heavily considered. That being said, a few of them have said that ~$1500 would be their max. \n\n&gt; No hate intended. But fuck destiny. I stand by that.\n\nI mean that's fine and all, but we do still enjoy the game. Maybe not so much the activities themselves as much as the social aspect of it. We've run the endgame raids in Destiny to the point where we rarely have to communicate about what's happening, and end up joking around for hours. \n\nGranted, we know the game has its fair share of flaws such as the entire story being gutted days before release and most of the DLC being on-disk at launch, but we do still enjoy it.
