It seems kind of strange thing to state since I assume it's not possible for a company to know what the GPU was used for. \n\nI personally don't use my GPU's for mining but they are still put under severe strain for 10+ hours a day while working with game engines, most stock PCB cards never last more than 3 years. It's usually the VRM's that give out, which in turn fries the GPU itself. The stuff they put on stock PCB's is usually only rated to last a few thousand hours at 105 C, a temperature which is easily reached under heavy load especially when the card comes factory overclocked but still uses a stock NVIDIA PCB. They have no sensors so you won't be aware it's that hot.\n\nIf you want durability you will have to get a card that uses a fully custom PCB, with extra power phases, higher grade components, mini-heatsinks on the VRM area and GPU/VRM/VRAM contact with the heatsink using two or more in-take fans. Of course those GPU's are much more expensive than stock models so they're generally never used for mining.\n\nI should note that just because a card has a custom cooler doesn't mean it uses a custom PCB.
