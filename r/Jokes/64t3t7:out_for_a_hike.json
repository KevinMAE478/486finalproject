We careened down the road, veering dangerously close to our own deaths when some god forsaken horse bolted out in front of us and, in a last act of defiance, stared down our car with its psychotic, empty eyes.\n\n\nWe struck that dumb beast with the full force of an unrestrained Chevrolet Continental, flinging it what seemed like 20 feet up in the air. The horse flopped and bounced down the road, its path was left painted by carnage where it's legs had shattered, and for the next few stunned and breathless moments we were frozen, motionless with fear. Pop tried to find out if everybody was okay, but I didn't have the wits to muster a \"yessir\". I heard him mumble something about finding help as he scrambled out of the car and disappeared down the road.\n\n\nMa didn't say much. She checked on me for a few minutes, but there wasn't much to it. We waited in agonizing patience until the noises started. A dying, gurgling whinny ripped through the veiled stillness. It shook me with dread. I looked to Ma, expecting to see her disgust, but instead saw a face of mild curiosity. She quietly exited the car and wandered over to the miserable animal. She bent over, petting it for a few minutes. Back and forth, back and forth. A rhythmic caress to ease it's passage. The deathly whine melted away and was replaced by a raspy excited breath, matching the cadence of my mothers comfort. As she knelt down next to the horse she began to sing softly. A lullaby that had soothed me to sleep on many nights.\n\n\nThen I saw it. She hadn't been petting the horse, she was stroking it's long manhood (or horsehood if you prefer). I watched disbelieving as she muscled and tugged a two foot long mangled horse penis. I shrunk back in my seat, cold sickness grabbed hold of me. The hollow sound of the horses breathing and the thick slap of its putrid cock being handled by my mother's arms brought me to the brink of insanity. I sunk into the car, thoughts, and colors, and shadows, and senses washed over me. I felt motionless as the world rocked and tumbled around me. My mouth felt dry and full of thick dust. I rocked in my seat, panting. I tore at my hair until it caused my face to squinch up as tears poured from my eyes. The horror was never-ending.\n\n\nA solitary gunshot rang out, drowning out the sound of my mother's wretchedness. Apparently Pop had found the cattleman who owned the poor horse and they had come back to bring mercy to the beast. I heard voices and cries so I left the safe embrace of the backseat and peeked over the dash, trembling in sheer terror.

We careened down the road, veering dangerously close to our own deaths when some god forsaken horse bolted out in front of us and, in a last act of defiance, stared down our car with its psychotic, empty eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We struck that dumb beast with the full force of an unrestrained Chevrolet Continental, flinging it what seemed like 20 feet up in the air. The horse flopped and bounced down the road, its path was left painted by carnage where it&amp;#39;s legs had shattered, and for the next few stunned and breathless moments we were frozen, motionless with fear. Pop tried to find out if everybody was okay, but I didn&amp;#39;t have the wits to muster a &amp;quot;yessir&amp;quot;. I heard him mumble something about finding help as he scrambled out of the car and disappeared down the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ma didn&amp;#39;t say much. She checked on me for a few minutes, but there wasn&amp;#39;t much to it. We waited in agonizing patience until the noises started. A dying, gurgling whinny ripped through the veiled stillness. It shook me with dread. I looked to Ma, expecting to see her disgust, but instead saw a face of mild curiosity. She quietly exited the car and wandered over to the miserable animal. She bent over, petting it for a few minutes. Back and forth, back and forth. A rhythmic caress to ease it&amp;#39;s passage. The deathly whine melted away and was replaced by a raspy excited breath, matching the cadence of my mothers comfort. As she knelt down next to the horse she began to sing softly. A lullaby that had soothed me to sleep on many nights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I saw it. She hadn&amp;#39;t been petting the horse, she was stroking it&amp;#39;s long manhood (or horsehood if you prefer). I watched disbelieving as she muscled and tugged a two foot long mangled horse penis. I shrunk back in my seat, cold sickness grabbed hold of me. The hollow sound of the horses breathing and the thick slap of its putrid cock being handled by my mother&amp;#39;s arms brought me to the brink of insanity. I sunk into the car, thoughts, and colors, and shadows, and senses washed over me. I felt motionless as the world rocked and tumbled around me. My mouth felt dry and full of thick dust. I rocked in my seat, panting. I tore at my hair until it caused my face to squinch up as tears poured from my eyes. The horror was never-ending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A solitary gunshot rang out, drowning out the sound of my mother&amp;#39;s wretchedness.
