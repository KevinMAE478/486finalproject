People I meet during quests, during Slayer tasks, skilling in general and certain minigames are generally quite friendly and people as long as they aren&amp;#39;t afking too hard, are willing to have a chat. I haven&amp;#39;t had a slayer task in a while where I haven&amp;#39;t made at least one friend, and had to clear an old contact from a decade ago to make room for a new, active friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, those moments where I think &amp;quot;Jesus fucking christ this community makes me sick they&amp;#39;re all autistic cunts&amp;quot; is when you interact with any of the following;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to anyone who is an avid Pker, not a real Pker, I mean the ones who hunt at green drags, black chins, wine of zammy, clue hunters etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hang out at grand exchange, any populated world. Not just because of beggers, lots of attention seekers saying stupid shit trying to be funny, or some maxed level dude wearing fashionscape talking to a few people feeling smug and jerking themselves to their character&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who use cannons. Honestly, the ranged xp is so shit. There are people with near max combat stats like me using cannons still. It&amp;#39;s painful to watch. That&amp;#39;s just a small factor, the main one is dumping a cannon in a crowded area is like a middle finger to everyone and passive aggressively saying &amp;quot;hop pls&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who say &amp;#39;hop pls&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pkers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Okay, the cannon thing I was wrong about the minor point. I haven&amp;#39;t actually used a cannon since back in the day and forgot it&amp;#39;s for quicker kills -&amp;gt; quicker slay xp not so much ranged. HOWEVER, bros, I still don&amp;#39;t fucking like those people. Most cannoners I see in Nieve&amp;#39;s cave are rude as fuck, or just don&amp;#39;t say anything and dump their cannon in the middle of a popular spot. Someone is just like &amp;quot;aww dude..&amp;quot; and they aggressively say fuck off or just &amp;#39;hop pls&amp;#39;. So no, I stand by what I said. Fuck the cannons. 3DMG is better at killing titans anyways&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "2007scape", "name": "t1_dg5esm7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491996654.0, "created_utc": 1491967854.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wbww", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sui9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wbww", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sui9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wbww", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sui9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg581yx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Berowalt", "parent_id": "t1_dg53bk0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/2007scape", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ya man, currently on the grind for 99 rc.
