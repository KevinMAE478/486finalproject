Whilst we didn&amp;#39;t community with Vault himself, we did communicate with Mod Cav (previously known as Fatcav) and Mod Jack H (Web developer and community manager). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game was intended on being released, everything was going well and after beta we did in fact have private alpha testing which was only made for moderators and admins to try prior to the release of the game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I remember, donations were put towards Mod Vault helping a real life friend pay through his cancer treatment and finally towards the server. After the game was shut down, he created a OSRS fan based website now known as 2007HQ.
