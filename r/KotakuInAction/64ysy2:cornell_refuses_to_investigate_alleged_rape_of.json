The ones that agree with such abusive rad-fem ideology (such as Cornell is pushing) are regulated to neutered working class peons, doing all the work, but without the benefit of respect or reproduction.\n\n* This is why the MGTOW movement is showing up in such societies. Grown up boys that realize they have no chance to compete in such a brutal market, simply dropping out of it.  This is a HUGE problem for the Oligarchs running our modern, industrialized governments.  Japan has a HUGE problem with this currently, and it's becoming more common elsewhere too, including the USA.\n\n* Then there are Men's Rights Activists, who believe in equality, demand recognition of the destructive sexism perpetrated against men, and absolving it into *actual* equality.  Mostly benevolent, still active members of society. Working inside the system to improve the situation.
