That he got fired? I think we&amp;#39;re talking in different contexts.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me put it another way... it&amp;#39;s like the thing with Marvel comics. Yeah, their comics line has gone to pot because of all the virtue signalling from writers/artists... but ultimatly Marvel upper management decided to hire &amp;amp; continue to employ these people, and to actually publish what they produced. Marvel is not absolved from responsibility for the recent spate of SocJusty comic books... it was their decision to go down that route &amp;amp; alienate their fan base.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same with FemFreq... except much simpler: It&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Anita&amp;#39; personal brand&lt;/em&gt;, and it always was. She possesses final decision on everything her organization says, and always has. Every word McIntosh wrote was approved by her before hand. Just because the words were actually spoken on camera by her does not make her the mouthpiece... really it&amp;#39;s the reverse, because &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; always had the &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dge2obj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492489973.0, "created_utc": 1492461173.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbcbi4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nijata", "parent_id": "t1_dgaqop2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Think of it like this, Kojima vs the guy who helped write a few missions in msgv (say he exclusively wrote the skull face stuff) ...
