Since variety TV shows are by far the most consistently popular TV shows, and made-in-Japan fictional TV and movie dramas seldom have a chance for foreign characters to provide much of a role because they reflect the non-fictional society where foreigners from Western countries are an extreme minority and don't speak well enough to make for a meaningful part (Asian foreigners make up much more of a the foreign population and as such they also dominate the casting in entertainment when foreigners are cast), and because nearly every week Japanese TV has [more than a couple](https://youtu.be/Sfajmm-oGHA?t=1643) of [these types of segments](https://youtu.be/nwrugCQz-bM) across [its various shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CL_kgjhIzk), these types of roles provide more opportunities than any other segment.

[JOY for instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moy_2DELpEw), who hosted the Dragon Quest XI release date announcement (which for us, is an incredibly high profile gig that is usually only given to high profile celebrities) and pops up on TV all the time (his real name is Joseph Greenwood) is half English and half Japanese, as is his sister Sophia. Other prominent examples include [Eiji Wentz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYVTbegARDE), [Ilmari from RIP SLYME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbRvIOpe1uQ), [Crystal Kay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2KFy653TvE), [Jero the black Enka singer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phiC7FVItY4), [Yuji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyvvqemyMEM), and that guy who always appears on morning wide shows whose name I don't know because I hate politics, but he has awful died blond hair. It's more often that you get half Japanese half something else here, because the ability to speak naturally is important and very few Western people ever get that far, but it's also the area where you're going to see a lot more representation of people from different countries. And I don't want to hear about how mixed people aren't a good example. That's not nice to mixed people. Quite a few of them identify with parts of the culture of the foreign blood in them. Still, however, foreigners from Asian countries, especially South Koreans, who outnumber every other country's contributions in sheer size, number and frequency, are more frequently seen here than any other type of foreigner.\n\nThe third area they're seen most in is Japanese-created commercials. Usually of course Japanese people show up, and usually of course, there's dubbing over of foreign commercials with Japanese voices. But there's also [a lot more opportunities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH8-pfEisQ8) for [foreigners to play roles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4htOXW9qf2s) there too. Japanese commercials are loud and I can see why people might think they're annoying, but if foreigners are loud and annoying in the commercials, it's because Japanese are also frequently loud and annoying too. It's kind of arms race to be as eye-catching as possible. (Obviously there's also the cases of foreign actors being hired to do commercials, but a feel like a lot of people already know about this.)\n\nAfter all that, you will finally come to the niche roles that infrequently get hired on TV dramas and fiction, or movies, and the last few I saw were: a beautiful English teacher who was worshiped by the boys in the high school in a flash back sequence; an exchange student who attracted all the attention from the other students; a few suspects in a murder case at a tourist resort and a bullying victim in a drama about teenage delinquents. Loud, annoying American roles are not only something I don't often see (perhaps it's more an anime thing, I don't watch that very much, but if so that would put it in a very different category, because animation is frequently about exaggerating for comedic effect) but I often don't even see Americans in general when I see a foreigner on TV or movies.\n\nAnd when they are on the screen, they are very seldom fat and ugly and more often pretty attractive.
