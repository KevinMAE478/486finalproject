It jumps to conclusions, and then never, ever admits it was wrong. Heck, it&amp;#39;s been known to actively ignore facts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EG: The Korryn Gaines case; BLM cared more about how the cops shut down her Facebook account than the fact that she put her 5-year old in the line of fire. BLM claimed she was killed over traffic violations, but ignoring the part where she pointed a shotgun at cops for no reason. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or shall we talk about Michael Brown, and how BLM desperately ignores or tries to hand-wave away the video of innocent widdle Big Mike Brown robbing a store, or claims that when he initially got in a fight with Officer Wilson he was just defending himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLM doesn&amp;#39;t care about cops&amp;#39; actual motives&lt;/strong&gt;. They just make crap up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe if she had backup? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She &lt;strong&gt;did&lt;/strong&gt;!
