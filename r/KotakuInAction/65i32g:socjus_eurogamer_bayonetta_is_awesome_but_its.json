A sexy scene does not make a character objectified. You have to look at the entire context to see that. \n\nSo let's look at the factors that make something objectified, and see if Bayonetta fits in. \n\n&gt;Instrumentality \u2013 treating the person as a tool for another's purposes\n\nNo. By and large, Bayonetta is the one treating others as tools for her own purpose. Not entirely so. One of the great parts of her character is that she's a female version of the gruff cynic with a heart of gold. \n\n&gt;Denial of autonomy \u2013 treating the person as lacking in autonomy or self-determination\n\nSome people would argue that all games mean their characters are objectified in this way, but I think that's hogwash. Again, By and large Bayo is doing what she wants to do. Is the story pushing her along? Sure. But again, no more than, and probably less than most other examples of storytelling. \n\n&gt;Inertness \u2013 treating the person as lacking in agency or activity\n\n... Right\n\n&gt; Fungibility \u2013 treating the person as interchangeable with (other) objects\n\nOh hell no. It's even in her theme song. \"You're one of a kind\". \n\n&gt;Violability \u2013 treating the person as lacking in boundary integrity and violable, \"as something that it is permissible to break up, smash, break into.\"\n\nI think here's where the argument is. I think the argument that people are making (even if they don't understand it, which they probably don't), is that the sexy poses and camera angles are an invasion into Bayo's personal space and integrity. But that's an assumption that the character isn't presented with any agency in terms of what is going on. And that's not really the case. \n\nThere's actually a lot of reason to believe that she's intentionally vamping for the camera of the player.  The biggest is the auto-taunt that's done after holding the breakdance shooting thing for too long. \n\n&gt;Ownership \u2013 treating the person as though they can be owned, bought, or sold\n\nBayo is presented as the character who buys and sells, not who is bought or sold. \n\n&gt;Denial of subjectivity \u2013 treating the person as though there is no need for concern for their experiences or feelings\n\nBecause of the use of the, again, hardass with a heart of gold trope type, you don't get this either. \n\nIn short, the only objectification going on here is the objectification of the character that's in the head of the author, largely surrounding denial of agency. This isn't a unique issue. Denial of agency is a huge problem for that pop feminism/progessivism culture.

I think the argument that people are making (even if they don&amp;#39;t understand it, which they probably don&amp;#39;t), is that the sexy poses and camera angles are an invasion into Bayo&amp;#39;s personal space and integrity. But that&amp;#39;s an assumption that the character isn&amp;#39;t presented with any agency in terms of what is going on. And that&amp;#39;s not really the case. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s actually a lot of reason to believe that she&amp;#39;s intentionally vamping for the camera of the player.  The biggest is the auto-taunt that&amp;#39;s done after holding the breakdance shooting thing for too long. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ownership \u2013 treating the person as though they can be owned, bought, or sold&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bayo is presented as the character who buys and sells, not who is bought or sold. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Denial of subjectivity \u2013 treating the person as though there is no need for concern for their experiences or feelings&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of the use of the, again, hardass with a heart of gold trope type, you don&amp;#39;t get this either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, the only objectification going on here is the objectification of the character that&amp;#39;s in the head of the author, largely surrounding denial of agency. This isn&amp;#39;t a unique issue. Denial of agency is a huge problem for that pop feminism/progessivism culture.
