I'd say anything above that, especially if you can approach or surpass $50 million is a bigger success or a big hit.\n\nTo give you some examples, again converting roughly to US dollars, for some other recent American films:\n\n- La La Land: Opened with $5 million and is still going strong with around $35 million to date (still in theaters). \n\n- Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children: Opened with $2.5 million, ended up with around $10 million.\n\n- Resident Evil: The Final Chapter: Opened with $5 million, ended up with around $37 million.\n\n- Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: Opened with around $7 million, finished with around $64 million.\n\n- Doctor Strange: Opened with around $3.5 million, ended up with around $17 million.\n\n- Moana: Opened with around $5 million, still in theaters and around $34 million.\n\nNow let's compare some recent domestic titles:\n\n- Kiseki: Opened with $2 million, ended up with about $12 million.\n\n- Aibou IV: Opened with $3.5 million, ended up with about $15 million.\n\n- Doraemon: Arctic Adventure: Opened with $6 million, around $33 million right now and still in theaters.\n\n- Sword Art Online: Opened with around $4 million, ended up with around $18 million.\n\n- Yokai Watch 3: Opened with around $5 million, ended up with around $27 million.\n\n- In a Corner of the World: Didn't chart the first few weeks, ended up with around a $20 million take four months later.\n\nAnd then for perspective, the only two movies which have been mega hits recently are Shin Godzilla, which started around $6 million and eventually made around $76 million, and Your Name, which started around $9 million and ended up making around $225 million to be the second most successful domestic success of all time after Spirited Away.
