Actually it turns out there's a couple, sexist bigot is probably the nicest one I could use in mixed company.\n\nSo to reiterate you think women are dumb, to dumb to achieve success on their own &amp; so the superior males had to be restricted so the inferior females could have a chance to succeed.\n\nBecause otherwise you'd just have left the talent search open to everyone.&amp; then a person would have been picked from the most talented of the pool. The only reason to restrict that is if you think women are so inferior to men, that you think all men must be removed from the pool to ensure that a woman could succeed.\n\n&gt;The outcry was immediate and vitriolic. \n\nWell not quite, it took me a couple of minutes between having seen the announcement in my facebook feed from Green Ronin &amp; the time I posted in on KIA, getting the ball rolling.\n\n&gt;I refuse to link to any of the trolls involved,\n\nOh come on, you know you want to name drop me, I don't mind.\n\n&gt;but cries of discrimination against white men were on all the major gaming discussion boards, some gamers even suggesting that Green Ronin was destroying their company, alienating their fan base by committing such a heinous act against men. \n\nIt's almost like you discriminated against men or something, wait, that's exactly what you did.\n\n&gt;It would have been hilarious had it not mirrored so closely what passes for public dialog in the United States.\n\n\"Bill Bodden declares workplace discrimination on the basis of gender to be funny\" I think I have the title of my next article.\n\n&gt;All it really takes to obliterate the favorite claims of these knuckle-draggers that being a game designer is a \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is to look at the number of gaming projects out there, and how few of them include even ONE, SINGLE woman in a writing or designing capacity. \n\nThat's not a rebuttal to the existence of a meritocracy. Same way pointing out that romance novels are written almost exclusively by straight middle class white women isn't an argument against meritocracy in the romance writing industry.\n\n&gt;There are damned few, and mathematically, that doesn\u2019t bear out any kind of reasonable statistical analysis. \n\nOf course it does. Just because you don't understand statistics doesn't mean it doesn't make sense. Seriously weren't you like Sales Guru at Green Ronin for like 5 years &amp; yet you don't understand basic statistics? \n\n&gt;Women are slightly more than 50% of the population, yet probably less than 5% of game designers are women. \n\nThey sure do, what they don't make up is 50% of the market audience for RPG's. You know in the same way that straight men don't make up 50% of the market audience for harlequin romance novels, or women's fashion magazines. \n\nAs such there will be a smaller starting pool of women interested in creating material for RPG's, so there will be a smaller amount in the final shake out.That's not  sign of sexism, it's a sign of equality of opportunity in practice, it's a sign of the free market doing what it does.\n\n&gt;John Wick Presents has made a point of specifically recruiting talented women to work on the wildly successful reboot of 7th Sea,\n\nSo you say, but assuming that's true &amp; we have to assume because your link doesn't go anywhere related to your claim, I doubt he did it by having a women only talent search.\n\n&gt;Green Ronin has long been a target of trolls. Their left-wing politics make them an easy target for the Alt-Right and the Men\u2019s Right\u2019s Movements\n\nOh so the MRA &amp; Alt-Right teamed up, created a team of experts, who then in classic heist movie fashion broke in to the home office of the social media contact person &amp; then made you discriminate against men.\n\nWell that's alright then, clearly you'll be announcing that the talent search will now be open to everyone &amp; not just women, since you would never discriminate on the basis of gender like a sexist bigot.\n\n&gt;That point is that we don\u2019t have to kill each other over scraps anymore. We no longer have to live in caves and scratch a living in the dirt; we can help each other, giving opportunity to those who have less. \n\nExcept that since all individuals would have the same level of less in this case \"less the wrok this job would provide\" they are all equally less, so which group among the all equally less are you helping &amp; on what grounds?\n\n&gt;Women still only make 78 cents for every dollar a man earns doing the same work at the same job; if you can\u2019t see that as discrimination, you are willfully blind.\n\nIt's not discrimination, it's how much a woman EARNS, not how much two identically skilled people working in the same industry, in the same job, at the same company, with the same level of experience &amp; expertise are paid.\n\n&gt;Those goofballs who claim they\u2019re are being passed over for freelance jobs because of women need to take a long, hard look in the mirror.\n\nExcept they in this case will actually be 100% factually, objectively, demonstrably right. You LITERTALLY passed over every man who could ever conceivably apply for this job from the get go by not allowing them to apply. \n\nEvery single one of those men will LITERALLY be passed over so a woman could get the job.\n\nAnd note when I say LITERALLY, I mean literally, not figuratively, LITERALLY.\n\n&gt;I consider myself a mediocre writer and I\u2019ve had no problem finding work in the gaming biz. \n\nAnd yet if you applied for this job, you'd also be passed over for the position, because they decided they were going to hire a woman.\n\n&gt;Someone who really tried and worked hard to improve their craft could do better than I have. \n\nAnd yet no matter how good that person is or gets they would STILL not be capable of getting this job if that person happened to be male.\n\n&gt;I was surprised: not that what the author recounts had happened, but at how many men were outraged by this essay.
