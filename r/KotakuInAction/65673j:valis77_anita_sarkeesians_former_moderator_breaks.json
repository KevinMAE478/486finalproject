I don't know what the specific offense is, but I'd easily bet my last year's earnings that it wasn't taking a drunken piss in the wrong place. From that, we know he has issues with other people's boundaries and standards of public decency and behavior. He has made videos of himself riding his bicycle through school zones that he is supposed to be restricted from entering. From that, we can garner that he has problems not only with authorities but accepting the repercussions of his actions. He was doing that to say \"Ha! Ha! You can't get me! You can't stop me from doing what I want! Ha Ha!\", that's why he was doing that. We also know that he has participated in toeing the SJW line and engaging in SJW zealotry and virtue signalling. That, I think was an evidence of how he is socially opportunistic. He lost position because of his conviction and playing SJW was an attempt at gaining it back through religious ahdherance and virtue signalling.\n\nHere's a couple other things we can discern about this guy. Did you hear those grunts he was making? Those are ticks. Those ticks are the result of some sort of mental illness. Did you hear that weird affected laugh he did about halfway through? He was putting on an ill fitting mask of sorts that was both revealing and obfuscating. He hides his real persona. He attempts to wear the skin of the people he wants the approval of. This video, though, seems to demonstrate an unsurety of which skin to wear.\n\nSo, what was he saying in the video? He starts off with \"Oh, I didn't really like Anita at first. So, I decided to infiltrate her crew.\" That, right there, is a \"Greetings, fellow kids\" and \"I was just pretending to be retarded\" all rolled into one. A little past the halfway mark, he transitions to \"I'm still buddies with Anita and I banned the people that I banned because I had to\". This is him clinging to the virtue signal that he thought would get him what it failed to. Just in case, probably.\n\nThis video should serve to be a case study of the most distilled psyche of the SJW. Of course, they're not all rambling mental patients, but the disjointed logic is often there. The exercised inability or unwillingness to connect one idea to the next. The, in this case, blatant attempts at wearing the skin of the crowd you want to belong to *because you think it will get something* is all there. \n\nWhoa, lad, this video was hard to watch. And this guy is definitely fucked in the head. But it does serve to demonstrate some important things. \n\nedit: Also notice that he avoids specifically saying what he means by \"my past\".
