Yeah, that shit might suit your peers just fine, but they're not in the habit of engaging their brains, are they? You tell 'em shit that is compatible with their bigoted preconceptions and they're happy to swallow it up no matter how retarded it may actually be. However, try as desperately as you might to explain it to those of us who are capable of seeing through bullshit, there's nothing of substance there. It all just ends up coming off like an ill-considered rant made by an unhinged twat who is trying way too hard to curry the favor of the other unhinged twats that he runs with. Good for you, I guess. \n\n&gt;Oh joy. You make a joke about breathless reporting of how many more pixels a PC port pushes being MRA territory and your mentions encuntify.\n\nNope. You're simply discovering that some people just aren't satisfied with simply accepting whatever nonsensical drivel you might utter in your sad desperation to let everyone around you know how totes progressive you are. You said something profoundly stupid, you said it about something that's actually pretty innocuous, and you framed it all in a way that portrays anyone who might consider it to be important to them as being socially unacceptable monsters. Do you really not understand why that might not go over well, or why? Are you a fucking sociopath? \n\nYeah, I get that you and yours are under the delusion that you should be able to put any old garbage out into the public space without it being challenged or questioned, and that you perceive any disagreement as if it's a grave injustice, but that's not how the world works. What you're facing here are the consequences of mouthing off like a twat. I suggest that you get used to it, because you don't seem to be smart enough to know when shutting the fuck up might be the better course of action. \n\n&gt;Correct. I do not like MRAs, so if we had better reporting around ports instead of fostering hardware divas, maybe things'd be less shit?\n\nYou don't like MRAs because you're too far up your own feminist ass to understand what they're really about, but that's really neither here nor there. What I'm confused about is why you seem to attribute what you perceive as \"hardware diva\" behavior to reporting. \n\nHow did you come to that conclusion? Because it's not actually a case of irresponsible reporting leading people to care about something they wouldn't have otherwise, it's an example of how the things that people care about tend to inform what gets reported on. Publishers mention this shit because they know that their potential market cares about it, and journalists mention it because they know that their readers care about it. I don't know that hardware divas are a real thing to begin with, but if they do exist they'd exist no matter how this information is presented to them. \n\nSo what I get from this is that you either don't understand causality, or this is just something that you pulled out of your ass in the hopes that it would look just plausible enough to justify all the irrational bullshit that preceded it. Only it doesn't really make any logical sense one way or the other, so...better luck next time, I guess.  \n\n&gt;I am a goddamn dev and I'm telling you that obsession with PC hardware purism let's the bad people pretend they're your friends.\n\nSure, we video-game enthusiasts put our mutual appreciation for the hobby in greater importance than things like race, gender, religion, sexual preference, or any of the other equally inconsequential characteristics that you and yours believe define people, but that doesn't mean that we're so shallow and of such narrow focus that we're incapable of recognizing bad actors when we see them. \n\nReally though, I think that if your ridiculous hypothetical speaks to any group at all it's you and yours. After all, aren't you the twat who has been running off at the mouth about shit he doesn't understand properly, like MRAs, GamerGate, and KiA, not to mention PC gamers who happen to find resolution and framerates important, all for the sake of endearing yourself to your social justice peers? Peers who include pedophiles and sexual predators, all of whom were accepted into your sad little group based solely on your shared hatred of things that you don't understand? That was you projecting, wasn't it? \n\nOh, and nice appeal to authority, dude. When all else fails, wag your credentials in people's faces, am I right? They're absolutely fucking meaningless in this discussion, but I can understand the desperation you must surely have felt. It can't be easy seeing your every stupid argument be destroyed. \n\n&gt;MRAs seem to be weirdly comfortable in the PC gamer communities that need messaging of their superiority to other gamers.\n\nWe've already established that PC Master Race is a fucking lighthearted joke, so maybe, just maybe, the actual appeal of PC gaming for MRAs is the same as it would be for anyone else with an interest in it; they just want to play the best version of their games! \n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you anyway, man? Holy shit!\n\n&gt; Can you use your hardware to its full potential without a Nazi moniker? Isn't all hardware playing a game at full potential, res regardless?\n\nYou can thank Alanis for my muddied understanding of irony, but I really think that pretending to give a shit about \"Nazi monikers\" after all the ignorant bigotry you've laid down on MRAs, KiA, GamerGate, and the PCMR must certainly qualify. You don't understand any of it, and yet here you are so filled with hatred towards those things all the same. Fuck, man, Hitler would be proud of you! \n\nBut yeah, that question's pretty fucking stupid. Look at any launch game for any console, then look at games made nearer the end of its cycle. With the understandable exception of whatever shovelware a developer might crap out at the end of a system's life in order to capitalize on its userbase, you'll typically see a pretty fucking huge difference between them in terms of graphics and performance. Those things improve over time as developers get more and more familiar with hardware. It's the reason why we're not still playing games that look like they belong on the fucking Atari 2600, dude. I feel like this is shit that you should understand as a developer.  \n\nSo yeah, we can certainly be satisfied with what we have in the moment, but as technology continues to improve so do our expectations, as well they should. It's not unreasonable at all that folks would want a PC port of a several year-old game to perform better than it did on consoles that were inferior to PC hardware even when they were first released onto the market, and which have been eclipsed in terms of capability by far since. \n\nI guess the better question is why in the fuck you'd think that anyone would want a PC port released in 2017 to look and perform like a game released in 2009.  \n\n&gt;No, I think the tendency of PC hardware obsessed dick measurers to be friendly towards MRAs is weird. Most players don't do that.\n\nYou've not established that this tendency actually exists in the first place, dude, but I guess that's par for the course with you. \n\nNo, it's more likely by far that if MRAs are welcome into the fold by the PCMR it's because normal people don't tend to wear their political opinions on their sleeves like you and yours do, and PC gamers wouldn't care even if they did. Unlike you and your pals, they aren't ignorant bigots.\n\n", "edited": 1492210449.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wait, just in case you&amp;#39;re serious: Via the PC &amp;quot;master race&amp;quot; bullshit, kotakuinaction, gamergate and misogynist gamer dick measuring.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PC Master Race is joke about the superiority of PCs to gaming consoles, which you as a developer (something that you kindly remind us you are several times...) ought to know.
