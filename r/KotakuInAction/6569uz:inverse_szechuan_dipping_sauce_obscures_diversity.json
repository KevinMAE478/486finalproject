I'm reading *The GULAG Archipelago*, a piece of literature based on the testimony of dozens of survivors of the Soviet labor camps.\n\nThe height of insanity came under Stalin's rule, but it was all based on Marx and Lenin. Stalin had something called Article 58. If you read the first few dozen pages of *The GULAG Archipelago*, it details how anyone could get arrested at any time for any reason. Because Article 58 could be interpreted so broadly. Anything that does not further the Soviet state can be described as 'counter-revolutionary'.\n\nIf a machine you're using at work breaks, you could get hauled in for sabotage ('wrecking') on no evidence. If you try a new idea at your job and it fails, you have acted counter to the interests of the Soviet state.
