At no point should you ever have to drag someone who was sitting down in their seat off a plane during an overbooking resolution procedure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that they didn&amp;#39;t do that should clue you in to the fact that this wasn&amp;#39;t really an overbooking issue.  &lt;em&gt;Employees of the airline&lt;/em&gt; were the ones who wanted to board the airline, and rather than do the obvious thing and not fuck over &lt;em&gt;paying customers&lt;/em&gt; just because employees need to be transfered to another airport, they decided to kick people out.  Even if these employees really need to be transferred, it&amp;#39;s common sense that customers take priority in such a situation.  It&amp;#39;s just basic customer service: every effort can and should be made to ensure that customers are not aware or affected by fuckups on the part of your business, particularly things as basic as personnel management.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand why the CEO of United apologized for the actions of people that weren&amp;#39;t their own employees (beyond the fact that it was overbooked with people, they didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong IMO), or why this was a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were acting on United&amp;#39;s behalf.  That makes their behavior the responsibility of United Airlines.  This is a problem because someone had their face smashed into an armchair and was dragged unconscious off a plane by people who were &lt;em&gt;under orders by United&lt;/em&gt; for a reason that was entirely United fault and could have been easily resolved with even a basic appreciation of the concept of customer service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dg5oq00", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492019852.0, "created_utc": 1491991052.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tuum", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tuum", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tuum", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tuum", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6wo9h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Templar_Knight08", "parent_id": "t1_dg6tskf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yea, I just would have thought it would have been the police or airport security first, since the guys who drug the guy out were wearing cop vests. \n\nIDK.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yea, I just would have thought it would have been the police or airport security first, since the guys who drug the guy out were wearing cop vests. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IDK.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dg6wo9h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492075108.0, "created_utc": 1492046308.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6tskf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TacticusThrowaway", "parent_id": "t1_dg6smxm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Most of the heat was being directed at United, not security.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the heat was being directed at United, not security.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dg6tskf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492071645.0, "created_utc": 1492042845.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6smxm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Templar_Knight08", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ug5i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "True enough, I'm more surprised that he apologized before the airport on behalf of the cops.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;True enough, I&amp;#39;m more surprised that he apologized before the airport on behalf of the cops.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dg6smxm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492070199.0, "created_utc": 1492041399.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ug5i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TacticusThrowaway", "parent_id": "t1_dg5impr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He apologized because bad publicity.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He apologized because bad publicity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dg5ug5i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492032062.0, "created_utc": 1492003262.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tuum", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tuum", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6sq2u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Templar_Knight08", "parent_id": "t1_dg61rhg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Very well.
