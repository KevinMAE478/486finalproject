It refers to kneejerk, shallow left-liberals who are basically brainwashed by the mainstream media, believe Rachel Maddow or Ana Kasparian are unbiased commenters, and who haven&amp;#39;t sincerely tried to understand the other side&amp;#39;s arguments and instead just dismiss and mock. Sargon of Akkad is a left-liberal and no one would claim he is thoughtless or superficial or lacking in understanding of political philosophy so no one calls &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; a libtard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cuck&amp;quot; is meant metaphorically but basically it is used to mean someone who lets themselves get degraded, humiliated and treated like an inferior, whilst putting up with it or even welcoming it for &amp;#39;social justice&amp;#39; reasons. Yes, there is an ethnic subtext here but the metaphor itself doesn&amp;#39;t have to contain it (the &amp;quot;black bull&amp;quot; style of cuckold porn seems to mostly be a US thing). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Masculinist&amp;quot;... well last time I checked, the MHRM (which is often accused of being alt-right) didn&amp;#39;t use that phrase, and the term was only used by an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; advocate of male supremacy like Roosh V (who opposes the MHRM). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This article, basically, is meaningless.
