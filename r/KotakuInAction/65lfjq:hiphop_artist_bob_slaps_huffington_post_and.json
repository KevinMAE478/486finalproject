In fact, all images of the Earth from space are composite shots made up from multiple images. NASA even admits this. The only claimed real shot from space is the Blue Marble image taken in 1972 by the crew on Apollo 17.

The curvature is way too drastic and should not be taken as literal. For comparison the felix jump is at 128K feet, while this footage is of a rocket reaching 120K feet and the horizon is very much flat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGbvae62YEM There is some natural convex and concave effects on the horizon due to the lens, but if the camera is not angling too much you can see the flat horizon and no detectable curve.\n\nI fly quite often as I have family that lives overseas, I look out the window a lot because I prefer the window seat. There is no curve that can be seen when looking out the window. I love the beach and used to work in Santa Monica, California.

I don't believe it's at the distance we have been told it is. It could be a sphere, it could be a hologram, a projection, any number of things. Unfortunately, I have never been there so I can only speculate. There are a lot of convenient explanations about the moon, like why we only ever see one side of it, that lead me to doubt the claims made by main stream science and NASA.\n\nI feel the same way about the Sun. Who knows what it truly is? It could be a sphere, could be something else. I've seen stars through telescopes and they look nothing like our Sun, they look like lights when you look at them from underwater, constantly changing and warping. The Sun creates hot spots on the Earth's surface which shouldn't happen if the distance is roughly 92 million miles away. The way it sets/rises is also questionable, it shrinks in size when setting and increases when rising.

But I'm not stupid, I have a high IQ, I conduct my own experiments and try to use the scientific method to produce the same results in pursuit of evidence and undeniable proof.
