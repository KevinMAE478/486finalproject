You almost believe it. \n\nI bet you think you're really in good hands with Allstate.\n\n&gt; The creation of the Open Campus Initiative has shown us where Harvard students\u2019 values lie. It recently formed with the intention of bringing controversial speakers to Harvard as a way to promote free speech. By inviting these speakers, students are meant to engage in dialogue with people who have opposing viewpoints as a way to understand their opinions and bridge the partisan gaps between polarized groups in order to foster greater community.\n\nI like this plan. Debate, open exchange of ideas, respectful disagreement. Having your assumptions tested. The acknowledging that even if you think someone is wrong they are a person too and deserve equal time to defend their ideas and question yours.\n\n&gt; However, by allowing odious speakers on campus, Harvard is not promoting freedom of speech; it\u2019s promoting hate speech. \n\nGonna point out, first speaker mentioned in the linked article regarding these \"odious speakers\": Jordan Peterson. Also going to point out that, not to quote the dictionary, something odious is either disgusting (as in a smell) or inspires/deserves/merits hatred. The target of the hatred is the odious object. So, let me rephrase that last sentence and carve out some of the fluff, without (as best I can tell) changing the meaning:  \n\n     However, by allowing speakers I hate on campus, Harvard is promoting hate speech. \n\nSeems like the odious speakers ain't the one doing the hating when I phrase it like that, huh? \n\n&gt; Though OCI may claim not to agree with all the views presented by the speakers who are invited, they are still giving them a platform to speak. They are validating opinions which are extremely harmful to students that are being targeted on the basis of their existence and identity. \n\nDear god I hate to resort to the dictionary again but *you keep doing this*. To validate an opinion is to confirm or approve it, which is agreement with a connotation of official sanction or conclusive proof. \"Views\" and \"opinions\" are straight synonyms. One more time: \n\n     Though OCI may claim not to agree with the views presented, they are agreeing with the views presented.\n\nYa got some proof they're lying? Or is this an opinion you can't validate?\n\n&gt; We saw these twisted, hateful views welcome earlier this week with an event featuring a transphobic and misogynistic speaker: Jordan Peterson. \n\nI really should read these things fully before responding, I'd save typing time. Still, good to have warning the author hates him before he shows up on the telescreen for two minutes. So, any proof he hates transgender people and women? \n\n&gt; During the event, he rejected the delineation between biological sex and gender, refused to refer to people by their preferred gender pronouns, and rebuffed the existence of Women and Gender Studies as a field of academic study.\n\nThe fiend! A literal spelling/grammar Nazi who doesn't want to use made-up words! And how dare he rebuff the existence of Women and Gender Studies! Why, I bet he hates women so much he personally shakes the hand of every Men's Studies professor there! \n\nOh, wait, you don't *have* any of those? Not even an adjunct? Who's the one exhibiting hostile treatment of a specific gender again? \n\n&gt; We must make it clear that this back and forth is not an even fight. \n\nNot when you got a whole damn department behind you, it ain't!\n\n&gt; Equating a single individual\u2019s opinion to the same level of importance as an individual\u2019s identity is unacceptable. \n\nOK, fine. I identify as Jesus. My pronouns are the Lord/the Lord/the Lord's. I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. And it's Good Friday so you have to be extra nice to Me.\n\nSo, have you accepted Me and My teachings into your heart yet? Or do you have an... opinion... on My identity? \n\n&gt; We cannot afford to \u201ctest\u201d the limits of free speech. A very clear line already exists;\n\nWhich is why there's so little case law on the books about it. Jaywalking? Completely different. So much grey area, cases always going to the Supreme Court, I don't know how they get anything else done.\n\n&gt; you are welcome to your own opinion so long as your opinion does not threaten another person\u2019s existence. \n\nSo Jordan Peterson (or any of these speakers) threatens people's existence? Wow. If you have all this evidence he has committed a serious crime you'd think you could've just called the police. Faster and easier than a ~~riot~~protest.\n\n&gt; The line has been crossed here.\n\nCertainly has, and I don't think you noticed when you did it.\n\n&gt; Our intent is not to simply deafen ourselves to the perspectives of others that contradict our own; on the contrary\u2014we welcome ideas that are constructive, productive, and foster meaningful conversation about objective issues to broaden our horizons. \n\n\"My intent is not to flatten your tire,\" the man said as he slashed the tire repeatedly. \"On the contrary, I am inflating it.\" \n\nChallenge time: Describe an idea that is \"constructive, productive\" etc... that you disagree with. Because if you can't, that entire sentence reduces to \"we welcome ideas that we agree with\". \n\n&gt; Yet, when these platforms are instead manipulated and abused to further proselytize a disregard for another\u2019s identity, we cannot sit idle and allow such hateful rhetoric to stew. \n\nYou could just, you know, disagree with it. Doesn't even need to be a debate. If it's so evil it should be trivial to disprove; it doesn't take hard work to prove that kidnapping and eating babies is unacceptable. I'm sure most of these speakers wouldn't mind if you recorded their speech and did what I'm doing right now - pick it apart sentence by sentence. Hold a showing of your masterpiece or put it on Youtube (expect demonetization). I'm sure that the Open Campus Initiative would, in exchange for halting interference in their activities, gladly signal-boost your efforts. Maybe do alternate showings, one of their controversial speakers one week and one of your rebuttals the next. A month or two of making their speakers out to be hateful gibbering morons and you'd laugh them off of campus, never to bother you again. A little work now and you can coast the rest of your university career.\n\nOr are you afraid that's not what would happen? Because if you are, you either think you might be wrong, or you assume that other Harvard students are gibbering morons as well. \n\n&gt; Through the creation of the Open Campus Initiative, it seems like we are moving backwards rather than moving forward. \n\nIf you're looking over the back of the boat it does seem like you're moving backwards, yes.\n\n&gt; It enforces the notion that Harvard isn\u2019t a home for everyone when a large portion of our student body cannot feel safe here.\n\nA large portion. How large? Because the instant that \"portion\" crosses 50% - and recall that you led with the misogynist card - you are stating that the *majority* can't feel safe. Think about that for a second. \"We outnumber you but we're scared of you.\" Every time you mention the \"minority\" after that you are talking about the largest group, and every time you mention someone who threatens them you are talking about someone threatening the majority. You like synonyms - do you know some for \"person who doesn't want to hear from anyone who threatens the majority\"? \n\n&gt; Allowing such speakers on campus gives a message that the well-being of marginalized students is of little importance. Some of our colleagues on the Editorial Board seem to believe it is acceptable for such a burden to be placed on students by expecting them to attend these events in order to push back against those triggering opinions. \n\nI'm glad some of the Editorial Board does. Gives me hope when someone knows how to do their job.\n\n(Marginalized? Triggering? I think I just got bingo. The prize is I can just point to my &gt;50% argument again here, and whenever it applies.)\n\n&gt; Students who are members of the communities that have or will come under attack by controversial speakers already face enough discrimination on a daily basis. \n\nAttack? Discrimination? Are they being beaten? Are they being refused at the door? You just said some members of the Board *want them to go*! Why do you assume it's so much peril for one or two students to voice their disagreement to Jordan Peterson but no hardship at all for him to go there and give the damn speech?\n\n&gt; Having to constantly defend one\u2019s own identity and stand up for what\u2019s right is absolutely draining.\n\nOh you poor dear. As a FUCKING WHITE MALE I never have to do that.\n\n&gt; Having to constantly justify your own existence is exhausting. \n\nYou ever date someone who said \"death to [cis/trans][het/homo] [white/colored] [men/women]\" (delete/add as appropriate for your identity)? I haven't, because thank god she posted it in public before we'd scheduled. \n\n(Remember the days when \"homo\" and \"colored\" were bad words? Now I have to use 'em when I'm writing the opposites of what people call me.) \n\n&gt;  Is it asking too much to allow students to exist without constantly worrying about which speaker will be the next one to publicly invalidate their existence? Is it too much to ask that Harvard not be complicit in this charade?\n\nYour dictionary is leaking. \"Charade\" doesn't work in this context - who's being transparently deceptive? Everyone you oppose is being honest about their aims. Or are you also ascribing a secondary insidious motive to them? \n\n(Damn character limit.

You almost believe it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bet you think you&amp;#39;re really in good hands with Allstate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The creation of the Open Campus Initiative has shown us where Harvard students\u2019 values lie. It recently formed with the intention of bringing controversial speakers to Harvard as a way to promote free speech. By inviting these speakers, students are meant to engage in dialogue with people who have opposing viewpoints as a way to understand their opinions and bridge the partisan gaps between polarized groups in order to foster greater community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like this plan. Debate, open exchange of ideas, respectful disagreement. Having your assumptions tested. The acknowledging that even if you think someone is wrong they are a person too and deserve equal time to defend their ideas and question yours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, by allowing odious speakers on campus, Harvard is not promoting freedom of speech; it\u2019s promoting hate speech. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gonna point out, first speaker mentioned in the linked article regarding these &amp;quot;odious speakers&amp;quot;: Jordan Peterson. Also going to point out that, not to quote the dictionary, something odious is either disgusting (as in a smell) or inspires/deserves/merits hatred. The target of the hatred is the odious object. So, let me rephrase that last sentence and carve out some of the fluff, without (as best I can tell) changing the meaning:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; However, by allowing speakers I hate on campus, Harvard is promoting hate speech. \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seems like the odious speakers ain&amp;#39;t the one doing the hating when I phrase it like that, huh? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Though OCI may claim not to agree with all the views presented by the speakers who are invited, they are still giving them a platform to speak. They are validating opinions which are extremely harmful to students that are being targeted on the basis of their existence and identity. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dear god I hate to resort to the dictionary again but &lt;em&gt;you keep doing this&lt;/em&gt;. To validate an opinion is to confirm or approve it, which is agreement with a connotation of official sanction or conclusive proof. &amp;quot;Views&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;opinions&amp;quot; are straight synonyms. One more time: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Though OCI may claim not to agree with the views presented, they are agreeing with the views presented.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ya got some proof they&amp;#39;re lying? Or is this an opinion you can&amp;#39;t validate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We saw these twisted, hateful views welcome earlier this week with an event featuring a transphobic and misogynistic speaker: Jordan Peterson. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really should read these things fully before responding, I&amp;#39;d save typing time. Still, good to have warning the author hates him before he shows up on the telescreen for two minutes. So, any proof he hates transgender people and women? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During the event, he rejected the delineation between biological sex and gender, refused to refer to people by their preferred gender pronouns, and rebuffed the existence of Women and Gender Studies as a field of academic study.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fiend! A literal spelling/grammar Nazi who doesn&amp;#39;t want to use made-up words! And how dare he rebuff the existence of Women and Gender Studies! Why, I bet he hates women so much he personally shakes the hand of every Men&amp;#39;s Studies professor there! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait, you don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; any of those? Not even an adjunct? Who&amp;#39;s the one exhibiting hostile treatment of a specific gender again? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We must make it clear that this back and forth is not an even fight. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not when you got a whole damn department behind you, it ain&amp;#39;t!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Equating a single individual\u2019s opinion to the same level of importance as an individual\u2019s identity is unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK, fine. I identify as Jesus. My pronouns are the Lord/the Lord/the Lord&amp;#39;s. I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. And it&amp;#39;s Good Friday so you have to be extra nice to Me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, have you accepted Me and My teachings into your heart yet? Or do you have an... opinion... on My identity? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We cannot afford to \u201ctest\u201d the limits of free speech. A very clear line already exists;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why there&amp;#39;s so little case law on the books about it. Jaywalking? Completely different. So much grey area, cases always going to the Supreme Court, I don&amp;#39;t know how they get anything else done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;you are welcome to your own opinion so long as your opinion does not threaten another person\u2019s existence. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Jordan Peterson (or any of these speakers) threatens people&amp;#39;s existence?
