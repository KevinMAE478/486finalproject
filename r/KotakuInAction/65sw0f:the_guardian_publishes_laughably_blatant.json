He references games theory as proof of the superiority of anarchism, and cites Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek in questioning whether a reporter can ever truly get to know him. \n\nI can barely believe that this isn't satire.\n\n&gt;The self-defense claim has gained some steam in the media. A local TV station reported that emergency medical responders had found brass knuckles in Dukes\u2019 pocket, based on a readout of the EMS radio dispatch. (Dukes finds this allegation both amusing and infuriating. Within a few minutes of meeting a reporter, he eagerly drew the \u201cbrass knuckles\u201d out of his pocket, revealing what was actually a plastic finger strengthener used by guitarists.)\n\n1. There is only his word that the \"plastic finger strengthener\" is what the paramedic identified as brass knuckles.\n2. Any weighted object gripped in the palm functions as a \"brass knuckle.\"\n3. The Guardian seems to have forgotten to mention the \"**[large knife](http://www.king5.com/news/local/a-look-at-uw-shooting-self-defense-case/426671285)**\" that the medic also reported him having. I'm guessing that that was just a friendship knife for stabbing happiness into people?\n\n&gt;\u201cThey\u2019re a married couple. I assume they love each other,\u201d Sasha said of the Hokoanas. \u201cI assume they know what it feels like when someone you love is threatened. There\u2019s got to be some humanity somewhere.\u201d\n\nI'm also sure that they do, because that's why you were shot, scumbag.\n\n&gt;Sasha\u2019s eyes brim with tears when they remember the night of the shooting, seeing Dukes\u2019 body ripped apart, and being denied information about him because the pair were not yet married.

He references games theory as proof of the superiority of anarchism, and cites Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek in questioning whether a reporter can ever truly get to know him. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can barely believe that this isn&amp;#39;t satire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The self-defense claim has gained some steam in the media. A local TV station reported that emergency medical responders had found brass knuckles in Dukes\u2019 pocket, based on a readout of the EMS radio dispatch. (Dukes finds this allegation both amusing and infuriating. Within a few minutes of meeting a reporter, he eagerly drew the \u201cbrass knuckles\u201d out of his pocket, revealing what was actually a plastic finger strengthener used by guitarists.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There is only his word that the &amp;quot;plastic finger strengthener&amp;quot; is what the paramedic identified as brass knuckles.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Any weighted object gripped in the palm functions as a &amp;quot;brass knuckle.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Guardian seems to have forgotten to mention the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.king5.com/news/local/a-look-at-uw-shooting-self-defense-case/426671285\"&gt;large knife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; that the medic also reported him having.
