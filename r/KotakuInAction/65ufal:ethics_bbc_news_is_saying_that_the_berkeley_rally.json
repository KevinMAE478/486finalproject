They may not mention the tax day protests but oddly enough the URLs seem to hint at something to do with taxes. Perhaps at one point the articles mentioned the Tax Day protests but were stealthily edited? I have no evidence for that, I&amp;#39;m just putting it out there as a possibility as to why the URLs would even mention something like the Tax Protests. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**So the Wikipedia article on the Tax Day Protests mentions the Berkeley rally at the bottom counter-protest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With those out of the way, does anyone know if this Patriots Rally that happened in Berkeley was done as a counter protest to the Tax Marches or was it meant as it&amp;#39;s own thing to protest the likes of Antifa? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thought on some of these, I&amp;#39;m not sure if some of these are trying to tie the two events (the Patriots Rally and the Tax Day March) as one and the same or what. It&amp;#39;s definitely disingenuous to try and pass them off as one in the same. Interestingly enough in some articles they don&amp;#39;t even bother to mention which side was throwing the M80s and using the pepper spray (if I were to guess, probably done to paint the Patriots Rally as also being violent, although if being fair, they are guilty of getting violent due to being provoked to become violent). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, all feel free to comb through what I&amp;#39;ve posted, add your thoughts, add more to the list if you find more such articles. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dgdcc1d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492454054.0, "created_utc": 1492425254.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 215}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ufal", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ufal", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ufal", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ufal", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ufal", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ufal", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge30g9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ddosn", "parent_id": "t1_dgdkjbj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, its Ofcom.\n\nOr you could complain through IPSO.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, its Ofcom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you could complain through IPSO.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dge30g9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492490353.0, "created_utc": 1492461553.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdkjbj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HuggableBuddy", "parent_id": "t1_dgdfpcn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Isn't there an independent media watchdog in the UK?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t there an independent media watchdog in the UK?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dgdkjbj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469427.0, "created_utc": 1492440627.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdfpcn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 25, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gladiator3003", "parent_id": "t1_dgde8u8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Cheers for both messages, I was going to go for the mischaracterisation of both events - I've been keeping an eye on the BBC lately to see if they were going to cover it, as they did cover the Milo riot previously, so now that I've got additional info, I'll write a complaint to them.
