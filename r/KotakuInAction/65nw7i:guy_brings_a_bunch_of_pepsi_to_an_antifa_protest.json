Harder, Daddy!\n\n&gt; Describe, with accuracy, what the alt-right movement is, stands for, and aims to achieve. I mean, it's well defined right, and not just a term used to label political opponents? Right? This should be a definition that is specific, while also having the vast majority of people agreeing.\n\nOkay. I can do that. Firstly though, we must establish a principle upon which such a definition can be anchored. As I'll explore more in-depth in a bit: the Alt-Right is, at its core, an anti-fragile sociological system of disconnected cells that operate entirely independent of one another. The kind of universal definition you're looking for is fundamentally unfit for purpose when describing such a phenomenon. There are far too many moving parts operating completely detached from their peers to even unify them as a coherent whole in that way beyond very thin generalities. It'd be like trying to find a way to summarize everyone at your place of work *beyond* \"they're all employees at X\". It can't be done. The individuals under the umbrella are far too nuanced. \n\nSo, with that said? The Alt-Right is best understood as three interconnected but distinct socio-political movements.\n\n1] The first and most microscopic of these is what you might call the \"true\" Alt-Right or \"core\" Alt-Right. This group most readily conforms to your desire for a rigid and well defined political bloc. Relatively minuscule in number, this \"true\" Alt-Right represents the white supremacists, white separatists and white nationalists who congregate in places like /pol and aspire - whether through violent or non-violent means - to the creation of a white-ethnostate and rejection of multiculturalism in the various nations of the West. Under the auspices of this unifying goal - this \"political party\", if you will - is the vast chasm of internal policy debate you find within any political party. Some favor mass deportation of non-whites by force. Some favor separatism - literally, some on the Alt-Right favor seeding Florida and Georgia to blacks/Hispanics, as the radical fringes of BLM demanded - and others still favor a form of \"rural-primitivism\" in which they cultivate rural, Rust Belt type areas into white enclaves. This is further complicated by divisions along non racial policy lines: some within the core Alt-Right, though it is growing *far* less common, favor Victorian Era gender relations and morality laws - repealing women's right to vote, outlawing the gays, absolute drug and alcohol prohibition, etc - and others still favor Christian Theocracy or even Monarchy as systems of government.\n\nIn very simple, TL;DR terms? The core Alt-Right believes in the creation of a white ethno-state, that such an ethno-state should -\n to varying degrees depending on the moralist hang ups of the individual in question - operate under a far more autocratic system of governance than we currently enjoy and that a cabal of International Jewry is responsible for preventing this outcome. While seemingly unrelated it is *crucial* to note that, while small in number, this core Alt-Right is disproportionately responsible for the creation and dissemination of \"meme magic\" into the broader internet ecosystem in much the same way that KiA is disproportionately responsible for Anti-SJW gaming memes.\n\n2] The second phenomenon I'll be discussing could be best described as the \"Alt-Lite\" or, if you're feeling jaunty, the \"Broader Dominion of Kek\".\n\nRemember how I noted that the core Alt-Right created a disproportionate amount of viral content? Well - in part by accident, in part as an entirely intentional capitalization upon the Trump phenomenon - the Alt-Right managed to create an orbital sub-culture and counter cultural movement around itself that is *much* more vast than the core Alt-Right and a legion of people entirely unrelated to white-nationalism now associate with and actively campaign alongside the core Alt-Right for their own reasons. *Generally* these people could be described as Anti-SJW or Anti-Regressive Left actors hitching themselves on to the shock trooper tactics of the core Alt-Right as a means to wage a Culture War but, as with the core Alt-Right, the participants run the gambit in terms of partisan motivation. \n\nThere are classical liberals disillusioned with the IdPol left, libertarians, anti-Islamists, Civic Nationalists, Constitutionalists, anti-multiculturalists, paleo-conservatives, a small number of jilted-by-Clinton BernieBros, trolls who just love triggering people, #FreeKekistan shitposters and even some - gasp - GamerGaters under this broader Alt-Lite banner. Almost none of these partisan cells have any interaction with each *other*, let alone with the white-identitarians from which most of their memes spawn. It is a coalition unified not by any singular purpose but instead by their common enemies: political correctness, CURRENT_YEAR progressive politics, the Neo-Liberal/Neo-Con establishment and, to a *certain* extent, Islamization. Whether they like it or not - and many don't - they share those enemies in common with the core Alt-Right too. \n\nAs a sidenote - I *really* hope, at this point, it's clear why a unifying \"what is the Alt-Right\" definition can't be given. \n\n3] The final social phenomenon ongoing beneath the Alt-Right banner - the one that's at once the most ephemeral yet also the most widespread and clearly observable - is the subtle shift in the Western political zeitgeist the former two movements have facilitated the growth of. The \"Alt-Right Paradigm Shift\", so to speak. \n\nThis movement - though not even formalized *as* a movement in the manner of the further two - refers to the plainly apparent shift in the cardinal principles of Conservatism that has transpired across the West in light of the Migrant Crisis, ever present ISIS aggression and accelerated globalization. Whereas the fundamental principle of being \"right wing\" was, only recently, \"belief in free market principles\" that principle of being \"right wing\" has BECOME, in the hearts and minds of voters, \"belief in the sovereignty of nations\". \n\nThis is a transformation that has happened independently of and without the consent of establishment conservative forces. There is now a disconnect between what those forces - the GOPe, the Tories, whoever - advocate and believe and what their supporters advocate and believe: an old and a new, a traditional and an \"alt\". \n\nSo, what is the Alt-Right? It's nothing more and nothing less than one *entire* faction in a Culture War. Under its banner falls myriad who don't know it even exists and many others who'd - knee jerking like yours did - hate to think of themselves as Alt-Right because they think it's something more specific than it really is. I applaud you for your skepticism of what MSM tells you but, equally, trying to portray even *using* the term Alt-Right as falling into a MSM narrative? Well... don't be a normie.

Well - in part by accident, in part as an entirely intentional capitalization upon the Trump phenomenon - the Alt-Right managed to create an orbital sub-culture and counter cultural movement around itself that is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more vast than the core Alt-Right and a legion of people entirely unrelated to white-nationalism now associate with and actively campaign alongside the core Alt-Right for their own reasons. &lt;em&gt;Generally&lt;/em&gt; these people could be described as Anti-SJW or Anti-Regressive Left actors hitching themselves on to the shock trooper tactics of the core Alt-Right as a means to wage a Culture War but, as with the core Alt-Right, the participants run the gambit in terms of partisan motivation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are classical liberals disillusioned with the IdPol left, libertarians, anti-Islamists, Civic Nationalists, Constitutionalists, anti-multiculturalists, paleo-conservatives, a small number of jilted-by-Clinton BernieBros, trolls who just love triggering people, #FreeKekistan shitposters and even some - gasp - GamerGaters under this broader Alt-Lite banner. Almost none of these partisan cells have any interaction with each &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt;, let alone with the white-identitarians from which most of their memes spawn. It is a coalition unified not by any singular purpose but instead by their common enemies: political correctness, CURRENT_YEAR progressive politics, the Neo-Liberal/Neo-Con establishment and, to a &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; extent, Islamization. Whether they like it or not - and many don&amp;#39;t - they share those enemies in common with the core Alt-Right too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a sidenote - I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hope, at this point, it&amp;#39;s clear why a unifying &amp;quot;what is the Alt-Right&amp;quot; definition can&amp;#39;t be given. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3] The final social phenomenon ongoing beneath the Alt-Right banner - the one that&amp;#39;s at once the most ephemeral yet also the most widespread and clearly observable - is the subtle shift in the Western political zeitgeist the former two movements have facilitated the growth of. The &amp;quot;Alt-Right Paradigm Shift&amp;quot;, so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This movement - though not even formalized &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; a movement in the manner of the further two - refers to the plainly apparent shift in the cardinal principles of Conservatism that has transpired across the West in light of the Migrant Crisis, ever present ISIS aggression and accelerated globalization. Whereas the fundamental principle of being &amp;quot;right wing&amp;quot; was, only recently, &amp;quot;belief in free market principles&amp;quot; that principle of being &amp;quot;right wing&amp;quot; has BECOME, in the hearts and minds of voters, &amp;quot;belief in the sovereignty of nations&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a transformation that has happened independently of and without the consent of establishment conservative forces. There is now a disconnect between what those forces - the GOPe, the Tories, whoever - advocate and believe and what their supporters advocate and believe: an old and a new, a traditional and an &amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what is the Alt-Right? It&amp;#39;s nothing more and nothing less than one &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; faction in a Culture War. Under its banner falls myriad who don&amp;#39;t know it even exists and many others who&amp;#39;d - knee jerking like yours did - hate to think of themselves as Alt-Right because they think it&amp;#39;s something more specific than it really is. I applaud you for your skepticism of what MSM tells you but, equally, trying to portray even &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the term Alt-Right as falling into a MSM narrative?
