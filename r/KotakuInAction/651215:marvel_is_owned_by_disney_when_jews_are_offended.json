Muhammad was born in 570 AD. There were people all over the middle east before then. Who were those people? Well. A large number of them were animists in what you might largely group as Bedouin tribes. Their religion resembled native american spiritualities, African tribal religions, ancestor worship, that type of thing. Some gods or spirits were shared, a lot were specific to family groups or tribal groups. There wasn't really any centralization to it. Each tribal group had it's own system or systems and they did their own thing for the most part. But these Bedouin groups weren't the only inhabitants of the middle east. There were plenty of others. Want to take a guess what one of the biggest ones was? A religious and ethnic group that shows up all over history from Spain to Saudi Arabia? \n\nThat's right. Jews. So, original question; what were Muslims before they were Muslims? Largely, they were Bedouins and Jews. Now, do you think Muslim would just roll up to the Synogogue or Moyshe Goldfarb's Bar Mitzvah and said \"Hey, guys, I have a better religion for everyone! It's the religion of peace!\"\n\nNope. Muhammad got all of his power and company growth from one thing. The sword, both iron and flesh. He'd roll into a town or a village with his army and fucking *slaughter* the people who lived there. He'd put every man of fighting age to death. The boys, he'd castrate and then take with the girls and women as slaves. Then you know what he'd do? \n\nHe'd have himself a big ole rape party. Those females, and a good number of the boys, were passed out for party time. The resultant babies would then be raised as Muslims. \n\nMuhammad was *not* a good guy. He was a powerhungry and bloodthirsty egomaniacal narcissist who managed to bamboozle and slaughter his way into a position of greater leadership and when it comes to the origins of the history of conflict between Islam and Judaism, it was Muhammad who fired the first shot. \n\nSo, if anything, Jews have a pretty good reason to hold onto some bias against a religious group that has their slaughter, rape, and forcible conversion hard coded into it. Muslims, on the other hand, their resentment of jews... well it comes down to Muhammad's teaching that they are entitled to slaughter, rape, murder, and rob them. They just learned, hundreds of years ago, to sell it to themselves as a victim narrative. They're the good guys because Allah said so and the Jews are the bad guys because eventually they decided to stop bending it over and taking Muhammad's scimitar in the shitter. That doesn't mean that they didn't commit some tactical fuckery over the centuries, but again, the origin of the entire conflict is Muhammad's own strategy of raping, slaughtering, and robbing Jews to build and finance his own army and ego.
