They had no 'better natures'; experience taught them that what they were doing was the way to survive.\"*\n\n\n\n\n&gt; -Robert Heinlein, *Starship Troopers*", "edited": 1492264797.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Morality is... not something which needs to be explicitly discovered&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t buy that for one instant.  Truly.  I think you are 100% completely wrong on this.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m with Heinlein, and if you&amp;#39;re a social worker then you are LITERALLY part of the problem of Heinlein&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;XX Century&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Why didn&amp;#39;t they spank little kids when they needed it?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know,&amp;quot; he had answered grimly, &amp;quot;except that the time-tested method of instilling social virtue and respect for law in the minds of the young did not appeal to a pre-scientific pseudo-professional class who called themselves &amp;#39;social workers&amp;#39; or sometimes &amp;#39;child psychologists.&amp;#39; It was too simple for them, apparently, since anybody could do it, using only the patience and firmness needed in training a puppy.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The tragic wrongness of what those well-meaning people did, contrasted with what they thought they were doing, goes very deep. They had no scientific theory of morals. They did have A theory of morals and they tried to live by it (I should not have sneered at their motives),&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;but their theory was wrong&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;-- half of it fuzzy-headed wishful thinking, half of it rationalized charlatanry. The more earnest they were, the farther it led them astray. You see, they assumed that Man had a moral instinct.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;These juvenile criminals hit a low level. Born with only the instinct for survival, the highest morality they achieved was a shaky loyalty to a peer group, a street gang. But the do-gooders attempted to &amp;#39;appeal to their better natures,&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;reach them,&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;spark their moral sense.&amp;#39; Tosh! They had no &amp;#39;better natures&amp;#39;; experience taught them that what they were doing was the way to survive.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Robert Heinlein, &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dgancc5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492292225.0, "created_utc": 1492263425.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgal80p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "philip1201", "parent_id": "t1_dga9hkl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; I believe that respect, coexistence, peace, is only possible when both sides acknowledge that the other side has the capacity and resolve to kill.
