I picked three books starring women (Femthor, Harlequinn and Mockingbird) to highlight the point: it is ABSOLUTELY NOT about women, or women characters, or minorities or diversity.

Harlequinn is women in comics done properly: a great book, with superior creative talent, headed by creators who AREN'T newbies to the industry, who aren't \"new voices\" but who are veterans of creating comics with decades of industry experience.  You can keep all of these creators whose names I don't know and who are making Femthor and Mockingbird suck, and as for me, I'll read Jimmy Palmonti (loved his \"Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters\" along with Justin Gray, that book was dope), Amanda Connor and Paul Dini.

SJW-bullshit doesn't sell, wacky hi-jinks sell.  \n\n&gt;This is a fascinating piece of data: one of the arguments I often see when people bring out things like distributor numbers to show that SJW favored titles don't sell is 'Oh, but you don't know the digital numbers, that's where the SJW money is...'\n\nOkay, I'm going to reveal a secret about the industry that only really long-time fan-boys and gals know.  The LCS (local comic shop) is the brick and mortar retail outlet of the industry.  What are the meat and potatoes of the LCS model?  The subscribers.  What a comic book store sells to foot traffic (that is, people who just walk in through the door looking for something) is tiny, there's not enough sales in foot traffic to keep a store open.  What the retailer relies on is his subscriber base.  In exchange for a discount on all sales, fans create \"Pull Lists\" at their local LCS and every Wednesday, when new books come in, the store staff pulls the new books before they hit the shelves and makes sure all of their subscribers, who filled out their list, get their comics first.  Many years ago, my LCS didn't order enough copies of Green Lantern Rebirth #1.  My store grossly underestimate the demand (my Comic book store owner was new to the job then, he gets it right these days) for this title, but the people who got the book where the people who put it on their list.  When extra copies of the book came in the next week, the people who got first crack at those extra copies were the people who were subscribers and maintained a pull list at the store.  I don't think we sold a single Green Lantern Rebirth #1 to foot traffic, it never actually hit the shelves.  \n\nIf someone walks into the store, whose new, and they need help with something, the retailer will help that person the best that he can.  If he doesn't have what that person needs (and often he doesn't) he'll tell that person where he or she can get what they need.  There are people who are looking for some very obscure comics that just aren't that easy to find.  They aren't valuable, they just had low print runs from hard to find eras or obscure publishers.  We're referred fans who were looking for something to Mile High Comics all the time, and tell them that if it exists, Mile High will have it.  Just the other day, a guy came into the store looking to buy display cases for action figures (our store doesn't carry that), my CBSG directed him to a local sporting goods store that would carry that kind of thing, or know how to order it.  \n\nRetailers don't worry about losing the sale that guy would have provided.  If he buys a comic or two, that's great if he does, but he's loose change.  The most important thing is that he has a good experience so that he'll come back later when he does need something that my LCS can sell him.  However, when a subscriber drops all their titles and abandons their pull list, that's what gets the retailers' attention.  A subscriber can drop as much as a $100 a week on comics, that random customer might be worth, at most, five dollars in revenue.  Keeping the subscriber happy is the priority of the business.  \n\nThat's why digital comics haven't taken off: subscribers, the \"Base\" Demographic of comic book stores, don't like digital, they prefer ink and paper.  Those subscribers, by the way, wield an enormous amount of power and influence over the operations of the LCS, and the retailer.  Those subscribers tend to skew more than 95% male.  Their interests determine what the comic book store buys, which determines what the publishers publish, at least it did in the past.  As a subscriber, my CBSG keeps an open line of communication with me.  He knows me, knows what I'll buy, knows what I'll go crazy for, so when he sees a collected edition of \"Emperor Joker\" or \"Samurai Jack\" for sale, he doesn't even check with me, he orders it for me and puts in my box and I fan-gasm when I see it and I hand over my money.  \n\nSubscribers, FWIW, HATE Social Justice Comics.  These are purists, who think Peter Parker should be Spiderman, Tony Stark should be Iron Man, and Captain America should punch Nazis in the face instead of becoming one.  Marvel caters to SJWs, pushes the comic out to retailers, who don't know what to order, sometimes order far too much and are stuck with things they can't sell.  Marvel gets the good publicity and the credit for being \"diverse\", the retailers gets stuck with the bill, and the subscriber says \"I'm not going to buy Marvel comics anymore\" and if that subscriber is someone whose a Marvel-only guy, the retailer might have just lost one of his core customers.  Comic book stores can only lose so many subscribers before the financial losses start to pile up.  Marvel's shitty behavior is not just academic, it has real world consequences.  \n\nMy comic book store guy went to Wondercon in Anaheim the other weekend, and he was there and there were fifty girls asking him why he didn't order comics for women.  They pointed at their own numbers and said \"you see, there is a market for it.\"  That's the most dangerous part of Marvel's stupidity: it has normalized the expectation.  Marvel is immune from the consequences, the retailer is not.  Marvel (and DC too, they aren't innocent either) has normalized the idea that there is a big pool of untapped customers just dying to buy comics, but who don't.  Those chicks are Wondercon were a product of this normalization of expectations and it just isn't true.  There's this girl I know at my favorite tea shop who loves Netflix's Iron Fist series and who won't ever touch a comic, my sister is a bigger fan of the Marvel Cinematic U than I am, and Winter Soldier is her favorite movie, but if I hand her the first Ed Brubaker Captain America (first Winter Soldier) even if the character is her favorite, she will never read it.  There are girls who are in book clubs, and who read everything under the sun, but if you hand them a comic book, they won't read it.  \n\nRetailers know the truth: the digital market isn't changing comics because the core customer doesn't like digital and everyone else doesn't care enough to read comics as it stands.  Those fifty girls at WonderCon totally ignored the fact that there were more than 19 guys at the convention for every 1 of them.

The Marvel VP whose diversity comment blew up the other week?  He was talking to a group of people, at the time, who nobody talks about, nobody cares about and no one in the media will ever help: the retailers.  Retailers are mostly small and medium sized business owners, and they are suffering due to Marvel's editorial policies in recent years.  What you didn't see in the Marvel VP's comment is the context: those retailers were very pissed off about the sales numbers and the job that Marvel was doing.  \n\nHere's the thing: Marvel is mainstream popular, and the movies, tv shows, video games, etc are huge business.  However, Marvel is a \"big business\" in every sense of the word: they don't care about the little guy at all.  For years, Marvel thought it wouldn't need the retailers anymore past a certain point: they were sure digital sales would eventually cut out the middle man and change the comic book sales paradigm.  They never made the investment to build the good will with retailers that would give Marvel some wiggle room if the product sucked.  The reason why there was a lot less complaining from retailers are DC's new 52 strategy (which didn't sell) is that DC 1) course corrected and 2) has built the strong ties with the retail industry which permitted them more slack.  Marvel was so sure about digital sales; now that the digital sales never panned out, and they need the retailers again, they walk in the room and say \"well, okay, anyone have ideas on how we fix this?\"  \n\nMarvel and DC have different business models, to be honest.  Do you want to know what the single biggest peeve that those retailers have is?  Nobody knows how the business of retail comics actually works.  Those comic book store owners are going out of business, coast to coast, right now, the wave of store closures is devastating for the industry.  The brick and mortar of the business of superhero comics relies on the shops in a way that Marvel has never fully acknowledged and in which Marvel doesn't understand.  If all those shops go under; the biggest problem that creates is that there is no more free product testing and the line of feedback is cut.  DC has always struck me as getting this; DC goes out of its way to get its writers and artists to swing by our shop every so often to do signings and pass out goodies.  Marvel never has.  \n\nThe movies, the TV shows, the video games and all the other stuff relies on the stories that have been told and retold in the comics for generations in order to get their bearings straight.  A successful story between the covers of a book is a tested story, with a fan following, which means its a story with less risk.  The movie \"Logan\" was based on \"Old man Logan\" which fans read, liked, offered that feedback to Marvel and when Fox needed a story idea for a movie, it had a proven one to use and to sell.  There's value in that.  Marvel seems to want to do all it can to bury that.  \n\nLet me give you an example.  Do you know what a retailer wants out of a comic book?  (that is, what has value to a comic book store guy).  This is what they want:\n\nHarlequinn | Month | copies sold\n:--|:--:|:--:\nSS Special | April 2016 | 75,354\n#28 | May 2016 | 43,858\n#29 | June 2016 | 55,774\n#30 | July 2016 | 45,443\n#1 (Rebirth) | August 2016 | 359,957\n#3 (Rebirth) | September 2016 | 81,635\n#5 (Rebirth) | October 2016 | 62,943\n#8 (Rebirth) | November 2016 | 56,878\n#9 (Rebirth) | December 2016 | 49,871\n#11 (Rebirth) | January 2017 | 47,308\n#13 (Rebirth) | February 2017 | 45,400\n\n*Note: in months were two Harlequinn books were published, I only included the high seller, because two books obscures the demand for the comic.  \n\nThis is what retailers want out of comics.  Diversity is sort of a side issue; retailers want a comic book that sells like Harlequinn sells.  That's why she's the most popular woman in comics and the most powerful.  Harlequinn is what the retailer's beef with Marvel really is about.  Look at the numbers, Harlequinn Rebirth #1 and #2, in August 2016, sold over half a million issues combined (which makes sense, her movie, Suicide Squad, opened that month).  However, what is crucial for the retailer is that Harlequinn did start to lose readers, but that's normal for every book over time, what's crucial is that she lost readers at a very slow, predictable pace.  This last month, the book added Paul Dini as a writer, so there will be another surge in sales that will push those numbers right back up.  When the book has a surge, its something that the retailer can predict several months out: the April fools comic or the ones that coincide with her movie coming out.  The thing about adding Dini as a writer or having her movie come out the same month is that any Harlequinn comics the retailer ordered, and never sold, will all move when the spike in sales happens.  The spike not only helps the current month's title, it also helps the retailer clear and sell the backlog that he has.  \n\nContrast that to a book like Femthor or Mockingbird, which both started off hot and then lost 10,000+ readers every single month before quietly exciting.  Retailers have to order 3 months in advance.  A book like Harlequinn, a retailers can order with confidence 3 months out: the numbers never drop very much, so I can make an accurate estimate.  Mockingbird and Femthor?  How the hell do I order those 3 months out?  If it sells 80,000 copies that first month, I have no idea how a book with drops in sales each month that large will do when issue #4 comes out.  I'm just guessing and I have no confidence in my guess and I'm left wondering how much money this is going to cost me.  With Harlequinn, the retailer goes to sleep at night comfortable that he's going to make good money on every single issue; any backlog will sell eventually.  Mockingbird?  How the hell do I sell a comic that has this for a cover? \n\nhttps://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/c/f0/57fe4f5d655ac/detail.jpg\n\nI had no idea that would be the cover when I ordered right after issue #4 came out.  Now I'm stuck with these books and no one wants the last few issues of a dead run.  As a retailer, I can't do business like that.  That is the context of the Marvel VP's comments.
