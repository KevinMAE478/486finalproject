Wellesley is certainly not a place for racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, transphobia or any other type of discriminatory speech. Shutting down rhetoric that undermines the existence and rights of others is not a violation of free speech; it is hate speech. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess, according to this staff editorial, feminism and Islam are no longer allowed at Wesleyan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This came up at my university&amp;#39;s political science club when a controversial speaker was disinvited from speaking at an international forensics event for potentially being too &amp;quot;politically polarizing&amp;quot;. When someone who supported the disinvitation asked &amp;quot;what if I was a person of color&amp;quot; (ignoring how the disinvited speaker was black), I said that I am an MRA and I have to tolerate the presence of feminists who think I should be denied due process rights and educational opportunities because of my gender. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dg9p3u2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492230308.0, "created_utc": 1492201508.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65by3q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ssue", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "This_is_my_phone_tho", "parent_id": "t3_65by3q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They're trying to re-define free speech because they know they look bad when they try to destroy it. \n\nI mean this is literally \"free speech = speech + oppression\" ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re trying to re-define free speech because they know they look bad when they try to destroy it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean this is literally &amp;quot;free speech = speech + oppression&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dg9ssue", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492234905.0, "created_utc": 1492206105.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65by3q", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65by3q", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65by3q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcqj40", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Maldras", "parent_id": "t1_dg9vzxe", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's the men...the Barbarians at the gate so to speak.
