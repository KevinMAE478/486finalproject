You can see fake news all the time on mainstream conservative news. Fox is famous for it. Anyone suggesting that this is purely an issue on the left is either being dishonest or not paying attention.\n\nFox was pretty Anti-Trump for quite a long time. If you know anything about the structure of the Republican party and the splits since 10, and the multiple factions fighting, you'd understand why. It's really complex to explain, though--so I'm just going to ask if you do understand that. Fox really didn't start rallying behind Trump until he actually won. Even when he won the Nomination they were luke warm except for a few hosts (Like Hannity was always pushing for him), but you can even see now, some of his biggest fans, like Carlson? Were originally Anti-Trump (And he's explained his [reasoning at a speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2dct9ErA_g&amp;t=1514s) good watch to see how Fox evolved from the old establishment right to change with the incoming Trump-Populist right, the Trump/Tea party schism is akin to the Hollywood-Reagan/Goldwater movement the last time the GOP changed.)\n\nHowever, I don't think you'll have any issue with people here saying Fox-News has a history of terribly biased reporting. The difference is, Fox has always had the image of 'not being real news', and its had some of the lowest trust ratings before the news really began to skid in 08 (I can go dig up the pew polls on this). Fox news viewers are also seen popular as less informed (Polls and studies on this.) So Fox has always paid the price for its bias. In addition, Fox is a single news network, yes its the largest, but since all the basic channels skew pretty hard left, the overwhelming amount of the media is left. So this growing problem is very much \"on the left\"--it DOES exist on the right, too, ABSOLUTELY, and that's the thing, many of us on KIA are Liberals that cut our teeth mocking the right for JUST that, back in the early 00's when it was the right wing pulling these shenanigans with Fox news. But its changed since then, and now its a far worse problem (Usually) on the Left--this doesn't mean the right is incapable of it, most of us remember family values (Hell, again, that's where we cut are teeth..)\n\nSo if you want to say Fox News is also a joke. Sure. No one is going to argue with you (This is a common mistake people come here to argue. Most of KIA is Liberal.) \n\n&gt;Eh, not really. KiA in general tends to ignore anything that shines a light on the rights ethical issues. And I'm convinced that the only reason KiA archives Breitbart is because it would be too good of a talking point to point out that Breitbart gets (or had) special treatment. It's not like this subreddit has any actual problem using it as a source.\n\nWhenever you have to make up something that sounds overly complex, like we worry about our image so that's why we collectively archive a paper :P, it probably isn't true heh. How about this. The reality is Brietbart is actually about as accurate as the \"trusted\" sources, like CNN/MSNBC and the primary networks--**which is saying, it's not good at all**, and we treat it as we do all media, with heavy skepticism and we typically only use it to track down primary sources. And no, this sub has no issue using a source that we can go to the primary source and find accurate. You'll see even the news we bag on a lot here as a source because we can read through it, and find the Journalist used good primary sources. \n\nDon't confuse skepticism and research with raw hate.  This is also a fundmental misunderstanding most people have when they are used to advocacy based subs that run purely on emotion. If tomorrow a mainstream site cleaned up its act and began only publishing pieces that went through a stringent process of fact checking, AND often reported both sides of contentious issues (Rather than relying of the facile \"durr you don't need to argue both sides of a big foot claim\" argument)...Well, KIA would be happy as a clam to promote that News organization. However, it simply doesn't exist, and until then, each article is taken for its primary sources. \n\n&gt;Search \"Obama.\" Now search \"Trump.\" Very different treatment by this sub. It's interesting to look at, honestly. Especially considering that KiA has been pretty silent on Trump and his stance on net neutrality. You'd think KiA would be all over that. But you'd be wrong.\n\nWe've had years under Obama while this forum has existed, and years of policy from Obama coming to fruition before that. Most of the articles here, in fact, come from various hysteria based reporting, like the Campus Rape Epidemic--which was partly fueled by Obama's Dear Colleague letter. So, uhh, yes you're going to find a Sub analyzing News referencing a President with 8 years of policy flowering more than a President that's only been in there 100 days. (This is just a baffling comparison. I'm sorry to harp on this, but wow. Is this what you're basing your opinion off of? Even if we were HUGELY Anti-Trump, it's 100 days. How in the heck would we have had more articles given the time difference?)\n\nThere are a lot of Trump issues I don't like, but right now, it's not Trump supporters or Trump no platforming people on campus. It wasn't Trump who began legislation to counter \"fake news\". It's not Trump or his supporters working with various governments to cleanse and silence social media--these were all things being done under Obama and grew stronger under Obama. When Trump actually is in office long enough to begin fucking with free speech, Trump will be discussed, but for right now, while there are things to worry about with Trump, he hasn't actually pushed policy that affects things too much. If anything, Trump himself has been the center of countless displays about how terribly biased the media is (And if you want, I WILL actually cite examples of this. But I'm sure you realize this.)\n\nRight now, for example, a Pro-Trump rally in Berkley has had 5 Trump supporters pulled into an Antifa crowd and beaten--badly. Antifa has launched 7 large firecrackers (Illegal mortar size crackers) into the Trump crowd. Now CNN is trying to spin it as the Trump crowd being there to disrupt the Anti-Trump protest. (Despite clear video evidence showing otherwise). And its stuff like this which makes it so hard to even get to what Trump is doing, when the media is acting like this. (https://www.pscp.tv/Timcast/1RDGlRzLbLVxL) In the end, again, there are a lot of things I don't like about Trump--but the media presenting truth is SO important that I'd defend the devil himself in order to uphold those ethical standards. So if we're 'missing\" Trump, it's partly because the media is becoming so twisted in trying to destroy him (But more because he's so new.)\n\nBut long and short, it is absurd to believe a President sitting for less than 100 days is somehow going to have more policy implications affecting free speech than one who sat for 8 years.", "edited": 1492292460.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mm, but no though.
