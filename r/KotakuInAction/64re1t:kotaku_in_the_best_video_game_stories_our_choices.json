There is none.  You can be killed anywhere but your hangar.  Security levels merely make it more complicated and expensive to kill people.  People don't commit *casual* murder in high security space; they scan the target first to make sure it's worth it.\n\n* Scamming.  There is none.  Because CCP doesn't recognize ANY scam you can do IN-CLIENT as a scam.  If the client lets you do it, its legal.  Only character transfer and plex scams are offenses.  The buyer must always beware.  Capital ship sales in particular are rife with scams and a few people have made names for themselves as trustworthy brokers.  There are no ratings agencies (although rating agency scams have been attempted).  \n\n* Tribes and Cults of Personality.  EVE alliances tend to be dictatorships, but the insatiable need for more warm bodies to press F1 on command means that pretty much everyone is always recruiting (including Dreddit).  If you're a live person with an account, you can join just about any alliance you want.  You simply won't be trusted for a long time.  The days where alliances were paranoid about spies have come to an end, every alliance ASSUMES they've got people flying for both sides and just takes steps to insulate the inner and outer party from the proletariat.  If you really like one leader's lack of style and want to fly for their banner, you generally can by jumping through enough hoops.\n\n* Scale.  An individual in EVE is... not a hero.  You're not the champion of the horde fighting diablo.  You're a nobody.  You start out with a ship practically made of cardboard with a flashlight for pointing at rocks and another flashlight for pointing at ships.  You will always be a nobody as long as its just you.  You will never be significant unless it comes from interacting with other people.  Fighting them.  Leading them.  Robbing them.  However you want to play.

There is none.  You can be killed anywhere but your hangar.  Security levels merely make it more complicated and expensive to kill people.  People don&amp;#39;t commit &lt;em&gt;casual&lt;/em&gt; murder in high security space; they scan the target first to make sure it&amp;#39;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scamming.  There is none.  Because CCP doesn&amp;#39;t recognize ANY scam you can do IN-CLIENT as a scam.  If the client lets you do it, its legal.  Only character transfer and plex scams are offenses.  The buyer must always beware.  Capital ship sales in particular are rife with scams and a few people have made names for themselves as trustworthy brokers.  There are no ratings agencies (although rating agency scams have been attempted).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tribes and Cults of Personality.  EVE alliances tend to be dictatorships, but the insatiable need for more warm bodies to press F1 on command means that pretty much everyone is always recruiting (including Dreddit).  If you&amp;#39;re a live person with an account, you can join just about any alliance you want.  You simply won&amp;#39;t be trusted for a long time.  The days where alliances were paranoid about spies have come to an end, every alliance ASSUMES they&amp;#39;ve got people flying for both sides and just takes steps to insulate the inner and outer party from the proletariat.  If you really like one leader&amp;#39;s lack of style and want to fly for their banner, you generally can by jumping through enough hoops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scale.

Life is Strange may have crappy writing and be a crappy RPG overall IMO, but you can&amp;#39;t deny that the very last choice in the game is one that matters, at least in regards to determining what is supposed to have mattered for your entire experience playing for the past 5 episodes. Whether it actually does matter after that choice is made is the bigger question. I&amp;#39;d argue it doesn&amp;#39;t, considering how unlikeable Chloe is, and how unlikeable most of the fucking town is, and how it basically just begs the question of why Max was even given powers to fuck things up so royally to begin with that the universe forced her to make that choice?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dg54g0j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491982661.0, "created_utc": 1491953861.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64re1t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5622s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Warskull", "parent_id": "t3_64re1t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I guess Kotaku never played any of the Witcher games.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess Kotaku never played any of the Witcher games.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dg5622s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491984830.0, "created_utc": 1491956030.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64re1t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4vs55", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "squishles", "parent_id": "t3_64re1t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They're fine with choices, they just want all of them to lead to showing their own particular flavor of social agenda is right.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re fine with choices, they just want all of them to lead to showing their own particular flavor of social agenda is right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dg4vs55", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491971853.0, "created_utc": 1491943053.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64re1t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4yr2a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DelicousIrony", "parent_id": "t3_64re1t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I say both choice and non choice can work extremely well.\n\nNon choice allow for a tight well constructed narrative to be form, and us as main characters to follow along how the world works around us.
