Think Origin (Richard Garriot prior to the EA buyout).  As the industry evolved, though, main line titles became more expensive to make.  You needed writers, voice actors, artists, marketing, etc.  Businesses like EA and Activision, who made their money with predictable, marketable products, made boatloads of money, while smaller studios like BioWare, Origin, and Blizzard, while successful, couldn't keep up.\n\nOnce more corporate entities controlled the industry, they noticed something.  Artists, writers, VAs, and other creatives had fun, similar career prospects like cartoons, movies, TV, etc.  Programmers who didn't get to work on video games were usually relegated to business software, which is fun to make, but young grads don't know that and want the flash of making video games.  This made them replaceable.\n\nAs costs of games soared, this became an easy target for budget cuts.  If the code monkey doesn't want to work 80 hour weeks because he's now married with kids, that's fine.  There are a dozen 22-year-old college grads willing to take his place.  Let him go make boring accounting software for Walmart while the **fresh out of college with no professional work experience** replacement comes in and works his butt off.  The bolded portion should show you where the problem is.  Burnout for devs is so high that everybody with enough experience to make a good dev team manager has fled the industry to greener pastures, leaving people with art or business degrees to manage coding teams or else people who really aren't ready to lead a team yet.\n\nOver the years, this attrition is showing on games.  Art is getting better all the time.  Voice acting stays really good (ME:A VAs delivered those awful lines quite well).  Writing is still hit-and-miss, but follows the standard across all industries with writing (most of the really cringey stuff from good studios is tied directly to agenda pushing...just like in movies, books, and TV).  What gets consistently worse in the software itself, and it's not even huge technical mistakes that would be made by people who don't know what they're doing.  It's lack of polish and proper QA testing by rookies and people who don't know how to **lead** a dev team.\n\nThe only thing that makes me super pessimistic is that, while AAA studios will continue to see declining sales on rich, story based games that get shipped in what should be a beta (or even alpha) testing state, there are 'old faithfuls' that will always sell, meaning they'll keep burning through IPs bought from other studios instead of learning how to actually support the creation of something with the depth and polish that BioWare used to be known for.  In other words, BioWare will eventually be relegated to a niche studio with the Dragon Age and Mass Effect franchises deemed not cost effective, but EA will keep on chugging along because everybody will buy their monopolized sports franchises and Battlefield games, keeping them in business long enough to buy up the next big property and run **it** into the ground.\n\nBest case realistic scenario is that indy studios keep cropping up to fill the gap.\n\nEdit:  All this to say that we probably shouldn't be too hard on the devs.  They're mostly rookies given too much responsibility.

Let him go make boring accounting software for Walmart while the &lt;strong&gt;fresh out of college with no professional work experience&lt;/strong&gt; replacement comes in and works his butt off.  The bolded portion should show you where the problem is.  Burnout for devs is so high that everybody with enough experience to make a good dev team manager has fled the industry to greener pastures, leaving people with art or business degrees to manage coding teams or else people who really aren&amp;#39;t ready to lead a team yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, this attrition is showing on games.  Art is getting better all the time.  Voice acting stays really good (ME:A VAs delivered those awful lines quite well).  Writing is still hit-and-miss, but follows the standard across all industries with writing (most of the really cringey stuff from good studios is tied directly to agenda pushing...just like in movies, books, and TV).  What gets consistently worse in the software itself, and it&amp;#39;s not even huge technical mistakes that would be made by people who don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing.  It&amp;#39;s lack of polish and proper QA testing by rookies and people who don&amp;#39;t know how to &lt;strong&gt;lead&lt;/strong&gt; a dev team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that makes me super pessimistic is that, while AAA studios will continue to see declining sales on rich, story based games that get shipped in what should be a beta (or even alpha) testing state, there are &amp;#39;old faithfuls&amp;#39; that will always sell, meaning they&amp;#39;ll keep burning through IPs bought from other studios instead of learning how to actually support the creation of something with the depth and polish that BioWare used to be known for.  In other words, BioWare will eventually be relegated to a niche studio with the Dragon Age and Mass Effect franchises deemed not cost effective, but EA will keep on chugging along because everybody will buy their monopolized sports franchises and Battlefield games, keeping them in business long enough to buy up the next big property and run &lt;strong&gt;it&lt;/strong&gt; into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best case realistic scenario is that indy studios keep cropping up to fill the gap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:  All this to say that we probably shouldn&amp;#39;t be too hard on the devs.  They&amp;#39;re mostly rookies given too much responsibility.  The real blame is a pattern of dev abuse by higher ups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dgczh9p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492425438.0, "created_utc": 1492396638.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s4ud", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcuo33", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Punchpplay", "parent_id": "t3_65s4ud", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well Mass Effect: Andromeda was like a nut punch.
