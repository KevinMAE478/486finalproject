", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s racist/bigoted. :/ &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just because someone&amp;#39;s skin tone is different than mine, doesn&amp;#39;t mean they have a completely different outlook on life than I do. How someone views the world, how they think, their experience... it all comes down to the &lt;strong&gt;individual&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh well, you&amp;#39;re black so you must think different than me. Because you are different!&amp;quot; How is that not racist as hell?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To assume that some &lt;em&gt;insert minority&lt;/em&gt; has some completely different outlook on life, or has struggled greatly, is a bigoted assumption based solely on their minority status [ie; skin color, sexuality, whatever]. Not everyone has the same experiences as their fellow minority. Not everyone struggles, even if they are a minority, and sometimes they struggle for reasons completely unrelated to being a minority. Sometimes a mixture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been through a lot, and most of it has had nothing to do with being gay. Yet, people like this would probably assume that was the reason I&amp;#39;ve had struggles in life. If I were to say I don&amp;#39;t speak to my parents, they&amp;#39;d most likely assume because they disowned me for being gay. When that&amp;#39;s not even close to being true. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way to &amp;quot;grow empathy&amp;quot; is to simply read from people unlike us. Not in something as pointlessly shallow as appearance, but THOUGHT and EXPERIENCES. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I read a book by a black person that has the same opinions as me, or a book by a straight man who had a similar life experience as I do... that doesn&amp;#39;t expand my views at all, or challenge me to empathize with someone else. If I read a book from another gay man who had a completely different experience in life, that would expand my worldview. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re pro-choice, read some statements by someone who doesn&amp;#39;t support abortion. I can empathize with their position, despite not agreeing with them on it. I&amp;#39;m pro-choice, but if I were to put myself in their shoes - believing that a fetus is a &amp;quot;baby&amp;quot; and that abortion is killing the baby - I can definitely understand why they get so upset and emotional, and fight so hard against it. That is empathy. I disagree with them, but can understand where they are coming from. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dgb013h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492310644.0, "created_utc": 1492281844.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f03g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb4768", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "triggershoes", "parent_id": "t3_65f03g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I watched a few Spike Lee movies.
