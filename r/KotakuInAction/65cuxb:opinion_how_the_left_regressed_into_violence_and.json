So this particular event didn&amp;#39;t get a whole lot of attention here, but following the Berkeley riots against Milo I listened to some very interesting &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/GaVJryS78CY\"&gt;interviews on Youtube&lt;/a&gt; with Jake Shields. For those who don&amp;#39;t know about him, Jake is a professional fighter (MMA?), and during the Berkeley riots he fought off a group of masked antifa rioters that were beating a man. It&amp;#39;s likely that Jake saved the man&amp;#39;s life or at least prevented significant injury to him, which is a very powerful story, but that&amp;#39;s not what stood out the most after hearing Jake relate the evening&amp;#39;s events. For me, it was his descriptions of the behaviour of the bystanders to the event that have continually stuck with me, and the fact that the regular citizens of Berkeley were cheering on and supporting the violent beating of a human being. Listen at about the three minute mark of the link above for his actual words, which are more than a little chilling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d originally thought that those who witnessed the events of that night (the normal citizens of Berkeley who weren&amp;#39;t rioters) were affected by a very powerful psychological phenomenon known as the &amp;quot;Bystander Effect&amp;quot;, and this was why no one was helping those in urgent need. During the riots though, according to Jake&amp;#39;s statements, most residents of Berkeley were actually cheering and supporting the beating of a man, and not just hiding in anonymity within a large group (though there were definitely many of those type as well, who probably thought that what was happening was wrong). Now I&amp;#39;ve always been one to speak out on this sub against painting all of California, San Francisco, or any large group in general, with too broad a brush when things like this happen, but with this I&amp;#39;ve come to understand the reason behind such statements a little bit more, though I will still try my best to properly qualify them and not just react to extreme prejudice with even more prejudice. However, it&amp;#39;s become clear that in many of these cities/universities/etc there is something...downright &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a feeling that I think anyone who&amp;#39;s read a Stephen King novel will recognize from his descriptions of the settings for his horror stories -- a &lt;em&gt;wrongness&lt;/em&gt; so heavy that it hangs over the place like a disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The average person in Berkeley will cheer on and celebrate someone being beaten to death for the crime of wrongthink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wow. How did it come to this? Hearing about these events has changed my worldview so much that I have been asking the question over and over again for the past two months: How did the left regress to the point where violence has become acceptable and even celebrated?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that many people here and elsewhere have been using the term &amp;quot;regressive left&amp;quot; over the past few years, but I feel no one is really talking about the &amp;quot;regression&amp;quot; process itself or trying to fully understand it. At this point, I think learning as much as we can about this process is very important for several reasons: understanding it can perhaps lead us to identifying solutions to stop the violence from escalating and maybe even save people from injury or even death, and we might also be able to spot and prevent this regression from happening in other groups/communities now or in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, over the past few months there&amp;#39;s a lot that I&amp;#39;ve considered in coming to the conclusion I have about how this regression is happening, but I&amp;#39;ll try to keep it short and maybe add some of my other thoughts in comments for anyone that is interested. So, as the saying goes...&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/O5WkhU7.jpg\"&gt;a picture is worth a thousand words.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider this image a moment. There is a story behind the making of this protest sign, and it very likely unfolded as follows: paper, scissors, markers, and other materials were brought together, and a group of people gathered to discuss what should be written on the paper, how long it needed to be and where it should be cut, etc. Eventually they chose to write &amp;quot;Your fascism is showing&amp;quot;. Unfortunately, the person or people who actually drew the letters on the paper had no clue how to spell the word &amp;quot;fascism&amp;quot; properly. Now, at this point, many people were certainly looking at the still-incomplete sign being made and were thinking to themselves: &amp;quot;this is going make us look like idiots&amp;quot;. But no one spoke up. Later someone decided to add a small &amp;quot;Hey You&amp;quot; message, but still no one criticized the sign or pointed out the glaring mistake. Finally, when they displayed the sign against those they wished to accuse/convince, many of those holding the sign were visibly shocked or embarrassed by the laughter directed at them because of the misspelling, and at how far and wide that ridicule then spread online. Their mistake showed them to be utterly pathetic; how could anyone take them seriously? They were accusing people of something they obviously hadn&amp;#39;t learned or read anything about, since they couldn&amp;#39;t even spell it right!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;#39;s admittedly a small and somewhat trivial example, but this, in a nutshell, is the root of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I believe that the left has regressed primarily because it has lost the ability to criticize/disagree using actual arguments, and instead relies solely on the social pressure of applying negative labels to certain ideas and by extension anyone discussing them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This almost certainly happened to the group making that sign, with people remaining silent because they didn&amp;#39;t want to be accused of having &amp;quot;language privilege&amp;quot;, or of making people &amp;quot;feel unsafe&amp;quot;, or any of the other variants of social justice newspeak. And this is happening in more important discussions like actual political decisions, laws, legal battles, game development, award shows, etc. After thinking it through as well as I can, I&amp;#39;m comfortable with making the claim that this is the most important reason behind the left&amp;#39;s regression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this claim/hypothesis is correct, then any attempt at focusing on parenting issues, personality disorders, education systems, or other unrelated (but otherwise worthy IMO) issues, will not serve to stop this regression in any meaningful manner. Alternately, confronting and learning about identity politics, postmodernism, attempts at censorship (whether blatant or through the backdoor), and other similar ideas will be effective at combating the regression because those problems directly relate to the promotion of reasoned debate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quickly, here are the most important predictions/takeaways that came up during my deliberations:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speak up and challenge bad ideas whenever possible. Do not remain silent. Do not get lazy. Focus on forming strong, rigourous arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support those who are unfairly attacked and suffer at the hands of outrage culture. The quicker that these labels lose their power to destroy the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome those who have been excommunicated because they questioned too much. Escaping a cult successfully is often about creating a new support structure for a person who just lost a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be prepared for things to get worse before they get better. I fear that there are no brakes on this particular train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, for anyone willing to read this far, my apologies for the wall of text. What does this mean for KIA? Well, first and foremost, we should not become complacent regarding our safety. While not everyone will have to worry about their physical health when attending an event like the one tomorrow at Berkeley, online safety is a very real thing when it comes to security of accounts, sharing personal info and doxxing, protecting your job/career/reputation, etc. However, there are far better resources than myself on this, and I actually want to consider a different angle to what this means for each of us. The question I have had to ask myself is: can KIA regress as well? The end result would look fairly different than the regressive left, but it is definitely possible. As a left-leaning person, I would never have imagined several decades ago that the people who championed the idea that the content of your character was more important than the colour of your skin, would now be saying that the most important thing to consider in every single person is the particular shade of skin pigment/genitalia/etc that they were born with. If it can happen there, it can happen here. For this sub, if labeling someone an &amp;quot;SJW&amp;quot; becomes a replacement for an actual argument, then we will start walking down that path of regression. And if we begin adopting tactics like getting people fired for personal opinions that do not affect their job, or if we start sacrificing truth in the name of some idea of ultimate justice, then we need to remember that methods that are used against our enemies will eventually get used (or get threatened to be used) against our allies as well. That is ultimately the story of the downfall of the regressive left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**TL;DR - \"That's a slur, not an argument\" is something that affects internal discussions on the regressive left just as much as it is used against people in the outgroup, and it the most important factor when understanding the process of how the left has regressed to the point of violence.

I knew many people on the right, I confessed, and while, yes, they were introducing voter id laws solely to win, and that it was wrong on so many levels to spit on democracy like they were doing, the majority of them believed that their policies would benefit minorities in the long run, or at the very least that the policies of the left were not good for minorities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, this was long before I had even heard the term &amp;quot;social justice&amp;quot;, so I was surprised at the reaction of many of the people there, although it probably doesn&amp;#39;t shock anyone here to learn that I was immediately called a &amp;quot;racist&amp;quot; myself. I stubbornly tried to stay with it for a few days after that, arguing that at least they should see that calling an entire political party and its supporters racist would not change anyone&amp;#39;s mind, but in the end I left in disillusionment, and my attempt at political activism came to a screeching halt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, these attempts at shouting &amp;quot;racist&amp;quot; at the top of their lungs failed, and this slap in the face on democracy was passed here as well, and things became more divided than ever. I might even say the outrage backfired, since it just created more support from people who knew that the claims of racism were ludicrous. And these were people who might have at least been convinced to keep a fair democracy in place that didn&amp;#39;t disenfranchise people. &amp;lt;sigh&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Believe me, I have tried, and will continue to try, the route of empathy, but the schism on the left has the two sides speaking completely different languages, and understanding will not be possible until words like &amp;quot;safety&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;privilege&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;racism&amp;quot;, etc, are given mutually agreed on definitions. And ones that don&amp;#39;t change depending on a whim.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "KotakuInAction", "name": "t1_dg9g95h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492219740.0, "created_utc": 1492190940.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cuxb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cuxb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33726", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cuxb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgardv2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "garybuseysawakening", "parent_id": "t1_dgahssf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/KotakuInAction", "controversiality": 0, "body": "White males are routinely painted as the enemy and you know it.
