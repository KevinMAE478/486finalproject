They take kids from their families and turn them into child soldiers, sure, Lucas was trying to create a Peter Pan fantasy for kids to sell movie tickets, but if you apply realistic moral logic to the situation, that's wrong.  And yeah, his example about Qui Gon and Anakin's mother is correct, that was incredibly ruthless.  Then there's the whole bit about training people to repress all their emotions, forbidding them from having families or ties outside the order, that's fucking brainwashing.\n\nNow, you can argue that the Sith are WORSE, you can argue that the methods of the Jedi are a necessary evil because people with psychic powers are incredibly dangerous and need to be controlled and their gifts channeled for the greater good of society, but calling something a necessary evil is not the same as ignoring that it's an evil at all.\n\nEven Luke himself, in what is now \"legends\" canon, acknowledged that the old Jedi Order largely dug its own grave through arrogance and rigidity, and did things very differently in his own re-created version of it.\n\nI think it's fair to say that the Jedi in the Old Republic era became as out of balance as the Sith, just in the other direction, hell, it got to the point where they saw the exclusive control of the Light Side to be \"balance in the Force\", which is just absurd on its face.\n\nWhere Kuchera is WRONG, however, is his logic that the Jedi are, and should be treated like, religions in the real world.  In real life, the claims of a religion, by its very nature as a religion, are impossible to prove and must be taken on faith, thus it is a terrible idea to let such claims influence government policy.\n\nThe Jedi, on the other hand, can prove all of the things they believe in objectively exist.  The existence of The Force is FACT in the Star Wars universe.  It can be measured scientifically, it can be demonstrated to onlookers, there is a place you can go where you can meet [immortal beings that physically embody its aspects](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Ones), to call such creatures Gods would not seem amiss.  The Force's will can be directly communicated to mortals, if not always reliably interpreted.  You can't just dismiss the Force as a belief.  It exists, it will play a role in the fate of galactic civilization, and the people who make decisions in the Republic have to deal with that fact.\n\nSo really, I think the Jedi Order is more comparable to Babylon 5's Psi Corps than to a religion.  There are people with this power, and if they are left unchecked, the results can be catastrophic, so the government has to have someplace to put them where their gifts can be controlled and ideally used for good.  This can have a significant negative impact on their quality of life, but what would be better, euthanizing Force sensitive babies at birth?  Leaving them to be ticking bombs?\n\nI do think Star Wars needs to do a better job of conveying the order's flaws, however.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing, and hear me out before you downvote: His basic premise is actually RIGHT, but how he gets there is a little messed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jedi Order, as it&amp;#39;s depicted in the prequel trilogy, does a lot of horrible shit that Lucas wanted us to just ignore because he had his head up his ass after decades of being told what a genius he was.  They take kids from their families and turn them into child soldiers, sure, Lucas was trying to create a Peter Pan fantasy for kids to sell movie tickets, but if you apply realistic moral logic to the situation, that&amp;#39;s wrong.  And yeah, his example about Qui Gon and Anakin&amp;#39;s mother is correct, that was incredibly ruthless.  Then there&amp;#39;s the whole bit about training people to repress all their emotions, forbidding them from having families or ties outside the order, that&amp;#39;s fucking brainwashing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, you can argue that the Sith are WORSE, you can argue that the methods of the Jedi are a necessary evil because people with psychic powers are incredibly dangerous and need to be controlled and their gifts channeled for the greater good of society, but calling something a necessary evil is not the same as ignoring that it&amp;#39;s an evil at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Luke himself, in what is now &amp;quot;legends&amp;quot; canon, acknowledged that the old Jedi Order largely dug its own grave through arrogance and rigidity, and did things very differently in his own re-created version of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that the Jedi in the Old Republic era became as out of balance as the Sith, just in the other direction, hell, it got to the point where they saw the exclusive control of the Light Side to be &amp;quot;balance in the Force&amp;quot;, which is just absurd on its face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where Kuchera is WRONG, however, is his logic that the Jedi are, and should be treated like, religions in the real world.  In real life, the claims of a religion, by its very nature as a religion, are impossible to prove and must be taken on faith, thus it is a terrible idea to let such claims influence government policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jedi, on the other hand, can prove all of the things they believe in objectively exist.  The existence of The Force is FACT in the Star Wars universe.
