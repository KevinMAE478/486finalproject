If I spend too long making things for the case I&amp;#39;m rushing the orders and panicking. I&amp;#39;d gone to culinary school and wanted to be a decorator so bad. I was going to start off in grocery stores and work up to special cake shops. Screw that now. If they act like this in a grocery store I can&amp;#39;t imagine how they&amp;#39;d act at a specialty shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was on vacation last week and some woman called the deli girl a fat cow because she couldn&amp;#39;t write on her cake. It&amp;#39;s like they know you can&amp;#39;t talk back so they take all their anger out on you. I&amp;#39;ve been yelled at for calling people to make sure I do their order right. &amp;quot;The person who took your order didn&amp;#39;t write down the style. I need to know how to decorate it&amp;quot; she starts yelling &amp;quot;she took the photo out of the book and attached it to my order! I already told them how to decorate it!&amp;quot; Well obviously if the photo was attached I wouldn&amp;#39;t be calling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ExpectationVsReality", "name": "t1_dg7eehr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492109856.0, "created_utc": 1492081056.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t6xs", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wax2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg61dk8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mbok_jamu", "parent_id": "t1_dg5sygr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ExpectationVsReality", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I call it the Pinterest effect.
