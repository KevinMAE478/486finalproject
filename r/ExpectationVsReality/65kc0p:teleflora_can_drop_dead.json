Something reminded me later last night and I tried again even though she was on the couch behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took ages and I finally found a company that could get flowers to her today. I know it was the middle of the night and I know it&amp;#39;s Easter weekend. I know that expectations never equal reality. I know I was paying a premium by shopping online and expecting Saturday delivery. Knowing all those things I also know I love my wife and wanted to show her in some small way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The flowers arrived at a decent time, thankfully she&amp;#39;s not home to see them. They&amp;#39;re dreadful. They&amp;#39;re embarrassing.

In the 20+ years we&amp;#39;ve been married I can&amp;#39;t remember ever sending her flowers. I&amp;#39;m an idiot, I know this. So this was my big chance... I wish I&amp;#39;d spent some time reading reddit last night while I was trying to sneak around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I got mad, wrote an angry email to teleflora and called them.

I know the first words out my mouth were unkind, that was wrong. He greeted me and I said &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;re not even on the same continent are we?&amp;quot; He didn&amp;#39;t understand so I repeated myself, several times until it wasn&amp;#39;t even funny to me anymore. I expressed my dissatisfaction and he put me on hold a couple of times to do something. Eventually it seems he called the local florist, well that&amp;#39;s when things went from bad to worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I ever find out who the local florist is I may picket them. Even as he relayed information I knew they were being pissy. I was asked to count flowers... in an $80 arrangement I was asked to count individual carnations!

Roses because I love her and lilies because it&amp;#39;s Easter, I&amp;#39;m not very creative when it comes to flowers. I picked out what I wanted then upgraded it to the best they had... &amp;quot;premium&amp;quot;... hah. This thing doesn&amp;#39;t look as good as the &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; picture, it&amp;#39;s nowhere &lt;strong&gt;near&lt;/strong&gt; as nice as what they&amp;#39;re passing off as &amp;quot;premium&amp;quot;.

When she sees them they&amp;#39;re going to represent my love for her... and frankly it looks rather pathetic. I wanted to blow her mind, I thought what I ordered WOULD blow her mind.
