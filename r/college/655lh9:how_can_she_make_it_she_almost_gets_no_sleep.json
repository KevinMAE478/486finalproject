I agree Engineering and CS are harder for sure.

I think each major comes with things that are difficult to people that are and are not of that major.

I agree Engineering and CS are harder for sure. What I meant was that I think we all have things we&amp;#39;re good at, if you&amp;#39;re an engineer major, you&amp;#39;re most likely damn good at math and science, or at least enjoy them to the point where you can learn it well vs if you&amp;#39;re a communication/soc/psy/phi/english major, you&amp;#39;re most likely into how norms work and are good at writing papers or enjoy analyzing. I think each major comes with things that are difficult to people that are and are not of that major. While I agree that not many majors are harder than engineering or some sort of science/math related (including mine) I think it&amp;#39;s unfortunate that people have to shit on people that don&amp;#39;t take quite as hard of majors, and forget that we still work our asses off and have hard &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;m assuming you never saw my response clarifying that I didn&amp;#39;t mean others majors are harder than yours.
