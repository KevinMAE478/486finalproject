I am a married 21 year old who works full time. My wife and I have a combines income of about $55,000/annually.

The FAFSA website is super vague and I just wanted to get a general idea whether I would qualify or not. I know I could just fill out the application and wait for the decision but I guess I am just nervous about starting everything.

I was thinking about taking an online program that way I am not away from home for more than 12 hours each day.
