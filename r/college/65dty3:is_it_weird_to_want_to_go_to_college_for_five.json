You could end up accidentally costing yourself thousands because you wanted to take unneeded courses or even risk your grant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To speak candidly, you are going for a very technical degree, you don&amp;#39;t have much reason to waste time taking unneeded courses other than arguably a language. I think if you wanted to take your time graduating, your time would be best spent signing to internships and Co-ops that give you real world experience (these are often the most fun experiences in college). If you want to take a basket weaving course here and there, take those as your directed electives which are already included on your degree plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "college", "name": "t1_dg9qqru", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492232290.0, "created_utc": 1492203490.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dty3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dty3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dty3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dty3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dty3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dty3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga6aat", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "-Knockabout", "parent_id": "t1_dga2v4h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/college", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think Environmental Engineering at my school is five years just in undergrad. \n\nI mean, that doesn't apply to Computer Science (which is a four-year program), but good to know either way.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Environmental Engineering at my school is five years just in undergrad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, that doesn&amp;#39;t apply to Computer Science (which is a four-year program), but good to know either way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "college", "name": "t1_dga6aat", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492253162.0, "created_utc": 1492224362.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga2v4h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "perib", "parent_id": "t1_dga054r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/college", "controversiality": 0, "body": "oh yes, sorry.
