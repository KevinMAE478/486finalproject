If you're teacher has study guides for tests at the beginning of the semester (one of my professors did this semester and its a godsend) or even if you have a lot of vocab, beginning studying 2-3 week prior. It takes so much stress off you, promise.\n\nSecond, get a planner. I know it sounds lame but having a physical calendar you can look at and see all your assignments can help you manage your time better. Most professors have a syllabus with everything on there from tests to assignment due dates. Look at it frequently and add them to you planner. Itll help you from going \"oh shit we had something due tomorrow/today\"\n\nLastly, relax. College is a new experience and its not anything like HS imo.

Didnt make so hot grades in HS, I graduated with a 3.2 gpa and made a 22 on the ACT. So not so hot grades. I took a year off between graduation and college and I believe that really helped me get my shit together. I dont know if that would be an option for you since you seem to have some good schools lined up, but if you are feeling strained from HS and just life in general and can take a year off, I highly suggest it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now once I got to college I was in the &amp;quot;oh shit how do I do any of this I didnt do ANYTHING in highschool&amp;quot; (referring to studying), but I found that most entry level class professors are willing to help. One professor gave a great tip that has helped me in other classes when it comes to studying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DONT DO IT THE WEEK/NIGHT BEFORE!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress that enough. If you&amp;#39;re teacher has study guides for tests at the beginning of the semester (one of my professors did this semester and its a godsend) or even if you have a lot of vocab, beginning studying 2-3 week prior. It takes so much stress off you, promise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, get a planner. I know it sounds lame but having a physical calendar you can look at and see all your assignments can help you manage your time better. Most professors have a syllabus with everything on there from tests to assignment due dates. Look at it frequently and add them to you planner. Itll help you from going &amp;quot;oh shit we had something due tomorrow/today&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, relax. College is a new experience and its not anything like HS imo. Work hard, but dont forget to have fun (not too much fun thou!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps you :) good luck! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "college", "name": "t1_dgb7zo1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492321461.0, "created_utc": 1492292661.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jm6f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbf7d9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ryanslezak", "parent_id": "t3_65jm6f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/college", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Don't expect to learn a lot (if anything) in your classes.
