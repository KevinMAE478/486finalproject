My issue is that I know my parents credit history is too terrible for them to be accepted as guarantors, and I don&amp;#39;t know anyone else I feel comfortable asking to sign so my only other option is to pay the last 2 months rent upon signing the lease and then pay the first months rent upon the first of the month. That&amp;#39;s no big deal as my financial aid/loans more than cover it. The only problem is that disbursement for summer semester isn&amp;#39;t until mid may. That&amp;#39;s well after the start of may when people usually begin their subleases for the summer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is the following. Is it common for a lot of students to put their apartments up for subleasing for June/July, after the semester has already started? Or do available units usually dry up by then.

Im just wracking my brain right now trying to figure out how Im going to pay for 3 months worth of rent upfront and then survive 15+ days for my financial aid to come in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So I'm half way through my junior year and I want to move out of my parents house and move closer to campus (its over an hour drive).
