These will generally require you to go to grad school, at least, if you want to get a job that&amp;#39;s actually in your field. There are plenty of well-paying jobs outside of your field that are low on applicants (e.g. data analyst) but they&amp;#39;re typically incredibly soul-crushing jobs, and why hire a physics grad when they can hire a stats grad (in which case, you&amp;#39;re back to the whole &amp;#39;boring degree&amp;#39; issue)? And if you go to grad school for the hard sciences then you&amp;#39;re unlikely to ever get a job in that field, since we&amp;#39;re all just waiting for someone to die so that we can take their job, and hope they don&amp;#39;t just annex the job entirely (which happens quite a bit). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "college", "name": "t1_dgarlmf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492298998.0, "created_utc": 1492270198.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j66a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j66a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j66a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j66a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j66a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j66a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3z", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j66a", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb3nor", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AccountToLearn", "parent_id": "t1_dgb2w6a", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/college", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is a case-by-case judgement.
