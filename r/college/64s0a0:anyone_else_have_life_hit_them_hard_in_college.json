I was also caught cheating on my exam for math and now I&amp;#39;m not sure what will happen. Lots of things happen in life, but successful people overcome challenges and failures. So after this setback, I decided to get my life back on track. I decided to stay committed to my planner, study effectively and get sleep. I talked to an RA and looked at ways to manage stress. All the best in your life and don&amp;#39;t give up, keep fighting. If you are dealing with problems talk to someone, a close friend, mom, dad, sister, brother or even see a counselor if need be.

Most of my friends had left town for their designated universities out of state so I felt left behind and like I couldn't reach out to them for help. Not only that, but I didn't want to stay home and attend community college because of my abusive relationship with my mom. I've suffered depression for a couple of year (with on and off medication) but this was when I decided to stop and try to just fix myself. During this time, I just threw myself into school and my 2 jobs. I knew that even though I felt miserable I needed to overcome this feeling or it would swallow me whole. My first semester ended with a 4.0 and a couple of thousand dollars in the bank to pay for next semesters tuition (since I quit one job and the other place got closed down). It was then that I was invited to join an honor society on campus and I leaped at the chance to get involved on campus! \n\nThat spring, my mom was laid off from a job she'd had for 20+ years because she was missing so much work to help nurse my dad, our bread winner, back to health. This hurt us financially because both of my parents have made poor decisions with money over the years and my dad has some serious health issues that require pricey medical attention every so often. I maintained a 4.0, got another job, won the election for SGA president on my campus, and got a leadership position in the honor society I mentioned earlier. \n\nThe fall semester of my sophomore year kicked off with my dad needed surgery again and my mom becoming more angry about becoming a stay at home nurse. I devoted a lot of my efforts to school because I found that Student Life was an outlet that helped me forget about the drama at home. I quit the job that I hated to focus on these passions because I still had money saved to pay for the next two semesters. My sister ran away to join the military at this time (very long story) and it really hurt my entire family and blame was passed around to everyone. It was a horrible, ugly mess. Somehow she left the military and instead of coming home to us she moved in with a friend and stopped taking to us. It was difficult to say the least. Somehow I maintained a 4.0 again. \n\nFinally, this semester is going pretty great. I like to think it's some kind of reward for how hard I've been working and how crappy the past couple of years have been. I've just been super happy with my involvement in the community and the people I've met. It makes it seems like everything is paying off! I've won a couple of scholarships, been awarded some pretty prestigious awards, found an internship for the summer, and, though I haven't decided which university I'll transfer too, I've been offered a great position in the student life at one of my top picks for college. I mean, I shouldn't complain because things for me are great, but they're not for my family. My dad is showing more signs of Alzheimer's and is progressively losing the ability to use his legs and he's the only source of income for the family since my mom still hasn't found/got a job. It's heart breaking because he wants to retire but is afraid of what will happen if he does. We might lose the house because my parents fucked up their taxes this year and things just kind of suck for them overall. \n\nNOW, with all this in mind OP I want to encourage you not to give up or compare yourself to any of us in this thread. We all have different ways to cope and you need to find the best way for you. I personally look at being productive, even if it feels pointless, as the best way to help because it distracts you and when you're feeling better, you'll thank your past self for not giving up. I actually like to write letters to my future self sometimes so I understand how difficult it was for me to accomplish even the most basic task.
