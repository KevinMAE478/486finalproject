Since my GPA is a tick below 3.0 (2.98), I was really looking for whatever I could get. One day, a girl in one of my business organizations I am in told me that the company she interns for is looking for a Supply Chain intern. I looked up the position, and it stated Global Supply Chain Intern. I interviewed and they had stated that this is a full time internship. Once again, starving for experience, I decided to attend school part time and work this internship. Keep in mind also, when I saw the posting for this position, it said January until May. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The internship is not what I expected. For 7 hours a day, I am doing tedious data entry, scanning files, looking at pictures to make sure all the boxes are on a skid, and looking to see if we have inventory for certain items. I get it, it&amp;#39;s an internship. Here is why I plan on quitting. I took this internship to learn about my field, and I haven&amp;#39;t learned a dang thing. I just feel like the data monkey. I also really messed up my school schedule, and now I am in the position that if I don&amp;#39;t take a summer class, I will graduate a semester late. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, I am going back to school in the Fall full time, and am taking a summer class three days out of the week in the morning this summer. I really don&amp;#39;t think I can do the full time thing. One of the other main reasons I want to walk is because I am practically invisible. I have gotten zero feedback on anything I am doing good or bad. Often times when I have a problem, and I email the guy I am an intern for, he rarely responds back. The only time he ever contacts me is if he wants me to do something. When I had to start going to his office, and saying I wasn&amp;#39;t sure how to figure something out, he says he will look at it, and never get back to me. For example, I had an issue trying to process something. He said email so and so. I never got a response from so and so. He says to forward him the the email I sent to him, and that&amp;#39;s all that ever happened. I never found out if it got fixed, what to do if this happens again, nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyday, I go to work, to data entry, scan stuff into the system, or go through this backlog and see if we have stock for the items. No one really talks to me, I am not learning anything new, and I am getting zero feedback. I&amp;#39;ve been busting my but to try and impress people, while the other intern basically sits on his phone all day. He basically gets a promotion. Possibly because he is graduated? I am not sure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember how I said the listing said until May? Well, no one has said a word to me about an exact date or anything. I hope they don&amp;#39;t think I am going to keep working there and keep going to school part time. As a matter of fact, I told HR and one of my bosses six weeks ago I had a wedding to go to. They pretty much said they would follow up with me on what to do. Never happened. Keep in mind I was giving them reminders on this throughout that six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I have one summer left before I graduate. Since I am so close to being to at least 3.0 cumulative (hoping after this semester I will be, currently doing well), I am going to really try my hardest to find another one. Or maybe even part time in the Fall. I just haven&amp;#39;t seen any part time internships for the summer. I can&amp;#39;t go full time with my summer class I need to take or else I graduate late.
