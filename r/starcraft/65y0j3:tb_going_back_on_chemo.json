All corn products and high-fructose corn syrup products are contaminated if it doesn't say Non GMO Project verified. The trending conversation is about GMOs but not the toxins being sprayed on them.

It's not a cure. We are always looking for a *cure.* But we don't need a cure. *The body heals itself.* We need to give the body the ideal environment to do it's job. Most cancers are caused by a virus that shouldn't pose a threat, but it's thriving because we live in an invisible cesspool. There's toxins in your furniture, carpet, clothes, makeup, water, food containers, medicine, vaccines. It's not enjoyable accepting the extent of it, but we have toxic crap surrounding us at all hours of the day. Glyphosate is one super problematic toxin that is in all of us because it is in almost all foods now. Whether you want to or not, going vegan and sticking to raw organic fruits and veggies is just the safest path now. It's the cleanest path. Organic wont always be free of glyphosate, but it will have a higher success rate of passing the test, so to speak. \n\nAlso important is the oxygen. Fresh air is something we are accustomed to *not* having. I would urge everyone to get outside, and out to nature, away from the cars, and focus on your breathing. We are all living in a constant state of being slightly oxygen deprived. Also, you shouldn't underestimate the effects of wi-fi and the wireless communication we have so passively accepted as safe. Some scientists will say it is non-ionizing radiation, therefore it will not harm you. This is not the whole story, don't buy it. Acknowledge the existence of subtle energies. Recognize you live in stress. When you \"decompress\", or attempt to, you may realize how much fear plays a role in your life and how you are kept in a fearful state. Find your lightness however possible. The idea that I needed to kill other animals to keep me alive never sat right with me. I ate meat for 30 years. Finally giving it up and recognizing I truly don't need to kill to survive is a huge relief. My 5 year old self was right, and I wish my parents would have encouraged me. Instead they were under the influence, thinking you need meat for some nutrients. It was a marketing ploy. Every vegetarian is not nutrient deficient. I had no idea I was carrying so much guilt for all the animals that lay in my wake. It was strange feeling it lift. Living in accordance with my innermost beliefs, or getting closer to living that way, brings me more joy and fulfillment in life. There is a lightness to it, and it brings me closer to nature. There is a harmony we are looking for, whether we know it or not, and nature will have the answers. Learning about her wonders will instill a humanity in you. It brings you closer to your roots, your history, and your childishness. \n\nNow back to nutrition and diet. Water. It's good to focus on the fundamentals, I think. Water is not water. Water from fruit and veggies is very different than the water coming out of your tap, or your bottle. I found I felt most fulfilled when I was eating a lot of sweet juicy fruit. My BM's were perfection every day. I became more sensitive and realized how other foods affected this. It's important to acknowledge just how sensitive we are. When you are used to toxicity, you don't see it until you can get away from it for a bit. As your senses heighten, you can really understand the vibration foods hold. Don't write me off as hippie woo-woo. It's all about the vibration, the water, and the sacred geometry built into the plants. But I wont harp on that stuff. Getting as much water from your fruits and veggies as possible is going to do you wonders. There is also a huge world of herbs that are marginalized in our society. Nature as a whole is pushed to the side, so all plant food and plant medicine is as well. The herbs are powerful and should not be forgotten. Modern medicine can be a miracle for so many people. But it also can seriously do folks a disservice. Doctors will commonly, and unfortunately, look to medicines as a prescription instead of prescribing a new lifestyle. It's difficult to get the idea through someone's head, but there is a powerful world of possibilities that seems to be obfuscated by the distractions we are all accustomed to, and forgotten because of all the misconceptions, bad science, advertising, rumors, and downright deception. I've been going strong, seeking the truth for ages now, specifically in the realm of health, and there is very little awareness about some of the problems we've accepted as the norm. The glyphosate is a perfect example. Glyphosate is a chemical in Round Up, the most common pesticide/herbicide. They spray that on all kinds of conventionally grown food and people eat tons of it without knowing anything about it. It is found in something like 90% of women's breastmilk. So babies are born and they are receiving toxins from all directions invisibly. There is a process called desiccation, in which farmers spray wheat with a large amount of this stuff, right before harvesting, to dry it out and prepare it for harvest. Then the wheat is not cleaned properly, and turned into a million other things like bread, beer, and pasta. If you are eating conventionally grown wheat, I would recommend switching to organic *at the very least,* but preferably just cutting out processed stuff and sticking to whole plant foods. Glyphosate causes cancer. It causes leaky gut. Leaky gut allows toxins into the bloodstream through the affected gut lining. Since glyphosate is an anti-biotic, as in *against life,* it negatively affects your gut flora. When this gut flora is not there, you wont digest food properly, will be nutrient deficient, causing your body to crave more food and forcing over-eating. We are starving ourselves to death while we cram food in our faces. Not to mention the dehydration from having a lack of water in the food, because everything is cooked; proteins are denatured and enzymes are rendered inactive; sacred geometry is ruined, processed away as we get further and further from the source. When the leaky gut is present, from glyphosate exposure, and a baby is vaccinated, with an already compromised immune system, the toxins are especially detrimental, getting into the bloodstream and then the brain. Trace amounts suddenly aren't so negligible. This gets into chelation, dealing with heavy metal toxins, autoimmune diseases, colitis, Crohn's disease, IBS, Alzheimer's, autism. I think it's all linked. Not to mention the gluten intolerance. \"Gluten free\" would probably do people better if it was \"Glyphosate free.\" Organic, is *kind of* that. But there's some loop hole, I think, if they can't get organic pesticide where they are, then they can use Round Up. Something like that.\n\n\nThe milk from cows contains a bunch of antibiotics and hormones that were administered to the cows, not to mention the contaminants on the food they're given. GMO corn laced with glyphosate is bioaccumulated in animal flesh, as well as antibiotics, killing all good bacteria too, then the enzymes are pasteurized away... it's just a mess. Sure milk is probably good, if the cow eats good food and isn't mistreated, and their baby's get some milk first, and you drink it [raw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWhb0v-oYnk). But in this day and age, we've got to know where to draw the line. The babies are dragged away from their mothers, for veal, and then the milk that was intended for them is technologically pulled from the mothers. Bad vibes through-and-through. Destiny, on Twitch, did a great little breakdown of how he wouldn't like an alien to come down and exploit humans, and eat us, so why should we do it to other animals? If you are in a similar boat, and don't see an easy way to justify your eating habits, just give it up. It's not a big deal at all. Just get over the hump, as your body's microbiome adjusts, and as you learn how to do it properly, getting the most high-quality stuff. The short of it is just eat plants like a mother freaker. It might take a lot at first, just stuff 'em down your throat. Later you will see the meat is extraneous. A fat juicy mango will always satisfy and you wont be dreaming about a hamburger, I assure you.\n\n\nYou will also find food is much more satisfying when you get into this. You can survive and thrive on less. Caloric restriction is a proven method of extending life span in mice. Simply eating less is good for you. It might seem counterintuitive, and don't take it too far, but you might find a pleasure in eating just what you need, and never getting the kind of sluggish, bloated feeling after a fat meal that is hard to digest. After eating a huge pomello I might feel a bit water balloon-y, but it passes much faster than if I ate a fat bowl of pasta.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel compelled to write this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fresh organic fruits and vegetables.

I had no idea I was carrying so much guilt for all the animals that lay in my wake. It was strange feeling it lift. Living in accordance with my innermost beliefs, or getting closer to living that way, brings me more joy and fulfillment in life. There is a lightness to it, and it brings me closer to nature. There is a harmony we are looking for, whether we know it or not, and nature will have the answers. Learning about her wonders will instill a humanity in you. It brings you closer to your roots, your history, and your childishness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now back to nutrition and diet. Water. It&amp;#39;s good to focus on the fundamentals, I think. Water is not water. Water from fruit and veggies is very different than the water coming out of your tap, or your bottle. I found I felt most fulfilled when I was eating a lot of sweet juicy fruit. My BM&amp;#39;s were perfection every day. I became more sensitive and realized how other foods affected this. It&amp;#39;s important to acknowledge just how sensitive we are. When you are used to toxicity, you don&amp;#39;t see it until you can get away from it for a bit. As your senses heighten, you can really understand the vibration foods hold. Don&amp;#39;t write me off as hippie woo-woo. It&amp;#39;s all about the vibration, the water, and the sacred geometry built into the plants. But I wont harp on that stuff. Getting as much water from your fruits and veggies as possible is going to do you wonders. There is also a huge world of herbs that are marginalized in our society. Nature as a whole is pushed to the side, so all plant food and plant medicine is as well. The herbs are powerful and should not be forgotten. Modern medicine can be a miracle for so many people. But it also can seriously do folks a disservice. Doctors will commonly, and unfortunately, look to medicines as a prescription instead of prescribing a new lifestyle. It&amp;#39;s difficult to get the idea through someone&amp;#39;s head, but there is a powerful world of possibilities that seems to be obfuscated by the distractions we are all accustomed to, and forgotten because of all the misconceptions, bad science, advertising, rumors, and downright deception. I&amp;#39;ve been going strong, seeking the truth for ages now, specifically in the realm of health, and there is very little awareness about some of the problems we&amp;#39;ve accepted as the norm. The glyphosate is a perfect example. Glyphosate is a chemical in Round Up, the most common pesticide/herbicide. They spray that on all kinds of conventionally grown food and people eat tons of it without knowing anything about it. It is found in something like 90% of women&amp;#39;s breastmilk. So babies are born and they are receiving toxins from all directions invisibly. There is a process called desiccation, in which farmers spray wheat with a large amount of this stuff, right before harvesting, to dry it out and prepare it for harvest. Then the wheat is not cleaned properly, and turned into a million other things like bread, beer, and pasta. If you are eating conventionally grown wheat, I would recommend switching to organic &lt;em&gt;at the very least,&lt;/em&gt; but preferably just cutting out processed stuff and sticking to whole plant foods. Glyphosate causes cancer. It causes leaky gut. Leaky gut allows toxins into the bloodstream through the affected gut lining. Since glyphosate is an anti-biotic, as in &lt;em&gt;against life,&lt;/em&gt; it negatively affects your gut flora. When this gut flora is not there, you wont digest food properly, will be nutrient deficient, causing your body to crave more food and forcing over-eating. We are starving ourselves to death while we cram food in our faces. Not to mention the dehydration from having a lack of water in the food, because everything is cooked; proteins are denatured and enzymes are rendered inactive; sacred geometry is ruined, processed away as we get further and further from the source. When the leaky gut is present, from glyphosate exposure, and a baby is vaccinated, with an already compromised immune system, the toxins are especially detrimental, getting into the bloodstream and then the brain. Trace amounts suddenly aren&amp;#39;t so negligible. This gets into chelation, dealing with heavy metal toxins, autoimmune diseases, colitis, Crohn&amp;#39;s disease, IBS, Alzheimer&amp;#39;s, autism. I think it&amp;#39;s all linked. Not to mention the gluten intolerance. &amp;quot;Gluten free&amp;quot; would probably do people better if it was &amp;quot;Glyphosate free.&amp;quot; Organic, is &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; that. But there&amp;#39;s some loop hole, I think, if they can&amp;#39;t get organic pesticide where they are, then they can use Round Up. Something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The milk from cows contains a bunch of antibiotics and hormones that were administered to the cows, not to mention the contaminants on the food they&amp;#39;re given. GMO corn laced with glyphosate is bioaccumulated in animal flesh, as well as antibiotics, killing all good bacteria too, then the enzymes are pasteurized away... it&amp;#39;s just a mess. Sure milk is probably good, if the cow eats good food and isn&amp;#39;t mistreated, and their baby&amp;#39;s get some milk first, and you drink it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWhb0v-oYnk\"&gt;raw&lt;/a&gt;. But in this day and age, we&amp;#39;ve got to know where to draw the line. The babies are dragged away from their mothers, for veal, and then the milk that was intended for them is technologically pulled from the mothers. Bad vibes through-and-through. Destiny, on Twitch, did a great little breakdown of how he wouldn&amp;#39;t like an alien to come down and exploit humans, and eat us, so why should we do it to other animals? If you are in a similar boat, and don&amp;#39;t see an easy way to justify your eating habits, just give it up. It&amp;#39;s not a big deal at all. Just get over the hump, as your body&amp;#39;s microbiome adjusts, and as you learn how to do it properly, getting the most high-quality stuff. The short of it is just eat plants like a mother freaker. It might take a lot at first, just stuff &amp;#39;em down your throat. Later you will see the meat is extraneous. A fat juicy mango will always satisfy and you wont be dreaming about a hamburger, I assure you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will also find food is much more satisfying when you get into this. You can survive and thrive on less. Caloric restriction is a proven method of extending life span in mice. Simply eating less is good for you. It might seem counterintuitive, and don&amp;#39;t take it too far, but you might find a pleasure in eating just what you need, and never getting the kind of sluggish, bloated feeling after a fat meal that is hard to digest. After eating a huge pomello I might feel a bit water balloon-y, but it passes much faster than if I ate a fat bowl of pasta.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "starcraft", "name": "t1_dgehr0b", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492508749.0, "created_utc": 1492479949.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpp6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65y0j3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpp6", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65y0j3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgef04j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "showstealer1829", "parent_id": "t1_dgeejhz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/starcraft", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Meh, you're a cunt.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meh, you&amp;#39;re a cunt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "starcraft", "name": "t1_dgef04j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492505350.0, "created_utc": 1492476550.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeejhz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pystridgesz", "parent_id": "t3_65y0j3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/starcraft", "controversiality": 0, "body": "meh, i fucking hate that guy.
