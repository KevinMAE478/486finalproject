Well, maybe not you but people who learn how can. That may include to indeed actually choose &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to defend but use the opportunity to attack. Your options are not limited to reacting to that exact event right there, you have wider options. If your troops are standing around somewhere uselessly where you can use them for neither defense or offense when something happens it&amp;#39;s not the game&amp;#39;s fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, any sports ever: &amp;quot;Oh, another ball.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Oh, another guy running.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Oh, another guy on a bike.&amp;quot; etc. Yeah, life is booooring. How can anyone stand watching &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;? It always repeats itself. /s&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously, compared to most other things StarCraft is pure diversity. Most sports including those with huge viewership numbers are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; less varied and still have been enjoyed for decades or even centuries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In tennis all they do is hit a ball across a net (one and the same net), for hours, even days. Swimmers swim back and forth, back and forth (not even a shark in sight to create some tension). Don&amp;#39;t even ask what cyclists do.
