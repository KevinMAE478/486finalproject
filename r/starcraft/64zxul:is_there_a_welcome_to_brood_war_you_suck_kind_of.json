Ok so these are the basic rules to follow and I'll explain why:\n\n1- If you want to buy something, do so as soon as you have the money. This is the core principle of the game because logically it's the fastest time you're able to make something. This is why the early game is about spending what you get as fast as possible.\n\n2- The more workers you have, the faster you get resources. So 50 minerals for an scv is worth more in the long run than the same cost for a marine. Barring zerg, you should be pumping workers til you saturate (next point) and divide your workers when you expand.\n\n2a- Try to not have more than 2 workers per mineral plus 3 in gas. This is saturation. You aren't getting more resources for these workers. Exception is if you're just expanding and want to do a Maynard slide.\n\n2b- The zerg economy is more complicated since you have a third resource (larva). It costs larva to make a drone, but your larva production is tied to your hatchery count. It is therefore better to have less workers per base but more bases to defend with. Team liquid has a bit on zerg economic theory, which suggests your worker count should be 5 per hatch. It's a good guideline but too restrictive if you follow it too closely. It should be about risk/reward. Are you spending your resources on drones or fighters?\n\n3- Expanding is an investment that pays off fast. If you have 2 bases, you have double the potential gas and you're probably mining faster than a 1 base player. If you outproduce your opponent you will probably win. More bases are critical to getting the resources to spend.\n\n3a- Do not expand if you aren't spending as fast as you're earning. You will be sitting on excess resources and wasted time expanding when you could be making units.\n\n3b- Expanding is a proactive choice and risk (a critical difference to sc2 imo). By expanding you understand that you are now more vulnerable. You've invested in something and it could be destroyed. The resources spent on your expansion your opponent could have spent on units. Can you defend if your opponent attacks?\n\n4- When your resource income is greater than your expenditure then you need to increase your production capability. Make more barracks or gateways or hatcheries. If you're pumping marines constantly and you build up to 500 minerals, make another barracks unless you intend to spend those on something else. Have your buildings reflect your intended unit composition. If you're intending to go mech you probably want 4-6 factories. Bio probably wants 6-8 barracks late into the game.\n\n5- Attack your opponent's economy. It's simple why. If they lose their workers and expansions, then their production is probably worse than yours. If you can outproduce your opponent you probably win.\n\nThose simple rules should help you understand the game. The rest is stuff you have to read and work out because it's too long to explain but too simple to need a guide. Stuff like tech tree - which liquid already has. That'd be like asking for a list of items and what they do in dota. It will take you some time to learn what everything does but I guarantee it will be quicker than learning heroes or items in dota.\n\nLearn the build orders for simple builds. Like I said, start at 1 base and then go to 2, then defend it, then test different enemies, then try to predict and attack the weakness of your opponent's build. It should be enough to be ok at the game.
