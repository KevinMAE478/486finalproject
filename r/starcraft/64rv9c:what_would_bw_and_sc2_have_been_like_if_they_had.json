She played EVERYONE in SC1 and broodwar. She got the Protoss to kill the overmind and opposing cerebrates for her. She got the Terrans to sabotage the UED psi-controller thing. She got Zeratul to turn on Aldaris, blaming him for an uprising which she orchestrated by infesting the matriarch. She got Duke and Fenix to work for her, and then killed them immediately afterwards. She duped Zeratul, and then revealed that she&amp;#39;d already infested Rhazagal. The last words of both Raynor and Zeratul were &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to fking kill you&amp;quot;. The major forces in the galaxy worked together to try to defeat her, and she crushed them all. She played every major character like pawns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then in SC2 she&amp;#39;s just bumbling around like a dummy, Raynor outmaneuvering her at every turn, before being &amp;quot;cured&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;rescued.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s so absurdly silly. Raynor, after everything she&amp;#39;s done, wants to go rescue her? (And again, takes charge of the Dominion navy in the process?? whut) And Zeratul then goes to help her, to tell her to go get her powers back? She&amp;#39;s the reason the Protoss homeworld fell. She&amp;#39;s the reason Tassadar&amp;#39;s dead. She&amp;#39;s the reason Zeratul turned on Aldaris. She killed Rhazagal. Zeratul&amp;#39;s WHOLE WORLD has been destroyed by Kerrigan, and suddenly he&amp;#39;s all &amp;quot;hey I should help you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now everyone&amp;#39;s gonna work together to solve the Xel Naga problem?

Following the plot of Episode III requires reading the manual. The games don't really explain the Khala and its significance, so when it is hijacked and destroyed the consequences lack impact. Even if this were conveyed in the story, the ease of which the Protoss discard their way of life in favor of all becoming Dark Templar is unbelievable.\n\nThe Zerg, on the other hand, lose everything that made them Zerg. Episode II was the first and the last look at what made the Zerg what they are. Unlike humans, they were truly communist because it was their nature. In contrast to the khala (and the dark templar fears of it), the Zerg really did lose their free will and did not miss it at all. Unlike the Tyranids, the Zerg had multiple personalities that gave them character without sacrificing their goal to assimilate all life. The Overmind stood out further in its use of Old Testament-style speech.\n\nThe plot of BW deliberately demolished the theme and atmosphere of Episode II, where Kerrigan usurps control of the Zerg, which is based on only a surface reading of the plot of SC1. By discarding the communist and quasi-religious leanings of the Zerg, they lose that which made them unique.\n\nThe SC1 manual explained that the Xel'naga created the Overmind to avoid the dangers of separate egos that rendered the Protoss unsuitable. The cerebrates are not separate minds enslaved to the Overmind, they are parts of its own soul that operate on its behalf. The Zerg, quite literally, possess multiple personalities that act in the service of all Zerg.\n\nKerrigan's subplot seems contradictory in two ways: her behavior and her fate. In terms of behavior, she doesn't actually have an separate ego yet her egotism costs the Zerg severely. This paradox unravels when you take a holistic look at the nature of the Zerg and the Overmind. The Overmind is the collective sentience and will of all Zerg strains... including Kerrigan. By assimilating humans, the Zerg gain human sentience or feelings. In this light, Kerrigan is the personification of the Swarm's pride and vanity.\n\nIn terms of fate, Kerrigan is set up as a messianic weapon against the Protoss, only to be left behind when the invasion begins. This isn't as odd as it first appears. As a template for new strains, she doesn't need to be physically present for the swarm to benefit from her psionic powers; fighting the Protoss on Char was a test run, if you will. (Psionic zerg aren't seen in the game due to balance and engine limitations, but in story terms the Overmind had not yet deployed them to assist in infesting the Protoss. Infested protoss weren't seen due to game limitations again, but in story terms this is because the Protoss need more effort to assimilate.)\n\nWhen SC1 ends with the death of the Overmind, it is implied that the Cerebrates perished with him because they existed within him as a gestalt consciousness. While BW has the Cerebrates surviving for an arbitrarily limited period without an Overmind, somehow creating a new overmind without any foreshadowing this was possible, and enslaving feral Zerg, whereas Zasz's death in SC1 was a turning point that terrified the Zerg. Zasz's death injured the Overmind, and healing only commenced after the Garm brood was exterminated. This implies that the Zerg are dual physical and mental entities, not slaves to the Overmind: killing Cerebrates doesn't destroy them, but it does cripple the Swarm until the injured portion is physically cut out.\n\nIf the Overmind was killed, the Cerebrates would die with him and the Swarms would fall apart. Yet Kerrigan, to whom this rule applied, retains her sanity rather than becoming a ravening beast or resuming her original human persona. This shouldn't be possible, as even the smarter Queens and Overlords became feral when their Cerebrates died.\n\nThere is a very simple explanation for this: the Overmind created Kerrigan as a second Overmind, a vanity project that mimicked his own creation while at the same time devising the instrument of the Protoss' destruction. You might think this sounds nonsensical or an attempt to justify BW, but Kerrigan and the Overmind share symbolism in their development. The Overmind's physical form consisted of a shell craddling a fleshy core, while Kerrigan spend time as a fetal form within a protective chrysalis. Both gestated and developed over time, becoming more and more powerful and breaking their restraints: the Overmind devoured its creators, Kerrigan broke her ghost conditioning.\n\nPerhaps the Overmind even made a backup plan in the event of a worst case scenario, since it would be silly not to do so. Perhaps Kerrigan could serve as the kernel for the Overmind and the Cerebrates to be recreated in some form? Or of more immediate interest, could she serve as an anchor for the Cerebrates to avoid destruction? If Kerrigan survived the Overmind's destruction, does it not stand to reason this protection could be extended to other cerebrates?\n\nIn any event, a sequel Zerg campaign that retained the Zerg's uniquely communist, multiple personality nature would necessarily have to include cerebrates as the primary characters. One of the highlights of the cerebrates was their brotherhood and camaraderie, which was barely explored in the limited context of SC1. SC2 took steps to replicate this, but the execution is not the same: while cerebrates may have personalities, they share a single will and offer one another advice. SC2's substitutes for the Cerebrates revolve around Kerrigan and do not banter with one another as cerebrates would be expected to. IMO, an insightful inspiration for a cerebrate brotherhood would be the Brothers from the video game The Void (aka Tension, Turgor).\n\nA primary conflict could be the slow and painful path back to a unified Swarm. With the Overmind's death and gradually regeneration, the Cerebrates suffer from a loss of cohesion and direction. While still parts of one whole, they would suffer an equivalent to psychosis until the Overmind regenerates. Kerrigan is a both a help and a hidrance: she represents the worst parts of the Zerg psyche, but those parts are necessary for the Zerg to rebuild. One cannot fight a war without righteous anger or build a city without pride in one's work. The feral Zerg, which outnumber them vastly, must be destroyed to remove the rotting remnants of the dead cerebrates.\n\nThe psi-disruptor plot could be burrowed as a means of instigating hostilities between the Zerg and the Dominion. When Mengsk tries to solidify his power by somehow enslaving the feral Zerg, the Swarm would fight back (and, more importantly, figure how he can do what they cannot and if it can fix them).\n\nBut I digress. In any case, the games did the Zerg and Protoss a disservice. In today's day and age it is nearly impossible to find interesting aliens that are truly alien, but to introduce convincing aliens only to destroy their alienness is very unsatisfying.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more detailed analysis follows: (In case it isn&amp;#39;t obvious, I am a Zerg fan)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of the two alien races in Starcraft, the Protoss are most similar to humans and the Zerg are most alien.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The political and moral conflict within the Protoss is one of the most poorly explained parts of their story. Following the plot of Episode III requires reading the manual. The games don&amp;#39;t really explain the Khala and its significance, so when it is hijacked and destroyed the consequences lack impact. Even if this were conveyed in the story, the ease of which the Protoss discard their way of life in favor of all becoming Dark Templar is unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Zerg, on the other hand, lose everything that made them Zerg. Episode II was the first and the last look at what made the Zerg what they are. Unlike humans, they were truly communist because it was their nature. In contrast to the khala (and the dark templar fears of it), the Zerg really did lose their free will and did not miss it at all. Unlike the Tyranids, the Zerg had multiple personalities that gave them character without sacrificing their goal to assimilate all life. The Overmind stood out further in its use of Old Testament-style speech.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The plot of BW deliberately demolished the theme and atmosphere of Episode II, where Kerrigan usurps control of the Zerg, which is based on only a surface reading of the plot of SC1. By discarding the communist and quasi-religious leanings of the Zerg, they lose that which made them unique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The SC1 manual explained that the Xel&amp;#39;naga created the Overmind to avoid the dangers of separate egos that rendered the Protoss unsuitable. The cerebrates are not separate minds enslaved to the Overmind, they are parts of its own soul that operate on its behalf. The Zerg, quite literally, possess multiple personalities that act in the service of all Zerg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kerrigan&amp;#39;s subplot seems contradictory in two ways: her behavior and her fate. In terms of behavior, she doesn&amp;#39;t actually have an separate ego yet her egotism costs the Zerg severely. This paradox unravels when you take a holistic look at the nature of the Zerg and the Overmind. The Overmind is the collective sentience and will of all Zerg strains... including Kerrigan. By assimilating humans, the Zerg gain human sentience or feelings. In this light, Kerrigan is the personification of the Swarm&amp;#39;s pride and vanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of fate, Kerrigan is set up as a messianic weapon against the Protoss, only to be left behind when the invasion begins.

Now that I think about it, maybe this is why SC2&amp;#39;s lore sucks so much; they must&amp;#39;ve forgotten a lot of the shit in SC1 and were too lazy to fire up Brood War to remind themselves what really happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or... Maybe they did know, and they just didn&amp;#39;t care. Maybe they wanted to pander to a new generation of RTS gamers. It&amp;#39;s not the most questionable thing they&amp;#39;ve done in SC2&amp;#39;s development history.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "starcraft", "name": "t1_dg50i3i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491977478.0, "created_utc": 1491948678.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
