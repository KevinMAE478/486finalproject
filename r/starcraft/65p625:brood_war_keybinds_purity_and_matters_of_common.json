At least if no key-bindings are added then these should be considered as presets.\n\nI will argue against keybindings as reducing the mechanical difficulty however. The difficulty in the mechanics is largely based on how inputs are received, and the amount of things you can do at any one time. (12 unit control groups, 1 building hotkeys) The unit control and the way they path and attack are intrinsic to the game.\n\nThat being said, just like in SC2. There is virtually no difference between players who use T for attack move, and A for attack move. We have never needed to ban layouts or stop players from using keybinds because it gave an advantage. There was never a GSL finals where Tasteless said *\"Well Polt is using the grid layout and his opponent is using standard, as we all know the grid layout beats standard layouts in mirror TvT matchups\"*\n\nThe rapid fire hotkey which allows you to do those creep spawns or zealot warps still exists. And it is due to how SCII takes in keyboard commands. In SCII many actions/spells take 1 key per command, if you want to spawn 5 zealots you must click 5 times with your mouse. The trick was to bind a key as both warp zealot and left click at the same time, which allowed your keyboards repeat rate to essentially act like a really really fast left click. \n\nI would see users trying to bind \"Move\" and \"attack move\" commands to keys which are alternate's for left click. Which would allow you to point your cursor and hold the key to get dragoons up a ramp nicely rather then smashing right click 400 times. If that's to easy then we can let blizzard decide. But it wont ever be a reason someone wins any title or advances to the next rank because of a hotkey.  Plus, BW already had people using hotkeys and none of them ever won any tournament from their layouts.\n\nOn a personal note, because hotkeys have virtually never made a performance difference ever in SCII and even with the custom hotkey mods people did for BW I see hotkeys much like a colour blind option. It would seem crazy to tell someone who is colour blind to \"Just learn to see better\" in the same way we tell people that they can just learn the keyboard better. It makes all the difference in the world for those who need re-bind support and yet makes no difference once you are on ladder. Other highly competitive games allow hotkeys and have never had an issue, why is BW suddenly not allowed hotkey support? If players wanted absurd mechanical difficulty then **ALL** hotkeys should be removed and the game should have zero keyboard support. (That's a silly idea of course but it is an extreme example)", "edited": 1492367816.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The options for standard and grid would be a welcome addition. At least if no key-bindings are added then these should be considered as presets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will argue against keybindings as reducing the mechanical difficulty however. The difficulty in the mechanics is largely based on how inputs are received, and the amount of things you can do at any one time. (12 unit control groups, 1 building hotkeys) The unit control and the way they path and attack are intrinsic to the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, just like in SC2. There is virtually no difference between players who use T for attack move, and A for attack move. We have never needed to ban layouts or stop players from using keybinds because it gave an advantage. There was never a GSL finals where Tasteless said &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Well Polt is using the grid layout and his opponent is using standard, as we all know the grid layout beats standard layouts in mirror TvT matchups&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rapid fire hotkey which allows you to do those creep spawns or zealot warps still exists.
