His nature of being a backstabing, power hungry, maniacal, steaming pile of shit is everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proof is in the pudding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scandal after scandal still he wins over the mindless spawn who revere him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has destroyed the trust of many in the community while always able to get a front seat at the table with his brash bulling tactics. \nI know the behavior he exhibits is that of a rotten child without respect and consideration for others which is masked with charm and wit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/wfdd9sa\"&gt;Nonetheless the bastard is a fraud who never had any talent for playing the game on any level of excellence. \nSure he represented usa for who knows what anymore, which proves my point even more. /if you know what I mean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly his ties with starcraft are as deep as they are foul.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sickens me to my stomach knowing he once had a mic talking over a scarlett match, it was so terribly sickening to here this miserable bastard with zero skill go on and laugh, bash, criticize the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1um5c3/a_dungeons_and_dragons_livestream_goes_awry_when/\"&gt;&amp;quot;QueenOfBlades&amp;quot; mercilessly though so much doubletalk and innuendo and folks just acted like they never understood wtf was going on! His remarks were that of an all star jock &amp;quot;having fun&amp;quot;(a total dickhead would be accurate) without fear of any repercussions and none were had as his fame disturbingly grew and grew.&lt;br/&gt;\nHe has done miserable shit in the community and most of it behind closed doors NAMELY TEAMLIQUID a unbelievable site with serious disturbing detestable behavior should you be one of the &amp;quot;INN&amp;quot; guys like geoff robinson.&lt;/a&gt;\nThe reason being that this individual along with his cohorts got away with so much crap is because TEAMLIQUID was a backwater internet site which was so very niche that is lost far more users than it gained/ please imagine a neonazi hangout for wierdos who &amp;quot;like&amp;quot; korean aka gooks(han-gook) guys as &amp;quot;real life gods&amp;quot; kind site.
