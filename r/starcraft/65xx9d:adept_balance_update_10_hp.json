I still think the adept looks fierce, and is still a wayy too versatile and gimmicky unit, like the blink stalker used to be. \n\n&gt;but not anywhere close to the degree protoss has in the last 7 years.\n\nProtoss has gotten hate for having OP units by people that couldn't play very well vs protoss, granted; beating protoss was absolutely the hardest learning curve **I** *ever* had to surpass in WoL, but it doesn't mean toss was OP, just required a different set of skills compared to TvT and TvZ. However, if you think that protoss has gotten **much much** more 'legit' whine than the other races, you're just not right, the outcry and rage vs terran has been just as prevalent since day 1, since blue flame, bunker, proxy barracks, since marines, since medivacs, JUST like 4gate, dark templar, proxy pylon, khaydarian amulet, if you had played Terran just as much as you have toss, you'd be really surprised at how much hate you get for playing your brains out, or for being smart, or for catching your opponent off guard. Also a lot of the problem with 'toss being shit on', is the absolutely ridiculous way toss works, it really doesn't fit well in an rts to be able to completely switch up the playing field in mere seconds with warpins, **when the other races cannot**, example: T and P have a huge fight, there is no clear victor, terran lingers with maybe 10 units, but lo and behold: 10 Dark Templar warpin, spread across multiple bases and voila win, even though terran has equal amounts of resources in the bank. This leads to seriously infuriating losses, which you don't really get in the other matches, and I fail to see how anyone would not ever once get upset by this. As I've said I've played a lot of toss too, and the only thing that I find equally infuriating when I play toss is **widow mine**, or when 3/3 Bio has become unstoppable, but as a Terran I've been wishing the widow mine gone since I first saw it, I fucking hate using it **and** playing against it.  \n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying to nerf the tank to the point where you can&amp;#39;t go tank pushes but it would be nice if protoss had a bit easier time with them&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree.
