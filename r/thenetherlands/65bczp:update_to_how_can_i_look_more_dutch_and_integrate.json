On some body types that are heavier you&amp;#39;ll get a hilarious contrast between skinnier legs due to the jeans and a fatter torso, and the posted picture presents someone who clearly has chosen clothing in a cut too slim for his body type.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, in other words, it&amp;#39;s still really dumb to buy clothing that is technicaly too small for your body, like &lt;a href=\"/u/NL89NL\"&gt;/u/NL89NL&lt;/a&gt; said because it will start to look like the example posted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hole point of wearing clothes that are regular cut (And by todays standards, even baggy) is to keep body proportions in check and not make people look slimmer. Someone suggesting to downsize your clothing by 1 or 2 sizes is not helping. Instead, look at how a different fitting garment could help. Slim fit jeans and straight fit jeans would be an option here. Skinny is a step too far. Straight fit does not mean bad fitting. Hell, the trousers OP is wearing in the picture aren&amp;#39;t even that bad. Sure, they&amp;#39;re too long, but other than maybe going down inch lenght wise, there&amp;#39;s no point in going for another size.\nI think the issue you&amp;#39;re having is that we&amp;#39;re so used to seeing shoes emphasized in someone&amp;#39;s fit that jeans which don&amp;#39;t put the focus on shoes suddently look unflattering. There&amp;#39;s an easy fix for that: Cuff your pants. Wear contrasting shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thenetherlands", "name": "t1_dg9q12s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492231420.0, "created_utc": 1492202620.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_30hrx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bczp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgak63t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nickcageten", "parent_id": "t1_dg9csus", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thenetherlands", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What are these fitted pants you speak of ?

Buying smaller pants would be really dumb, because it would expose the fact that OP is a little wider (That's what I gather from the pictures anyways).

Any of these sneakers in an unoffensive colorway will go with just about anything. Avoid black sneakers, you'll look like a waiter (I hate black sneakers. I think they're hideous.

Usually these jackets are fairly short.This is ideal, as we want your legs look longer, resulting in you looking taller. They also keep you warm during chilly spring evenings. If you've got cash to spend, I recommend Alpha Industries for a bomber and something like Denham, Scotch &amp; Soda, Nudie Jeans or something for a denim jacket. As for denim jackets, pick an inoffensive wash. I.e., nothing too distressed. That's pretty easy with the aforementioned brands, but in the H&amp;M you'll have to look out. Same goes for Zara. For a bomber: Avoid olive green, this will make layering more difficult. Go for black or navy blue.\n\n**Advice for tops**\n\nWhat do you regularly wear on your torso? I'm so glad you asked! You can go for just about any T-shirt. Should be fitted, but if it doesn't cover your entire belly properly, size up. Prints are actually fine, so long as they are still images . Text is horrible in my opinion. Only allowed if you want to show off a brand. Not recommended. I also recommend you look for some linen T-shirts, too keep that sweet airflow and not get too hot. When it gets hot here in the Netherlands.\n\n\nI'd be glad to also type out something like this for winter seasons when people are interested, but I'm too lazy to do that now.\n\n\nOh yeah, something else I hate: Wearing a jacket, a dress shirt and then a pair of jeans with very brown dress shoes.
