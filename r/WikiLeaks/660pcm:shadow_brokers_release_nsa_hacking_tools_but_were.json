That also open the &lt;a href=\"https://threatpost.com/shadowbrokers-expose-nsa-access-to-swift-service-bureaus/124996/\"&gt;question of what the NSA&lt;/a&gt; was doing with the applications? They could have have been tracking &amp;quot;suspects&amp;quot; but it seems they could have also been moving money for any reason they chose without records being left in the banking system. The possible exploits were only exposed after a series of bank robberies exposed the power of the tools the NSA had developed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems once again crimes have exposed the government&amp;#39;s illicit powers concealed by the intelligence community (IC). It is entirely possible that the tools were used legally and only to expose private records of terrorists and spies under FISA warrants, but who knows. The only thing that exposed these exploits was the theft. Kinda makes ya wonder, huh?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The evidence and the different styles of hacking listed in the articles about the bank heists suggests that an initial group stole some NSA hacking tools and pulled off the Bangladesh heist. They may or may not have done Ecuador or the Philippines but it seems that at some point the exploits were sold on the open market, but that does not exclude some clandestine deals with other groups that also have employed the exploits. Once the initial 81 million was stolen they distributed the exploits to other groups who may have also attacked the SWIFT system and other targets to make forensics on nation state level zero day attacks that much more difficult. Several groups attempting independent attacks increased the attack vectors making identification even more difficult. It also appears that the hackers may have targeted banks that had the Trojans installed initially. So why would they go for relatively small scores when they essentially owned the SWIFT system. Could the hackers be attacking networks already infected with the Trojan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really makes sense when you think about the banks they hit. The NSA installs the Trojans to &amp;quot;observe&amp;quot; suspected transactions. The hackers obtain the exploits, found the Trojans phoning home and used them to own the infected systems, modified the attack vectors to transfer money. Why not skip the phishing attack when there was already infected banks. Take the path of least resistance that leads back to someone the American government would never admit lead away from the hackers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course that means anyone including the IC could have manipulated transactions, but hey that wouldn&amp;#39;t have been a robbery would it. Really the tools could have been used to track transactions, but they could have facilitated the IC surreptitious movement of money to fund operations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all reality it was very clever, make a score, don&amp;#39;t get greedy, prevent the creation of a M.O. to narrow investigations and identify the perpetrators. But identifying clever when they managed to steal exploits from the NSA and could use the exploits to attack the banking system. Just the fact that they can&amp;#39;t be identified means they are pretty slick and the exploits are not for the novice user.
