Can anyone really have a constructive conversation with say, Milo Yiannapolous, when his position is that he should be able to out trans people and illegal immigrants and give their information out for them to be serially harassed?  It especially doesn't make sense at Berkeley, where they are obviously in college and doing their damnedest to educate and better themselves, to act like, as a human, they have no right to be here and to do just that.  To treat them instead like a villain for \"abusing\" access to knowledge and education, because they didn't come to the country in the \"right way.\"  I find it *very* hard to have a rational discussion with someone who has that attitude an opinion (Partially because I view myself and others as humans first, and nationality second.  No one chooses the country or family they are born into.  To act like they are wrong for struggling toward something better, even if they did it illegally, is in my mind, bullshit.).  At a certain point, you  have to say to people like that, \"we won't allow you to spread your bullshit anymore, and if we can't have a rational discussion, because you are not rational to begin with, we must resort to violence.\"\n\nIt's like saying to Black Lives Matter protestors that they should all hold hands and sing around the same cops who are killing their family members, and might kill them too, given the chance.  It's absurd and backward to try to \"peacefully\" resolve an issue where one side is vocal about their plan to erode civil rights for the other side, removing the other sides ability to be politically involved.\n\nThe right wants to take civil rights away from many groups who fall under a leftists banner.  What is the left trying to \"take\" from the right, anyway?  Not their civil rights, not their ability to care for themselves, not their healthcare, not their home not their livelihood, many advocate for Basic Income.  No, those are all things the left (the *real* left, not the joke that is the Democratic party) want everyone to have, regardless of political belief.  We want everyone to have healthcare and civil rights and a home and to not be gouged by the rentier class.  Hell, the socialist/anarchist/AntiFa leftists are even on the same page with gun control, they're against a lot of it, because they see the need to arm themselves against a renegade State as well.\n\nSo maybe, just maybe, the reason they are fighting is because one side, whether they are racist or not, has political plans dedicated to removing rights and making lives harder for many, many people, while the socialists/anarchist just want people to be able to live their lives without being bothered by government or their fellow citizens for how they live (so, you know, quite like Libertarian, except they also think social responsibility is just as important as personal responsibility.).\n\nAnyway, that's about the only thing she's really wrong about in the article, and maybe she ought to spend some time discussing the issues with the AntiFa who would heartily agree that it is the rich trying to divide us, and that they are there to fight for diversity and to *not* let people who are too proud to see they've been duped and told brown people are the source of most of their problems continue spreading that backward message.  Because yes, as much as they want to pretend it wasn't, racist dog-whistling was a cornerstone of Trumps campaign, and it has allowed far more divisive and racist groups to organize under the Trump banner, even if Trump himself and the majority of his supporters aren't the worst racists that the left makes them out to be.  These hate groups are using the cover of Trump and weasel words to spread hateful messages and get more onboard with their hateful ideas, ideas which do nothing to help us organize under the same banner, but ideas which divide us based on nationality, religion, and the color of our skin.

Can anyone really have a constructive conversation with say, Milo Yiannapolous, when his position is that he should be able to out trans people and illegal immigrants and give their information out for them to be serially harassed?  It especially doesn&amp;#39;t make sense at Berkeley, where they are obviously in college and doing their damnedest to educate and better themselves, to act like, as a human, they have no right to be here and to do just that.  To treat them instead like a villain for &amp;quot;abusing&amp;quot; access to knowledge and education, because they didn&amp;#39;t come to the country in the &amp;quot;right way.&amp;quot;  I find it &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; hard to have a rational discussion with someone who has that attitude an opinion (Partially because I view myself and others as humans first, and nationality second.  No one chooses the country or family they are born into.  To act like they are wrong for struggling toward something better, even if they did it illegally, is in my mind, bullshit.).
