I went into lifting with a desire to gain more weight and muscle and, though I haven&amp;#39;t reached my aesthetic goals yet, I&amp;#39;m proud about my weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started in 2015. Since then, my bouts of lifting have been moderately consistent. I went 3x a week in the first semester of university, took about a month break during Christmas break and got back into 3x a week the second semester.

I downloaded an app with an encyclopaedia of gym exercises. After my first few weeks of experimenting with exercises, each of my days consisted of bench press, incline bench, bodyweight dips / pullups, ez bar curls, landmine press, cable tricep pulldowns, dumb bell curls, lat pulldowns and cable rows. These are the exercises I felt the most comfortable with and saw considerable progress in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the lack of squatting, deadlifts and OHP is bound to get me some hate here. I recognize the serious benefits of all these exercises and plan on learning them this summer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for my only compound lift (bench press), I&amp;#39;ve managed to successfully 5 x 5 my bodyweight and have since plateaued. I&amp;#39;m beginning to find that the strength in my wrists are lacking and want to overcome that obstacle before I raise my weight in bench. I haven&amp;#39;t tested my 1rm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t count calories -- ever. However, I frequently ate calorie dense foods and gorged out at places like McDonalds. It wasn&amp;#39;t clean but, as far as gaining weight went, it got the job done. Moving forward, I do intend on counting my calories and eating healthier.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consistency is so key. I know I missed out on a lot of gains early on by not following proven beginner programs and eating properly, but i&amp;#39;ve undeniably seen significant improvements in my physique, endurance and strength solely as a result of going to the gym 3x a week. I hope that my post can help motivate some discouraged readers who are turned off by the prospects of programs / healthy eating to at least stay consistent with their journey in the gym. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Here to post my progress. \n\n**Disclaimer:** my interest in lifting has been casual and I didn't abide by any orthodox routines nor did I count my calories.
