To be honest, I don't see much of a difference in your pictures either way. 5kg of weight gain over three months isn't really enough to \"get\" anything - muscular or fat, it'll mostly be water, food and poop. You're facing the skinny-fat dilemma that most on the sub confront. Too little muscle to cut; too much body fat to gain. \n\nThis is just my opinion, but I personally think it's better to start at a lower BF%. Others disagree. If I were you, this is what I would do.\n \n1. Pick a reputable hypertrophy/strength programme. One that incorporates as much frequency and volume as you're willing to dedicate. Personally, I feel 3 times a week is too little. \n2. Begin cutting. You are probably sitting at ~20% BF, which is rather high to begin a bulk from. I recommend 10-15lbs to drop to 13-15% BF, over 10-15 weeks. You'll be a skeleton, but it'll only be for a short while.  \n3. Dial in a high protein diet; track macros and baseline TDEE.\n4. Use this time to develop form and increase numbers on your compound lifts and raise the intensity of your workouts. You want to focus on gaining strength in the main compounds (ie, low reps); whilst getting in volume for hypertrophy on accessories (ie, high reps). This will be built into most programmes. Inevitably when someone gains excessive fat, it's due to eating too much and lifting too little. Intensity and progressive overload is key.\n5. At the end of the 10-15 weeks you should be a lower BF% and improved strength. This is the foundation to start from. \n6. Begin lean bulk, ~2-4lbs a month. If you got down to 13%, you can maintain the bulk for most of the year, sneaking in short cuts to stay lean.\n\nThis, however, is merely my opinion. Other, more experienced lifters, might disagree. \n\n", "edited": 1492206176.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga is great, but it&amp;#39;s also a reasonable commitment in its own right and pretty difficult if your flexibility isn&amp;#39;t great.
