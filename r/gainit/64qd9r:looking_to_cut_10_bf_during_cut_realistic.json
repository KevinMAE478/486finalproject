I have a friend who&amp;#39;s lean bulking rn and you can still see his abs under lighting. Also check out OmarIsuf on youtube.

When you step on a scale, it doesn't distinguish. So when you weigh yourself or try to figure out your TDEE based on your weight change and energy expenditure/ calories consume, that water weight is making your calculations less accurate. A 500 calorie surplus is great starting point IMO, but like you said, you're gaining a max of 2lbs of muscle a month. A 500 calorie surplus is going to get you that 2lbs with another 2lbs of fat for a total of 4lbs a month (3500 surplus calories in a week = 1lb gained). You will be gaining half fat and half muscle. Then you're gonna have to cut that fat because you decided to go with 500 instead of 250, and you're going to lose muscle every week that you have to cut, and you won't be able to spend that time building muscle. Essentially, overeating now (500 calories) is going to make it take even longer to build up your muscle because you're going to have to stop bulking to start cutting and while you cut you're undoing progress of that bulk.\n\nThe better way? Don't use a calculator. For 2 weeks just record your consumption without altering it. Your weight should stay the same. If it stays the same, the average calories per day in that 2 weeks is equal to your TDEE. Add ~200-300 calories on that to slowly build. You're still going to gain some fat, and you won't get the full 2lbs of muscle a month, but it's still going to outpace the constant bulking and cutting, and its probably a lot better for you.\n\nSo I guess I actually disagree with everything you said.
