Some background would probably help. I&amp;#39;m 6&amp;#39;3, 140 lbs, 18 years old, and male. As the title says, I&amp;#39;m stuck in a vicious cycle, and it all started with food. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am ADHD, and to help with concentrating in school, my doctor prescribed a 20mg, extended release Adderall pill every morning before school. Adderall is a stimulant, so I was warned that it would decrease my appetite, but for the most part I was fine. Then tennis season rolled around. Because practice and matches happen every day after school, I was using a lot more energy than before, but didn&amp;#39;t change my eating habits to match that. In addition, my school schedule got a lot tighter because tennis was taking up more of my time, and I would often simply forget to eat because of how busy I was. So that gets me to where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The TDEE calculator linked in the sidebar tells me that I should eat 3000 calories a day to maintain my weight. I&amp;#39;m currently between 1000 and 1500. The rest of my family is pretty sedentary and non ADHD, so they can&amp;#39;t comprehend struggling to gain weight. My parents are supportive, but also (imo) grossly favor protein over calories, which I have told them time and time again isn&amp;#39;t helpful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What can I do to pretty much double my caloric intake? Some other information that would probably be helpful to know: Since I&amp;#39;ve forgotten to eat, my stomach has shrunk considerable, not allowing me to eat large meals. Because of this, I do get hungry more often, but most of my teachers are anal about eating in their classrooms. I do get hungry after dinner, at about 10 or 11pm, but my parents&amp;#39; bed is close enough to the kitchen that their sleep is disturbed when I make food that late at night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t think of anything else at the moment, but seriously guys, I&amp;#39;m stuck. All suggestions are appreciated, and I thank everyone that took the time to get to the bottom of this massive post.
