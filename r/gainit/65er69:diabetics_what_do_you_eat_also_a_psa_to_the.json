I did this thanks to you guys telling me my sodium and sugar numbers might be high, but really I should just check. So I did. All my numbers and stuff (this was a super extensive test) were fine, but Im pre pre diabetic. This is due to my high carb intake, high sugar intake (bananas have a super high glycemic index, I eat two a day), and It&amp;#39;s super hereditary. So my doctor advised that I cut back on sugars, and carbs in general, and to especially pay attention to the glycemic index of foods. Anyways, the gist of this is that I eat 350-400 carbs a day, a lot of it coming from pasta and bread. I have 800cals of pasta every day, but I need to change that. So diabetics of Reddit, what do you eat to reach your caloric goals without going nuts on your carbs and sugars?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "PSA: Get your blood work done.
