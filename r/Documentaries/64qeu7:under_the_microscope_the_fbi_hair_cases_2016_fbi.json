Both sides of my family are abusive and the last 5 yrs of my life have been one abusive situation after another. Plus, I didn't realize it at the time, but my ex was a narcissist and emotionally abusive. Every time I think I had removed the last one, another one piled on. It is learned behavior though and I honestly think they don't have a clue because it is normal to them.\n\nI'm finally back to the point where I will just not be around them and keep to myself and make my family as I go like I've done most of my life. I feel like the therapy has actually made me more sensitive to it. When I was younger, before I moved away, I could literally only feel anger (or depression) and had to learn what feeling hurt and sad was like. If someone hurt me I'd just go immediately to anger which was a protection. Now I feel the hurt and sadness and rejection. It sucks in an  abusive situation, but with healthy people, it is great because I can tell them what's going on and communicate instead of blowing up. \n\nIt is really hard work and if I'd known I'd still be working on it 19 yrs later, I may never have started, but I'd never go back to what I was before. My doctor saved my soul. I would be just like those people if I never went and I'd have never known what it is like to not feel like a worthless piece of shit my whole life. \n\nLuckily, I have great friends and have had for longer than I've had my family back in my life so I know it isn't me. I have a great therapist who can convince me it isn't me with real examples when I still need reassurance, and I   know I can do pretty much anything on my own because I have.

I moved into an RV, gutted it, fixed it up and traveled the country for 3 years because it sounded fun. I bought a house at 19. I traveled to other countries. I'm not trying to brag, it usually sounds more impressive to other people than it actually is, but I did reach a lot of the goals I only dreamed about when I was younger and that helps me see I'm not a loser.

I cruise down there, almost crashing multiple times, I find a firefighter and was like \"Hey I brought you guys the tools you forgot!\" and they were super cool, took the tools, then asked if I wanted to see the station, I was like \"Hells ya!\" always had wanted to be a fire fighter.  Suddenly the firefighter I'm talking to is like \"Do you smoke cigarettes?\"  I say \"no.\" he says \"You want one? You know how to use a lighter?\" and I was like \"No thanks, I don't smoke.\"  (Keep in mind I'm 13 years old) and I just started getting this strange feeling.  Then he says \"Come with me!\" and we start walking along the shoulder of the road, and he asks me to find \"Old Cigarette butts\" and of course I did find a couple and was like \"here's one!\" and handed them to him.  He continued to ask questions that were kinda odd, then he just cut to the chase, he was like \"We know it was you, we know you started it, we know you started another fire over on X street, and last year on Y street in town.\"  I was ready to cry, so confused, \"I didn't do that.\" and he was kinda like \"Well you'll go to jail unless you tell us.\"  And I just repeated that I didn't do it.  Then he just completely stopped talking to me and ignored me, and I was like \"I guess I'll go now...\" and rode home, confused I told my mom about it, she freaks out realizing they were trying to get me to admit to a crime I hadn't done.  I was told to never talk to them again, and avoid firefighters, which sucked because I loved them, I did eventually do 3 years of firefighting in Montana, but, ya I always remember how they tried to frame me, and they didn't even care, I assume they just didn't want to do the paperwork.  This was like the day before the arson investigator showed up.
