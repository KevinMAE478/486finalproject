Physical examples come to mind easily, but social examples are just as ubiquitious. \n\nThe healthcare corruption is analagous to the financial system corruption, but instead of selling toxic financial products they are selling toxic medical procedures. This is statistically provable, the same way Stephen Levitt proved that Sumo wrestlers were throwing matches. \n\nIf a healthcare facility gets a new medical asset, all the sudden the number of patients who need this device will increase. This increase is statistically-impossible to happen naturally. The correlations are too tight. It happens because the doctors finances dictate their behavior more than patients actual conditions. \n\nIf insurance adds a new reimbursable medical code, all the sudden all the patients who the doctor can get away with diagnosing that condition with will have this disease. Behavioral economics, specifically incentive structures, make this pathological corruption visible. Otherwise it's hard to see. \n\nCombine this reality with the fact that the healthcare system is deregulated, (remember the 90's?) The healthcare system is a self-regulating industry. As such, it relies on internal checks and balances to achieve market-discipline. Otherwise the system decays like a physical system, and it's the public that suffers. The cost is public good. With the healthcare industry corruption we literally pay with our lives, and well-being. Our very bodies. \n\nThe collateral damage is conservatively* estimated at 400,000 preventable American deaths annually, and an additional 4,000,000 - 8,000,000 serious life-altering injuries. Again, from preventable medical error. [2013 Journal of Patient Safety]\n\nThe financial industry, like the healthcare industry, had one of it's primary self-regulatory functions, namely the ratings agencies (e.g. Moodies), become corrupted. How this system-critical function became corrupted was; if the ratings agencies didn't rate the toxic financial assets the industry was pushing onto the public AAA, then they would lose business. They faced possible and likely insolvency. So they abdicated their market function.\n\nThe analogous 'regulatory agency' in the healthcare system is the malpractice function. It also doesn't work, just like the financial ratings agencies before it. Doctors can literally do anything to patients, even surgically operate on them against their will, during 'elective' surgeries and face no accountability. \n\nThis patient had his face cut out by a doctor who admitted he had no informed consent, and incredibly, no medical reason either. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/5pwZHI1Vmws\n\nThat surgeon will likely face no culpability. The healthcare system has no accountability, because their internal regulatory functions have been compromised. \n\nThis short documantary further highlights the deep system corruption in the healthcare industry.

Physical examples come to mind easily, but social examples are just as ubiquitious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The healthcare corruption is analagous to the financial system corruption, but instead of selling toxic financial products they are selling toxic medical procedures. This is statistically provable, the same way Stephen Levitt proved that Sumo wrestlers were throwing matches. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a healthcare facility gets a new medical asset, all the sudden the number of patients who need this device will increase. This increase is statistically-impossible to happen naturally. The correlations are too tight. It happens because the doctors finances dictate their behavior more than patients actual conditions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If insurance adds a new reimbursable medical code, all the sudden all the patients who the doctor can get away with diagnosing that condition with will have this disease. Behavioral economics, specifically incentive structures, make this pathological corruption visible. Otherwise it&amp;#39;s hard to see. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Combine this reality with the fact that the healthcare system is deregulated, (remember the 90&amp;#39;s?) The healthcare system is a self-regulating industry. As such, it relies on internal checks and balances to achieve market-discipline. Otherwise the system decays like a physical system, and it&amp;#39;s the public that suffers. The cost is public good. With the healthcare industry corruption we literally pay with our lives, and well-being. Our very bodies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The collateral damage is conservatively* estimated at 400,000 preventable American deaths annually, and an additional 4,000,000 - 8,000,000 serious life-altering injuries. Again, from preventable medical error. [2013 Journal of Patient Safety]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The financial industry, like the healthcare industry, had one of it&amp;#39;s primary self-regulatory functions, namely the ratings agencies (e.g. Moodies), become corrupted. How this system-critical function became corrupted was; if the ratings agencies didn&amp;#39;t rate the toxic financial assets the industry was pushing onto the public AAA, then they would lose business. They faced possible and likely insolvency. So they abdicated their market function.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The analogous &amp;#39;regulatory agency&amp;#39; in the healthcare system is the malpractice function. It also doesn&amp;#39;t work, just like the financial ratings agencies before it. Doctors can literally do anything to patients, even surgically operate on them against their will, during &amp;#39;elective&amp;#39; surgeries and face no accountability. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This patient had his face cut out by a doctor who admitted he had no informed consent, and incredibly, no medical reason either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/5pwZHI1Vmws\"&gt;https://youtu.be/5pwZHI1Vmws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That surgeon will likely face no culpability.
