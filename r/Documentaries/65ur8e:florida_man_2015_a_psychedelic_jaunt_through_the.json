Can we help you with anything?\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When a middle-aged woman asks about a box of crackers, no aisle number is blurted out. Instead, an employee races off to find the item, just as he is trained to do. At checkout, shoppers move to the front quickly, thanks to a two-customer-per-line goal enforced by proprietary, predictive staffing software. Baggers, a foggy memory at most large supermarket chains, carry purchases to the parking lot. Even Publix\u2019s president, Todd Jones, who started out as a bagger 33 years ago, stoops down to pick up specks of trash on the store floor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cWe believe that there are three ways to differentiate: service, quality and price,\u201d Jones says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be good at two of them, and the best at one. We make service our number one, then quality and then price.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If that\u2019s a dig at Wal-Mart\u2013traditional slogan: \u201cAlways low prices\u201d\u2013which has recently targeted Publix\u2019s home turf, Florida, it\u2019s a subtle one. The more direct retort comes via the numbers. As best we can tell, Publix is the most profitable grocery chain in the nation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2013/07/24/the-wal-mart-slayer-how-publixs-people-first-culture-is-winning-the-grocer-war/amp/\"&gt;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2013/07/24/the-wal-mart-slayer-how-publixs-people-first-culture-is-winning-the-grocer-war/amp/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dgdrca3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492477277.0, "created_utc": 1492448477.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdlwka", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 44, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iliketunamelts", "parent_id": "t3_65ur8e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Publix is legit", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publix is legit&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dgdlwka", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492471122.0, "created_utc": 1492442322.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ur8e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ur8e", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdpdxh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 20, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FirstyouMakeAPaste", "parent_id": "t1_dgdmb1s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah I hear you!
