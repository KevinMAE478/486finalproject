Because the thing they purchased will fulfill some desire of theirs, whatever that desire is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is that introspection is only useful for a certain amount of personal growth. You can&amp;#39;t be the best version of you if that&amp;#39;s all you do. You can develop skills, create things, help people, any number of things that can help you grow as a person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You make it sound like introspection is the only way smart people can ever enjoy life, but that&amp;#39;s just plain not true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work in IT because a lot of what I do is help people. Just so happens that someone is willing to give me money for it. I get the money, and I can buy things like wood for carpentry, or video games for when I want to visit someone else&amp;#39;s imagined world, or ingredients for cooking, or materials for gardening. Most of these things I do are relatively mindless activities that let me think about other things. Not myself, most of the time, since like I said I went through an introspection phase and &amp;quot;found&amp;quot; whatever it was I was looking for already. I generally think about other things, like something new to build.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dg9htk1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492221559.0, "created_utc": 1492192759.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9fuse", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Notafraidofthelark", "parent_id": "t1_dg9dzx8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Automating your job is great.
