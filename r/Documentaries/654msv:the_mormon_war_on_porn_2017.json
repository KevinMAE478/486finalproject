If you don&amp;#39;t pay your 10% tithing you cannot enter into the temples to perform rituals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.lds.org/church/news/lds-family-services-no-longer-operating-as-adoption-agency?lang=eng\"&gt;For a while the mormons ran an adoption agency that recently shutdown to bring children into the faith.&lt;/a&gt;\nThis was recently discontinued.  Perhaps the experiment didn&amp;#39;t bear fruit as much as they had hoped.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/23/why-is-the-mormon-church-getting-out-of-the-adoption-business.html\"&gt;It certainly wasn&amp;#39;t because of bad press when trying to gain control of America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Temple attendance is not mandatory, but seen as a way to inflate membership through &lt;a href=\"https://www.lds.org/topics/baptisms-for-the-dead?lang=eng&amp;amp;old=true\"&gt;baptism of the dead&lt;/a&gt;.  This practice of baptizing deceased family members into the church has helped drive genealogy efforts to all time records.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics\"&gt;You can view the current statistics here&lt;/a&gt;, and baptisms for the dead are seen as permanent members.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway. tl;dr&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*The Church membership numbers do not add up because they are retroactively adding dead people (usually entire families in one go) to the registry.\n*Porn is seen as a huge threat to family growth (it may be removing the pressure to marry young and have children within the church)\n*Mormons have huge families, and their multi-generational children keep the church alive\n*15 million members\n*10% of income is tithed to bring in ~7 million per year\n*Yearly net growths can be currently attributed to setting up in fresh and poor markets.\n*By giving aid, they encourage membership.\n*Members get access to food, water, manpower.\n*Mandatory &amp;#39;Blessed&amp;#39; (read:magic) under-pant designs were updated to help fund the church so personal (non church related) money could be spent on passing of discrimination laws\n*Adopt or don&amp;#39;t be saved is over&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have very mixed feelings about the &amp;#39;Church&amp;#39;.  I agree with the overall message, but the lore is a bust, and the overall setup is Multi-level-market-ey.  At the end of the day I&amp;#39;m a byproduct of the lds family services.  I can attribute my education, and in-part my success, to being removed from a ghetto and placed into a middle class family.  Though growing older my feelings of unease gave rise to removing myself from the whole affair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how they try to evolve and stay with the pace of technology.
