This documentary is based off of Robert Lustig&amp;#39;s work on demonstrating how fructose is metabolized completely differently than glucose.  Fructose has to go through the liver and be converted to fat before most of its calories can be used by the body.  Glucose on the other hand, nearly 100% of its calories can directly used for energy from consumption.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dg9ko99", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492224967.0, "created_utc": 1492196167.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 96}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9irj7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 137, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AManNamedStanley", "parent_id": "t1_dg9hsoc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You watched a documentary about sugar, and then ate a vegetable that is metabolized as sugar.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You watched a documentary about sugar, and then ate a vegetable that is metabolized as sugar.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dg9irj7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492222679.0, "created_utc": 1492193879.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 137}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9hsoc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1027, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stebbensboy", "parent_id": "t3_65d2mu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I watched this movie a couple summers ago.
