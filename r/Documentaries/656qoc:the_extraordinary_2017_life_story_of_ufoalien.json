The stuff you're saying I'm failing to understand - have you actually even read the works that you're talking about?\n\nPhysical evidence that indicates something took place in many abduction accounts exists, like changes to the soil and radiation levels where a 'UFO' landed (a case complete with radar data and mass witness accounts), as is the case with the Rendlesham Forest incident and the soil sample analysis from the Travis Walton case. People ending up in the hospital with radiation sickness, like in the Cash Lundrum case. There are a great many cases where physical traces of one kind or another were left, and if you spent enough of your time looking into this, you'd come away hard-pressed to try and explain it with \"oh well they're all just crazy and having a shared hallucination\". These worldwide \"hallucinations\" started long before aliens and UFOs became a cultural phenomenon in the US, like the incident in Zimbabwe at the school, or the incident at Westall school, or the incident in Papua New Guinea where Australian priest Father Gill and his entire staff saw what we've come to know as a UFO/disc with occupants inside.\n\n&gt; This is far from proof or evidence of an intelligent species that apparently visits Earth on a regular basis.\n\nNo, individual cases and studying alien abductee reports don't provide proof or evidence, the evidence that indicates that is when you put all of the available data together, then alien visitation becomes the most reasonable explanation, in the expert/professional opinion of a great deal of very intelligent people. Anyway, why would you even expect physical evidence? Do we leave \"physical evidence\" behind for the chimps in the jungle to pick up and analyze when a scientific expedition shows up to 'abduct' a few of them for research? Maybe just our footprints or impressions in the ground where our helicopter touches down - the same way we see impressions from UFOs.
