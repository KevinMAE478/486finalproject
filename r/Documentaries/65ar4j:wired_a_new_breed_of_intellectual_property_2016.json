Patents are intended to incentivize people to invest in conceiving, developing, and bringing inventions to the market, while trademarks are intended to incentivize companies to build and maintain a reputation for quality and give consumers confidence in the quality of the product or service they are purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider the following: Why would a company put money into research, product development, testing, advertising, etc. if its competitors could free-ride on this investment, simply copying the product and taking advantage of the consumer awareness the company had built without incurring any of the costs involved? Though we like to think that patents and trademarks are only used by big companies to victimize individual entrepreneurs and small companies, remember cases like Robert Kearns, the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper, who had his invention copied by the big automobile manufacturers but was eventually able to assert his rights and reap the rewards for the valuable invention he had made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is also worth remembering that, particularly in fast moving areas of technology like electronics, patents are generally maintained far less than their term of 20 years, since they become essentially worthless as other inventions are made that allow companies to work around the protected invention. No one is forcing anyone to seek patent protection in the first place, so inventors that want to allow anyone to use their invention freely can just put it in the public domain (which will prevent other people from subsequently getting a patent for that same invention).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of this means that the patent system is perfect or need not be adapted to take into account changing circumstances, but it does have a lot of advantages that would be hard to replicate in alternative systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dg96x81", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492208796.0, "created_utc": 1492179996.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ar4j", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbp6lb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bear_Goes_What", "parent_id": "t3_65ar4j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This quite interesting, I wish there could be a balance to encourage innovation and protecting IP for businesses to flourish.
