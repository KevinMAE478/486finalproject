So if you're a member of this class, the question is, \"how can the existing power structures be maintained/reinforced without resorting to blatant authoritarian rule (which the public would not tolerate)?\" And the answer, as they've figured out, is that you get the public to voluntarily consent. If you can get the public on board, there's no need to be authoritarian. In fact, voluntary support is better in the long run, because the public happily does the bidding of its elites.\n\n&gt; Alright, so that's why. But what about the how? How can the elites just go and \"manufacture\" this consent? Surely the public would be too smart for that, right? Chomsky (the co-author of the book) explains:\n\n&gt;&gt;\"The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum - even encourage the more critical and dissident views.

The for-profit nature of mass media means that media outlets don't just need to worry about losing advertisers; they also have to worry about growing their advertiser support. Guess who advertisers represent? Surprise! It's the economic elite. The advertiser-driven model means that the mass media must produce a steady stream of content that draws consumers to consume lots of bite-size content rather than long-form content. More content = more advertising opportunities. This is why you don't see much serious investigative reporting anymore. It takes serious time to produce, and it brings in less money from advertisers.

You just have to say, \"A government source close to the situation says...\" and that's that. No need to follow-up and get a secondary source, and that would take extra time. Time is money.

There is also change in media types, financial models, etc. And the media has taken sides. Let\u2019s just look at bias and the media taking sides (apologies for the novel):\n\nIn the newspaper era, journalistic integrity dictated you had to present all of the facts, so bias was introduced by presenting your idea of what happened in the headline and first few paragraphs, since you knew most people only read those. But, if you actually read the entire article, you got the \"other side\" of the story.\n\nToday, bias is more noticeable, although society has tuned a lot of it out or accepted the narrative. If you want a prime example, what do you think the Russian Influence document is about? Now stop reading for a second while you get a vivid picture of that document. Then start with the next paragraph.\n\nMore than likely you think it deals primarily with hacking emails of Democratic Convention and Hillary and Russian hacking of election machines. Those topics are in the report. But do you know what the majority of the report is about? Would you believe me if I said it was about a Russian YouTube channel called RT America TV? Here is the breakdown of the content (excluding indexes, general information, etc.)\n\nHacking:\t\t\t1 page\t\t9.6%\nVoting Machine Tampering:\t.1 page\t\t.96%\nSocial Media (YouTube):\t9.3 pages\t89.42%\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? That\u2019s fine, read [it]( https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) for yourself.\n\nAs a more extreme case of bias, examine the Zimmerman case. The local media talked to a guy who was an eyewitness the day after the shooting. I haven\u2019t searched lately, but you used to be able to find the interview online. The witness describes events very similar to what George Zimmerman stated happened. Major media did not pick up the story until the NAACP got involved.\n\nFast forward a month. There is now a narrative: racist white man kills black youth. The media starts focusing on facts that fit that narrative and ignoring others. The original witness is never interviewed or mentioned. They find a media that came out after the shooting who fits their narrative. NBC news ramps it up by editing the audio tape of Zimmerman calling the police to make it sound like he is racist. They also have video tapes that show wounds on Zimmerman\u2019s head, but pause the video before the wounds are shown. Many media sources claim Zimmerman did not have any wounds on his face or the back of his head. The narrative becomes more important than the story.\n\nToday, nearly all of the news is against Trump. Certainly, he is pompous and possibly even deserving of ridicule. But the media\u2019s job is to report, not take sides \u2026 even if the person they are reporting about challenges them trying to get them to take sides. That is part of journalistic integrity.\n\n*What does this mean to America?* I had a talk with someone the other day and mentioned that some people thought Trump was the new Hitler. She responded \u201ceveryone knows that\u201d. Not, \u201cwell he is a pompous asshole\u201d or \u201che has taken some extreme postions\u201d, but an absolute conviction Trump and Hitler are interchangeable. That is extreme. And I cannot work with that type of conviction, as there is no objectivity or balance. The media supplies confirmation bias for Americans who believe Trump is a NAZI, because they have taken sides. (Conversely, those who see Trump as a Superman type of hero get confirmation bias that is true, as well, so this is not a Liberal/Conservative argument). \n\nIt is problematic many people do not examine their beliefs or challenge the news they receive. And our entertainment focused society creates a cycle that not only accepts, but encourages, a media that openly displays its bias and chooses sides. Add on that we are extremely divided (more so than any time in history) and it leads to colleges cancelling classes due to an election due to PTSD and other forms of insanity.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bias has always existed, but journalistic integrity used to matter more and our consumption habits were different.

Let\u2019s just look at bias and the media taking sides (apologies for the novel):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the newspaper era, journalistic integrity dictated you had to present all of the facts, so bias was introduced by presenting your idea of what happened in the headline and first few paragraphs, since you knew most people only read those. But, if you actually read the entire article, you got the &amp;quot;other side&amp;quot; of the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, bias is more noticeable, although society has tuned a lot of it out or accepted the narrative. If you want a prime example, what do you think the Russian Influence document is about? Now stop reading for a second while you get a vivid picture of that document. Then start with the next paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More than likely you think it deals primarily with hacking emails of Democratic Convention and Hillary and Russian hacking of election machines. Those topics are in the report. But do you know what the majority of the report is about? Would you believe me if I said it was about a Russian YouTube channel called RT America TV? Here is the breakdown of the content (excluding indexes, general information, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hacking:            1 page      9.6%\nVoting Machine Tampering:   .1 page     .96%\nSocial Media (YouTube): 9.3 pages   89.42%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t believe me? That\u2019s fine, read &lt;a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf\"&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a more extreme case of bias, examine the Zimmerman case. The local media talked to a guy who was an eyewitness the day after the shooting. I haven\u2019t searched lately, but you used to be able to find the interview online. The witness describes events very similar to what George Zimmerman stated happened. Major media did not pick up the story until the NAACP got involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a month. There is now a narrative: racist white man kills black youth. The media starts focusing on facts that fit that narrative and ignoring others. The original witness is never interviewed or mentioned. They find a media that came out after the shooting who fits their narrative. NBC news ramps it up by editing the audio tape of Zimmerman calling the police to make it sound like he is racist. They also have video tapes that show wounds on Zimmerman\u2019s head, but pause the video before the wounds are shown. Many media sources claim Zimmerman did not have any wounds on his face or the back of his head. The narrative becomes more important than the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, nearly all of the news is against Trump. Certainly, he is pompous and possibly even deserving of ridicule. But the media\u2019s job is to report, not take sides \u2026 even if the person they are reporting about challenges them trying to get them to take sides. That is part of journalistic integrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does this mean to America?&lt;/em&gt; I had a talk with someone the other day and mentioned that some people thought Trump was the new Hitler. She responded \u201ceveryone knows that\u201d. Not, \u201cwell he is a pompous asshole\u201d or \u201che has taken some extreme postions\u201d, but an absolute conviction Trump and Hitler are interchangeable. That is extreme. And I cannot work with that type of conviction, as there is no objectivity or balance. The media supplies confirmation bias for Americans who believe Trump is a NAZI, because they have taken sides. (Conversely, those who see Trump as a Superman type of hero get confirmation bias that is true, as well, so this is not a Liberal/Conservative argument). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is problematic many people do not examine their beliefs or challenge the news they receive. And our entertainment focused society creates a cycle that not only accepts, but encourages, a media that openly displays its bias and chooses sides. Add on that we are extremely divided (more so than any time in history) and it leads to colleges cancelling classes due to an election due to PTSD and other forms of insanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dg6cb4w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492051703.0, "created_utc": 1492022903.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg62cqu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg5v7k4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dg62cqu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492041472.0, "created_utc": 1492012672.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5v7k4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 85, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gbworld", "parent_id": "t3_64xcyp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "When you consider the media now takes hard bias, to the point of taking sides on issues, what you see here is kindergarten.
