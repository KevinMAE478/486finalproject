During it's entire existence the only years it had negative growth was when the Nazi's invaded and destroyed a huge chunk of it's industry and housing(the reason they always had a consumer goods deficit, they were always in catch-up mode, as opposed by the US which had barely been touched).\n\n\"As weighed growth rates, economic planning performed very well during the early and mid-1930s, World War II-era mobilization, and for the first two decades of the postwar era. The Soviet Union became the world's leading producer of oil, coal, iron ore, and cement; manganese, gold, natural gas and other minerals were also of major importance. However, information about the Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933 was suppressed by the Soviet authorities until perestroika. In 1933 workers' real earnings sank to about one-tenth of the 1926 level.[40] Common and political prisoners in labor camps were forced to do unpaid labor, and communists and Komsomol members were frequently \"mobilized\" for various construction projects.\"\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union#1930.E2.80.931970)\n\nAlso, [Soviet famine of 1932-1922](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1932%E2%80%9333).  The Soviet Union had VAST amounts of mineral wealth which along with forced labor propped up their economy for a time before the collapse.  They also plundered their satellites for anything they could.\n\nRussian propaganda is the reason that Gorbachev is so disliked in Russia today.  Much like the nonsense you're spreading here.  [This is why the Soviet Union was dissolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union).\n\n\"Previously, from August to December, all the individual republics, including Russia itself, had seceded from the union.
