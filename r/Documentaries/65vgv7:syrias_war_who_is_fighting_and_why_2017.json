Here, borrow some of our bombs!\"\n\nI'm not saying that missile strikes, air raids, troops on the ground or anything like that is the solution, but you raise another question that I've heard a lot of people ask.  Basically, there are reasons why virtually all nations have agreed that conventional bombs are okay but chemical weapons are not (this could be a conversation all on its own, so I won't get into it here).  I know it sounds ass-backwards to bomb someone as punishment for bombing people, but a moral and geopolitical threshold is crossed once chemical weapons are used.\n\n&gt;Supposedly there's evidence Assad did it, but they won't show the evidence to congress or US allies.\n\nCan't vouch for what has or hasn't been shown to Congress or our allies, but here's the evidence that I've heard:\n1) The Syrian government was previously known to have a large stockpile of sarin, the chemical used in the attack on Khan Sheikoun.  Yes, they said they'd get rid of it after the US threatened intervention in 2013, but they appear to have lied.\n2) Sarin isn't like the mustard gas that ISIS uses (and I have heard some reports of rebels using chemical weapons, but they appear to do it less frequently, and they never use sarin).  It's a much more complicated substance, not the kind of thing that you can make in your kitchen.\n3) The Syrian government's version of events goes something like \"yeah there was a rebel-held depot of chemical weapons, it got bombed and that's how the sarin gas got out\".  Except that's not how sarin works.  It's a binary chemical weapon, meaning that it's made of two components that are kept separate for safety reasons, and then mixed together moments before use (usually while a chemical bomb is in mid-air).  If there had been rebel-held chemicals in a storage facility and it got bombed, there would have MAYBE been a wisp of sarin; the rest would have been destroyed.\n4) The NSA appears to have intercepted communications between the Syrian government and the Syrian military where they discuss preparations for using chemical weapons.\n\nI can get you sources for those points if you'd like, I'm just kinda typing out loud.  There's an enormous amount of evidence that this was the work of the Assad regime, quite possibly with the Russian government condoning or even assisting Assad.\n\n&gt;Congress is supposed to declare war, not the president.\n\nAmen, although Congress has completely abdicated their responsibility to make that decision.  I'd love for them to take back that power, but after decades of letting the president bomb whoever he wants, I don't see it happening.\n\n&gt;They're not the only ones with those weapons. We know ISIS and the rebels have control of some too.\n\nTrue, there are certainly no innocent parties here.  But the specific weapon we're talking about is sarin gas (which has been confirmed by multiple sources), not just mustard or chlorine gas like ISIS uses.  Of the three parties who could have perpetrated this attack, only the Assad regime has access to sarin and the greatest capacity to successfully use it, only the Assad regime has been proven to have used sarin in the past, and only the Assad regime has been caught discussing the use of chemical weapons just prior to the attack on Khan Sheikoun.  The Russian and Syrian governments have their version of events, but the facts don't add up and frankly, the Russian and Syrian governments are fucking terrible, brutal, rights-abusing liars (yes, the US government isn't perfect, but we're better than Putin and Assad).\n\n&gt;We train their rebels, then we fight who we trained, while training some more.\n\nI used to be in the Ron Paul 'just get the fuck outta there' camp, but I'm not so sure anymore.  We move into the Middle East under Bush, things go horribly wrong.  We pull out of the Middle East (somewhat) under Obama, things go horribly wrong.  I don't expect things to get better under Trump, but if I was in charge I honestly don't know what I'd do.\n\n&gt;Looking forward, if we're going to be there for 30+ years, maybe we should build them some schools. They need those if they're ever going to be the type of people who we we're able to get along with.\n\nEh, maybe.  I can see where you're coming from...'you break it, you buy it'.  But for one, I'd like to see our overall involvement in the Middle East scaled down, and that has to start sometime.  More importantly, the Middle East has been fucked up for a very, very long time.  It would be wrong to say the US didn't make things worse, but you can't place all the blame on us, either.  With hardcore Islamists and jihadists, repressive government virtually everywhere in the Middle East, widespread poverty, and war or the threat of war being the norm for decades now, people in the Middle East need more than new schools and hospitals.  The way I see it, the Middle East is undergoing the same thing that Central Europe saw in the Thirty Year's War: religious and political disputes finally coming to a boil and resulting in massive bloodshed.

With hardcore Islamists and jihadists, repressive government virtually everywhere in the Middle East, widespread poverty, and war or the threat of war being the norm for decades now, people in the Middle East need more than new schools and hospitals.  The way I see it, the Middle East is undergoing the same thing that Central Europe saw in the Thirty Year&amp;#39;s War: religious and political disputes finally coming to a boil and resulting in massive bloodshed.  Call me a fatalist, but I think the Middle East is just going to have to wait until enough death and destruction has happened until things get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Depressing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dgdqc9m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476172.0, "created_utc": 1492447372.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdn4rg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "OutOfStamina", "parent_id": "t1_dgdmla3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; and this answer may seem like a cop-out\n\nNot to be rude, but I mean, it kinda does sound like a cop-out.
