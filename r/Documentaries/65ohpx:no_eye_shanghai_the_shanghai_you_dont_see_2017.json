Your job is to recruit crusaders. Our job is to sit here doing nothing, definitely not joining some pitchfork crusade, well at least not before somebody mentions payment.\n\nWhat the fuck? I'm not trying to recruit crusaders. To be honest, I personally hope they DO tear my in-laws house down (although I'm not sharing that fact with them). Their house sucks, and even if the compensation isn't totally fair (they'd get less square footage), they'd be set up with a much more modern apartment. I could take a shower in the bathroom (because there would *be* a bathroom) instead of having to walk 10 blocks away to a public shower in -20 degree winter weather when we visit for spring festival. And it would be a much safer and more comfortable environment for my daughter when we visit. My in-laws don't see things that way of course, and I do understand where they're coming from in the sense that they'll be losing significant square footage, but personally I think even though in value terms they're getting lowballed (especially at first, it's a bit better now) it would probably result in a net quality of life increase.\n\nSo yeah, please don't assume you know my motives, or assume that because my in-laws are involved in one such dispute, that I have a vested interest in forcing the same view of ALL similar disputes (including the one in this video, which is hundreds and hundreds of miles away and involves *zero* of the same parties as my in-laws' situation). EVen if my in-laws WERE getting totally fucked and I wanted to start a crusade, what the hell does the local government and developer in their area have to do with this video about a completely different government in Shanghai?

Your job is to recruit crusaders. Our job is to sit here doing nothing, definitely not joining some pitchfork crusade, well at least not before somebody mentions payment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the fuck? I&amp;#39;m not trying to recruit crusaders. To be honest, I personally hope they DO tear my in-laws house down (although I&amp;#39;m not sharing that fact with them). Their house sucks, and even if the compensation isn&amp;#39;t totally fair (they&amp;#39;d get less square footage), they&amp;#39;d be set up with a much more modern apartment. I could take a shower in the bathroom (because there would &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a bathroom) instead of having to walk 10 blocks away to a public shower in -20 degree winter weather when we visit for spring festival. And it would be a much safer and more comfortable environment for my daughter when we visit. My in-laws don&amp;#39;t see things that way of course, and I do understand where they&amp;#39;re coming from in the sense that they&amp;#39;ll be losing significant square footage, but personally I think even though in value terms they&amp;#39;re getting lowballed (especially at first, it&amp;#39;s a bit better now) it would probably result in a net quality of life increase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, please don&amp;#39;t assume you know my motives, or assume that because my in-laws are involved in one such dispute, that I have a vested interest in forcing the same view of ALL similar disputes (including the one in this video, which is hundreds and hundreds of miles away and involves &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; of the same parties as my in-laws&amp;#39; situation). EVen if my in-laws WERE getting totally fucked and I wanted to start a crusade, what the hell does the local government and developer in their area have to do with this video about a completely different government in Shanghai? It&amp;#39;d be like me trying to get people to protest the Chicago police because I was mistreated by cops in Boston...makes zero sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dgc7d0e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492387986.0, "created_utc": 1492359186.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc5n7v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pundemonium", "parent_id": "t1_dgc4mce", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In this case (OP's video) I see clear evidence of the journalist manipulating translation to get what they want to say, but want some Asian face to \"say\" it.\n\nThe old man in the video said \u62c6(chai), which means tear-down; they translated it into \"destroy\".

Some residents have alleged that municipal demolition and eviction management departments have embezzled compensations funds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A banker alleged that the developer put 8 million yuan into a demolition and eviction compensation fund managed by the municipal department. According to this allegation, the management office unilaterally lowered the amount of compensation paid to residents, and kept the remaining 960,000 yuan (about U.S.$116,000) for the departments\u2019 own use, later investing this money in a commercial real estate project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the regulations, Chinese experts also report that the amount of compensation may in some instances be &lt;strong&gt;unilaterally decided by the developers or the demolition companies. It may be set far below market value, with little or no account taken for loss of income in the case of properties used for family businesses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dgc3ijp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492382563.0, "created_utc": 1492353763.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ohpx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc9cin", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dulceburro", "parent_id": "t1_dgc2s3v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah obv the govt doesnt want 1,000s of people to be homeless.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah obv the govt doesnt want 1,000s of people to be homeless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dgc9cin", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492390592.0, "created_utc": 1492361792.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc2s3v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 133, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ugwu123", "parent_id": "t1_dgc1kgr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have family in Shanghai and they've been compensated enough for moving out.\n\nYou get paid a fair amount in cash (at or more than how much the property is worth usually) and the government might give you another apartment.", "edited": 1492352849.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have family in Shanghai and they&amp;#39;ve been compensated enough for moving out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get paid a fair amount in cash (at or more than how much the property is worth usually) and the government might give you another apartment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dgc2s3v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492381424.0, "created_utc": 1492352624.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 133}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ohpx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ohpx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd0ytl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hellokitty42", "parent_id": "t1_dgc6r80", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This has been a thing since the compensation policy existed.
