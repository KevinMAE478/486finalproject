The case could be made that you knowingly endangered and ended innocent lives with torture &amp;quot;for the greater good...&amp;quot; which, of course, often seems to be the form that evil takes, does it not?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dgdpbyn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475053.0, "created_utc": 1492446253.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdoh6r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CrackingYs", "parent_id": "t1_dgdhcyu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How is that any different than capital pinishment is the today?\n\nIf the deterrent is effective enough such crimes would (hopefully) rarely occur in the first place and probably be easier to find the correct person.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is that any different than capital pinishment is the today?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the deterrent is effective enough such crimes would (hopefully) rarely occur in the first place and probably be easier to find the correct person.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dgdoh6r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492474089.0, "created_utc": 1492445289.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdhcyu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kellyanne_Conman", "parent_id": "t1_dgdfzwr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "what would you do if you found out years later you got the wrong guy?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;what would you do if you found out years later you got the wrong guy?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dgdhcyu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492464961.0, "created_utc": 1492436161.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ts0n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdhtar", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JimmyTheSeal", "parent_id": "t1_dgdfzwr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What about people who suffer from a mental illness which has an effect on thier reasoning, or schizophrenic people who are pushed to kill by voices?
