The video misses some key points and IMO misrepresents the situation:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video fails to mention that it&amp;#39;s not the brands themselves that are pulling ad spend, it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;ad agencies&lt;/strong&gt;. Agencies aren&amp;#39;t the most trusted companies in the world. Agencies are using this as an opportunity to prove to their clients that they&amp;#39;re spending their ad budgets wisely and only buying ads in the most brand safe environments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point in the video it says if buyers wanted more controls over brand-safety they could just demand it. That&amp;#39;s not true. The video doesn&amp;#39;t mention that Google would lose money by removing ads from non brand safe content. Buyers have wanted more brand safety measures and transparency with the marketplace for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youtube does have a fake news problem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the video it says corporations and governments are trying to control information. There is no government entity involved in this and this has nothing to do with government censorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google basically has a monopoly on internet advertising. Pulling some ads from Youtube is still a pretty small hit for them. Buyers in the industry are using this to put leverage on Google and show that they still have power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is most likely very temporary. Everybody will puff up their chests and talk about brand safety, then Google will come out with some new brand safety features in a few months and everything will pretty much go back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Documentaries", "name": "t1_dgaxk75", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492307259.0, "created_utc": 1492278459.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlh", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65iza8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgatk82", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "i_am_with_the_NSA", "parent_id": "t3_65iza8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Documentaries", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think these companies are using it as an excuse to get lower ad rates on youtube.
