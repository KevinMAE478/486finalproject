Early ganks will be easier than late ganks. Amumu+Kayle is weaker than Shen+Lee early.  \nConclusion: toplane might be worth ganking early.\n\nMid: Ahri has a summoner advantage, a stronger first two levels and will push. Fizz will be hard to gank as long as he has his E and damage ganks will not be as efficient due to TP. Ahri is should be safe from Amumu ganks.  \nConclusion: midlane is a low priority match and a low priority gank lane. However, if Ahri shoves, invades are possible.\n\nBotlane: Ezreal and Soraka will prolly shove early, Alistar + Kalista will be dangerous from level 3 on and have strong synergy with ganks.  \nConclusion: low gank priority, high match priority.\n\nPossible paths:\n\n- red, blue, Gromp, blasting cone, top gank\n- red, invade enemy topside, can also have different twists, but you are mainly looking to catch Amumu in her topside jungle and pressure or even kill.\n- start topside, farm and secure botside scuttle + stay near to counter enemy level 3 powerspike\n\nAll of this can already be planned in champselect/loading screen.

You need to adapt to the situation. For example, earlier today I was playing Shaco jungle in a normal. I started bot side at red buff, went to take wolves then blue. However the enemy jungle riven was sitting in the small bush next to blue ready to kill me. My q was on cooldown, and his aoe destroyed the box I tried to put down, so I had nothing. He had out smarted me. Later in the game, my team told me he was diamond. The problem was that my route was predictable, and he was a step ahead of me. Guess I need to be more careful next time! \n\nHowever, later in the game, I saw on a ward that he was invading my top side jungle once more and thought \"I can use that\". So I just went straight to the infernal drake and soloed it. For that instance, I had outsmarted the diamond player, since an infernal drake is worth far more than Gromp and Wolves!\n\n&gt; Like if I play Graves against Gragas I know that Graves win\n\nI've just played the matchup. Game finished 5 minutes ago. Graves can bully Gragas off of camps, but Gragas can survive just fine and lose a bit of farm. Meanwhile Gragas ganks harder and is more useful in team fights. So it's not all one-sided.\n\nTo get a rough idea of how matchups play out, look at stats on [champion.gg](http://champion.gg/). Champs with high win percentages in a matchup tend to have some sort of advantage, but it isn't always obvious. For example, the advantage may be level dependent or reflect usefulness rather than dueling potential. For example, Skarner will outduel almost anything in a 1v1 fight, but he will still get destroyed by a good Ivern because Ivern never has to fight him 1v1, and can be far more useful in team fights.\n\nThe only ways to learn matchups in detail are either to play more, or to watch high level streams.\n\n&gt; When shous I invade? \n\nWhen you either (a) know where the enemy jungler is - e.g. if he is ganking bot then you can take his top jungle for free, or (b) you both beat him in a 1v1, and your nearby lanes have priority (i.e. they are pushed up and can come to your support faster than the enemy).\n\nThere are a few exceptions. A few champions can invade more often either because they have good escapes (e.g. Shaco), or they can take camps very quickly (e.g. Ivern).\n\n&gt; How to lane gank?\n\nYou're right that it involves walking through lane into the side bushes. There are basically 2 types of lane gank. The first is when you think the enemy will push up past your bush, and you simply wait for him to push and then engage on him 2v1 like a regular gank (if he tries to trade before you go in then all the better). This allows you to avoid wards in the river, but has some risk at low ELO, because laners might not understand what you want to do.\n\nThe other is the counter gank, where you expect the enemy jungler will come to a lane and you lie in wait to surprise him. Wait until the enemy has committed their gap closers for the gank and then go in. This works best when your laner is tanky enough to not get bursted in the initial enemy engage, and you believe you win the 2v2 duel.\n\n \n\n", "edited": 1492362726.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what I mainly want to know is how do I know which jungle path should I pick? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is  no single path. You need to adapt to the situation. For example, earlier today I was playing Shaco jungle in a normal. I started bot side at red buff, went to take wolves then blue. However the enemy jungle riven was sitting in the small bush next to blue ready to kill me. My q was on cooldown, and his aoe destroyed the box I tried to put down, so I had nothing. He had out smarted me. Later in the game, my team told me he was diamond. The problem was that my route was predictable, and he was a step ahead of me. Guess I need to be more careful next time! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, later in the game, I saw on a ward that he was invading my top side jungle once more and thought &amp;quot;I can use that&amp;quot;.
