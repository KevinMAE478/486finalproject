I was spamming Braum as the season started (even though range has been meta since way before that), but as I climbed and people actually now punish the pick, it got to the point where I won something like 2 from 14 (having previously been at 65%+ W/R) and I realised that it simply wasn&amp;#39;t feasible any more. Even when I am now begged to play a tank, I won&amp;#39;t...not out of spite, but because I can still win the game playing Zyra/Karma (can&amp;#39;t stand Lulu), but it&amp;#39;s basically an auto loss if I play Braum and my other lanes aren&amp;#39;t popping off.

On the other side, because of that Fiora and Renekton became very good picks just because how well do they deal with tanks. Fiora especially, as the most popular tanks (Maokai, Nautilus) do not work that well into her compared to other tanks. With already announced second nerfs to armor penetration, changes to black cleaver and upcoming tank items/buffs you can expect the meta to be shifted to tanks very easily. Then we will most likely see only tank junglers with exception of Elise and perhaps Kindred if she gets some buffs just because how well they deal with tanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dg6l693", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061036.0, "created_utc": 1492032236.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x02f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6n92t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "clos1248", "parent_id": "t3_64x02f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I main top and jg.
