Don&amp;#39;t play league untill your mental state become stable. Srsly, just make a long break. You don&amp;#39;t need to completely quit league, but you really need to stop playing for now.\n2. Talk to a doctor (if you can afford it), talk to your family.\nIt&amp;#39;s obvious and been said already, but this is really good advices, just follow them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most important thing (from my point of view) you need to understand is: your depression is a problem. Not you, not your entire life, not how good you are at anything and ofc not your league of legends skill. It&amp;#39;s your depression, the only thing you really need to focus on now.
