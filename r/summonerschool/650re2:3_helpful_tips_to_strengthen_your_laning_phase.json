I hope, and believe, that a great lot of Support players(as well as AD Carries) find these tips useful, and will actually start applying them into their own games - as they require little effort to apply, as long as you are aware of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;1 - Starving the enemy bot lane on wards&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being able to starve the enemy bot lane as far as wards goes, is extremely important throughout the entirety of the laning phase, although &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; during the early stages. Vision control has always played a huge factor in the bot lane as far as zoning goes, although it appears a lot of people do not know how to wrestle vision control efficiently. The idea is very simple - you&amp;#39;d like to starve the enemy lane on wards, leaving one or multiple routes into your lane unwarded for the majority of the laning phase. What a lot of people seem to not realize, is how incredibly important the two lane brushes are in doing so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A great lot of Support players spread across all brackets of the ladder, have realized the importance of the level 2 spike in most laning phases, thus try to reach level 2 prior to their opponent. What they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do efficiently however, is making use of the fact that lack of vision often creates a huge amount of pressure on the enemy bot lane. This means, using the lack of vision the enemies have in the lane brushes to your advantage, is &lt;em&gt;absolutely crucial&lt;/em&gt; if you&amp;#39;re looking to set your lane up for success as far as jungle pressure goes. While rushing level 2 is important - I find it almost equally important to force the enemy bot lane into placing wards in lane brushes to avoid the potential threat you present from outside of vision. So, instead of standing about in the middle of the lane trying to put pressure on the enemy bot lane through dishing out some damage through spells or AAs - &lt;strong&gt;stand in the brushes instead&lt;/strong&gt;. You present such a huge threat even with doing anything in particular, you practically force the enemy bot lane to spend wards on warding a brush that isn&amp;#39;t a threat to them as far as jungler pressure goes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;2 - Eliminate the blast cone just across the wall from the river brush on cooldown&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is probably the simplest tip so far, and requires an incredibly low amount of effort on your end. The blasting cone is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; reason to why bot lanes who are seemingly ahead, suddenly turn out to lose first tower after being double killed and not realizing what even happend to them. While the blast cone could be used by both junglers, and always favours one jungler slightly more than the other, it is definitely &lt;em&gt;not worth&lt;/em&gt; leaving it up for either sides, unless you are constantly being shoved under your own tower and your jungler is looking to get a jump on them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is how unpredictable and uncoordinated your jungler&amp;#39;s movements might be, and how two vastly different playstyles might not compliment eachother very well. Besides, if you are already starving the enemy off of wards - there is no need for your own jungler to take the blast cone in the first place as there should be at least one unwarded ganking opportunity. &lt;strong&gt;Do not put yourself at unecessary risk&lt;/strong&gt;, destroy the blasting cone on cooldown. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;3 - Communicate warding patterns, wards and ganking opportunities to your jungler&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Waaaay too often do I see people complaining about a low amount of jungle pressure, and they often blame it purely on the jungler himself. What the same people fail to realize, is that they aren&amp;#39;t doing their very best to communicate opportunities to their own jungler, helping him make judgement calls on how to execute his role. Simply pinging for assistance just &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; good enough, and will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be good enough. There are a few things you should do &lt;em&gt;every single game&lt;/em&gt;, without exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, you should keep an eye out for patterns in the enemy bot lane&amp;#39;s warding, and communicating them towards your jungler. Are they constantly buying control wards? Tell your jungler. Are they always warding in a specific area? *Tell your jungler. *&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt; the wards placed - even trinket wards. Early on in the lane, time the exact timer on when a ward expires, and let your jungler know the exact time of experiation, as well as the spot. If the enemy Support wards the tribush, simply check the duration of your own trinket ward, quickly do the math and tell your jungler the time stamp and location of the ward. This means your jungler could plan a gank when the enemies are as vulnerable as they would ever be, which is in the valuable seconds after a ward expires, before the enemy laners realize it&amp;#39;s gone and they&amp;#39;re no longer protected by their vision. It is truly amazing how &amp;quot;04.13 ward tribush&amp;quot; could sway your lane, and it takes you few seconds of effort to put down into the team chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, communicate summoner casts, and their cooldowns. It appears to me that a lot of people are actually pretty good at pinging enemy summoner cooldowns, but they aren&amp;#39;t good at timing them. While pinging the cooldowns is great, it is actually not sufficient. It is not always easy for a jungler to keep track of when every cooldown is back up on the enemy team, thus timing it in chat makes things a lot easier for your jungler. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;#39;s not a lot, I hope this helped at least someone to some extend. If you aren&amp;#39;t doing whatever is in your power to influence every aspect of the game in a positive way, you are doing something incorrectly. Even the smallest thing could affect your game, thus caring about even the tiny details is important in order to steadily climb. It is doubtful that one of these tips on their own is going to completely change the outcome of your ranked games - but put them together and they&amp;#39;re suddenly a huge part of your playstyle - and will definitely assist you in your climb towards success. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi,\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSince its been a good while since the last time I did a text-based guide that did not resolve around my role as a moderator of the subreddit, I figured it was time to make another submission as a player, and not as a moderator.

If you have kill pressure and you've denied vision and the wave is pushing can set up a disgusting zone without ever having to even fight them. \n\nAlso, you increase outplay potential in case of a gank.

Instead of warding river bush, ward in front of dragon pit and tri bush if your red side and then ask your mid laner to ward in the pixel brush in river. This is great warding with minimal risk. This counters blue side from going into dragon pit, coming from tri bush or walking to the blasting cone red side. \n\nIf your blue side some good wards would be river pixel bush next to mid, and one on the tip of the ramp leading into dragon pit. These two wards can give a huge heads up to incoming ganks and roams while leaving the blasting cone up for your team to use as an escape after a dive or for pulling off a gank.\n\nOne jungle route I like to take when I'm red side hecarim is go behind blue buff into river and behind dragon pit and take blasting cone to krugs and come behind them. This avoids any shallow warding around the lane and sets up a great gank with Hecarim E. A good way to counter this is a ward behind red buff or in river pixel bush. But usually they won't expect the gank path even if they see you in river. Best to do this play if mid is shoved in and you know the jungle is top side. It's also really good for cutting off the minion wave to their tower and setting up a minion crash dive.\n\n3. This is really great advice. Just remember even if they have wards doesn't mean you can't gank. There are tons of ways to counter wards with control wards and sweepers to still pull off a gank. Just remember that if the enemy laners have been playing like pussies all game and then decide to go ham its probably a gank. \n\nAny more questions and I'd love to answer.
