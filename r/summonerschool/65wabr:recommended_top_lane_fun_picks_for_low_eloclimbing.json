A lot of people have taken issue with my past posts because of how I recommend Champions. I&amp;#39;ve sort of boiled it down to people 1) don&amp;#39;t like getting told their favorite goofball/meme/champion is counter-productive to gaining wins. 2) people sometimes find my picks boring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with that said, I wanted to take a chance to lay out some top laners that are great for low elo climbing that I think are also extremely fun. If you&amp;#39;re one of those people who gets a screw loose when someone says, &amp;quot;just spam annie/swain&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;ll love this post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Top Lane Fampions (fun + champions pun?):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Darius&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Garen&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jax&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pantheon&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darius&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun factor:&lt;/em&gt; brutal and strong from lvl 1-18&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why good:&lt;/em&gt; Passive effects. it&amp;#39;s really not the ult, although it&amp;#39;s icing on the cake. His Q has a heal, his W is an auto reset, and his E has free armor shred. His actual passive gives a massive kill pressure, similar to ignite. His passive deals a physical bleed damage based on your bonus AD, that stacks with each physical damage dealt. At 5 stacks, you gain a massive amount of AD and apply your passive bleed fully stacked with 1 auto. The reason this is even better, is that because they are all passive it can be hard to assess his actual power level until it&amp;#39;s too late. I.e. he only has phage, and I have armor I&amp;#39;m fine (armor shred on his E); He&amp;#39;s lower health than me I can fight him (heal on Q); I&amp;#39;m winning this trade I can stand ground and fight (passive stacks up to bonus AD + Bleed).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;biggest weakness:&lt;/em&gt; Slow &amp;amp; immobile. Requires BC+Deadmans and or summoners for big pressure in team fights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;summoner spells:&lt;/em&gt; Flash+Ghost / Flash+teleport / ignite+ flash / ghost +ignite. I recommend Flash + ghost or Flash + teleport. The choice here is mobility vs. team utility. Flash ignite or ghost ignite, IMO, takes away survivability and mobility for little gained in kill pressure since you have bleed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note on keystones:&lt;/em&gt; You can take fervor, grasp of the undying, or storm raiders surge. Grasp is safest, fervor is for veterans, and storm raiders are for people who try and cheese 1st blood. See what works, see what pros use. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laning:&lt;/em&gt; In melee matchups you generally want to be mindful to not push. Keeping the wave in the center of lane, or slightly pushing towards you is best. Darius is not good at running people down. You want them to get impatient, overconfident, or overextended and then punish them for doing so. Use zoning + head games to freak your opponent out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;combos: (mostly variations on same principle)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AA + W (AA reset) + AA + E + Q + disengage/AA/R&lt;br/&gt;\nAA + E + AA + W (reset) + Q + R&lt;br/&gt;\nE + AA + W + Q + AA + R&lt;br/&gt;\nFlash + E + AA + W + Q + AA + R&lt;br/&gt;\nWalk up to wave + enemy + Q + disengage into bush\nQ + Flash + AA + W + E + AA + R&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Teamfight combo:&lt;/em&gt; Apply 5 stacks/R (kill) + Q + Flash (into grouped enemy team) + AA+W+E+R OR W+R OR R&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad combos:&lt;/em&gt;\nAnything Leading with Q aside from above&lt;br/&gt;\nQ + E + W&lt;br/&gt;\nW + AA + E&lt;br/&gt;\nE + Q + W + AA + AA + R&lt;br/&gt;\nW + E + Q + AA + AA + R&lt;br/&gt;\nAnything that involves using R with under 4/5 stacks.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why? These are bad b/c they blow what makes you threatening up front (fear of getting pulled or clipped with Q). If you do these combos and miss it&amp;#39;s very easy to turn around and kill darius. Further, you want to use Q at the end of trades when possible as it allows you to heal with lower health, and makes it so that as you kite away, you heal back any damage taken during the trade. Ending trades with Q + zoning + heal. Also, AA and W AA resets are pretty much the difference between good darius and shit darius. &lt;strong&gt;AA are essential&lt;/strong&gt; for getting max damage + max R damage off before they run away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garen&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;fun factor:&lt;/em&gt; big juggernaut with stupid damage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why good:&lt;/em&gt; armor shred + silence + mobility (in skirmishes) + execute ult + passive regen&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;biggest weakness:&lt;/em&gt; no peeling in TF + immobile for engages&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;summoner spells:&lt;/em&gt; Flash + Tele / Flash + ignite&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note on keystones:&lt;/em&gt; check pro/champ.gg&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laning:&lt;/em&gt; Garen is a lane bully who does best when he can shove in weaker wave clear champions or by very aggressively zoning.

You sort of wait for them to underestimate your AA damage + passive damage + 5 stack AD spike. Usually it'll be very clear they are thinking they massively fucked up and try to bail. You just use ghost to stick on them so you apply more bleed. Pretty much Darius wins almost any-fight as long as he can force the person to keep fighting him. The longer you fight, the more likely you will win/kill the other guy. \n\nGhost also functions similar to how stormraiders works on Darius.
