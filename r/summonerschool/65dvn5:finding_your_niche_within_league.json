There was a recent post about ex-Origen coach talking about how to get out of ___tier or something of the sort. Please read the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before deciding how to &amp;quot;carry&amp;quot;, you need to realize why do you play League. Are you playing because you don&amp;#39;t give a shit and it&amp;#39;s a game? Are you playing because you want to excel at something in life? Do you want to be LCS material? You really don&amp;#39;t care about the game but you want to get out of Bronze?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What ever your reason is, if you are going to try and put in the effort then this will help you. You know if you are going to give an &amp;quot;half-assed&amp;quot; try. This message is not for you, this is for people who will at least try and put in the effort  and time to climb. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, out of the words of Jatt, &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s get into it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You need to first find out what kind of lane you would like to play&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you like supporting your team and gaining the knowledge and vision for your team to excel? do you want to make the flashy plays and out shine your opponent? you want to be the main damage dealer with a bullseye target on your back? Find out what lane you want to play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find what style you want to play&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I mean by that is, different lanes have different &amp;quot;styles&amp;quot;. Take top for example, you have your Split Pushers, Bruisers, Duelists, Tanks, etc. Each one of these styles have a different feel and gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After finding your style you need to find champs that fit your personal &amp;quot;flair&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your &amp;quot;flair&amp;quot; is how you fit into your style&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, You like split pushers, you like the pure damage of Trynd, but you don&amp;#39;t like his team fighting ability, you don&amp;#39;t like how he can&amp;#39;t kite. You like Gnar&amp;#39;s kite but you don&amp;#39;t like his Rage Bar... Find how YOU are going to fit in the Split Pushing Role. Once you find your champs to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrow your selection of champs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to specialize your &amp;quot;flair&amp;quot; and experience. Narrow it down to 1 maybe two champs. I say 1 because you get to &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; the ins and outs of the champ. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is plain simple, the more experience you have with the champ the more you can &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; how much damage a Crit will do with Trynd. Or know how long Ekko&amp;#39;s stun will be on certain champs. This comes with grinding games with your &amp;quot;flair&amp;quot; champ. Once you know the ins and outs of the champ. You know many if not the majority of matchups against your champ. For example, with myself, I played Fizz in ALL roles, yes I have trolled before. Not in ranked (Except for Support Fizz) but in norms. I wanted to find how all champs can kite, evade, dodge, damage fizz and his abilities. I am pretty damn sure I have played against all champs with Fizz (except for Rakan and the other new bitch). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adaption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have that experience you can utilize your champ appropriately. You have played so much on your champ that looking for opportunities to snowball the game. You know the power spikes of the champ and know the limits of the champ. You notice you got a hyper carry assassin bot lane. You are a naut with TP, well time to make a play bot lane. Or push in and roam mid for a gank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#39;t flame your team because a strategy didn&amp;#39;t work for this game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember there are multiple combinations League can have with team comps and their matchups. Just play and have fun. Mute who ever is toxic and play your game with your &amp;quot;flair&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Find your Role. Find your Style. Find your Champ. Find your Flair. Grind games. Adapt. Don&amp;#39;t Flame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good Luck out there on the Rift!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or wanna add me NA Server IGN = XxIronJxX&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I have heard many posts about \"how do I carry games?\" or \"is it even possible to carry bronze?\" \"How do I carry as an ADC or support, etc.\"\n\nSo my friends out on the rift let me explain some things.
