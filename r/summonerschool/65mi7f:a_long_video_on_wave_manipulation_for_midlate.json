An issue I see in a lot of games, even high elo ones, is that people only set up waves to push 30 seconds to 1 minute in advance. I recorded a video about how to set up waves so that in 1-2.5 minutes, the wave will crash into their turret, drawing the enemy away from whatever objective you&amp;#39;re going for on the opposite side of the map. This is usually for top laners who don&amp;#39;t split-push well, or when they don&amp;#39;t have TP. By setting up the wave so that a huge wave crashes into their turret, you force the enemy to make a lose-lose decision, to clear the minions and risk a 5v4 engage, or to take a ton of turret damage and possibly lose the turret. There&amp;#39;s a lot of rambling in the video and waiting for minion waves to set up, so if you&amp;#39;re here for just basic information without all the details, skip to the end.

If your laner has mobility while their laner is pinned in a certain place, you automatically gain an advantage. Another thing is, if your laners understand this concept, early/mid game you can set up a minion crash dive, and cause them to not only die but lose a ton of farm. What I covered in the video isn't very relevant for early game, but a similar principle can be applied to stacking a wave to build a large push, and subsequently roaming. This concept of prepping a wave 2 minutes or so in advance is mostly designed for sieges late game on a certain tower/objective, as even the art of war will say to divide your enemy by attacking from all sides. A recent example is in OCE when a rumble set up a wave bottom lane that was left unattended and pushed down 3 turrets by itself in the following 3-4 minutes.\n\nIf there is enough interest in these types of videos I'll try to make some more :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For solo queue, wave manipulation is, while not the most typical way of carrying a game, an easy way to do so if you know how to do it while your opponent isn&amp;#39;t.

Another thing is, if your laners understand this concept, early/mid game you can set up a minion crash dive, and cause them to not only die but lose a ton of farm. What I covered in the video isn&amp;#39;t very relevant for early game, but a similar principle can be applied to stacking a wave to build a large push, and subsequently roaming. This concept of prepping a wave 2 minutes or so in advance is mostly designed for sieges late game on a certain tower/objective, as even the art of war will say to divide your enemy by attacking from all sides. A recent example is in OCE when a rumble set up a wave bottom lane that was left unattended and pushed down 3 turrets by itself in the following 3-4 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there is enough interest in these types of videos I&amp;#39;ll try to make some more :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dgbmrvr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492342860.0, "created_utc": 1492314060.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgblt8k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Smagmorks", "parent_id": "t3_65mi7f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "2 questions if u don't mind :)\n\nFor climbing in soloq, how important do u value \nwave manipulations? \n\nWhat advantages can you get off of a good roam from your top or mid laner specifically in terms of vision and invades if your the jungler?

When timed well, example, an adc setting a slowpush bot before grouping with his team to pressure baron or towers at top/mid, can force the enemy team to send a champ bot, and then it's a 4v5 situation, which means any fight will often be a win for that adc's team. In low elo if you understand wave management, the enemy wont, and it will often result in hilariously winning game after game to an enemy or even two wandering off to deal with your slowpush wave and you just taking easy objectives and fights.\n\nAlmost every team comp in the game benefits from a slowpush too. Pick comps for example, with good vision can force fights if someone goes to deal with the slowpush wave, they can also take out the single player who goes to deal with the slowpush and then go along with the wave to take that tower mostly uncontested due to the numbers advantage.\n\nMinion management and closing out games are closely related and imo this is why games from bronze - diamond last longer than they should. When you are the team with the lead, you can often win fights, but fighting without being able to take objectives from winning the fight is often what leads to throws. For example, if the minions are pushing towards you in sidelanes and you just normally clear it, it will often actually end up slow pushing towards you and if you win the fight you can't do much as you have to base to clear out the wave. It also means you often end up just grouping mid after winning a fight and trying to get mid inhib. If you slowpush sidelanes before going to teamfight, then after winning that teamfight instead of only getting one inhibitor you can get three. If you win a teamfight after setting up slowpushes and take baron you pretty much win the game on the spot because even if you throw the enemy just cannot punish you for it.\n\nThe losing team can also use slowpushes to win. When behind having a slowpush is the safest way to stall if the enemy cant end straight away, because they either have to send someone to clear it or risk losing a tower. A tower dying is 1k+ gold for your team, and that can bridge the gap between you and the enemy team. It also means if you throw and die they can't do much other than take mid inhib, which is the worst inhib to take as it doesn't give baron or dragon pressure like the side lanes do. \n\n#Advanced method\n\n*    Whilst losing I would actually kill 3 melees and 1 ranged, and whilst winning I may choose to kill only 2 rangeds. This is because the team with a tower lead in that lane, has minions that have better stat, and the number of minions you kill directly affects how large the wave will be when it gets to the enemy tower, and how long it takes to get there.\n\n*    The wave with 3 melees or a Cannon lead will generally push one zone, predicting the rate at which a slowpush moves zones decides how much pressure you make. Setting up a slowpush on the cannon wave means it will clear zones faster than a slowpush set up on a non cannon wave, setting slowpushes on non cannon waves will often lead to them bouncing back towards you after clearing 3-5 zones, depending on how close it is to the enemy nexus due to the reinforcement time between waves. It takes about 34 seconds for minions to go from nexus to centre of a lane, so the closer a minion wave is to its nexus, the sooner it gets reinforcements, and so the closer a slowpush is to the enemy nexus the bigger it needs to be to sustain itself. \n\n*    To calculate how long a slowpush takes to crash enemy tower, is the number of zones between that wave and the tower, multiplied by the time between a minion wave spawning ~ currently 30 seconds. Add an extra 15 seconds to every (3n + 1) wave. So for example setting up a slowpush on a cannon wave, clearing the enemy cannon, that has to travel four zones to get to the enemy tower, will take roughly 2minutes 15 seconds to get to the enemy turret.\n\n#A basic guide to countering a slowpush\n\nSetting up a slowpush requires someone be in the side lane, going to the sidelane, and going from the sidelane to your team are both scenarios where that one champion is a free kill for a team that has vision control. Teamfight comps can also force the 4v5 or an objective when you leave to set up the splitpush.
