Before anything else, I focused on climbing to an elo where I can learn more. In chess, I learned the queen&amp;#39;s gambit and cheesed my way out of low elo.

In chess, I learned about forks, pins, and discovered checks and realized that they are like landing CC or an important skill shot in League. Similarly in League, keep track of your opponent&amp;#39;s mobility spells and look for opportunities to land an important ability. I.e.

In League, I suggest learning the uneven minion rule, where to ward, clear routes against different types of aggressive jungles, and lane swapping after taking a side turret. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I found that the learning processes for League and Chess are very similar.
