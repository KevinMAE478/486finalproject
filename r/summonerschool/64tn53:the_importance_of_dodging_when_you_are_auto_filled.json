How many of you have been in a situation where you think, &amp;quot;Hmm, I don&amp;#39;t really play Top lane that much, but I&amp;#39;m sure I can just farm it out and be okay later.&amp;quot;? Well, buckle up, because we are about to go for a ride about why you should never think like that if you want to climb!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with the obvious: For the vast majority of us, we are the elo we are at right now not because we can play everything at the same level, but because we play our best champs and roles at that level. Your Bronze jungling skills don&amp;#39;t mean anything when your mid is Plat, what matters is your mid is at a Plat level, and thats why you are Plat. Very simple and straight forward thinking, right? (The answer is yes)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s look at another relatively accurate statement: You are matched with people around the same skill level as you. Again, for the vast majority of us, this is true. You will have games where smurfs take over games, I&amp;#39;m sure, but for ever smurf, there are probably at least 20 other players around your skill level. You generally get matched with people at your own skill level, for the most part, is the point here. Again, this is generally true and accepted by everyone who isn&amp;#39;t delusional about how they belong in challenger while Silver 5.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So lets bring those two thoughts together for this one. We know that you are the elo you are at based on your best. Your best champs in your best roles. We also know that you are generally matched against equally skilled players. But what does this all mean? It means if you get filled Top where you have no Top experience, and lane against a Top main, you can expect to get absolutely crushed. Crushed in CS, crushed in pressure, crushed in rotations, and pretty much everything. You are essentially playing against a team of smurfs when you get auto filled to a role you are not competent at. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This applies less to lower elos and obviously much more at higher levels of play, but the reality is you lose 3 LP for a dodge and have to wait 5 minutes. Your odds of winning that game if you try to play it out are logically somewhere at or below 40%, you waste at LEAST 25 minutes between champ select, loading, and the earliest possible surrender, and lose somewhere between 14 and 20. Thats an increase of over 400% LP loss by you trying and praying to get carried. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no, before anyone asks, this is not a rage post from dropping 150 LP in two days due to excessive auto fillers who want to get carried in high diamond. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I feel like this isn't talked about enough.

Farming junglers like Master Yi and Shyvanna are not really good, cause they are always sorta 50-50 if they can get to the 1v9 point before your team feeds the enemy team too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support&lt;/strong&gt;: you pick Leona. You scoff at stuff like Malzahar support, or support Brand / Annie. You don&amp;#39;t even look at stuff like Bard, Blitzcrank, or Thresh. Those champions are for people who main support. Those champions are for people who are &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; at being support. You are not one of those guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have no fucking idea how to play support. There is no shame in that. You are autofilled. You don&amp;#39;t know the matchups. You don&amp;#39;t know the powerspikes. &lt;em&gt;You don&amp;#39;t know shit.&lt;/em&gt; You know who does know these things though? &lt;em&gt;Your ADC&lt;/em&gt;. So its best to keep that fucking guy alive. You don&amp;#39;t start shit as Leona, you wait, and when they try and jump on you, you just keep the enemy ADC cc&amp;#39;d for fucking eternity. You just start hitting the guy, and go &amp;quot;nope, you will never ever move ever again&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dg5ozui", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492020695.0, "created_utc": 1491991895.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tn53", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5mn75", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dracoknight256", "parent_id": "t3_64tn53", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thats why I main fill in plat.

You're right, it isn't guaranteed, but when most games are about 50% to win, having someone on your team in their worst possible role hurts your chances tremendously.\n\nThe only way you would convince me that it does is by showing me some statistics. I mean, from what I've seen of peoples statistics, people main their roles and win somewhere around 55 percent on their most used champions in that role, so if were going off your number before of 40% chance of winning in an off role, it isn't really that vast is it?\n\n&gt; This isn't about overcoming fears or being a stronger player or whatever cheesy thing you want it to be about. \n\nIt is not cheesy.

Would you have fun playing your worst role and losing? Go for it, but you're screwing over your 4 teammates while you do that.\n\nIf you're playing as if you can only have fun when you win and you don't have fun when you lose, then you forgot why you enjoyed league of legends in the first place. You're right though, I wouldn't have fun playing my worst role and losing, but I wouldn't choose my worst role as my secondary role anyway. Also, when I make the decision to play my secondary role, my aim isn't to have fun, it is to practice and improve as a player. A lot of the time, that means sacrificing the fun element or setting aside time in the game for fun, like playing an aram. If that is screwing over my teammates, by aiming to play in a way that gives my teammates a win, then that's their problem.\n\n&gt; Which you somehow disagree with, because you think your rank is measured by your worst role, and not your best role, which it isn't... You playing your absolute worst role and worst champ isn't something your team wants to deal with, but its what you want, so you neglect their feelings entirely because what you want means more than what they want, thats literally being selfish.\n\nNo I don't think rank is measured by your worst role, but it is determined by the choices we make. It is a bad choice to be playing my absolute worst role, but I wouldn't be because I'd never put it as my secondary role. It is a bad choice to be playing my worst champ, but I'd never pick it anyway, even in an off role. Likewise, it is a bad choice to lose lp by dodging games that now you would likely lose but would later win due to practice and gaining experience in those situations. I would neglect my teammates feelings because even though we both want to win, I know that I am choosing to do things that will actually help me win more games, while they are too concerned with the here and now and the instant satisfaction of winning while doing as little work as possible. Call it selfish if you want. I call it improving as a player.\n\n&gt; If you want to improve on a role you have little experience or skill it, take it to normals, don't first try something in ranked and potentially ruin the game for your 4 teammates.\n\nNormal game conditions arent the same as Ranked game conditions.

It&amp;#39;s about if people actually wanted to climb, become a better player, all that jazz, they would be brave and realise that they could be earning more lp eventually by getting used to uncomfortable scenarios such as the ones you&amp;#39;re saying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s about &amp;quot;Hey, this is my worst role, I&amp;#39;d like to win and have fun, but losing and feeding isn&amp;#39;t fun, let me not play this one.&amp;quot; People play this game for two main reasons: fun and competition. Would you have fun playing your worst role and losing? Go for it, but you&amp;#39;re screwing over your 4 teammates while you do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re playing as if you can only have fun when you win and you don&amp;#39;t have fun when you lose, then you forgot why you enjoyed league of legends in the first place. You&amp;#39;re right though, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have fun playing my worst role and losing, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t choose my worst role as my secondary role anyway. Also, when I make the decision to play my secondary role, my aim isn&amp;#39;t to have fun, it is to practice and improve as a player. A lot of the time, that means sacrificing the fun element or setting aside time in the game for fun, like playing an aram. If that is screwing over my teammates, by aiming to play in a way that gives my teammates a win, then that&amp;#39;s their problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which you somehow disagree with, because you think your rank is measured by your worst role, and not your best role, which it isn&amp;#39;t... You playing your absolute worst role and worst champ isn&amp;#39;t something your team wants to deal with, but its what you want, so you neglect their feelings entirely because what you want means more than what they want, thats literally being selfish.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No I don&amp;#39;t think rank is measured by your worst role, but it is determined by the choices we make. It is a bad choice to be playing my absolute worst role, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t be because I&amp;#39;d never put it as my secondary role. It is a bad choice to be playing my worst champ, but I&amp;#39;d never pick it anyway, even in an off role. Likewise, it is a bad choice to lose lp by dodging games that now you would likely lose but would later win due to practice and gaining experience in those situations. I would neglect my teammates feelings because even though we both want to win, I know that I am choosing to do things that will actually help me win more games, while they are too concerned with the here and now and the instant satisfaction of winning while doing as little work as possible. Call it selfish if you want. I call it improving as a player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to improve on a role you have little experience or skill it, take it to normals, don&amp;#39;t first try something in ranked and potentially ruin the game for your 4 teammates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normal game conditions arent the same as Ranked game conditions.
