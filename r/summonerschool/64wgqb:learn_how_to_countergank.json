Most junglers just farm mindlessly until they see a gank opportunity. Now pathing is a very complex thing to do and even high elo junglers dont path well most of the time. But one thing you can do to improve your jungling, and to give your team a HUGE advantage is LEARN TO COUNTERGANK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the key thing here is to be looking at all the lanes every time and think like you are the enemy jungler, constantly saying to yourself: what would the enemy jungler do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FOR EXAMPLE: Mid laners are trading, they end up both at 30% health, lets asume both blew flash just to make it even juicer, the wave is pushing towards the enemy tower. This is as juicy as it gets for the enemy jungler to gank. But what do most junglers do? they keep farming, or at best they ping danger to the midlaner, but this is incredibly wrong, this is the perfect opportunity to give your team an advantage, you know the enemy jungler is gonna gank mid, when your midlaner sees that you&amp;#39;re coming (obviously ping them that you&amp;#39;re on your way) you&amp;#39;re taking a HUGE amount of pressure off of him, he can go CS, and also he&amp;#39;s baiting the enemy jungler, so that when the gank happens you ambush it with your countergank and get a huge advantage, after which you can resume farming your camps, or take a tower, or get the enemy camps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now since most junglers dont do this, 2 things can happen, your midlaner plays safe and loses farm (maybe xp) and gets put behind meanwhile you get farm that you would&amp;#39;ve gotten anyways. OR the midlaner is greedy, tries to go for CS gets ganked and dies. both scenarios are sub-optimal for your team, so your job is to not be so greedy and go for the countergank, DELETE the mindset that if you&amp;#39;re not farming you&amp;#39;re setting yourself behind, cause you&amp;#39;re not! One of the primary roles of a jungler is to put pressure on the map, PUT PRESSURE!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no excuse for afk farming as a jungler, if you are doing that, you&amp;#39;re a bad jungler no matter if you end up carrying some games, you&amp;#39;re an awful jungler that provides no pressure. the Only exception is if you&amp;#39;re constantly counterjungling and you do it well, in that case then yeah its worth, but even if you&amp;#39;re a countergan style jungler, being smart and path yourself to get counterganks will get you insane advantages, and will make your laners happy about you, will avoid silly arguments, flaming, and will improve greatly your chances of winning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take care, and please do not comment about specific situations that this doesnt apply, because there are probably some cases in which it doesnt but they&amp;#39;re very specific and this is general advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Being smart about how to countergank is an essential skill you need to learn as a jungler.
