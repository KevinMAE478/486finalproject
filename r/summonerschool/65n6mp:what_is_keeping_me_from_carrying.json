There is no secret on how to get better at map awareness. You just have to look at the map more and be aware of where your opponents might be. So just keep working on that and eventually things will just click.\n\n&gt;I have been putting a good amount of effort into roaming, but find it difficult to maintain my lane pressure when I do so.

I understand this is simply what happens when you roam as a Toplaner, but I don't see professionals/ ex-professionals face this kind of situation when I watch them play while ahead so I can only assume I am doing something incorrect.\n\nSee this is where things get tricky.. sometimes you want your top tower to die and force the enemy team to fight because you are fed, sometimes you want to keep your top tower alive for as long as possible. I am a gold 1 scrub myself so I honestly can't give you any tips on macro plays like this. However one thing I've noticed is that when playing with season 6 diamond players, or like plat 2- plat 1s sometimes they will call for rotations that actually make a lot of sense(something that is absent in lower elo). For example after my tp play in bot, if I'm at relatively good health, my midlaner will go top to hold top for me while I hold mid. While this is pretty rare I am absolutely sure things like this happen more often the higher elo you go. As for now, I don't think you need to be concerned with stuff like rotations and when you should trade towers in bronze/silver/gold. Again, sorry that I can't give you advice on this one as I have no idea how these things work myself. \n\n&gt;While I have gotten much better at manipulating the wave to freeze or zone, I seem to be unable to balance this with Csing, watching the map, Roaming\n\nSame as map awareness. Keep trying and things will just click. You're going in the right direction.\n\n&gt;...and even trading. It is a new(ish) concept to me which I am not used to appyling to my games, but nevertheless tips would be helpful. (This is particularly a problem against Nasus)\n\nAfter looking at your op gg I have to say that your runes, masteries and build paths are really bad. \n\nFor irelia you want to go AD marks, flat armor seals, flat mr glyphs and attack speed quints (versus champions like quinn, vladimir etc you can take 2xAD 1xAS quints.)\n\nAs for masteries, you just go with [this](http://i.imgur.com/EZpFefh.png)\n\nYou always max W on her. Not E. vs melee matchups start with E, stun AA then, vs ranged start Q.\n\nWith irelia you really want to win lane hard because this will tilt your opponent hard and irelia can be really annoying when fed. So usually what you want to do is back either at 450 gold and get a dorans blade, or go back at 800 gold and get dorans blade + long sword (tp back to lane of course). Before going back, make sure to trade with your opponent, especially if it's nasus. Even if you take an unfavorable trade and end up barely surviving with 200 hp it doesn't matter since you are still going to recall and tp back to lane with huge item advantage. After you tp you either A: kill nasus or B: he is forced to recall and fight you with inferior items(and then you still kill him). I actually think this is going to help you focus on cs a lot, because you want to get 800 gold before nasus gets 1000 for his first item. After that you can focus less on cs and a bit more on trading, just to get the feel of matchup and so on, because I know it's hard to keep track of everything that's going on on your screen at once as a low ranked player. \n\n&gt;I tend to have to pre-plan every play in order for it to happen correctly, such as flashing an ability or predicting cc to parry on Fiora.\n\nThis is exactly why you shouldn't play fiora or yasuo at your elo. You have to pre-plan way too many things. You have to react way too fast. The only thing you have to pre plan when playing malphite is one button press. With annie its two. F and R. You don't need to focus on anything else from mechanical point of view, so you get to pay all of your attention on enemies and improving your macro game. That's why those champions are so good to play in low elo. \n\n[This](https://www.youtube.com/user/tinkcho123/videos) is the best irelia player in the world. Watch him. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC91iL_AR8Sv95pAieTFfrcw/videos?sort=dd&amp;view=0&amp;shelf_id=0) is his new channel. Be sure to follow him on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/tinkcho123) as well. He has been in high korean masters since season 4 one tricking irelia, so he really knows what he's doing. Enjoy.\n\nI also really like that lately you've been playing one champion exclusively lately, that's very very good.

Before going back, make sure to trade with your opponent, especially if it&amp;#39;s nasus. Even if you take an unfavorable trade and end up barely surviving with 200 hp it doesn&amp;#39;t matter since you are still going to recall and tp back to lane with huge item advantage. After you tp you either A: kill nasus or B: he is forced to recall and fight you with inferior items(and then you still kill him). I actually think this is going to help you focus on cs a lot, because you want to get 800 gold before nasus gets 1000 for his first item. After that you can focus less on cs and a bit more on trading, just to get the feel of matchup and so on, because I know it&amp;#39;s hard to keep track of everything that&amp;#39;s going on on your screen at once as a low ranked player. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I tend to have to pre-plan every play in order for it to happen correctly, such as flashing an ability or predicting cc to parry on Fiora.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is exactly why you shouldn&amp;#39;t play fiora or yasuo at your elo. You have to pre-plan way too many things. You have to react way too fast. The only thing you have to pre plan when playing malphite is one button press. With annie its two. F and R. You don&amp;#39;t need to focus on anything else from mechanical point of view, so you get to pay all of your attention on enemies and improving your macro game. That&amp;#39;s why those champions are so good to play in low elo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/tinkcho123/videos\"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the best irelia player in the world.
