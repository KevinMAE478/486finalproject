If you climb to diamond on Aatrox that makes you diamond. If you climb to diamond on Ahri that makes you diamond...if you climb to diamond on Zyra that makes you diamond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I don&amp;#39;t think Janna teaches as much all around about support as say, Karma would. Janna wants to play the game a very specific way focused on making sure her team doesn&amp;#39;t die. A versatile support would probably be more proactive than you would learn by playing Janna. That being said, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s necessarily better to be versatile. It&amp;#39;s certainly true that playing just Janna to get to diamond makes it easier by minimizing the amount you have to learn, so yes you do learn less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think that necessarily makes you worse though, this is very relevant imo: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEd3Dy0bp0o&amp;amp;lc\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEd3Dy0bp0o&amp;amp;lc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dged5eq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492503028.0, "created_utc": 1492474228.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65yvzt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgedqln", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rolf_Dom", "parent_id": "t1_dgeckmw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Janna is very one dimensional as a support.
