I honestly love this guy, he is so much fun to play when you get used to him and I've loved his style and theme from release. Let's get right to it, shall we?\n\n* What role does he play in a team composition?\n\nBard is very heavily geared towards a roaming support and honestly I've had the most success with him when I've managed to push up my lane or wait for backs and go roaming by myself before my first back. I basically wait for a good time and then become a second jungler for my team. Either ganking midlane from behind the enemy or I'll recall and head top as fast as I can.\n\n* What are the core items to be built on him?\n\nHe works really well with the current support build at the moment. Locket/Redemption are both really great items and they give him a good amount of utility in later game teamfights when roaming isn't as much of a possibility. A lot of the Bardmains community have been building Nashor's Tooth on him since the most recent patch and while I haven't seen as much success as others with this build, I definitely do see the potential. Great items for him include Knight's Vow and Frost Queen's Claim. I almost always get Ruby Sightstone because of Redemption/Locket and mobi boots are an absolute must!\n\n* What is the order of leveling up the skills?\n\nR &gt; Q &gt; E &gt; W\n\nHis heal is not strong, leveling it isn't really honestly as useful as being able to catch people out easier, which is what leveling magical journey does. Anyone who hasn't tried it underestimates how much the speed through tunnels helps and when you get a couple points in it, you can effectively catch anyone with their pants down or get out of any situation yourself.\n\n* What are his spikes in terms of items or levels?\n\nDefinitely level 6 is a pretty big spike, especially if you chime well enough to get it before the enemy botlane. A good Bard ult can turn around a gank, engage, tower take, dragon, anything. It has almost infinite possibilities if used correctly. Apart from that, currently hitting 15 chimes is pretty big. AOE meeps with 2 meeps at your disposal is pretty absurd for catching people.\n\n* What are the most optimal rune/mastery setups?\n\nThere are several. I take AS Reds, Health Yellows, MR blues and Armour Quints but I've seen AS/Mpen builds or Movespeed quints or AD even work on him. He is a very flexible champion as far as runes are concerned. Masteries you almost always want to go for 0/18/12. Getting the extra movement speed and Summoner CDR from the defense tree while also having Thunderlords gives you fantastic potential for roaming.\n\n* What champions does he synergize well with?\n\nAny champion who can shove well and lane 1v2 for an amount of time that will allow him to roam. Caitlyn is good, Ezreal is great, anything with a decent amount of disengage or self peel. You don't want to run him with a Vayne or a Kalista because it just removes your roaming potential early and sort of disallows you from using his greatest potential.\n\n* What is the counterplay against him?\n\nShoving, keeping him from roaming, or just flat out murdering him if he gets out of positon. He trades well in lane but has to get pretty close to do so, in that case he's pretty open to harassment. I have huge problems with Lulu and Brand, or someone like Thresh or Braum, who are able to tank his trades and lock him down. I would also say that having an aware midlane or jungler is a huge counter because if he can't get his ganks off then he tends to fall behind quite fast depending on how much he roams. Ward up your lanes basically, keep an eye out.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well then, here we go with my favourite champion. I honestly love this guy, he is so much fun to play when you get used to him and I&amp;#39;ve loved his style and theme from release. Let&amp;#39;s get right to it, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What role does he play in a team composition?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bard is very heavily geared towards a roaming support and honestly I&amp;#39;ve had the most success with him when I&amp;#39;ve managed to push up my lane or wait for backs and go roaming by myself before my first back. I basically wait for a good time and then become a second jungler for my team. Either ganking midlane from behind the enemy or I&amp;#39;ll recall and head top as fast as I can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What are the core items to be built on him?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He works really well with the current support build at the moment. Locket/Redemption are both really great items and they give him a good amount of utility in later game teamfights when roaming isn&amp;#39;t as much of a possibility. A lot of the Bardmains community have been building Nashor&amp;#39;s Tooth on him since the most recent patch and while I haven&amp;#39;t seen as much success as others with this build, I definitely do see the potential. Great items for him include Knight&amp;#39;s Vow and Frost Queen&amp;#39;s Claim. I almost always get Ruby Sightstone because of Redemption/Locket and mobi boots are an absolute must!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What is the order of leveling up the skills?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;R &amp;gt; Q &amp;gt; E &amp;gt; W&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His heal is not strong, leveling it isn&amp;#39;t really honestly as useful as being able to catch people out easier, which is what leveling magical journey does. Anyone who hasn&amp;#39;t tried it underestimates how much the speed through tunnels helps and when you get a couple points in it, you can effectively catch anyone with their pants down or get out of any situation yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What are his spikes in terms of items or levels?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Definitely level 6 is a pretty big spike, especially if you chime well enough to get it before the enemy botlane. A good Bard ult can turn around a gank, engage, tower take, dragon, anything. It has almost infinite possibilities if used correctly. Apart from that, currently hitting 15 chimes is pretty big. AOE meeps with 2 meeps at your disposal is pretty absurd for catching people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What are the most optimal rune/mastery setups?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are several. I take AS Reds, Health Yellows, MR blues and Armour Quints but I&amp;#39;ve seen AS/Mpen builds or Movespeed quints or AD even work on him. He is a very flexible champion as far as runes are concerned. Masteries you almost always want to go for 0/18/12.

He can make almost any support item work and also enjoys having a bit of defensive power along the way. I usually go EoW into Redemption into Locket and build out from there. He's not a great user of Knight's Vow but it can be built as a last item and he doesn't have amazing synergy with something like Mikael's. Ardent is a pick-up that has grown on me mostly since it adds a ton of stats even if only applying it with Locket/Redemption. Bard's W doesn't heal a ton but having a point and click AS steroid with an on-hit component and an healing effect feels pretty good.\n\n\n&gt; What is the order of leveling up the skills?\n\nR&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;W. I know some people like to max W second, I don't see the point in it. By the time you're maxing your second ability you're well into the mid game and your main purpose is roaming and rotating and setting up picks. While your E enables you to do all of these better, with lower CD and faster travel time per point on it, your W adds only in healing. It's immediate healing effect is still underwhelming and it's movement speed does not scale. For the most part, maxing W only benefits it's \"charged\" status but you're not gonna be dropping a ton of Shrines unless you're hardcore sieging and waveclearing, which is not the ideal way you want the game to play out as Bard. \n\nYou can, however, put a second point into W against rough lanes (e.g. Cait+Karma when you have a Vayne) since the early healing does matter then.\n\n\n&gt; What are his spikes in terms of items or levels?\n\nAssuming a good lane match-up, respect Bard's level 3, a lot of people will put points early on like Q-W-Q-E so they'll have a very strong level 3 even if they have no escape. \n\nWith that said, Bard's level 1 is pretty strong and a ton of people underestimate the early damage of his AA+Meep+Q. Keep in mind, this takes less than a second to pull off and you're dealing (assuming only Spellthief's for bonus damage) 52 (AD) + 31.5 (Meep) + 83 (Q) + 30 (Spellthief's passive) + 10.5 (TLD) which adds up to 207 damage pre-mitigation.\n\n While this doesn't sound \"amazing\" you also have runes and your own ADC helping plus once you get 5 chimes (around level 3) you should be getting 45 (2nd Q point) + 20 (two levels of TLD) + 15 (5 chime damage bonus) + 4.4 (2 levels of AD growth) bonus damage for 84.4 bonus damage which makes a level 3 Q+AA worth 291.4 pre-mitigation damage.\n\nBard spikes hard with every CDR purchase, the more CDR he has, the more damage he's consistently bringing as well as having a lot more CC and mobility. It is the must-have stat on the champion. \n\n\n&gt; What are the most optimal rune/mastery setups?\n\nCurrently I run Hybrid Pen marks, a mix of Health and Armor seals, flat MR glyphs alongside 2 AS quints and 1 Armor quint. Mostly this setup is to ensure I maximize AA harass and can execute quick Meep trades without too much hassle. Plus, Bard gets only 1% bonus AS per level up so having 9% right off the bat goes a long way to unloading all the meeps on people later on. \n\nI know several people who run several variations: flat hp seals with Armor quints, movespeed quints with armor seals, magic pen over hybrid pen and so on. It's mostly personal preference but some sort of penetration and some sort of added durability (especially against magic damage) is good enough on my book.\n&gt; What role does he play in a team composition?\n\nAs befits his name, Bard is a maestro and his purpose is to set the tempo for his team and the game as a whole. He excels when he has the freedom to roam and can do it better than any other support. Bard's greatest strengths are his ability to move around the map quickly and to secure long range picks via his ultimate. \n\nWhile Bard lacks conventional mobility his E is one the single most situationally powerful abilities in the game, allowing him to take routes that are faster than the standard map's. Bard is a playmaker and, among all supports, he's best at setting up picks and catching overextended targets, able to do this from a very long distance. Bard's passive also gives him a strong scaling element in his meeps so he remains very relevant in terms of damage.\n\nBard's laning is not bad, but he does suffer against lane-dominant match-ups. He dominates almost any melee match-up, stunning melee supports when they go for Relic stacks and witling them down with constant harass, slows and stuns. Bard can do well against some of the traditional supports (such as Lulu or Karma with whom he can trade but only in short intervals) but struggles the most against supports that can quickly catch him out and burst him (Blitz/Zyra/Malz).\n\n&gt; What champions does he synergize well with?\n\nThe most obvious picks are ADC's that can hold their own (read: that have some sort of safety), Ezreal/Caitlyn/Sivir are all good since they have good range and waveclear. More aggressive picks can work and benefit a ton from having a Bard supporting them but this depends on the match-up. \n\nPersonally, I love having Kalista as an ADC. Bard's fairly low range but also fairly low survivability means that he wants to play aggressively but needs to play smart. Kalista can help Bard's quick trades via her W, has fairly good waveclear, can use her W to spot incoming gangs, is fairly self-reliant and can save your ass via ultimate. Plus, Bard wants to use his E to quickly translate a pick or a fight into an objective and Kalista's Rend can easily secure an epic monster. \n\n\n&gt; What is the counterplay against him?\n\nIn short, Bard struggles against anything that can either lock him down and burst him or outtrades him and forces him to play defensively. Mage supports often do both of these. Blitzcrank is a pain to play against especially since it makes leaving your ADC 1v2 so risky. For the most part, however, Bard will often be roaming and rotating so having good vision to spot him is essential. Prevent him from getting picks and get picks on him yourself and you will greatly hurt his ability to impact the game.\n\nMoreso, try to close the map as much as possible. The less distance Bard can cover, the less chimes he will have and a fairly big amount of his power budget lies within his meeps and chimes both in terms of damage and utility.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I didn&amp;#39;t have enough space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What are the core items to be built on him?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bard doesn&amp;#39;t really have a &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; item that synergyzes amazingly well with him. He can make almost any support item work and also enjoys having a bit of defensive power along the way. I usually go EoW into Redemption into Locket and build out from there. He&amp;#39;s not a great user of Knight&amp;#39;s Vow but it can be built as a last item and he doesn&amp;#39;t have amazing synergy with something like Mikael&amp;#39;s. Ardent is a pick-up that has grown on me mostly since it adds a ton of stats even if only applying it with Locket/Redemption. Bard&amp;#39;s W doesn&amp;#39;t heal a ton but having a point and click AS steroid with an on-hit component and an healing effect feels pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What is the order of leveling up the skills?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;R&amp;gt;Q&amp;gt;E&amp;gt;W. I know some people like to max W second, I don&amp;#39;t see the point in it. By the time you&amp;#39;re maxing your second ability you&amp;#39;re well into the mid game and your main purpose is roaming and rotating and setting up picks. While your E enables you to do all of these better, with lower CD and faster travel time per point on it, your W adds only in healing. It&amp;#39;s immediate healing effect is still underwhelming and it&amp;#39;s movement speed does not scale. For the most part, maxing W only benefits it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;charged&amp;quot; status but you&amp;#39;re not gonna be dropping a ton of Shrines unless you&amp;#39;re hardcore sieging and waveclearing, which is not the ideal way you want the game to play out as Bard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can, however, put a second point into W against rough lanes (e.g. Cait+Karma when you have a Vayne) since the early healing does matter then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What are his spikes in terms of items or levels?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assuming a good lane match-up, respect Bard&amp;#39;s level 3, a lot of people will put points early on like Q-W-Q-E so they&amp;#39;ll have a very strong level 3 even if they have no escape. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that said, Bard&amp;#39;s level 1 is pretty strong and a ton of people underestimate the early damage of his AA+Meep+Q. Keep in mind, this takes less than a second to pull off and you&amp;#39;re dealing (assuming only Spellthief&amp;#39;s for bonus damage) 52 (AD) + 31.5 (Meep) + 83 (Q) + 30 (Spellthief&amp;#39;s passive) + 10.5 (TLD) which adds up to 207 damage pre-mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While this doesn&amp;#39;t sound &amp;quot;amazing&amp;quot; you also have runes and your own ADC helping plus once you get 5 chimes (around level 3) you should be getting 45 (2nd Q point) + 20 (two levels of TLD) + 15 (5 chime damage bonus) + 4.4 (2 levels of AD growth) bonus damage for 84.4 bonus damage which makes a level 3 Q+AA worth 291.4 pre-mitigation damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bard spikes hard with every CDR purchase, the more CDR he has, the more damage he&amp;#39;s consistently bringing as well as having a lot more CC and mobility. It is the must-have stat on the champion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What are the most optimal rune/mastery setups?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently I run Hybrid Pen marks, a mix of Health and Armor seals, flat MR glyphs alongside 2 AS quints and 1 Armor quint. Mostly this setup is to ensure I maximize AA harass and can execute quick Meep trades without too much hassle. Plus, Bard gets only 1% bonus AS per level up so having 9% right off the bat goes a long way to unloading all the meeps on people later on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know several people who run several variations: flat hp seals with Armor quints, movespeed quints with armor seals, magic pen over hybrid pen and so on. It&amp;#39;s mostly personal preference but some sort of penetration and some sort of added durability (especially against magic damage) is good enough on my book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What role does he play in a team composition?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As befits his name, Bard is a maestro and his purpose is to set the tempo for his team and the game as a whole. He excels when he has the freedom to roam and can do it better than any other support. Bard&amp;#39;s greatest strengths are his ability to move around the map quickly and to secure long range picks via his ultimate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While Bard lacks conventional mobility his E is one the single most situationally powerful abilities in the game, allowing him to take routes that are faster than the standard map&amp;#39;s. Bard is a playmaker and, among all supports, he&amp;#39;s best at setting up picks and catching overextended targets, able to do this from a very long distance. Bard&amp;#39;s passive also gives him a strong scaling element in his meeps so he remains very relevant in terms of damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bard&amp;#39;s laning is not bad, but he does suffer against lane-dominant match-ups. He dominates almost any melee match-up, stunning melee supports when they go for Relic stacks and witling them down with constant harass, slows and stuns. Bard can do well against some of the traditional supports (such as Lulu or Karma with whom he can trade but only in short intervals) but struggles the most against supports that can quickly catch him out and burst him (Blitz/Zyra/Malz).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What champions does he synergize well with?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most obvious picks are ADC&amp;#39;s that can hold their own (read: that have some sort of safety), Ezreal/Caitlyn/Sivir are all good since they have good range and waveclear. More aggressive picks can work and benefit a ton from having a Bard supporting them but this depends on the match-up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I love having Kalista as an ADC. Bard&amp;#39;s fairly low range but also fairly low survivability means that he wants to play aggressively but needs to play smart. Kalista can help Bard&amp;#39;s quick trades via her W, has fairly good waveclear, can use her W to spot incoming gangs, is fairly self-reliant and can save your ass via ultimate. Plus, Bard wants to use his E to quickly translate a pick or a fight into an objective and Kalista&amp;#39;s Rend can easily secure an epic monster. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What is the counterplay against him?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, Bard struggles against anything that can either lock him down and burst him or outtrades him and forces him to play defensively.

Bard is the quintessential roaming support with plenty of playmaking capabilities and likely some of the most \"carry potential\" while being a fairly traditional support. At the time of writing this post, I have close to 600k mastery points on the champion and he is, by a wide margin, my single most played champion. \n\nSo let's get the basics out of the way before addressing the questions:\n\n- Bard's passive is **Traveler's Call** which has two components: the first being **Chimes**. Chimes are small objects that pop up around the map that Bard can collect to receive mana, movement speed, experience and a single, well, chime. Every 5 chimes Bard collects he receives a unique bonus to his second component: **Meeps**. Meeps are spirits attracted by all the chimes and noises that Bard makes. \n\n- At first, all the single meep Bard gets at the start of the game will do is deal a bit of bonus magic damage very few seconds. As Bard collects chimes, his empowered AA will also slow, deal bonus damage, do these things on an AoE, will gain more meeps so Bard can attack multiple times with these bonuses and will also reduce the cooldown of each individual Meep.\n\n-  Bard's Q is **Cosmic Binding** which is a fairly simple ability on paper. You throw a single line skillshot that damages and slows the first enemy unit hit and generates a second bolt behind that unit that also deals damage and stuns, should this second bolt collide with terrain or another enemy unit then the first unit will be stunned. Sounds simple enough but the inner working of the ability confuses a lot of people. \n\n- There's a few things to keep in mind: the bolts don't have the same range, the first one has 950 range while the second bolt has 450 range, regardless of how much distance the first one traveled. This means that if you point-blank Q someone then you will only have 450 units worth of range to work with to set up a stun. This means that being close to your enemy is doubly dangerous: you're squishy and want more \"space\" so you can line up a stun properly.\n\n- Another, perhaps more important, aspect to keep in mind is that: as long as the first bolt hits and the second one connects to something, the first target (unless he's dead/untargetable/immune to CC) will always get stunned. \"But Handsome Taco\" you ask \"Of course it does. Why are you writing this?\" Well imaginary reader made for the sole purpose of explaining this nuance that gets some \"?\" and \"wtf\" in my games every now and then, because it doesn't matter if you flash or dash or blink or whatever. If the first bolt hits you, the second one will be created on your \"impact\" location and should it connect then it doesn't matter where you are so long as you are available to be stunned.\n\n- Fun fact about Cosmic Binding: if you destroy a Morg shield with the first bolt then, should the second bolt collide with something, Morgana will also be stunned despite the whole policy of \"spells that destroy Black Shield are still nullified\". Why? Because the second bolt is a distinct entity from the first, ergo the first bolt destroyed the shield while the second stunned Morgana. Separate bolts, separate effects.\n\n- Bard's W is **Caretaker's Shrine** and is a fairly straightforward spell. Bard leaves a small shrine on the ground that will grow over 10 seconds, giving health and a short burst of movement speed to the first ally that steps on it. The more it grows, the more it will heal. Bard's W acts as both a skillshot and a point and click ability, should you directly click on an allied champion or portrait it will behave as a point and click and \"lock onto them\" giving them a tiny bit of health but the burst of movement speed all the same. Whenever a champion steps on the Shrines, they are consumed. \n\n- Bard's W has a big mana cost attached to it. Due to his Q's highly spammable nature and fairly low mana cost alongside his 0 mana cost passive for harass/trading and the free mana sustain from his passive, Bard's W costs 90 mana per cast, otherwise he would be a sustain monster and never run out of mana ever. Spamming W's is a quick way to lose lane but is sometimes almost required in a tough lane. Bard has some sustain, yes, but it's mostly as a safety net rather than a powerful tool on it's own. \n\n- Bard's E is **Magical Journey** and is also fairly simple at a glance. Bard aims at nearby terrain (not useable on player-made terrain such as Anivia walls or Trundle's E) and creates a clickable object that will lead any champion to it's destination. You are not invulnerable nor untargetable inside and it does have a travel time (i.e. not instant). While enemies can use it, allies receive a % bonus speed within it so enemies using it will always be slower than allies also using it.\n\n- Bard's E is your premier tool to flank, move around the map and even move around fights. It can be used as an escape and has a chasing tool and, while not 100% reliable, will often act as a safety net. Bard players have a unique advantage to most supports in that by using E and their chimes together, they can venture quickly to an unwarded area, ward every little bush and vanish extremely quickly. Getting vision control has never been easier! Few supports have an escape, even if an unreliable one, like Bard so it use it well.\n\n- Bard's E also serves a very important function, it is a veritable bait machine. Catch the tunnel, wait for an enemy, Q him while he's inside the wall and he'll pop up stunned when he finishes the trip. Great to turn small fights around and to escape when things go wrong. Chasing a good Bard is a tough business and avoid catching Bard tunnels that end up in his tower. Unlike Thresh's lantern, Bard's E can be used while silenced but is still susceptible to the grounded effect from Cassio's W. Also, since it's coded as a dash, effects like Poppy's W will cause a knock-up on first use.\n\n- Finally, Bard's ultimate is **Tempered Fate**, it is a long range AoE spell that has a travel time. When it arrives to it's destination, everything (save for immune enemies, untargetable units and structures other than turrets) will be put on stasis (e.g. invulnerable and untargetable) for 2.5 seconds. In short, it's an AoE Zhonya's.\n\n- Bard's ultimate is a complex ability but using it can be summed up to: use it as aggressively as possible. Or, in other words, never on your team. This too has exceptions (if you can save someone from a DoT or a Karthus ult), but these are few and far between. Look to use your ultimate to set up picks and begin fights or to interrupt key abilities. It's a tough ability to use when you can't speak with your team in real time (e.g. using your ult only to have your MF also use hers on a bunch of piled enemies)  so, to save trouble, limit it to it's most obvious function: catching people out. \n\n- On that note: any Bard player should know how to pull of Q+R+Q. Stun someone, then ult on top after a while, then stun them as soon as they're out of stasis. This is possible, IIRC, as soon as about 35% CDR with max rank Q and can take people out of the fight for 5/6 seconds. Especially useful if your allies are around but will still take a while to arrive.\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll preface this by saying that I like oddball picks, champions that bring truly unique stuff to the table.
