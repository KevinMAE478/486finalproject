Ill admit i rarely bought it before since it was reworked since i usually didn&amp;#39;t trust my soloqueue acds and i got no duo atm. It&amp;#39;s definitely underrated especially if the enemys have low amounts of hard cc (f.e. only Ahri charm as engage with a yasuo, udyr, ahri, lucian, janna comp). The fact that it has 20% healing over the 10% of censer and redemtion is something i was unaware of. Went from getting it in 1/10 games to 6/10 games.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not upgrading boots. Situational. Love me some mobis or some lucidity, if they have cc that stops me from using my actives i take mercs vs full ad i take tabis. 2/10 would keep tier 1 boots&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Trinity of idol upgrades? Vs some teams its right. But usually if my adc uses runaans i go censer if he doesnt i get redemption and grab a situational 2nd one. Very rarely get all 3.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No sightstone? No. But i don&amp;#39;t rush it anymore i usually get Eye of the Oasis after my first Forbidden Idol upgrade item.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: Some useful stuff but some doesn&amp;#39;t work for me well. Mikaels and Fearie start are definitely underrated tho&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dgc13ql", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492378540.0, "created_utc": 1492349740.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od21", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od21", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od21", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65od21", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcl9tb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "r2401", "parent_id": "t1_dgbz8o2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm betting this guy doesn't use his heal in battle anyway, he'll go aggro and trade and just heal to get both he and his adc back to health.
