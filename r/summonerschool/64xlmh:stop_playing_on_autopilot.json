What I mean by auto-pilot is not really thinking while you play. You sort of just play through a combination of muscle memory or whatever, sort of like someone may play a sport or a musical instrument (though people who are really good at those things, will tell you the same thing - don&amp;#39;t auto-pilot while doing them!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some people, playing on auto-pilot means they play at a Bronze level, and for others it means playing at a Diamond level. However, the point is, if you &lt;strong&gt;did&lt;/strong&gt; turn off the auto-pilot and think as you played, you would be a higher elo than you currently are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how to not play on auto-pilot?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Play ranked only when you are well-rested. This means particularly do not play ranked late at night. This also means you probably won&amp;#39;t play as many games. However, you will notice that many people in high elo don&amp;#39;t have as many games as you&amp;#39;d might expect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Make sure you are well-hydrated and aren&amp;#39;t hungry. I know it sounds trivial but again, this combined with sleep is really vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) In-between cs&amp;#39;ing/waves, look at the map briefly. This takes practice, but you can get a rhythm down. Learning to use spacebar really helps you (as it brings you right back to your champion no matter where your camera is on the map). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Ask questions while you play. Ask yourself about enemy CDs, where enemy players are, how much you have until your next item spike, how many waves until you level - It really isn&amp;#39;t too important what you&amp;#39;re thinking about necessarily, just that you&amp;#39;re actively thinking about the game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) Think about the enemy jungler. This is &lt;strong&gt;especially&lt;/strong&gt; true if you are laning, but also &lt;strong&gt;ESPECIALLY&lt;/strong&gt; true in higher elos. Think of the jungler as your lane opponent in a way. A lot of people, when laning, tend to blame the enemy jungler intervening in their lane on losing lane/game. There&amp;#39;s almost no reason any gank should come as a surprise - I tend to assume when I&amp;#39;m laning I&amp;#39;ll get ganked and receive no ganks (of course this doesn&amp;#39;t always happen, but going in with this expectation makes you less likely to tilt if it does happen). Most of the time when higher elo players die to ganks, they were taking a risk knowingly. As a result, you don&amp;#39;t see them rage as often about the enemy jungler. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This gets to my point about higher elo and paying attention to the jungler. Jungle is the role with the highest impact on the game in higher elo and the one that tends to tip the scale of the game, as people know how to play their lanes better so in general won&amp;#39;t die in even fights (1 v 1 or 2 v 2). So you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to think about the enemy jungler as if you were laning against them, because their potential to tip the scale of the game is so high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of ways people play off auto-pilot. Just be aware that actually &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; while playing - knowing when you can/how to do this and trying your best to only play ranked when you can - will help you improve at the game and achieve a higher rank.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Every person at every elo (myself included) is guilty of doing this in ranked at one point or another.
