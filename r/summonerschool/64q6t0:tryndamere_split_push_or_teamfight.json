One thing I learned from watching him and what I think makes Trynd viable in solo Q at low ELOs....\n\nWhen I was in low bronze I thought split pushing meant taking down towers. I have to take down towers or I'm not splitting well! That's not the goal of split pushing, it's the result when the other team fucks up.\n\nYour goal as a split pusher, especially when fed, is to draw pressure from the rest of the map. You keep track of where the enemy is (ward up and count heads), when you have 4 (or 3 if you are super fed) heads accounted for, you start drawing pressure to the opposite side of your team and important objectives (so bot side if baron is up, top side if dragon is up).  You clear minion waves to the tower. You make a lot of noise and say \"look at me, I'm about to take your towers.\"\n\nIf they come for you, great, your team can now do objectives and win team fights while you lead them on a wild goose chase. If the enemy team stays in lane to clear objectives, you clear their jungle. If they never come for you and 5 v 4 your team, you get towers while spam pinging your team back.\n\nIf done right there should always be 1-2 people running for you. If it's one you kill them, if it's two you keep them busy while your team hopefully gets their shit together. Use pings to guide them to better decision making (ie ping baron/dragon/towers, etc). If it's zero you take objectives (turrets/dragons/inhibs/nexus).\n\nI like what Neace says, when you're fed, you WANT to get ganked. You want to draw the jungler to your lane so they waste time and effort trying to kill you.  If they're trying to kill you, the rest of your team is free to push objectives, farm, gank, counter-jg, etc etc.\n\nAt low elos they wont' always capitalize but you're just making it easier for them by drawing pressure from other lanes.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neace has some good Tryndamere split videos.
