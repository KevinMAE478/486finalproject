Q is a hard skillshot to hit on a moving target, especially around minions, it's a single target snare, and it has a decent cooldown - it's not exactly a great disengage tool compared to its usefulness in poke/engage.

The Zhonyas potential rush could also set you back from getting more useful team orientated items, much like why RoA and Tear champions aren't usually played as support because to rush those items means to delay getting Sightstone and vision, but to not rush them means no powerspikes. \n\nI'd say she's a mid to low top tier support champ at the moment.
