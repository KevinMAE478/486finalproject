If you genuinely think that smite nunu support is viable, and you are finding statistically significant success with is, when specifically are the &amp;quot;some cases&amp;quot; you can do it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is that you can&amp;#39;t really make bland statements like &amp;quot;not buy a sightstone is irresponsible&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s plainly not in certain cases. You&amp;#39;re even fuzzy on how to say it yourself. This guy whether you choose to accept it or not &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; one of the best players in the world even never buying sighstone, he is a net bonus to his team. So which is it, is it &amp;quot;recomendable to advise supports to buy sightstone&amp;quot; or is it &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;iresponsible&lt;/em&gt; not to buy it&amp;quot; ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that your arguement and reality are at odds and it&amp;#39;s largely because of your view of the game as &amp;quot;set&amp;quot; and the meta as &amp;quot;set&amp;quot;. This role &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; do this, and that role &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; buy this to &amp;quot;fill the needs in the team&amp;quot;, when you cannot say one of those statements for &lt;em&gt;any role in the game&lt;/em&gt; that has been constant throughout leagues history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your view suggests that there is an &lt;em&gt;optimal established way&lt;/em&gt; to play the game and anything that deviates is sub optimal. This is not the case and has been proven hundreds of times both in pro play and solo queue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leaving the top laners to 2v1 while you go jungle? Irresponsible?\nTaking smite top instead of TP and your team lacking TP pressure all game? Irresponsible?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again your goal is to win, that&amp;#39;s it, and there&amp;#39;s many more paths to this goal than you give the game credit for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dgb91h1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492322927.0, "created_utc": 1492294127.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb0oqs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HaganeLink0", "parent_id": "t1_dgaztw2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "YOu put thousands of words on my mouth I didn't said.

Utterly irrelevant.\n\nEven for her heals, those are a 60% and 55% scaling. Even if you factor in the healing multipliers, you're at most looking at a +50 heal strength or something. At lvl 18 it's so very little.\n\nAnd looking at her last 20 games, she never got past lvl 15. And usually ends at around lvl 13. A lot of that scaling never gets utilized.\n\nIMO I'd much rather have some extra Armor and MR/Flat AP to crush the laning phase even more and survive better overall. Because let's face it, she may be a lane bully, but she's not THAT much of a lane bully that you can comfortably go full glass cannon with scaling runes and hope to always smash the enemy lane.\n\nI just don't see the risk/reward ratio as \"worth\" at all.\n\n---\n\nAlso - not really sold on the no sightstone thing either.
