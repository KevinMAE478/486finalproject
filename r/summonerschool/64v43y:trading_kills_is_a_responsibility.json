Trading kills is great if you're behind.\n\nFirst of all he's going to give more gold than you. But that's just part of my point.\n\nLet's say your team is 10k behind in gold and the game is at the edge of being gone (30k gold vs 40k gold, purely theoretical).\n\nNow, what happens if you trade 20 equal kills? 500 gold for every kill(once again a theoretical amount. A simple kill is worth 450 gold, more or less depending on killstreaks, but the winning team is likely to give more gold than the losing one)\n\nThe lead is still 10k! But the difference has shortened, actually. A team with 40k gold has 33% more items than the team with 30k gold. But a team with 50k gold only has 25% more items than the team with 40k gold.\n\nAnd last but not least, successfully trading kills stalls out the game.\nAnd even that is not considering that the difference between 80K gold and 100K gold isn't 25% more items. It's 0% more items, because players are full.\n\nSo, the point here is that advantage of a winning team shrinks if you trade kills. It shrinks because\n\n1) They give more gold than you\n\n2) The lead shrinks every time you trade kills. That's just how percentages work.\n\n3) Stalls the game out, bringing you closer to potential full builds, making you more even in strength.\n\nAVOID trading kills if you are ahead in mid-game and late-game.

Trading kills is great if you&amp;#39;re behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all he&amp;#39;s going to give more gold than you. But that&amp;#39;s just part of my point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say your team is 10k behind in gold and the game is at the edge of being gone (30k gold vs 40k gold, purely theoretical).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, what happens if you trade 20 equal kills? 500 gold for every kill(once again a theoretical amount. A simple kill is worth 450 gold, more or less depending on killstreaks, but the winning team is likely to give more gold than the losing one)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lead is still 10k! But the difference has shortened, actually. A team with 40k gold has 33% more items than the team with 30k gold. But a team with 50k gold only has 25% more items than the team with 40k gold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, successfully trading kills stalls out the game.\nAnd even that is not considering that the difference between 80K gold and 100K gold isn&amp;#39;t 25% more items. It&amp;#39;s 0% more items, because players are full.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the point here is that advantage of a winning team shrinks if you trade kills. It shrinks because&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) They give more gold than you&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) The lead shrinks every time you trade kills.
