I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to pick up A&amp;#39;Sol since his release but the few times I&amp;#39;ve tried him I just couldn&amp;#39;t seem to put out much damage. Maybe it&amp;#39;s my anivia tendencies making me think I should be doing more but A&amp;#39;Sol seems to be everything I currently want in a midlaner. He&amp;#39;s a good roamer, has good waveclear and pushing power, and can zone really well in team fights which is basically the reasons I picked up ice bird to start with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my question is, what can I do to really get the most output from A&amp;#39;Sol and what tactics do you think might carry over from anivia if any? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dg4gsfy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491955506.0, "created_utc": 1491926706.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qpsq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qpsq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qpsq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5b5pc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Eric91", "parent_id": "t1_dg4oahb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "People prefer to mash buttons.
