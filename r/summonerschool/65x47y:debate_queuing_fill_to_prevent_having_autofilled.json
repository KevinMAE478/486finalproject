Several players cycle between 3 or 4 roles regularly\n\n* You are assuming that they will play the champions they have success when playing. This is very much often not the case in lower gold. Players sometimes just play a champion because they \"feel like it\" this game. \n\n* You assume that your skills will develop adequately enough that you will not be punished at the other roles or that you will be good enought o at the minimum avoid playing poorly.\n\nAs you climb, you will find that you will be more severely punished by players that main the role. I only play two roles, but I know that I can play the other roles OK, but well below my current rank. For example, I would simply be outclassed by an ADC main or a Jungle main if I queued as that role because I am not nearly good in those roles as I am at others. \n\nI don't think this is fast way to climb because other players are specializing, and you are are not.
