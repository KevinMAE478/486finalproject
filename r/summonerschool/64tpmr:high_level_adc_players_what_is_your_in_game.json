If they decide to run, don't try and chase them unless the remainder is an Enchanter support of some sort who really needs a partner to be effective. An Enchanter without a teammate to support can't really do much. Instead, shoot whoever else is still threatening and in range.\n * You're usually the best objective destroyer in your team.

She can abuse Draven more in the laning phase due to her range advantage, can cancel excended trades with her net and trap Draven when he tries to all-in. Draven has a stronger 1-2 items spike but usually a good Caitlyn is ahead to him at this point already, and she can do more in teamfights, especially in the late game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ezreal&lt;/strong&gt; is decent matchup but from first back until he gets iceborn (yes he must build iceborn over triforce in this matchup for the slows) but the part between is rough, he can all-in Draven in the early game and after finishing iceborn and win them but they can only hug turret between the 2 states and Draven might be able to dive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess the other adc-s shouldn&amp;#39;t win the laning phase unless their support is good pick and plays the matchup well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good support picks into Draven:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Braum, Lulu&lt;/strong&gt; S tier, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leona, Zyra, Nautilus&lt;/strong&gt; A tier, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand, Nami, Zilean&lt;/strong&gt; (if played properly only) B tier&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blitzcrank might work as he can punish overextending with grabbing under turret but if you lose lane he won&amp;#39;t be able to do much and Draven might even say thank you for grabbing him closer to his target.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything else can be outplayed easily if they don&amp;#39;t have a good combo and synergy with the AD. If you have troubles playing against Draven and you already locked in some Jinx-Sona botlane you should consider dodging the game I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dg5u3nv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492031551.0, "created_utc": 1492002751.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5pv6g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MoredhelEUW", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ooof", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hello mate ;\n\nI'm a main ADC as well ; and whatever champion I'm getting my hand on - I'm getting destroyed by OTP Draven.\n\nIt came to a point that I already know in champ select that if there is a Draven in ennemy team ; I'm going to feed in lane &amp; lose the game.\n\nSince most Draven I came accross were high mastery-point / near OTP ; they were doing really well with him.\n\n\nMy question is : How the fuck am I suppose to play against him ?\n\nI don't even know how to play him ; the only few times I've picked him in normal blind - (and this is a true story) I've ran into high-mastery Draven in ennemy team and get destroyed.\n\nDo you have tips on laning against Draven ?
