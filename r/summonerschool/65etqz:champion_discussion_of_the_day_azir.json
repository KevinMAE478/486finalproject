automatically start with W then take Q level 2 then max Q&amp;gt;W&amp;gt;E&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What are his spikes in terms of items or levels?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nashor&amp;#39;s rylaid and 3rd item is his items spike then he spikes extremely hard at level 13 when his W is maxed out that&amp;#39;s when his massive dps level starts&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What are the most optimal rune/mastery setups?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;there is 2 sets of runes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1- the attack speed one and you want to take Berserker&amp;#39;s greaves with this build\n9xattack speed marks,9xscaling hp seals or armor seals if against AD, 6xscaling cdr and 3x mr glyphs and AP quints&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2- magic pen one and you want to take sorc shoes with this one&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;basically swap the AS marks with M.pen marks &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;masteries are 18/12/0 sorcery is always better don&amp;#39;t take the attack speed mastery &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What champions does he synergize well with?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He works with every thing pretty much but a strong frontline and alot of shields will make him super strong (Lulu gives him attack speed and he just destroys every thing)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What is the counterplay against him?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a strong early game that snowballs the game hard before he reached lategame .. or just a ton of engage to kill him before if you don&amp;#39;t he will win the game alone &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dg9x0qx",
