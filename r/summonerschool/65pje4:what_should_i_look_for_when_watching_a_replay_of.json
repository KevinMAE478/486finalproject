This is a big one overall, a large part of your success in Jungle is going to come down to how well you tracked the enemy jungler and made appropriate decisions as a result, whether by counterganking, ganking the opposite lane (top if bot, bot if top), or by invading to set up vision/steal camps. \n\nAlso pay attention to how much \"dead time\" you spent. This is time not farming, moving to another camp, or actively ganking. This is an area where you can trim a lot of fat; shaving even a second or two per camp or routing such that you get that one extra camp between ganks will make a huge difference in your overall performance in such a roam-heavy role. Time spent waiting in a bush, changing your mind on a decision, etc are areas you can always improve upon. Jungle as a role has tons of room for optimization that rarely applies to other positions simply because of how important your pathing and clear speeds can be. \n\nWhere possible, try to remember what your mindset was at any given time that you were doing something, and then ask yourself \"did that make sense given what I knew about the game at that point?\" In the heat of the moment you might not notice that the lane you ganked for had no mana, or that you had no vision on the mid and jungler while you were invading to try to steal Blue Buff. Watching the replay can really make it more obvious for you that there was information you had that you didn't use. Even in situations where you didn't have direct vision of something, you can ask yourself \"could I have reasonably assumed this behavior?\" Using the Blue Buff example again, it's a safe assumption if the enemy Mid goes into Fog and if their Blue Buff has recently spawned that the enemy Jungler might be giving it to them.

Pay attention to where the enemy jungler is up to 10-15 seconds before your ganks. Did you have vision of them or otherwise know where they were? Were you being reactive or proactive?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watch the enemy Jungler&amp;#39;s pathing and ask yourself how much of that you knew or guessed while in-game. This is a big one overall, a large part of your success in Jungle is going to come down to how well you tracked the enemy jungler and made appropriate decisions as a result, whether by counterganking, ganking the opposite lane (top if bot, bot if top), or by invading to set up vision/steal camps. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also pay attention to how much &amp;quot;dead time&amp;quot; you spent. This is time not farming, moving to another camp, or actively ganking. This is an area where you can trim a lot of fat; shaving even a second or two per camp or routing such that you get that one extra camp between ganks will make a huge difference in your overall performance in such a roam-heavy role. Time spent waiting in a bush, changing your mind on a decision, etc are areas you can always improve upon. Jungle as a role has tons of room for optimization that rarely applies to other positions simply because of how important your pathing and clear speeds can be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where possible, try to remember what your mindset was at any given time that you were doing something, and then ask yourself &amp;quot;did that make sense given what I knew about the game at that point?&amp;quot; In the heat of the moment you might not notice that the lane you ganked for had no mana, or that you had no vision on the mid and jungler while you were invading to try to steal Blue Buff. Watching the replay can really make it more obvious for you that there was information you had that you didn&amp;#39;t use. Even in situations where you didn&amp;#39;t have direct vision of something, you can ask yourself &amp;quot;could I have reasonably assumed this behavior?&amp;quot; Using the Blue Buff example again, it&amp;#39;s a safe assumption if the enemy Mid goes into Fog and if their Blue Buff has recently spawned that the enemy Jungler might be giving it to them. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dgcstlf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492416453.0, "created_utc": 1492387653.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pje4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgceokp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AniviaMidOnly", "parent_id": "t3_65pje4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Watching your own replays is not that effective, better to find a friend or someone else to watch it and tell u what they think", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching your own replays is not that effective, better to find a friend or someone else to watch it and tell u what they think&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dgceokp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492397676.0, "created_utc": 1492368876.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pje4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcrxuk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "The420Conspiracy", "parent_id": "t3_65pje4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "People say don't watch your own Vods because you can't tell what you did wrong.
