From what every high elo/pro player says, stick to one role as much as possible and limit your champion pool to as small as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, your best bet to learn pathing is to main jungle so you can see the wide variety of starts other jungler do. The best thing a jungler can do is either mimic and counter gank  or start opposite so you can invade, this depends on your team comp/lane presssure/type of jungler you are. I just think jungle is too much to learn as a 2nd role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dgcyr8j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492424425.0, "created_utc": 1492395625.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rasq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd7ook", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NicNash08", "parent_id": "t3_65rasq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Valkrin explains a lot of what he does \n\n[http://legendwatch.tv/player/valkrin/videos](http://legendwatch.tv/player/valkrin/videos)\n\nOr simply lookup your champs that you jungle with.\n\n[http://legendwatch.tv/champion/LeeSin/videos](http://legendwatch.tv/champion/LeeSin/videos)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valkrin explains a lot of what he does &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://legendwatch.tv/player/valkrin/videos\"&gt;http://legendwatch.tv/player/valkrin/videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or simply lookup your champs that you jungle with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://legendwatch.tv/champion/LeeSin/videos\"&gt;http://legendwatch.tv/champion/LeeSin/videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dgd7ook", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492439781.0, "created_utc": 1492410981.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rasq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgda03g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "VKEwoholini", "parent_id": "t3_65rasq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I mean a failsafe way is to just watch korean junglers and question why they went where they did, till you figure it out and then you will start applying it to your pathing.
