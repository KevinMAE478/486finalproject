Since, outside of his ult, Sion doesn&amp;#39;t exactly have much of a shot at winning the blue ribbon in mobility or reliable, low CD CC it&amp;#39;s often better to get a damage item that also makes him more mobile/stickier so he can actually do damage instead of something that only synergizes with his passive (especially considering he has no incentive to build AS and can&amp;#39;t even auto if he happens to use 3/4, Q being the most notable/detrimental by far of his abilities for the duration of their cast time). Usually something like Iceborn (as a &amp;quot;quasi-damage&amp;quot; item with the damaging sheen proc slow field and hefty 20% CDR that adds damage in a more subtle, indirect way by being able to use abilities more often along with more frequent CC) or even sometimes something like Mallet or Triforce if you&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dgbitx9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492336986.0, "created_utc": 1492308186.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lkhy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbrq45", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dukwdriver", "parent_id": "t1_dgbghvs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Might get it top lane if you can get away without the armor of sunfire cape but still want to split and push alot of waves.
