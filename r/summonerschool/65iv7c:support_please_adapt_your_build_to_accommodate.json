A couple of scenarios where Redemption would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be the best first item to buy would include:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enemy jungler is constantly camping your team along with the enemy mid laner; you need to rush Sightstone if you haven&amp;#39;t already.  Upgrading boots will also help to reduce their chance of catching you in a bad position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are playing a support with strong kill potential e.g. Thresh or Blitzcrank, and you are dominating your lane. Instead of getting a more support-oriented item such as Redemption, rushing Mobility Boots will capitalize on your current kill presence and help you zone the enemy bot lane into a more favorable position and/or help you roam/rotate to secure kills at mid lane. If you are a more heal-oriented support such as Nami, Sona or Soraka, consider rushing Ardent Censer or even Zeke&amp;#39;s Harbringer over Redemption. Ardent Censer will help capitalize on your ADC&amp;#39;s already good damage but Redemption does not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enemy team has an immense amount of CC and your ADC is immobile and/or bad at dodging skill shots/positioning themselves as to avoid getting hit by skill shots. At this point it may be worthwhile to consider to rush a Mikael&amp;#39;s Crucible to help them not being caught out by CC. Mikael&amp;#39;s Crucible is an item that also seems to be currently extremely under-appreciated as a support item in this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mid laner lost badly to the enemy APC and/or the enemy team has a great amount of AP damage at their disposal; at this point it is necessary for your first finished item to be a Locket of the Iron Solari. Similarly, if the enemy has a strong AD carry (not necessarily the marksman), getting Frozen Heart will greatly enhance your team&amp;#39;s survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An honorable mention&lt;/strong&gt; goes to Iceborn Gauntlet and Rylai&amp;#39;s Crystal Scepter that have a niche place as additional CC on champions that either have weak natural CC or have great AA presence e.g. Sona, Blitzcrank or Brand. I would also argue that Rylai&amp;#39;s is a core item no matter what your support build is on Brand and Zyra. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An item that I think &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; support should include in their build outside of the core first buy item is Sightstone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are dominating your lane and your team is winning, you do not need to rush more support-oriented items. It is easy to overlook the power of map control vision brings you and to think that it is sufficient to keep dominating your lane, but in order to win the game, you need to sooner or later extend your lane presence control to the rest of the map. The best way to do that is to provide vision to your team and to deny the enemy from vision. Upgrade your trinket as soon as you can; you do not need to have Sightstone before you upgrade into the Sweeping Lens. You should also consider to always try to have space and gold for at least one Control Ward every time you  return to base. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when you are behind, it is crucial to retain vision in order to retain map and objective control so you can capitalize on what the enemy is doing in order to gain a more advantageous position in the game. If you do not know that the enemy ADC is alone trying to steal your red in your jungle while the enemy bot and mid lane are defending at their t2 towers, you just missed out on a kill or the burn of a flash that can later result in a kill; or, in a different situation, you may not know that your bot lane that is currently defending at their tower will be dove on by the jungler and enemy top laner so the enemy can secure a dragon kill. Sometimes increased vision cannot prevent you from getting killed from a bad play or positioning, but it can help you react more immediately to an enemy threat and in the very least, try to go even e.g. pushing a tower while the enemy is doing dragon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t always rush Redemption as it&amp;#39;s not always the first best item for your team, always buy Sightstone, buy Control Wards, always sweep for enemy wards whenever possible and upgrade as soon as possible in order to retain map control.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit: formatting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I have been in several games now in high gold/low platinum and I keep seeing people who end up in a support role but build the same build every time i.e. they rush Redemption as first item no matter how it's going for your team.
