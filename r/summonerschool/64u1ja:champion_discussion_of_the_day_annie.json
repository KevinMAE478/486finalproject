Your team should want to fight every time you have Tibbers up.\n\n&gt; What are the core items to be built on her?\n\nAnnie is someone you want to build lots of AP/Mpen on. Core is probably Ludens/void staff/rabadons/Morello are probably the most common items built on her, but you will build either an abyssal, ROA or zhonya's pretty often (matchup dependent).\n\n&gt; What is the order of leveling up her skills?\n\nR&gt;Q&gt;W&gt;E Every time but I recommend starting W at level one if you feel that your team will need that AOE stun.\n\n&gt; What are the most optimal rune/mastery setups?\n\nYou want Mpen and Ability power runes. Your blues and yellows are personal preference but typically you want to go defensive. A typical page will be like 9 Mpen reds, 9 Sc. Health yellows, MR blues, AP quints. Masteries will either be 12/18 or 0/18/12, but TLD is ran 9/10 times. I prefer 0/18/12 because *Insight* from the resolve tree reduces the cooldown on your flash (If you didn't know, Annie's signature move is her Flash+R. It's basically her Stone Cold Stunner)\n\n&gt; What champions does she synergize well with?\n\nBecause of her ult, you can pick her into almost any team comp because she is simple and can one-shot people from level 6 onward. She can roam, she can pick, wombo-combo, counter-engage, you name it. Basically there isn't a champ she doesn't synergize well with.\n\n&gt; What is the counterplay against her?\n\nVery squishy champ. Her E provides 16% damage reduction, which can be the difference between life/death to an all in. Her E lasts 3 seconds and has a 10 second cooldown, so you can either bait out her E and wait or you can CC her when she uses E and wait to finish the all in. You can see when her stun is up, so you have to play around that. She's also relatively unthreatening pre-6. If a champion can outclear or outpoke her, she'll have a rough laning phase. Assassins should look to all in her/gank when her stun is down. If you can out shove her then you keep her from being a problem for the rest of your team, but tis only a matter of time before grouping starts and she becomes annoying.\n\nTLDR for counterplay: Take advantage of a weak pre-6, keep her from roaming if you can, all-in when her stun is down.\n\nEDIT: Someone took issue with me calling annie very squishy because she has a damage reduction ability.

Also has a lot of pick potential.\n\n&gt;What are the core items to be built on her?\n\nAs I said, it changes with playstyle. \"Annie Bot\"'s (challenger Annie player) build is quite different from most players', as they usually respect Annie's range and don't let him walk up to them, nor do they clump up.

I would suggest first starting out on RoA build though. Always build Deathcap and Voidstaff at some point in the build though, as you have extreme AP ratios, and void staff is... void staff. You need void staff.\n\n&gt;What is the order of leveling up her skills?\n\nStart Q -&gt; W -&gt; E and max Q -&gt; W -&gt; E.\n\nQ gives more DPS as its on a lower cooldown, its targeted, and you usually farm + stack your passive with it. W has too high of a mana cost. E is practically useless for leveling as you are a burst mage.

Not having skillshots might be easier on paper, but the short range is a far bigger drawback than having to aim your shots, and click shots actually often can result in you moving to a place you didn't want to or to cancel a shot you wanted to place on the first place just to avoid moving.

I would recommend as everybody else to start with her, but there's a reason why no one plays Annie mid outside of lower leagues, as the more recent mid champions are more efficient, and have a far higher snowball potential.\n\nMy newbie view on her, however:\n\n\nPros: \n1) It's easy to farm with her. You can safely spam her Q to farm without incurring in mana problems, and her passive teaches you to stay aware of your status and ask you things such as: should I keep my stun up now, or reset it to abuse Q on minions more? Can I go in trade position now for when the next minion will get hit? Will I be able to effectively trade now, or should I wait for the stun? Actually, the fact that you have an ability that allows you to get those last hits so easily is somewhat of a problem, as moving to another champ that relies mostly on AA to farm will be hard, but hey, by then you will be a better player, right?\n\n2) Her level 6 power spike is insane. You can easily one shot ppl from lvl 6 to late levels consistently by stunning and spamming your 3 abilities + ignite. Against most champions she doesn't have problems in getting to lvl 6 and then consistently get her a first kill in lane.\n\n3) Tibbers is always a great distraction to low level players and it has a great AOE stun potential. It can also help you tank towers, even if Annie is not what I'd call a great pusher at all. It also teaches you a lot about how much different can be your style of play when your ult is up compared to when the ult is down.\n\n\nCons:\n1) Your stun is unreliable and depends on your AA. That means you won't necessarily have it ready if you're caught off guard, and that means a decent opponent will play accordingly, avoiding your stun altogether and waiting for you to spend it to farm.\n\n2) You're slow. No, slower than that. SLOW. Some MID heroes can abuse that and just land skill shot after skill shot. Expecially the ones with long range (see below).\n\n3) Your range is absymal, and you AA animation is so slow that basically Annie feels and moves more like a melee hero when not using Q to farm. Against long range heroes, you WILL suffer. Some of them can truly abuse you to no end (I think the worst matchup I had with her is Xerath, long range, and high damage, high speed skillshots).\n\n4) You will fall off the curve by endgame. I think this is where you will have more problems with the champion. After lvl 13-14, your damage falls off (expecially if the opponents has got any clue and bought some MR) and while you will still able to land a kill here and there, your role will become that of the AOE stunner when tibbers is up. And this ties to bullet 5, namely...\n\n5) It's hard to make thing happens with Annie by herself. She's great at ganking, but she can't consistently snowball as many other mid champions. And while you can have an easy kill mid, if nobody comes to help you push, her pushing abilities are limited, and you won't easily get that tower by yourself. In addition to that your speed will limit your farm while you roam more than other champs (i.e. you will lose more last hits), so you will feel the effect of a failed gank more. By end game, you will be mostly engaging, doing an initial damage and then relying on your team to kill ppl following that initial stun. \n\n\nMy 2 cents, obv.

And while you can have an easy kill mid, if nobody comes to help you push, her pushing abilities are limited, and you won&amp;#39;t easily get that tower by yourself. In addition to that your speed will limit your farm while you roam more than other champs (i.e. you will lose more last hits), so you will feel the effect of a failed gank more. By end game, you will be mostly engaging, doing an initial damage and then relying on your team to kill ppl following that initial stun. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My 2 cents, obv. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dg5sc2x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492028661.0, "created_utc": 1491999861.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9x3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64u1ja", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg53upr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Youbestnotmisss", "parent_id": "t3_64u1ja", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/summonerschool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;What role does she play in a team composition?\n\nBurst champ. One of the best initiations from midlane. Extremely good gank setup, particularly if enemy does not take cleanse. Team utility via tibbers for tanking dragon/baron/towers. Strong midgame roamer provided she has some lane priority. Goal is primarily to 1 shot at least 1 of enemy carries but can function as a more kite oriented champ if needed due to her semi spammable CC in a CDR build. \n\n&gt;What are the core items to be built on her?\n\nTons of variants. Aside from standard RoA/Dcap that will be in all builds you see one of either sorcs/CDR boots or even Mobis. Depends on your goal for the game. \n\nOther than that items can include RoA, Morellos, Ludens, Rylais, Liandrys, Abyssal, Zhonyas, even protobelt. She has a fairly unique playstyle in a way that doesn't fit into cookie cutter builds.\n\n&gt;What is the order of leveling up her skills?\n\nRQWE for midlane. Support can max W first for better AoE\n\n&gt;What are her spikes in terms of items or levels?\n\nLevel 2 she can win trades hard with stun. Level 6 of course. Overall I think she has a fairly linear set of powerspikes, she spikes with notable levels (ranks in Q, ult) and with major item purchases. \n\n&gt;What are the most optimal rune/mastery setups?\n\nKeystone can be either DFT or Tlords. DFT better lane trading because Q applies it in full, and a bit more teamfight damage. Thunderlords more threatening burst and therefore better for all ins and roams. Tlords by far most popular, but Deathfire technically has better winrate (noise in the data for sure though)\n\nRunes... Mpen reds, scaling health yellows as standard. Blues can be any of flat AP, flat/scaling CDR, or flat/scaling MR. Depends on lane matchup/intended rest of build. No Morellos builds can end up low CDR which can favour CDR blues, but you could opt for better laning with MR or flat AP. \n\nQuints are either flat AP or MS. I think MS are stronger generally if not vs a lane you can bully (mostly meaning melees)\n\n&gt;What champions does she synergize well with?\n\nShe works well with champs that offer ranged waveclear so that they can provide that in siege scenarios so she doesn't have to burn mana that she might not have and doesn't need to waste stun charge. Also works well with champs that can follow up on her initiation with CC/burst of their own, ideally from fairly long range. High early pressure/strong tower dive junglers make her extremely effective at snowballing midlane to unlock her roaming.\n\n&gt;What is the counterplay against her?\n\nMR, QSS. Take cleanse in lane if they have decent ganking from jg. If she can't 1 rotation you or 1 rotation + Q you she's generally not great. Flat or Scaling MR runes to survive her 6. Her biggest issue is no mobility and poor range (as far as mages go). Big frontlines just soak her burst and deny her access to carries. Strong shoving champs can outpush her easily since she maxes a single target skill and can keep her stuck in lane. \n\nHer CC is conditional and that can be exploited at times in lane. Annies like to use Q to last hit so that limits how long they can hold stun. If you can bait out her stun in a trade she becomes very easy to gank even with E damage reduction.
