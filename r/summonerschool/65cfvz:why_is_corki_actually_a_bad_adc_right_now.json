He builds ad, but most of his damage is magic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He isn&amp;#39;t a AA  based adc but he needs AAs to maximise damage in his combos, which all have varying ranges. Compared to say lucian, where is QWE all have similar ranges and feels smooth to pull off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His hybrid builds are above average at best compared to kayle, xz and jax because he can&amp;#39;t utilise the stats as well, xz and kayle heals more by attacking faster with AAs, jax just beats the shit out of everyone while spellvamping from single target Qs, Ws, and empowered AAs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a personal problem I can&amp;#39;t stand facing one direction to use his E. AA and moving back after each hit is too big of a habit to use on him. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "summonerschool", "name": "t1_dg9saja", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492234245.0, "created_utc": 1492205445.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
