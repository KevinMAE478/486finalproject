And you have no answer for his sustain and allin, pre-6.)\n\n* Darius (People think Darius beats Rene, but it's not really true. Rene has better sustain, mobility and a quick damage stun. Plus at 6, his ult will lower the damage from Darius's)\n\n* Teemo (Teemo will almost always build AP and Rene loves AP champs, makes it easy to rush Visage and afk sustain with Q. Onhit Teemo *might* work. Otherwise Rene just jumps, Q+W and destroys Teeto)\n\n* Nasus (Bad bad bad idea to go in on a Rene as Nasus. So much Q+W+E harass if he tries to Wither him and both ults will pile on damage. Nasus doesn't do well vs lane bullies keeping him from farm)\n\n\n**DO PICK INTO RENEKTON**:\n\n* Singed (Singed is extremely obnoxious and he doesn't *need* to stay in lane to farm. Yeah you might get free farm but he'll proxy or just get you to chase him around while he baits for jungle. Singed players have stopped being stupid regarding how to proxy and learned.)\n\n* Kled (Nonstop harass via W hp% and Q, his passive can dump on your all in and he's too cranky!)\n\n* Maokai (Screw this champ, gets hyper tanky unless you can get a tent city pitched top lane with your jg and mid)\n\n**MAYBE PICK IF YOU ARE VERY GOOD AT THE CHAMP**:\n\n* Jax (I'm seeing differing opinions on this. Renekton used to be a prime counterpick to Jax and I suspect that's still true, afaik Renekton's W ignores Jax's E which was one of the main points. With Bork meta, this may've changed.)\n\n* Garen (This is one I classically call the Two Fold Counterpick. 1) The Garen has to be very good at him. 2) The Renekton has to not know what a Garen *does*. The former is quite possible, the latter not so much anymore.)\n\n* Tryndamere (Okay this is a weird matchup. You're gonna get destroyed pre-6 if the Renekton isn't brain damaged. But after 6 + you can stay in lane forever forcing him to stay or give up towers and inhib. This is like Nasus, only infinitely more frustrating. If you get some lucky crits early on, Renekton can get wrecked and lose his advantage. Bring ignite, he probably will bring it too.)\n\nBear in mind I'm currently in silver (Need to go fix my flair again it seems..) but I'm usually in the gold range, highest I've gotten is gold 3. I've gotten level 7 mastery on him and have about 500-750 games of Renekton over the years, not reflected properly in the champion masteries.\n\nSo take it as you will.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Played a LOT of Renekton over the last few months, this is my take on it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO NOT PICK INTO RENEKTON&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poppy (Rene will be on top of you and it&amp;#39;ll be too late for you to pop your W, and he doesn&amp;#39;t need BC to shred your armor + he builds it &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt;. And you have no answer for his sustain and allin, pre-6.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darius (People think Darius beats Rene, but it&amp;#39;s not really true. Rene has better sustain, mobility and a quick damage stun. Plus at 6, his ult will lower the damage from Darius&amp;#39;s)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teemo (Teemo will almost always build AP and Rene loves AP champs, makes it easy to rush Visage and afk sustain with Q. Onhit Teemo &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; work. Otherwise Rene just jumps, Q+W and destroys Teeto)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasus (Bad bad bad idea to go in on a Rene as Nasus. So much Q+W+E harass if he tries to Wither him and both ults will pile on damage. Nasus doesn&amp;#39;t do well vs lane bullies keeping him from farm)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO PICK INTO RENEKTON&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singed (Singed is extremely obnoxious and he doesn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to stay in lane to farm. Yeah you might get free farm but he&amp;#39;ll proxy or just get you to chase him around while he baits for jungle. Singed players have stopped being stupid regarding how to proxy and learned.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kled (Nonstop harass via W hp% and Q, his passive can dump on your all in and he&amp;#39;s too cranky!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maokai (Screw this champ, gets hyper tanky unless you can get a tent city pitched top lane with your jg and mid)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAYBE PICK IF YOU ARE VERY GOOD AT THE CHAMP&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jax (I&amp;#39;m seeing differing opinions on this. Renekton used to be a prime counterpick to Jax and I suspect that&amp;#39;s still true, afaik Renekton&amp;#39;s W ignores Jax&amp;#39;s E which was one of the main points. With Bork meta, this may&amp;#39;ve changed.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garen (This is one I classically call the Two Fold Counterpick. 1) The Garen has to be very good at him. 2) The Renekton has to not know what a Garen &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;. The former is quite possible, the latter not so much anymore.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tryndamere (Okay this is a weird matchup. You&amp;#39;re gonna get destroyed pre-6 if the Renekton isn&amp;#39;t brain damaged. But after 6 + you can stay in lane forever forcing him to stay or give up towers and inhib. This is like Nasus, only infinitely more frustrating. If you get some lucky crits early on, Renekton can get wrecked and lose his advantage. Bring ignite, he probably will bring it too.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind I&amp;#39;m currently in silver (Need to go fix my flair again it seems..) but I&amp;#39;m usually in the gold range, highest I&amp;#39;ve gotten is gold 3.
