Early on your goal is to farm efficiently. But if a laner is gankable then do it.\n\nThis means that you need to be super aware of what is going on.

I had a lot of wave knowledge and matchup knowledge that I could see when a gank is going to be high or low probability of being successful. That might mean knowing when a minion wave will push back in my favor to gank, or if the enemy is going to go for an all in, etc. This knowledge obviously doesn't come overnight, but to be a great jungler you need to know a lot about laning as well. I'm not saying abandon jungling as a main, but also concentrate on learning the game as a whole as well. \n\nAlso as for Graves, he is excellent at farming and counter jungling. He is also great at killing people especially since he doesn't get low hp in jungle. Also he is excellent at taking towers. So let's say u have a good counter gank and you have red and u kill the enemy laner. Just take the tower, especially if it's like level 6 and beyond\n\nThis video is an example on how I mess up early and give up a double kill on the enemy jungler.
