Those are situational items on most mages. Abyssal for shorter range/melee mages and/or when you need MR. Zonjas is a counter to champs like Zed and when the enemy team has high AD and just want armor with damage, and/or when your kit relies on the invulnerability to make better plays (like TF, Fizz, Kassadin).

Then top it off with Deathcap and for the very last item probably Zhonyas or Rylais. Simply because Zonjas always gives some nice general outplay potential while Rylais can be good for kiting and chasedowns - but neither are must-have early items for Ori.\n\nThough I can't imagine the game going to 6 items when the enemy team is full squishy that builds no MR.

Sorcs + Liandries basically removes all their base MR, so you&amp;#39;ll be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what do you mean you don&amp;#39;t like Ludens? It&amp;#39;s great on Ori and on most mages. The movement speed is godly for better positioning, chase down and escapes, and the added burst synergizes well with most mages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually wouldn&amp;#39;t build Abyssal or Zhonyas as early core though. Those are situational items on most mages. Abyssal for shorter range/melee mages and/or when you need MR. Zonjas is a counter to champs like Zed and when the enemy team has high AD and just want armor with damage, and/or when your kit relies on the invulnerability to make better plays (like TF, Fizz, Kassadin). But if the enemy is running mixed damage and they don&amp;#39;t really have anything that needs Zonjas to outplay, I see no point for getting either early on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the enemy isn&amp;#39;t building MR, I&amp;#39;d probably go Morello&amp;#39;s, Sorc boots, then Liandries and Ludens (order depends on what I&amp;#39;d be up against). Then top it off with Deathcap and for the very last item probably Zhonyas or Rylais. Simply because Zonjas always gives some nice general outplay potential while Rylais can be good for kiting and chasedowns - but neither are must-have early items for Ori.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though I can&amp;#39;t imagine the game going to 6 items when the enemy team is full squishy that builds no MR.
