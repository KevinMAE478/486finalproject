To give some context to my story I work at a pet store, and we have a rewards card system like most places do. Well once in a while the company blasts out an email to all the rewards card members saying they have a 5 dollar off coupon for there next purchase. Only if you read the fine print it actually says you will receive a 5 dollar off coupon when you make your next purchase AND this coupon is only good for a 25$ purchase or more from X date until X date. obviously customers got confused by this and although it seems by now most customers are familiar with the way this email is formatted, the first time we had this deal going on EVERY customer was handing me their phone and saying they had a 5 dollar off coupon and i had to go and explain to them that the email was actually for a coupon they would receive that day for making a purchase. id hand them the coupon, apologize for the way the email was formatted, and most people would understand that it was out of my power to do anything and it wasnt my fault the email was sent out the way it was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;queue in angry lady (AL) who comes into my line (me) I ring her stuff up and ask her the usual questions being polite with a smile as usual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;AL: Oh ive also got a 5 dollar off coupon as well.\nME: Ok, could i see it then please?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the back of my head I already know what this is going to be for.
