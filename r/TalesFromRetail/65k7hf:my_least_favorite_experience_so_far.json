I&amp;#39;ve been working in the Electronics Department for a month and some change. (I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to post this sooner, but I never got around to it) I got in around 1-2pm, and shortly after that, my other coworker who was there went on her lunch. So it was just me and the Mobile Department worker. Pretty soon it gets packed. I have people all around needing things unlocked and phones going off. By then there were about 3 people needing to cash out, two of them needed 2 games to be unlocked, and one customer who needed a TV from the back. Whenever she wasn&amp;#39;t busy, the Mobile person would help cash people out to lessen the crowd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;re busy, and this guy walks up to the desk with a box of Beats headphones. I know it&amp;#39;s going to be retuen/swap related since we have them locked up. I had about 5 people needing assistance at the desk and 3 calls on the phone backed up. He (C) calls my (A) attention. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: I didn&amp;#39;t see any of these on the shelf. Do you know if you have any of these left in stock or in the back? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: (Literally takes a second to check, no biggie) The system is saying we&amp;#39;re all out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Can you check if another store has it in? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: (Mind you this is the day after Christmas and Beats were a pretty big item then. Still, only takes 1 seconds to check) uh, it says this other store may have two in stock. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Can you call that store and see if they have it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I still had a lot of people around my desk that were there for a bit, not to mention the 3 calls to my department backed up (the small exchange between him and I was only 30-40 seconds, not too long. But I didn&amp;#39;t want to keep the other people waiting much longer, especially since they were already there first.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: I&amp;#39;m a bit busy at the moment. The customers in line have been waiting for a bit, and I have a few calls backed up on my end. Unfortunately, I won&amp;#39;t be able to call as of right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: What do you mean you can&amp;#39;t call? Why can&amp;#39;t you? (he then mumbles under his breath) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Sir I&amp;#39;m just busy is all. People have been waiting in line, and I have a few calls waiting on my end. If you want me to call I can in a few when I finish those calls and other customers. Otherwise I can give you the number to the store if you don&amp;#39;t want to wait. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: (He literally starts yelling) NO I AM NOT GOING TO CALL ANY F*C KING STORE! YOU CAN CALL THEM!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: I can, it will just be a few minutes. Just wait and I call after I&amp;#39;m done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: I PAID FOR THESE WITH MY MONEY! THEY&amp;#39;RE DEFECTIVE! I CAME UP HERE TO GET A NEW PAIR, AND YOU DON&amp;#39;T HAVE ANY! SO HELL NO, I&amp;#39;M NOT CALLING ANYMORE STORES! YOU CALL THEM! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(By that time, a lot of the customers were staring at him and I) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Alright. Just give me a few minutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By then, I had no clue, but I guess some other coworkers helped me out with the calls, so when I got on one of the lines, it was for a whole different department. I still helped anyways, seeing that I wanted to stretch out the time for the guy waiting. After getting all the other customers request done with, it was probably 8 minutes after he first started yelling. I get the item number from him, and call the other store. (Not to mention, the call to the other store took only like half the time he waited for.) Turns out, the store was out of stock all day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: They said they&amp;#39;re out of stock &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Okay (He simply walks away) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking back at it now, I could&amp;#39;ve handled it a lot better since I did make some mistakes. But that whole situation was probably the worst experience I&amp;#39;ve had as of today. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So forgive me if my formatting is weird, it's my first time using mobile, and I'm using one hand to type. \n\nSo this situation happened the day after Christmas.
