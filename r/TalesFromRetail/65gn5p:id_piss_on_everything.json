You had to go outside first and then walk to or from the mall. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had a private washroom but only for employees. People would ask to go to the washroom but we would kindly redirect them to the public washrooms in the mall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a busy day so the place was full of people. All is going well until a woman ask for the washroom to one of my coworkers. She kindly tell her that it is a private washroom and where she can find the public ones in the mall.
