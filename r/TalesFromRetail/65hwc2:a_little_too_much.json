Its still very much a retail store in terms of the things most retail workers have to deal with, but with a few interesting twists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a couple months ago we got a couple of these&lt;a href=\"https://stiguns.com/guns/dvc-limited/\"&gt;bad boys&lt;/a&gt; in. For those of you who don&amp;#39;t know anything about guns, this gun is intended as a competition gun. Its very specialized and mostly meant for guys who shoot competitions a good bit. One of our firearms instructors shoots a lot of competitions and he has been going back and forth about buying one since they came in. Its also about $3000 dollars. In car terms this is a factory built race car, very good at its intended purpose, but a bit limited in what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, customers who walk in the store either know exactly what this gun is (and they drool over it) or they don&amp;#39;t have a single clue and wanna see it because it looks crazy. Probably 80% of our customers have no clue what the gun is, 19% know what it is and can&amp;#39;t afford it, and the other 1% know what it is and can afford it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a customer comes in and asks me a technical question, I help him out and show him some examples of what he can do. He seems like a super nice guy, and as we&amp;#39;re walking by the pistol case he spots this gun and goes silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Him:......is that an STI DVC?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Yep. Wanna fondle it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Him:.......absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I pull it out of the case. He&amp;#39;s asking questions about it and seems very excited. Apparently he&amp;#39;s been looking at one of these for a while, but never found one in person. He&amp;#39;s super into the gun and I&amp;#39;m 99% sure I&amp;#39;m about to make a sale thats going to make me look really good to my bosses. Our price is also a little bit below MSRP and he&amp;#39;s excited about that as well. So he decides that he wants to do it (and I quote &amp;quot;to hell with what my wife thinks I&amp;#39;m gonna do it&amp;quot;), so I ask to see his drivers license. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He whips out a DL from [neighboring state]. Uh-oh. By federal law I&amp;#39;m not allowed to sell a handgun to someone who is not a resident of the state in which we reside. Most places will do a transfer to a gun dealer of his choice in his home state. Normally we have a strict no transfers policy, but due to the rarity of the gun I go talk to my boss to see what we can do. I inform the guy of this and my boss turns out to be cool with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go back out to give this dude the good news. He&amp;#39;s almost vibrating with excitement. I take his FFL&amp;#39;s info (his local gun dealer that its being shipped to), we get a copy of theirs so we can ship it out the next day. He also grabs like 500 rounds of ammo, a $500 pistol red dot site, and a bottle of cleaning lube. All in all his total is pretty close to $4k. He&amp;#39;s ecstatic and shakes my hand and is so thankful for helping him out and being the best guy ever and I&amp;#39;m feeling pretty great. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he walks on out of the store, only to return about a minute later. The following conversation ensued:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Him: [brandishing receipt] WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Uuuuhh....what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Him: DO I LOOK LIKE SOME KIND OF IDIOT TO YOU?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;m sorry sir, what seems to be the problem?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Him: RIGHT HERE!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He pointed to a line on his receipt for a shipping fee. Guns shipped via a private shipping company (Fedex, UPS, DHL, etc) have to be shipped overnight to minimize the chance of their own employees stealing guns. We charge $15.00 to ship a handgun. Its a pretty reasonable fee, and we&amp;#39;ll eat the cost occasionally. I neglected to ask my boss about it, and its added on for transfer sales automatically. 100% my fault, but pretty easily remedied. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;m very sorry about that sir. If you want I can go talk to my boss and get that refunded...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Him: I DON&amp;#39;T WANT A REFUND! THAT IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS, TO HAVE A FEE LIKE THAT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Well sir, typically we don&amp;#39;t do transfers. When we do, we do try to cover our costs. Its not that big of a deal though, I can get it taken off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Him: How dare you not mention the price. Had you said it in the beginning I never would have agreed to this. I want to return all of this. That is a ridiculous fee and I&amp;#39;m never shopping here again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me:.......ok?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He grumbled throughout the entire return, and stormed out to the parking lot. Where he cruised away in his brand new Audi. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I often have to remind myself that I still work retail and that people like this are to be expected. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Another story from the gun store.\n\nFor those who didn't see my [last post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/60ekfo/not_your_average_retail_store/) I work in a gun store.
