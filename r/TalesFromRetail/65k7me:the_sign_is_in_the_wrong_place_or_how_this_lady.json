Like produce. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I walk with the produce manager and he tells me what he needs and what sizes. One of the problems what the squash. Spaghetti and butternut are on sale for same price. But there was a couple other things over there so they had some signs hanging off and it looked like a mess. So he asked that I combine the two to one sign. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I do and put it back out. The problem is that they have butternut squash, then acorn squash, then spaghetti squash all next to eachother. So the one in the middle is not on sale.

It&amp;#39;s spaghetti squash. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: well the sign is in the wrong spot! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;M: okay I&amp;#39;ll fix it right away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I walked away. The sign is in the middle! I could 100% understand if she was mad about the acorn squash since that could be a little confusing but I have no idea what her issue was with this sign. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Also I did check later to see if maybe someone moved it from when I put it up.
