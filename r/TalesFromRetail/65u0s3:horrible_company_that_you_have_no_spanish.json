We try to keep at least a few of them working each shift, even in my office, but due to scheduling sometimes its not possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So on Saturday we are having our sale, it&amp;#39;s busy because we are closed on Easter Sunday (today). Wouldn&amp;#39;t ya know it but the two girls who do speak Spanish in my office both called off, my 3rd one had to leave midshift for a family emergency. I am left all alone working a busy store from about 5pm. Not only am I taking care of my sales staff, their customers, I  am also handling the numerous calls that are coming in from sales calls to people who are calling to see if we were open on Easter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I take a call from a lady who immediately demands to speak to some who can converse in Spanish (she asked this in perfect, slightly accented English, mind you). I apologize to her that I don&amp;#39;t have anyone available right now, that if she gives me a moment, I can check if one of my Spanish speaking sales staff can lend me a hand. I place her on hold and page for a Spanish speaker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are busy so no one comes, of course. I pick up the phone to advise her...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lady: This is ridiculous!! I have been calling all week about a problem and you have no one that speaks Spanish. I&amp;#39;ve asked for a manager to call me back, but no one has. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I apologize for that, but none of my managers even speak Spanish. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lady: Then why do you have your commercials in Spanish on (name of Spanish programming chanel we have here)? That is false advertising!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Because that is a Spanish language chanel. They don&amp;#39;t even put English commercials on that Chanel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soooo... Yes, she has been speaking to me this entire time in English. I finally get her to tell me her problem as there is no way I am pulling a Spanish speaking sales person off the floor on a busy Saturday (sales staff work on commission) for a customer service issue in which it seems she can full well converse in English.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem was with her father&amp;#39;s order. She states again that he&amp;#39;s been calling, demanding a Spanish speaking rep to help him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I help as much as I can, but it seemed odd that this family keeps demanding a Spanish speaking rep, when they all seem to speak English perfectly. To make matters even more interesting, the entire sale was done by my Vietnamese salesperson who knows less Spanish than I do and barely has a handle on English as it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she finally hangs up, still not happy as I really couldn&amp;#39;t help her at that time with her issue (due to the Holiday, the department I would need to contact would be closed until Monday).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not an hour later, a family approaches me at the customer service desk and as soon as they hand me their invoice, I see that it&amp;#39;s the ones who had called earlier.

But I get those customers that have such a heavy accent I can hardly understand them and when I switch they refuse to switch as well, these customers are mostly older. I go back to English but it is a struggle to understand them and sometimes they get the nerve to get upset because I don&amp;#39;t understand what they said. whatever...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do ask before I switch in my second language and it has happen to me were they spoke the language in front of me to another person and yet refused to do the same to me. haha&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TalesFromRetail", "name": "t1_dgdr7hn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492477130.0, "created_utc": 1492448330.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t2zt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65u0s3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t2zt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65u0s3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdsf1r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Raw_Venus", "parent_id": "t1_dgdmybl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TalesFromRetail", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm going to assume that OP knows more about the family emergency then (s)he told us.
