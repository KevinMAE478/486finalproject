One of the old ladies requested I put it in two big bags instead of our normal shopping bags. I happily oblige because who wants that many bags of just bread! The next thing they had was some back scrubber loofas on a stick, which was kind of long and stuck out of the bag. The other old lady ran over to a different register and got a BUNCH of our big bags (we rarely give them out because there&amp;#39;s not much reason to and we only have ~5 at a register). She put the loofas in there because even though it&amp;#39;s easy to grab the handle on the bag, she didn&amp;#39;t like it.

This makes me very uncomfortable because that&amp;#39;s my little amount of personal space I have and she was in it. Every bag I turned around she had to redo. The first lady asked me to bag her tea containers in different bags because she&amp;#39;s had the bottom break before. No big deal, I put one in a bag with some stuff to cushion it and the other the same way in a different bag. This is where it starts to get on my nerves. She pulls each one out of the bag, and triple bags it and wraps them up tight. Think it stops at just two glass tea containers? Nope. She has eight bottles of pasta sauce. By standard practice I put two in each bag, but again that isn&amp;#39;t good enough.

We&amp;#39;re pretty busy and understaffed, and I&amp;#39;ve got a decent line going. So I start going faster and spinning the bagging rack around and around till I can find an empty bag, and each time I bag something they pull it out and do it again, differently. They have loose items stacked on top and I still keep going (I have a scan rate of around 850/hour if I don&amp;#39;t run into crazy problem customers. It ended up being 780 after this incident). They&amp;#39;re now frantically trying to keep up and double and triple bagging things for no reason at all. I finish and they&amp;#39;re still struggling with all the bags and upset and frantic. The lady then decides to pay with EXACT change (it was over a $200 total) and I can tell they were both ticked at me the whole time.
