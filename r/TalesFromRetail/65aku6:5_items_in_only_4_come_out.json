This just happened less than an hour ago and I&amp;#39;m still a bit shaken up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minor background: I work in retail. The place prides itself on customer service. We do 2 minutes fitting room checks, smile and greet everyone, and basically annoy the crap out of people who would rather be left alone. Anyways, on to the story. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m nearing the end of my shift and these two guys come in. My coworker and I both notice how sketchy they seem. They just don&amp;#39;t fit in. He starts a room for one of them, taking the items and holding a fitting room. And I let the other guy into his room after counting the number of items. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: so let&amp;#39;s see, you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 items. And your name? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;L: it&amp;#39;s L. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: well Larry, let me know if you need anything. (Cue the retail smile) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I let Larry have some time in the fitting room, I hover processing things to put back on the floor. And I see him set out of the room, &amp;quot;looking&amp;quot; for other things. I do a quick check to make sure everything is still there. He put 2 jackets on our rolling rack and there&amp;#39;s still 3 things in the room. Still have 5, we&amp;#39;re good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He and his friend continue to dart in and out of their rooms. This next part I only hear about from one of my other coworkers. We&amp;#39;ll call her J.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;J: (knocks on door)\nL: I just need fucking silence.\nJ: how you doing in there? \nL: I just need you to leave me the fuck alone. \nJ: I just need you to get the fuck out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love J, there no way she&amp;#39;d get fired for saying that and she&amp;#39;s just a beast.  But a couple minutes later he leaves the room, seemingly with nothing. I go in and check, there should be 3 items in there. Nope, only 2. Damn it... I let my manager know as well as our security guard. We double check everywhere to try to find the sales tags, nowhere. Well, L sits down on one of our couches. 8:30 rolls around and the security guard locks the doors as we are closed. He wanders over to L and asks to look in his bag. Brown paper bag, nothing in it. He asks to look into the backpack, nope L won&amp;#39;t let the security guard look in there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As this is happening another customer is leaving. J goes to let them out and as she does the alarm starts to go off because she has store keys on here. L sees it as an opportunity and bolts for the door. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happens next was just a big mess. He shoves his way through the door, stepping on J, our security guard tries to restrain him, J is just trying to get out of the way and get out. L tries to blame J saying she&amp;#39;s stealing something, yeah dude she works here. She apparently rips his brown shopping bag at some point but he makes it out of the store. Next thing I remember I hear a loud thump and I see out security guard wrestling L against our window. Then they all take off, including L&amp;#39;s friend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I heard L threw his backpack at his friend and they ran in opposite directions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We weren&amp;#39;t able to recover the jacket he took.
