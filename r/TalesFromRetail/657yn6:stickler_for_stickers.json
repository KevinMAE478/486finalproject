In our clearance section, we put identical stickers on both the box and the shoe to show what the discount for the price is. We have a very specific way of putting these stickers on (i.e. they go in a certain spot on the box and on the shoe) this is kinda important for the story. These stickers though, aren&amp;#39;t the kind that rip when they come off, so it&amp;#39;s possible to remove them, especially from the shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day I was working clearance, and I had a lady stop me to ask a price of the shoe. 100% normal, the stickers don&amp;#39;t have the discounted price, so a lot of people need me to do the math for them (thank god I&amp;#39;m good at math). This shoe, however, had two different stickers on it. I don&amp;#39;t remember the exact amounts, but one sticker (the real one) would have ended up making the shoe cost ~$55 and the wrong one would have made them ~$30. Extra/incorrect stickers end up on shoes or in boxes not infrequently, and usually all it takes is me pointing out the correct one and it&amp;#39;s no longer an issue. And clearly this woman knew something was up since she stopped to ask me which was right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked, and the more expensive sticker was the correct one, which was also the sticker on the box. I explained this to her, and went to remove the wrong sticker. Up until this point, the interaction was the same as any other. But as I&amp;#39;m reaching for the sticker she goes to grab my hand and yells&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait! I want it for that price.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now lucky for me, and for herself, she did not touch me. I&amp;#39;ll put up with all the verbal abuse you can throw at me, but if you lay a finger on me in any way that is not super polite (like tapping my shoulder to get my attention) I will not help you. I explained to her&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, the more expensive one is the correct price, so I need to remove the incorrect one.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went ahead and removed the sticker at this point and tore it up, so she knew she wouldn&amp;#39;t get the price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Her: &amp;quot;Well you can&amp;#39;t give me any discount?! It says the shoes would be [cheaper price]&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;We do have to sell it for the correct price. If we had tagged it incorrectly we would happily honor the lower price. Unfortunately we cannot control what our customers do, so these shoes are [correct price]&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I was 99% sure this customer put the sticker on the shoe herself, as most of these situations are. After I said that line, she kinda sputtered and walked away, confirming my suspicions.
