I&amp;#39;ll get straight to it. I work at a large grocery store chain down south, and I work in customer service as a bagger. This is when I was only a few months in on the job, so I lacked experience on what to do in situations like these. Normally when I deal with customers, I try to always fulfill their needs regardless of the scenario.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we close at 10 PM every night, we lock the doors with intentions so that customers can&amp;#39;t come in after that exact time, and we have to keep serving the customers that are still in the store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well around 10:15 was when I had clocked out, and I was walking out the door. The manager had to stay by the door to unlock it manually for customers/employees still in the store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked maybe 10 feet, and I noticed a car was parked right out front of the door. There was a woman that had walked up to me and made for a very peculiar conversation. \n(Me: Me - Lady: L)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;L: Hi! I&amp;#39;m wondering if you guys have these cookies, they&amp;#39;re round and are chocolate flavored, and they&amp;#39;re called [these] cookies? (I put a placeholder because of her thick Russian accent, and I couldn&amp;#39;t concisely understand her.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Ma&amp;#39;am, I can&amp;#39;t help you, we&amp;#39;re closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mind you, I was a little sick when this was happening, so I was kind of disoriented when she was talking to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;L: (Proceeds to describe the cookies to me another 3 times) Is it possible for you to get your manager for me? He might know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;m sorry, we&amp;#39;re closed there is nothing I can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;L: Okay. If you help me, I will give you this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She pulls out a &lt;strong&gt;$20 bill&lt;/strong&gt; and shoves it in my face. WTF? At this point, I&amp;#39;m so tired and sick, I just take it and start knocking on the entrance door for my manager. He comes up and I ask him about [these] cookies the lady mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Manager: I have never heard of those in my life. (He notices the lady that I was talking to)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Manager: Don&amp;#39;t talk to that lady, she&amp;#39;s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, all of the Customer Service Staff are at the door with him, and they&amp;#39;re all telling me to &lt;strong&gt;RUN&lt;/strong&gt;. I run to my car where my dad was waiting for me. (I was 16 and didn&amp;#39;t have my own car, what to do :/ ) Explaining this to my dad, as I was still holding the $20 bill... Whoops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the 2nd part will make up for me stealing her $20. Fast forward a few months, it&amp;#39;s almost closing time. I was bagging for a customer at around 9:59. The manager hasn&amp;#39;t quite made it to the door yet to lock up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10:00 hits and he still hasn&amp;#39;t come in yet. But guess who comes through the door? Not walking, &lt;strong&gt;running&lt;/strong&gt; through the door, to escape the hands of evil that dare close this store because it&amp;#39;s 10 o&amp;#39;clock and we&amp;#39;re all tired from a long day of work. My cashier looked up, it was as if he was staring at nothing, he was so terrified because she was a casual shopper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lady, of course, takes forever for her shopping. When she &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; comes through to my line, we run into some troubles when she is checking out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cashier: Okay that&amp;#39;s gonna total out to [grand total of her groceries]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t remember exactly what she paid with, whether it being card or cash. But she didn&amp;#39;t have enough money for everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cashier: That&amp;#39;s fine! if you want we can take off the things that you don&amp;#39;t want.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was my cue to grab a basket (Small green baskets for customers that don&amp;#39;t need a cart for shopping.) So I&amp;#39;m holding the basket for her while she picks the items she can&amp;#39;t afford and will put them in the basket. Then I notice something out of order.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw what looked like a branch from some bananas. She was &lt;strong&gt;EATING&lt;/strong&gt; produce while shopping, which may come to a surprise, is stealing. And we can&amp;#39;t charge her because we don&amp;#39;t know how much it cost because it goes by the pound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She also tried getting a refund on an expensive item with a receipt. We ok&amp;#39;d it but she didn&amp;#39;t have the receipt with her, it was in her car. She came back from her car with no receipt. Of course. She also had drank half of a fruit drink, and she had to replace another item with that because she would have to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, the car she drives is a Land Rover. Amazing to me that she can afford such a nice car, but not the other half of her groceries. I guess taking her $20 makes up for her stealing from the store.
