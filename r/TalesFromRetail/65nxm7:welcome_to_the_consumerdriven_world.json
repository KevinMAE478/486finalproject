The store I work at used to carry them, and our larger locations most likely still do, but my store didn&amp;#39;t sell much of the child safety stuff, so of course we stopped carrying it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tonight as I was walking to the stock room, this lady started giving me &lt;em&gt;the stare&lt;/em&gt;. You know, where they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;trying to figure out&amp;quot; if you work there or if you&amp;#39;re just wearing a name tag for fun. So I asked her if she needed any help. She explained to me what she was looking for, and I told her that we used to have them, and if she gave me a second I could just quickly check if we still do. I walk very quickly, and when I know exactly where something would be I don&amp;#39;t waste time waiting for the customer to walk over. I prefer to just do my quick run around the shelf, especially if I know we don&amp;#39;t have it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I was checking, she was explaining to me that it was actually for an elderly man who had been getting into cabinets and drinking cleaning chemicals (obvious dementia/Alzheimers). Of course I felt bad, having had a grandfather and great grandmother who suffered from dementia in the last years of their lives, but we didn&amp;#39;t have the safety stuff anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She started getting upset, and so I offered to walk her over to the aisle in grocery where some baby stuff is kept (I would have called, but it would have taken longer to get the answer that way versus walking the 20 seconds to get to the aisle). We get over there, &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; do all the looking, even though she&amp;#39;s right there, and still nothing. She&amp;#39;s huffing and sighing and saying how &amp;quot;this is just ridiculous&amp;quot; so I call the home department. Nope. Then we have the following short conversation (I am &amp;#39;Me&amp;#39; she is &amp;#39;RL&amp;#39; for &amp;#39;Rude Lady&amp;#39;):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Unfortunately we don&amp;#39;t have anything like that anymore. I&amp;#39;m really sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RL: That is just ridiculous! How can you not have any?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: We probably just didn&amp;#39;t sell many.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RL: Well you should have still kept &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I agree, it is silly, but our buyers-- the people who pick out what we sell-- decided that this location wasn&amp;#39;t selling enough of those items and so they stopped sending them to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RL: That&amp;#39;s just stupid!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to tell her that this is what it means to have a consumer-driven society, and that just because &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; wants an item doesn&amp;#39;t mean a store is going to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, over 30 minutes later, she went over to the home department and complained to their closing manager, whom I had called when helping the lady. He basically said the same things I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then when she did finally get up to a register she was apparently mean and nasty, not only to my coworker, but also to her husband/the man she was with. She was yelling at him (person who was with her) because he was standing in front of the pin pad, or because he was slower than she wanted when it came to putting bags back in the cart. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was awful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Stores don&amp;#39;t carry items that are only bought maybe once every 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Tonight I had a lady in looking for child safety cabinet locks.
