This company did allow customers to refuse purchase of pictures, usually if they didn&amp;#39;t come out right.

I get why she was, but dear lord 19 year old me who hadn&amp;#39;t experienced loss yet was so uncomfortable. The moment I would start, she would call me over. I&amp;#39;d say in the end, she printed over two hundred photos, most 4x6 and some 8x10, and easily only bought about thirty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ran deals frequently, so her total came to be about twenty bucks.... for almost three hours of man power and god knows how much wasted ink and photo paper, of which we were always running low on, so we actually ran out the next day thanks to that.
