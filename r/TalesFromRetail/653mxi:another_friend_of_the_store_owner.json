One evening at Retail Store I was waiting in line to check out, and I happened to catch the eye of another man browsing nearby. He nodded hello as if he knew me, and he did look familiar but I couldn&amp;#39;t place him. Learning from past gaffes when encountering parents in the wild, I said hello, and added, &amp;quot;I - I&amp;#39;m sorry, I can&amp;#39;t remember your name.&amp;quot; He graciously replied, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m John Q Public, Mayor of Midwestern City.&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;Oh I&amp;#39;m sorry your honor, I thought you were a parent of one of my students.&amp;quot; Pleasantries were exchanged, and separate ways were went on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TalesFromRetail", "name": "t1_dg7q8ni", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126988.0, "created_utc": 1492098188.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7bp3i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 48, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AlienMagician", "parent_id": "t1_dg79krp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TalesFromRetail", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Reminds me of how the (British) Queen reacts to tourists in Balmoral\n\nT: hey, you know the Queen sometimes lives here?
