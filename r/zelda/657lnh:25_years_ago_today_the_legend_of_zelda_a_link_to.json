But it does have flaws. Most of them are pretty minor imperfections, like the lack of unique dungeon music, or a disappointing room or boss here and there. But there is one major flaw I'd say the game has, and that's writing.\n\n\nThere's not much in the way of character in LttP. No one has any internal struggles, no one goes through an arc or character development. Most of them don't even have any opinions or emotions at all beyond \"stop the evil\". And that isn't to say that LttP ignores story either. It has plenty of text to read, but it's mostly exposition. There's a bit of personality in some side characters, but everything in the main quest is quite bland. Link is a mute without the expressions and reactions that gave his later incarnations character. Sahasrala and the seven sages say almost nothing but where to go, what to do, or what the plot is. They have no personality. Often times the exposition isn't even necessary, it's just reiterating the same facts we already know. You could do nothing but cut dialogue for a long while and end up with a more enjoyable narrative. The setting of LttP is fine, and it's certainly a big step up from previous games, but most games afterward do a better job at writing characters, drama, and emotional investment.\n\nLet me just reiterate this game is still amazing.

But it does have flaws. Most of them are pretty minor imperfections, like the lack of unique dungeon music, or a disappointing room or boss here and there. But there is one major flaw I&amp;#39;d say the game has, and that&amp;#39;s writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s not much in the way of character in LttP. No one has any internal struggles, no one goes through an arc or character development. Most of them don&amp;#39;t even have any opinions or emotions at all beyond &amp;quot;stop the evil&amp;quot;. And that isn&amp;#39;t to say that LttP ignores story either. It has plenty of text to read, but it&amp;#39;s mostly exposition. There&amp;#39;s a bit of personality in some side characters, but everything in the main quest is quite bland. Link is a mute without the expressions and reactions that gave his later incarnations character. Sahasrala and the seven sages say almost nothing but where to go, what to do, or what the plot is. They have no personality. Often times the exposition isn&amp;#39;t even necessary, it&amp;#39;s just reiterating the same facts we already know.
