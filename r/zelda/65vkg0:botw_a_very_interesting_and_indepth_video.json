I generally like it, but I get the complaints.\n\nFor one thing, as the video explains, we are very used to classical and romantic (as in romanticism) themes from Zelda (and a lot of game soundtracks generally).  But here we've got impressionism.  Impressionistic music can be really hard to love.  It's this interesting mix of cerebral and very purposeful, while also fundamentally being about nature and the impressions that you receive from nature.  It's about conveying moods, rather than creating the mood for you.  It can be harder to get swept away by an impressionist piece compared to say, a Beethoven first movement.\n\nOne of the big complaints I have seen is that the music is just too quiet or not present.  This is, unfortunately I suppose, sort of the point.  The world that Link is moving around in is pretty quiet.  It's a post-catastrophe world.  There's no hustle and bustle.  It's mostly just nature, some ruins, and an occasional village.  When activity does pick up (you enter a village, you encounter enemies, something about the environment changes), the music picks up.  That's impressionism in a nutshell.  The music is trying to convey to you the mood of the land.  So there is a lot of quiet.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind too that impressionism is a reaction to the preceding period.  It's a rejection of the very orchestrated, very expressive music from the romantic period.\n\nCompare:\n\n1) [Debussy's *Nocturnes*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtL_enacFn8) (side note: Debussy gets put up on a pedestal as *the* Impressionism composer.  He hated the term, and didn't consider it applicable to himself.  He composed during the window of impressionism and the label arguably fits some of his work.  This is one I'd say deserves the impressionism label.).  Now, unless you have a great love of impressionism, quiet melodies, cerebral compositions...you maybe made it two minutes in before boredom.  You'd probably like it better if you were staring at a landscape painting while listening to it with a warm coffee in hand on a rainy day.\n\n2) [Dvorak's New World Symphony.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETNoPqYAIPI).  Dvorak is a late Romantic.  You'll notice that once you hit 55 seconds in, you're swept away on a very dramatic journey to who knows where.  This is what makes Romantic music fun.  You're not relying on the environment to give you cues about how to feel.  This is the composer's journey and he is going to take you along for the ride.  There's darkness, there's brightness, there's drama.  Someone who likes simple music would say it's overwrought.\n\nThis is, I think, the general reason for the negative reactions to the BotW soundtrack.  It's delightful for someone who likes impressionistic music.  But...there's sort of a reason that video games don't use impressionism inspired melodies.  It's more fun for a player to have the mood created by the music.  It's *fun* when you walk into a dungeon and the music guides how to feel about it.  It creates suspense, happiness, sadness for you.  In BotW, you're sort of left to decide on your own how to feel about the environment, because the music is just suggesting the mood of emptiness and the forgotten glory of Hyrule to you.  The lack of \"presence\" from the soundtrack is, I believe, meant to be a feature, not a bug.\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492446310.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of thnking about the soundtrack and the response to it.

You&amp;#39;re not relying on the environment to give you cues about how to feel.  This is the composer&amp;#39;s journey and he is going to take you along for the ride.  There&amp;#39;s darkness, there&amp;#39;s brightness, there&amp;#39;s drama.  Someone who likes simple music would say it&amp;#39;s overwrought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is, I think, the general reason for the negative reactions to the BotW soundtrack.  It&amp;#39;s delightful for someone who likes impressionistic music.  But...there&amp;#39;s sort of a reason that video games don&amp;#39;t use impressionism inspired melodies.  It&amp;#39;s more fun for a player to have the mood created by the music.  It&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; when you walk into a dungeon and the music guides how to feel about it.  It creates suspense, happiness, sadness for you.  In BotW, you&amp;#39;re sort of left to decide on your own how to feel about the environment, because the music is just suggesting the mood of emptiness and the forgotten glory of Hyrule to you.  The lack of &amp;quot;presence&amp;quot; from the soundtrack is, I believe, meant to be a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "zelda", "name": "t1_dgdknnd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469579.0, "created_utc": 1492440779.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vkg0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdlsom", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "smileyfrown", "parent_id": "t3_65vkg0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/zelda", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nice find, very interesting stuff.\n\nI keep thinking how underrated the muscial themes of this game is.
