You see the passion in her eyes for the item that serves no literal purpose other than to help you get more HP/stamina, and swear to defend that passion as the samurai you are.\n\nUnfortunately, during one of your excursions to find a traveler's sword because you forgot to take a picture of it for your compendium, the artifact is stolen by a mysterious entity, and upon returning, you find your (doesn't realize it but totally is) beloved weeping in her Aunt/Grandma's house. Your anger burns at this mysterious villain's unforgivable actions, and your own lack of diligence at only being able to start the quest instead of preventing it, and you decide to find the culprit yourself.

I'm seeing a lot of right answers in this comments section. A lot of fish waifu and a lot of paya... That's great and all... but I'm not seeing anyone willing to address the fact that although they're both wonderful, they both have their faults as well and should be compared thusly.\n\n So let's talk about the fish lady first. Mipha is the kinda girl who is stunning, compassionate and honorable. You are childhood friends and she always had a thing for you (always healing you up). The kind of girl that you wanna take home with you and show to your parents to show how great of a kid you are. \"Look at me, Dad, I scored a priestess princess!\" Good for you, but you didn't score her, did you? Everything was going great for the both of you until IN THE END you FUCKED UP and DIDN'T beat the shit out of Ganon's forces... Oh wow. After being resurrected, you realize that the OTP-great-waifu-to-be (OTPGWTB) was carefully crafting you a special swimsuit to let you swim up the waterfalls of marriage with her. And that's when you and when I say you I mean ALL OF YOU OUT THERE realize that you need to address the elephant in the room... Like... The literal elephant in the room, Divine Beat Vah Ruta. You go to save your Prize Priestess, but when you FINALLY beat up the damn beast, you realize that it killed Mipha... IT KILLED MIPHA. \n\nSo hold on... You, being a shadow of your former self, manage to beat up this monstrosity nearly BY YOURSELF and yet you couldn't have done this while it was attacking Mipha? \"Oh, your one duty is to protect Zelda!\" FUCK ZELDA. She gets captured in 90% of the other stories and everything turns out JUST FINE. Mipha doesn't have plot armor, Zelda does. Fuck her and go save the real deal! THE WAIFU THAT WAS ABOUT TO PUT A FUCKING RING ON IT. But no. You let her die. You finish off the elephant and you see her beautiful form in front of you, but she's as dead as a doorknob. You can't marry a ghost! YOU CAN'T FUCK A GHOST. WHY DID YOU LET HER DIE, HUH? You can say it's a tragic tale, but in the end it's just a disappointment. \n\nTHAT'S WHY I gotta say... Mipha OTP? More like One True HERRING. AND A RED HERRING AT THAT. \n\nNow, this is where I can hear the multitudes screaming for Paya. Yes, yes... I know you have all had your special moments... like that moment where she was all shy and covering her face and wouldn't tell you about her tramp stamp that looks like a fruit. But you like that. You're the strong silent type that doesn't really say any words other than \"Hyaa\" and \"Huh\" and \"Malon/Link OTP.\" She's the perfect match for you and you know it. Every day she see's you, her stunning hero who she's dedicated her whole life to serving and every night you carefully sneak into her bedroom, watch her sleep and raid her dairy for secrets. Wow. What a \"hero\". And sure, she's beautiful. Sure, her personality is \"kawaii as fuck\" blah blah blah, but lets get down to the truth. \n\nYOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER. She is doing her duty every day and you're not even willing to take her out to dinner or do anything nice for her at all? You might think about it in your head, but you never act. You're even shyer than her, admit it! She needs a big burly man who will sweep her off her feet and tell her that he loves her, but you're not that man. No. You spend your whole quest saving other maidens, like Zelda... And what does she end her Diary with? \"does link wanna fuck zelda not me? Idk, lol. Guess I'll never get to see his dick cuz he won't evr tell me!\" WOAH. Look at that huge opportunity! You literally know she's all over you and you don't do anything about it? You're still trying to get with that nutjob zelda who keeps trying to get you to eat live frogs? AWWW HELL NO. YOU DON'T DESERVE HER. SHE'S A DUTIFUL DAMSEL WHO JUST WANTS ANY AMOUNT OF CONFIRMATION OF LOVE AND YOU WON'T GIVE HER ANYTHING. \n\nOh, and the real OTP? Paya and Ball. That's right. That ball that was \"stolen\" and you found and used as a key? That's her only love in this whole world. The only thing she has cared for her entire life other than her own granny and YOU had to take that away from her. What a fucking prick. \n\nALRIGHT. TIME FOR THE MAIN EVENT BOYS! LIGHTNING ROUND! \n\nAhem Why do each of these waifus suck? \nZelda............... is british. Also has a weird frog fetish. Yells at you because of her own damn problems. Decides to project her problems on to you and ask YOU what you would do if you weren't a knight anymore? No. Get outta here you disgrace of a namesake. \n\nUrbosa............. is really damn cool. She's another one of those perfect in every way kinda gals... Hot as hell, cool under pressure. Wise beyond her years. Wow... she's a sexy strong gerudo mama. Oh, and you LET HER DIE! \n\nRiju................. is 12 or 14 at best... You better check your country's/state's age of consent laws becuase this girl is just that... a little girl. I know that kind of thing gets some people going, but this new royalty isn't a 500 year old vampire that just looks young... you can't say it's ok... And even if it was a 100 year old woman who used sheikah technology to make herself younger.... oh wait... shit... back up... \n\nPurah............... looks 6 and doesn't love you. She's cute, acts like a japanese idol half the time and like a brave scientist the other half. She may be funny and clearly old enough for you, but let's remember she has the body of a six year old girl and she doesn't seem to be getting any older any time soon. OK. So you fall in love with this girl despite her faults and maybe you can withhold your lust for her since she looks six and the rest of the village seems REALLY judgey? Well guess what. Even if she did miraculously work out how to look as old as she is, she's not into you except as a friend to take selfies with. She's married to science and wants as much of her space to herself as possible. Just look at her and her assistant. She drew a line of chalk in the lab to denote which half of the lab is his AND SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT MOVING THAT LINE OF CHALK CLOSER TO HERSELF. That man is painting himself into a corner, specifically the corner with a door that he'll almost surely walk out of just like all the other men in her life and probably just like you should (if you know what's good for you). \n\nSpeaking of Men: \nPrince Sidon...... is the brother of the chick that was about to propose to you. You have a childhood friendship with his sister, let her die and then you wanna bang him? Fat chance. He may be charismatic, but he has enough girls to keep him busy for the next 100 years when maybe you'll be resurrected enough to get the nerve to even ask him out (and maybe he'll have forgotten about the whole letting his older sister die thing). \n\nKass................. Is perfect for you in every way. He's always there for you on your adventures telling you badass song/story/riddles. He's a talented musician. He's as brave as you are (probably deserves that triforce of courage). He's also faster than you are and you see him in a ton of cool locations... He's funny, mysterious, and cool as hell... oh... and he's married. Now I know what you're thinking: marriages break up and his seems to be on the brink of disaster, so maybe you can swing in and grab him, but let's face it... this guy has a kid and a wife... just leave him be. You were too busy sleeping for 100 years to get this brilliant bird boy. (He's my favorite character, but obviously not Link's waifu).\n\n If you have another waifu you want me to rip to shreds (and not in a good way) comment on here. \nAlso in case you didn't catch it... Malon/Link OTP.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, hold up. I&amp;#39;m seeing a lot of right answers in this comments section.
