Despite being an incredible game, BotW let me down a little in that regard and I think there&amp;#39;s a few reasons for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main one is probably that an inhuman Ganon is the least interesting kind of Ganon. Villains can be a large part of what makes a plot compelling, and BotW&amp;#39;s villain falls completely flat. This Ganon has nothing close to sympathetic motivations or even any dialogue. There&amp;#39;s little satisfaction to be had in battling the narrative equivalent of a black wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, the presence of the ghost-guardians prevents their living descendants/successors from playing a satisfying role throughout the story. The successors actions stop being relevant after Link enters the divine beasts and the guardians have a necessarily limited impact on the world because they&amp;#39;re ghosts. Both are more or less narrative dead ends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Zelda doesn&amp;#39;t fully escape from the &amp;quot;captive princess&amp;quot; archetype because we don&amp;#39;t get to see her struggle against Ganon. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I liked this Zelda quite a bit. I especially enjoyed her initial behavior toward Link, and I think the memories do a great deal to flesh her out as an interesting character, but we ultimately don&amp;#39;t get to see her flex her muscles, so to speak. This is disappointing, since we&amp;#39;re told that she confronted Ganon, and continues to struggle against him, but we aren&amp;#39;t allowed to witness that. I&amp;#39;m still waiting for a game that gives Zelda a chance to stand on equal footing with Link and Ganon, but it seems like I&amp;#39;ll have to hold out hope for the next game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "zelda", "name": "t1_dgcyz2x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492424725.0, "created_utc": 1492395925.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sre7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd2p6x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Show-Me-Your-Moves", "parent_id": "t3_65sre7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/zelda", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yea...I think this is one of BotW's weak spots.
