Fast Travel to the Tena Ko'sah Shrine near the Tabantha Tower\n 2. Fly across the Tanagar Canyon to a small grove of trees where 6 horse-riding bow-wielding enemies are ready to give up their arrows freely\n  * ***Location:*** [GIF](http://imgur.com/kFRK1d2)\n 3. Land yourself directly in the middle of the enemy group\n 4. Use your camera rune to take a selfie, angle the camera directly up, and exit the camera rune\n  * (This puts you in a non-combative stance and makes it so the enemies cannot properly target you and all their arrows land at your feet)\n 5. Pick up 20ish arrows (Until they stop showing up around you)\n 6. **SAVE YOUR GAME AND IMMEDIATELY LOAD THAT SAVE**\n  * Loading a save point tricks the game into thinking you're entering an area for the first time\n  * If you're already where the enemies are, you can *IMMEDIATELY* start farming again\n  * This method removes the weather from the equation and doesn't force you to travel somewhere and return\n 7. Repeat steps 4-6 until you have reached your desired amount of arrows\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat's it folks.  Use the save/load mechanic to trick the game into resetting the arrow limit.  This adds about 30ish seconds to reload the exact place you are standing.\n\nFarming used to be around 200 arrows every 10 minutes.
