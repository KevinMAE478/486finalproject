The Bridge of Hylia\u2019s design was likely inspired by the Great Bridge of Hylia from Twilight Princess (Corrected by AbileneKavka)\n\n*Breach of Demise*- This references the great Demon King himself, Demise, and also references how he \u2018broke through the earth\u2019 in a sort of breach. Creepy. \n\n*Eagus Bridge*- Named after Eagus, the instructor who runs the Sparring Hall in Skyloft.\n\n*Horwell Bridge*- Named after Horwell, an instructor at the Knight Academy.\n\n*Owlan Bridge*- Named after Owlan, an instructor at the Knight Academy. \n\n*Batrea Lake*- Possibly named for the friendly demon Batreaux, due to the similarities in the name (**Batrea**-ux) and the proximity to other locations named for characters from SS. \n\n*Pillars of Levia* \u2013 named after the flying whale spirit, Levias. \n\n*Piper Ridge*- Named after Piper, the mother of Gully and a resident of Skyloft. For some reason, this character merited a place to be named after her. To be honest\u2026 I\u2019m not even sure if I talked to her in my first play through of SS.\n\n*Lake Floria/ Floria Bridge/ Floria Falls, Floria River, Mount Floria*- Named after Lake Floria, guarded by the Water Dragon Faron. \n\n*Springs of Power/Wisdom/Courage*- These springs were likely inspired by the Earth Spring and the Skyview Spring, which serves similar functions and takes on similar appearances. Their names are derived from the virtues of the three Golden Goddesses/ the Triforce. As noted by NiteMary, two of these springs may be the exact springs from SS. \n\n*Golow River*- Likely named after Golo, the Goron archaeologist who assists Gorko in researching the three dragons.\n\n*Gorko Tunnel, Gorko Lake*- Named after Gorko, the Goron archaeologist who hangs out outside the Sealed Temple. \n\n*Gotram Cliff*- Named after the Goron, Gotram, who lives in the Lanaryu Shipyard.\n\n*Death Caldera*- A caldera is a cauldron-like volcanic feature. It\u2019s like the crater where the magma was, but when the magma was emptied it created an empty chamber. Since it sits at the foot of Death Mountain, this makes sense. As noted by bisforbenis, 'Caldera' may also refer to Scaldera (S-**caldera**), which is the fire boss in SS. \n\n*Whistling Hill*- Likely named for the action of whistling done by Loftwing riders when they wish to call to their birds. I came to this conclusion based on the hill's location, as it is near many locations that are named after SS characters. It is also possible this location got its name from the whistle from LoZ, or the recorder. However, the latter is unlikely. \n\n**Minish Cap**\n\n*Mount Gustaf* \u2013 a mountain named for one of the oldest Kings of Hyrule known, King Gustaf.\n \n*Minshi Woods* \u2013 Minshi is an anagram for Minish, perhaps referencing the Minish and the original Minish Woods. This is likely, due to the proximity of other locations named from Minish Cap.\n\n*Pico Pond* \u2013 Likely named for the Picori, the other name for the Minish used by Hylians. This is likely, due to the proximity of other locations named from Minish Cap. \n\n*Crenal Hills* \u2013 Named after Mount Crenel. \n\n*Trilby Plain / Trilby Valley* \u2013 Named for Trilby Highlands, a location in Minish Cap. \n\n*Veiled Falls*- Likely named after Veil Falls from MC. It is also possible that Veiled Falls refers to the very first Waterfall in LoZ, as the waterfalls 'veils' a secret. However, since there are plenty of other waterfalls in BoTW that also have secrets behind their waterfalls, this is unlikely specific to the Veiled Falls. \n", "edited": 1491960198.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mount Hylia / Bridge of Hylia / Hylia Island / Hylia River&lt;/em&gt;\u2013 Locations named for the goddess Hylia.

Creepy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eagus Bridge&lt;/em&gt;- Named after Eagus, the instructor who runs the Sparring Hall in Skyloft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horwell Bridge&lt;/em&gt;- Named after Horwell, an instructor at the Knight Academy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Owlan Bridge&lt;/em&gt;- Named after Owlan, an instructor at the Knight Academy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batrea Lake&lt;/em&gt;- Possibly named for the friendly demon Batreaux, due to the similarities in the name (&lt;strong&gt;Batrea&lt;/strong&gt;-ux) and the proximity to other locations named for characters from SS. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pillars of Levia&lt;/em&gt; \u2013 named after the flying whale spirit, Levias. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Piper Ridge&lt;/em&gt;- Named after Piper, the mother of Gully and a resident of Skyloft. For some reason, this character merited a place to be named after her. To be honest\u2026 I\u2019m not even sure if I talked to her in my first play through of SS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lake Floria/ Floria Bridge/ Floria Falls, Floria River, Mount Floria&lt;/em&gt;- Named after Lake Floria, guarded by the Water Dragon Faron. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springs of Power/Wisdom/Courage&lt;/em&gt;- These springs were likely inspired by the Earth Spring and the Skyview Spring, which serves similar functions and takes on similar appearances. Their names are derived from the virtues of the three Golden Goddesses/ the Triforce. As noted by NiteMary, two of these springs may be the exact springs from SS. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Golow River&lt;/em&gt;- Likely named after Golo, the Goron archaeologist who assists Gorko in researching the three dragons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorko Tunnel, Gorko Lake&lt;/em&gt;- Named after Gorko, the Goron archaeologist who hangs out outside the Sealed Temple. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gotram Cliff&lt;/em&gt;- Named after the Goron, Gotram, who lives in the Lanaryu Shipyard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Caldera&lt;/em&gt;- A caldera is a cauldron-like volcanic feature. It\u2019s like the crater where the magma was, but when the magma was emptied it created an empty chamber. Since it sits at the foot of Death Mountain, this makes sense. As noted by bisforbenis, &amp;#39;Caldera&amp;#39; may also refer to Scaldera (S-&lt;strong&gt;caldera&lt;/strong&gt;), which is the fire boss in SS. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whistling Hill&lt;/em&gt;- Likely named for the action of whistling done by Loftwing riders when they wish to call to their birds. I came to this conclusion based on the hill&amp;#39;s location, as it is near many locations that are named after SS characters. It is also possible this location got its name from the whistle from LoZ, or the recorder. However, the latter is unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minish Cap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mount Gustaf&lt;/em&gt; \u2013 a mountain named for one of the oldest Kings of Hyrule known, King Gustaf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minshi Woods&lt;/em&gt; \u2013 Minshi is an anagram for Minish, perhaps referencing the Minish and the original Minish Woods. This is likely, due to the proximity of other locations named from Minish Cap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pico Pond&lt;/em&gt; \u2013 Likely named for the Picori, the other name for the Minish used by Hylians. This is likely, due to the proximity of other locations named from Minish Cap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crenal Hills&lt;/em&gt; \u2013 Named after Mount Crenel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trilby Plain / Trilby Valley&lt;/em&gt; \u2013 Named for Trilby Highlands, a location in Minish Cap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Veiled Falls&lt;/em&gt;- Likely named after Veil Falls from MC. It is also possible that Veiled Falls refers to the very first Waterfall in LoZ, as the waterfalls &amp;#39;veils&amp;#39; a secret. However, since there are plenty of other waterfalls in BoTW that also have secrets behind their waterfalls, this is unlikely specific to the Veiled Falls. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "zelda", "name": "t1_dg4ef42", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491952891.0, "created_utc": 1491924091.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rh1t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rh1t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4u12d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ibanez7271", "parent_id": "t1_dg4emgc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/zelda", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I also noticed at the Goron city, one of the large carvings looks like Darmani and his son ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also noticed at the Goron city, one of the large carvings looks like Darmani and his son &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "zelda", "name": "t1_dg4u12d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491969883.0, "created_utc": 1491941083.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rh1t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rh1t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rh1t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5rzp3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KthulhuKitten", "parent_id": "t1_dg5rp9o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/zelda", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah fine.

However, I do not believe this is the same ranch; just an easter egg for fun and giggles. \n\n*Nabi Lake / South Nabi Lake*\u2013I will not lie, this is a serious stretch. However, it is possible that Nabi is named for Navi. I have come to this conclusion for two reasons: one, the spellings are very similar. Two, in Japanese, the \u2018V\u2019 sound does not exist, so when writing out English words in Japanese characters, sounds that use the \u2018b\u2019 sound is often used instead. So, in Japanese, \u2018Nabi\u2019 is truly \u2018Navi.\u2019 So either this was a spelling error, or very intentional. \n\n*Bonooru\u2019s Stand*- Literally named for the scarecrow that that stands at all times at Lake Hylia. He dances, he sings, he remembers your song. He has a counterpart in Majora\u2019s Mask as well. \n\n*Pierre Plateau* \u2013 Also named for a scarecrow. He wanders, he assists in your quest, he lets you stab him with a hotshot then greets you with pleasantries. Pierre is the unsung hero. He also has a MM counterpart. \n\n*Kaepora Pass* \u2013 Named for Kaepora Gaebora, the most annoying owl in the world\u2026 For the love of god, just let me get past\u2026 no, PLEASE, stop talking\u2026. This character also appeared in MM and Four Swords Adventures. \n\n*Ja\u2019Abu Ridge*- Likely named for Lord Jabu Jabu, the deity of the Zora and the eater of Zora Princesses. Although not exactly named, the similarities are there. It is also possible that this location is named for Jabun, the fish spirit from Wind Waker\u2026 however, his name derives from Jabu Jabu. \n\n*Goro Cove, Goronbi River, Goronbi Lake*- There are two possibilities for the naming of these locations. One, they come from the word \u2018Goron\u2019. Or Two, \u2018Goro\u2019 refers to the sound the Gorons make at the ends of their sentences. For Goronbi River and Lake, it is possible that it means \u201cGoron Fire\u2019 as \u2018bi\u2019 (bee) in Japanese can refer to \u2018fire.\u2019 This is fitting, as the river is a river of lava.\n \n*Medingo Pool*- This could be a reference to Medigoron, the larger Goron that makes that stupid sword that breaks\u2026. Ahem, anyways. I\u2019ll admit, this one is a stretch, and I\u2019m not even sure this is the best fit, if there is even a fit at all. \n\n*River of the Dead*- This river could be a callback to the \u2018river\u2019 in the Shadow Temple, where the \u2018ferry to the other side\u2019 will carry you across. There are, of course, many many reasons to name the river the way they did, and not necessarily a reference at all.\n\n*Koukot Plateau*- Another stretch of a reference, but this place could refer to Koume and Kotake (**Kou**-me and **Kot**-ake), the surrogate mothers of Ganondorf himself. Collectively known as Twinrova, these two have also starred in MM and OoS/OoA.\n\n**Majora\u2019s Mask**\n\n*Romani Plains* \u2013 named for the lovely Romani, the little girl from the ranch. \n\n*Tingle Island* \u2013Named for the great, the majestic, the glorious Tingle, the map maker with daddy issues and disillusion that he, too, is a fairy boy! This rather wacky character also appeared in several other titles, including Wind Waker, Oracle of Ages, Four Swords Adventures (the bastard), and Minish Cap, and for several games starred as the hero in his own games Freshly-Picked Tingles\u2019 Rosy Rupeeland\u2026 Wait, did I read that title right?\n\n*Toto Lake*- Named after the manager of the Indigo-Go\u2019s, Toto, the counterpart to King Zora from OoT.\n\n*Mikau Lake*- Named after Mikau, the lead guitarist of the Indigo-Go\u2019s who died trying to save Lulu\u2019s eggs, and the spirit who inhabits the Zora Mask. \n\n*Lulu Lake*- Named after the lead singer of the Indigo-Go\u2019s, Lulu, the counterpart to Princess Ruto. I love how close the lake is to Mikau Lake\u2026 Adorable. Whether it\u2019s canon or not, I ship them. The characters, not the lakes\u2026\n\n*Inogo Bridge* - Likely named after the Indigo-Go Band (**In**-dig**o**-**Go**\u2019s). \n\n*Breman Peak*- Named after the Breman Mask. March, my pretties, march!\n\n*Lake Darman*- Likely named after Darmani, the Goron hero who died and whose spirit inhabits the Goron Mask. \n\n*Gero Pond*- Likely named after Don Gero, the leader of the Frog Chorus, whose name is used for the Don Gero Mask.

UPDATE: Thank you to ShiKage for providing me the Japanese name for this location (\u30c8\u30c8\u30ea\u6e56 [Totori Mizu-umi). Unfortunately, this still does not help to determine if the meaning was meant to be &amp;#39;Lake Bird,&amp;#39; so the translation can still be up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proxim Bridge&lt;/em&gt;- \u2018Proxy\u2019 means to \u2018represent someone else\u2019 or to \u2018represent something\u2019. Although very unlikely, \u2018Proxim\u2019 could refer to \u2018Proxi,\u2019 the fairy who speaks on Link\u2019s behalf in Hyrule Warriors. However, this is very unlikely as the game is not part of Zelda canon. There is likely a better candidate for this reference or there is no reference at all.  \u2018Proxim\u2019 could also be short for \u2018proximity,\u2019 which means \u2018close by, in the same area.\u2019 UPDATE: As shared by ShiKage, this bridge in Japanese in known as Moyori Bridge (Moyori- nearby, closest). As such, it is likely the latter meaning, &amp;#39;proximity,&amp;#39; was the intended meaning of the bridge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rist Peninsula&lt;/em&gt;\u2013 This location is possibly based upon a famous real-life location known as Spiral Jetty, an earthwork done by Robert Smithson in 1970. It is located as Rozel Point peninsula on the Great Salt Lake. Also, they spelled Peninsula right!
