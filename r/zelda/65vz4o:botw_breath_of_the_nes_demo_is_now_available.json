Lets say you have a player and an enemy and they are standing about 1.5 feet away from each other (or a tile and a half or whatever), and when the enemy swings his weapon, it hits you so. Therefore, he can hit 1.5 feet away from him. If you swing your weapon, however, you can&amp;#39;t reach him and you miss by .5 feet. Therefore you can hit only 1 foot away from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case the enemy constantly has an advantage from the front since he only has to be .5 feet farther than where you can hit and he will be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "zelda", "name": "t1_dge4c1x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492491843.0, "created_utc": 1492463043.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vz4o", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vz4o", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vz4o", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r61g", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vz4o", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeamg2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thefrdeal", "parent_id": "t1_dge9nnf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/zelda", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'll look into it, thank you for the feedback!!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll look into it, thank you for the feedback!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "zelda", "name": "t1_dgeamg2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492499771.0, "created_utc": 1492470971.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge9nnf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cylius", "parent_id": "t1_dge69mv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/zelda", "controversiality": 0, "body": "One other issue ive run into is the poes are way too strong, they stick to you like glue and melt your hp.
