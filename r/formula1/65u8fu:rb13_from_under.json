So he sold the idea to NASA who then used the pen on their spaceflights (starting in the late 1960s), and he sold the pen as &amp;quot;THE SPACE PEN&amp;quot;. The idea that it cost millions of dollars to develop heightened the prestige.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the urban legend ignores the fact that pens are much better than pencils in space. Graphite chips and pencil shavings are terrible in microgravity (without gravity, dust doesn&amp;#39;t settle -- invert your keyboard on your face to simulate space flight without careful dust controls). Furthermore, graphite is highly flammable and conductive. After the tragic Apollo I fire, NASA &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; spend money to try to develop flame-retardant pencils, but pens are simply a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: CRAP! I forgot to mention the best part: When the Soviets found out Americans had expensive space pens, they immediately placed a large order. Pens really are better. When he got the order, the manufacturer famously gave them the same discount given to NASA, for buying in bulk. There&amp;#39;s some lesson about capitalism in there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "formula1", "name": "t1_dgdloco", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492470844.0, "created_utc": 1492442044.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qimj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65u8fu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdjf1e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BillGoats", "parent_id": "t1_dgdj6ko", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/formula1", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;...and this is what happens when you ask a throwaway question about something completely mundane to a bunch of fans\n\nI don't mind, very much enjoyed reading this.
