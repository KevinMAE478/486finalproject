I want to see Hamilton win based off of this merit alone. Not backing people up going into the pit lane (or on track at Abu Dhabi). Not cutting corners and not slowing down (Mexico). I just see the guy as unsportsmanlike. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hamilton has the pace to be the fastest guy on track. If he had some more honour aboit him I would support him. Admitting fault is fine but it&amp;#39;s his actions that are the problem and I see all too often actions on track that are just unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "formula1", "name": "t1_dgcni2n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492409190.0, "created_utc": 1492380390.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -26}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qimj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qmky", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdbzuu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Adam_Daze", "parent_id": "t3_65qmky", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/formula1", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Is it really \"gracious\" to admit you were being a cheating dick after you were called out and penalised for it on international television?
