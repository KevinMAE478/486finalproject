I think the issue with Renault&amp;#39;s second driver stems from the one year contract that they&amp;#39;re offering. It might be that they contacted JEV and he, like Magnussen, turned them down for a longer option, or that he&amp;#39;s engaged already in a multi year contract in Formula E or WEC. Palmer&amp;#39;s time in F1 is definitely limited of he keeps performing like this though, with two Renault juniors in F2 that are probably eager for his seat&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "formula1", "name": "t1_dgckr70", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492405603.0, "created_utc": 1492376803.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qimj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qdlt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qimj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qdlt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qimj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qdlt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qimj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qdlt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd34yd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mike_Kermin", "parent_id": "t1_dgd2zs7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/formula1", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah I see what you are saying.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah I see what you are saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "formula1", "name": "t1_dgd34yd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492430835.0, "created_utc": 1492402035.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd2zs7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dajigo", "parent_id": "t1_dgd11ea", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/formula1", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The worst offender with respect to dangerous and reprehensible driving, surely, but not nearly the worst performing.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst offender with respect to dangerous and reprehensible driving, surely, but not nearly the worst performing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "formula1", "name": "t1_dgd2zs7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492430598.0, "created_utc": 1492401798.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd11ea", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mike_Kermin", "parent_id": "t1_dgcn786", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/formula1", "controversiality": 0, "body": "To be honest, for me when he drove into the back of Lewis on purpose that on it's own made him the worst....", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, for me when he drove into the back of Lewis on purpose that on it&amp;#39;s own made him the worst....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "formula1", "name": "t1_dgd11ea", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492427633.0, "created_utc": 1492398833.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qimj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qdlt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcngm9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AllezCannes", "parent_id": "t1_dgcn786", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/formula1", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That is true.
