Ryder has a fixed personality like Shepard, it's different and yes Ryder is definitely trying too hard and can even be a big asshole in situations (especially if you don't pick the professional answer sometimes), I don't get how it sucks any drama though, Ryder is someone that's emotionally detached yeah, but if anything thanks to the contextual clues, **the fact that it is clearly shows as coping mechanism originating from their relation with their father humanize them just as much for me.**\n\nAnd here's the rub; Shepard worked despite having a potentially *horrific* back story because s/he was an adult who had moved past their trauma. And in the rare cases where they didn't, background specific quests were provided to let you decide how Shepard reacts to their past. Shepard was pre-defined to an extent, but s/he was far more malleable than Ryder is. You decided how Shepard reacted to his/her history, and you decided whether they had moved past it or if there was something still lingering in them about it. For instance, it's not out of character for Shepard to go full Paragon, except when dealing with Batarians, if you chose the Colonist background. With Ryder, you've got daddy issues. \n\nAfter seeing the context of Shepard dragging him/herself up from the ghettos of Earth, or perhaps having their entire life destroyed by alien pirates, or even just spending most of your childhood in space, going for something so mundane as \"my daddy was gone a lot\" as the big central conflict within Ryder is just... it's beyond bland. It's rote. Am I playing a space opera or a soap opera?\n\n&gt; I really disagree with the fact that it's dehumanizing because there's an existing segment of the population who actually reacts like that. I've had some in my own family. The gravity it deserves is completely subjective, for some people there isn't any situation that deserves gravity and they're not inhuman, but more importantly and more relevantly, when we enter the realm of coping mechanism it can even be the opposite: the worse a situation is, the less gravity would be applied to it. I don't find that it sucks the drama, however maybe it refocuses it from the situation to the character.\n\nPerhaps dehumanizing was the wrong word. I think what I'm talking about is cognitive dissonance. I had an idea of how I wanted my Ryder to be, and I couldn't achieve that because of the forced, dull, droll way that Andromeda handled Ryder. Everything from giving you an AI that makes you a bad ass (you didn't earn it yourself), to a family that you're emo about because daddy was gone a lot, to the way the romances were handled all reminded me of something my sister would watch on the CW. This game was like Gilmour Girls in space.\n\nAnd that's what it really boils down to, no one at BioWare Montreal has the faintest clue as to what drew so many to the Trilogy. It was the adventure. The operatic space adventure. It was the aliens, the context, the incredibly in depth lore, and the main plot. Every one of those things in Andromeda is lacking to many, myself included, precisely because the writers of Andromeda don't know how to handle conflict.\n\nAs an example, and this may sound petty to you, but I was flabberghasted by how many fucks and bullshits and goddamns there were in the game. In Mass Effect 1, there was maybe one, maybe *two* \"shits\" in the entire game, yet it managed to be dramatic and tense despite it. Mass Effect 2 had Jack, which made sense, because she's an inarticulate feral child who doesn't know how to be a decent person. Andromeda's excuse is... nothing, really. They think it sounds more human, I guess?\n\nAll it does is make people on the Tempest sound inarticulate and childish. Maybe you'll say that you know people who swear a lot, and fair enough, but tonally it is wildly inconsistent with how the Trilogy was set up. Yeah, people cursed, but when they did, it had *impact*. I'm pretty sure the only time Shepard ever cursed was when knifing Kai Leng. Having recently replayed the Trilogy (as in over the last two weeks), that's the only moment I can recall where Shepard curses. It had *weight.* It was *impactful* because up until that point, it had never happened before.\n\nRyder on the other hand... jeez. \n\nThat isn't to say curses or cussing in Mass Effect don't belong, but it's to highlight the nature of the game, the dip in writing quality, between the Trilogy and this title.\n\nAnother point I'd like to bring up before I take my leave is that there is no inter-personal conflict with any of the crew members. Everyone gets along. Nobody butts heads. Everything is hunky dory and the worst problem anyone on the Tempest has is... um... trying to fit in? Compare any of the situations for this crew to any in the Trilogy, and you can't really tell me what their central arc is about. You or I could rattle off a whole host of conflicts both within the Normandy crew as well as in the plot itself. Nothing like Virmire exists in Andromeda. Nothing like having to make peace between Legion and Tali, or Jack and Miranda, exists, either. \n\nNobody like *Ashley* exists.\n\nAnd Ashley, despite whatever people may think of her, was one of the most well written characters in the Trilogy. Why? Because you can tell me exactly who she is. I can't tell you who Cora is, or Vetra, or Liam. I can tell you about Drack, but that's because Badass Grandpa is a little more outside the norm than any of the other squad mates. Peebee? She's... uh... a nerd? Maybe autistic? That's about it.\n\nPoint blank, the crew in Andromeda... they don't feel like *people* in the way they did in the Trilogy. There's nothing to blame that on but the bad writing. And the bad writing isn't limited to them, it extends to Ryder. The Trilogy writers were smart enough to understand that creating symbiosis between a player character with a personality and the player requires choice. It's fine for a PC to be a ball of angst, but the reasons *why* need to belong to the player. That's why Shepard resonates. Shepard has a ton of great moments and lines, but s/he doesn't steal the show from the player. Shepard is both a player avatar and his/her own character, from beginning to end. Very few games with voiced protagonists have managed to walk such a tight rope so deftly.\n\nRyder on the other hand is *clearly* someone else's idea of a hero, not mine. A hero doesn't whine about how daddy was aloof. A hero actually gets through problems with grit and determination, not because daddy mind-melded you with an AI robot that makes you stronger, faster, better, than you have any right to be. All throughout the game you're told that Ryder is only who he is because of SAM, and the worst part is that nothing can prove them wrong. Ryder doesn't display half the heart that Shepard does, Paragon or Renegade. \n\nMix it all together, and what you have is a rather bland cast with a rather bland story that borrowed so liberally from Halo that Microsoft might sue, and you've got a bland, bland game. The thing is, I *wanted* Andromeda to blow my socks off. Instead, it gave me a newfound appreciation for the Trilogy.
