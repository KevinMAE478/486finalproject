Max them out. Max the three passives in the skill tree of those skills, or the 6+ passives if you&amp;#39;re playing a hybrid class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve got all that sorted, THEN you can start putting points into additional skills for niche situations. Until that point though, any skills you put into different profiles basically nerfs your main profile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I do think profiles are worth it when you come up against different threats. For example, my main is a Pull, Singularity, Throw pure biotic. However, I&amp;#39;ve found switching to a Throw/Singu/Lance build is optimal for killing Hydra (spam combo detonations whilst they sit in singularity) and I&amp;#39;ve gradually added more and more skills to sub-profiles for specific things to make certain encounters easier. In most cases, these certain encounters are the big armored boss-type mobs or ascendants. For regular packs of mixed enemies, my pull/throw/singu build works fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dgap8b2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492295485.0, "created_utc": 1492266685.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65iqyw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb33rv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stephanovich", "parent_id": "t3_65iqyw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I used the same 3 abilities all game long.
