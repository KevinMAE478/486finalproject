On an actual ship, you'll never find the whole crew sleeping at night, as they usually work in shifts. \n\nAll in all, the Tempest is manned by 10 people, with the skeleton crew being only 5 (Kallo, Suvi, Lexi, Gil, Ryder). The Tempest has 4 bunks in total and the Pathfinder's quarters (1 bed).\n\nThe additional, non-standard crew consists of 6 people (Vetra, Cora, Liam, Drack, Peebee, Jaal), which brings the number up to 11.\n\nMy theory:\nThe crew takes turns sleeping. There are 11 people onboard, with two out of the equation (Ryder and Peebee, since she lives in the escape pod, which opens an entirely different can of worms, and Ryder has his quarters) and leaves us with 9.\nSuvi and Kallo are keeping the ship in the air, so they likely sleep during long flights with the autopilot on, or whenever the Tempest is landed. Kallo is Salarian and likely needs less sleep than the others (probably around one or two hours), due to his biology. This leaves 7 people that need to sleep somwhere.\n\nJaal has some sort of air bed/field mattress in his quarters/tech lab. This removes him from the equation, and leaves 6 people that need a pillow beneath their heads: Vetra, Drack, Gil, Lexi, Liam and Cora.\n\nAssuming at least one bunk is occupied for the majority of the time, this leaves six people that take turns (sleep when one is awake).\n\nNow if we go really crazy and take Romances into the equation, Ryder shares his quarters with one crewmember (let's say Vetra, because reasons), which leaves 5 people that take turns on 3 free bunks.\n\nNow, let's take a look at the sleeping priority of the 5 crewmembers that are left:\n\n1. Gil comes first, he is the only engineer that can keep the Tempest in shape (sans Kallo who pilots the damn thing)\n2. Lexi as the Doctor is close second, she is required to be well-rested to prevent mistakes that could happen through sleep-deprivation. \n3. Cora is the next one rank-wise, as she is pretty much Ryder's lieutenant.\n4. Liam is Andromeda personell, therefore he gets the second-to-last spot.\n5. Drack is, for all intents and purposes, basically a civil contractor, or another Security detail like Liam at best rank-wise. \n\nIf we ignore the Romances, Vetra would take the fourth spot instead of Liam, as she is the Tempest's Quartermaster* and therefore ranks somewhat higher than him.\n\n*: While Vetra is never addressed as such AFAIK, she hangs around in the armoury and cargo room alot, while also taking care of the Tempest's supplies, or 'getting stuff', which makes this a reasonable assumption.\n\nThere you have it, problem solved. Thoughts?", "edited": 1492034548.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD!]\nThey probably take turns. On an actual ship, you&amp;#39;ll never find the whole crew sleeping at night, as they usually work in shifts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, the Tempest is manned by 10 people, with the skeleton crew being only 5 (Kallo, Suvi, Lexi, Gil, Ryder). The Tempest has 4 bunks in total and the Pathfinder&amp;#39;s quarters (1 bed).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The additional, non-standard crew consists of 6 people (Vetra, Cora, Liam, Drack, Peebee, Jaal), which brings the number up to 11.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory:\nThe crew takes turns sleeping. There are 11 people onboard, with two out of the equation (Ryder and Peebee, since she lives in the escape pod, which opens an entirely different can of worms, and Ryder has his quarters) and leaves us with 9.\nSuvi and Kallo are keeping the ship in the air, so they likely sleep during long flights with the autopilot on, or whenever the Tempest is landed. Kallo is Salarian and likely needs less sleep than the others (probably around one or two hours), due to his biology. This leaves 7 people that need to sleep somwhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jaal has some sort of air bed/field mattress in his quarters/tech lab. This removes him from the equation, and leaves 6 people that need a pillow beneath their heads: Vetra, Drack, Gil, Lexi, Liam and Cora.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assuming at least one bunk is occupied for the majority of the time, this leaves six people that take turns (sleep when one is awake).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if we go really crazy and take Romances into the equation, Ryder shares his quarters with one crewmember (let&amp;#39;s say Vetra, because reasons), which leaves 5 people that take turns on 3 free bunks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#39;s take a look at the sleeping priority of the 5 crewmembers that are left:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gil comes first, he is the only engineer that can keep the Tempest in shape (sans Kallo who pilots the damn thing)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lexi as the Doctor is close second, she is required to be well-rested to prevent mistakes that could happen through sleep-deprivation. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cora is the next one rank-wise, as she is pretty much Ryder&amp;#39;s lieutenant.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Liam is Andromeda personell, therefore he gets the second-to-last spot.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drack is, for all intents and purposes, basically a civil contractor, or another Security detail like Liam at best rank-wise. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we ignore the Romances, Vetra would take the fourth spot instead of Liam, as she is the Tempest&amp;#39;s Quartermaster* and therefore ranks somewhat higher than him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*: While Vetra is never addressed as such AFAIK, she hangs around in the armoury and cargo room alot, while also taking care of the Tempest&amp;#39;s supplies, or &amp;#39;getting stuff&amp;#39;, which makes this a reasonable assumption.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There you have it, problem solved.
