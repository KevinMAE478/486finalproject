I really want this story to continue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really want them to continue from ME:A but I equally want them incorporate those huge sci-fi metropolises and established alien civilisations to the next game as well. ME:A is about the new frontier, the new home and colonisation, but ME:A2 (working title) should, in a believable way, be about something else than &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re new, we need to survive and find a home&amp;quot;.. I want the sense of exploration to stay (Star Trek: Voyager style, I love it) but the viability/colonisation stuff should be history and we should already see stuff like megacorps, Illium (&amp;lt;3), the Citadel, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have few ideas on how to make this possible without advancing time.. so either they&amp;#39;re going to add in a good amount of new established &amp;quot;friendly&amp;quot; (Not too much first contact diplomacy please, it substracts from the replay value) Alien civilisations, or they&amp;#39;re going to hit us with some Ryder n&amp;#39; Crew time travel cheese.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking for that Hutta from Star Wars, that Omega &amp;amp; Illium from Mass Effect 2, that Samurai Jack, all in all that &amp;quot;Cyber-Retro Alien Metropolis&amp;quot; trope I am craving for so much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve even learned to like Ryder as the MC&amp;#39;s name. For me it has always been nothing more (sorry to all the actual Ryders out there) than a nickname for a motorcycle gang member, but by wearing a black leather jacket as my casual outfit in-game I&amp;#39;ve actually grown accustomed to it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dgdnga7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492472917.0, "created_utc": 1492444117.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rmld", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdnltz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "filanwizard", "parent_id": "t3_65rmld", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I doubt the Andromeda folks will ever find out what happened to the Milky Way at the end of ME3.   the Expedition left near the start of ME2 timeline wise.
