This community is usually nice but yeah ok my opinion is \"worthless\" and i'm just here to \"rake in that sweet karma\" sure ok.\n\nOn reddit everyone values civil discourses highly. Insulting other people or belittling them shuts people out of discussions even if their points are valid. \n\nDespite this being the usual stance in the comments I'm writing this simply because I think you're an idiot and I want to let you know what makes you an idiot.\n\nHere's a quote from you:\n\n&gt; Honesty is always the best policy.\n\nIdiots annoy me. Persistent idiots annoy me more. You're a persistent idiot.\n\nYou made this post to show you went from someone hating the game for a bad reason to actually playing it and enjoying it. Your ending statement is the following:\n\n&gt; Of course because the original trilogy is so dear to us all, it's natural to be protective and want to be cynical towards any new iterations, but this has taught me not to dismiss a game before even trying it out.\n\nIt's supposed to show how you've learned from your experience but it really doesn't. \n\n&gt;this has taught me not to dismiss a game before even trying it out.\n\nThat's your take away. It shows you haven't actually identified the problem.\n\nYou CAN dismiss a game without trying it out. You should just have a good justification. Batman: Arkham Knight was horribly optimized. On my system at the time it wouldn't have been playable. That's a good reason to dismiss the game. Then you should probably also differentiate a bit to give your opinion more credibility. For example by saying that not all parts of the game are bad, the performance is simply a dealbreaker.\n\nBesides not learning anything you're also excusing yourself for your behaviour and lumping other people in with yourself:\n\n&gt; Of course because the original trilogy is so dear to us all, it's natural to be protective and want to be cynical towards any new iterations\n\nIs it natural to be protective of something dear to yourself? Yes it is. But what does it have to do with the discussion at hand?\n\nWere you being protective when you were laughing at \"My face is tired\" memes and upvoting them? Were you protective when you were watching bug videos on YT? Were you being protective when you decided it was a \"steaming pile of shit\"?\n\nThe answer is there's no connection. You know you weren't being protective. You're just writing it there to bridge the massive gap between being looking at something objectively and trashtalking it to rid yourself of responsibility. You're making up excuses for your behaviour.\n\nAnd then you pretend that it's natural of course because the OT is so dear to **us** all?\n\n&gt; Of course because the original trilogy is so dear to us all, it's natural to be protective and want to be cynical towards any new iterations\n\nWhy do you write **us**?\n\nWe already established that you equate being protective with hopping on the bandwagon of trashtalking a game. How come you are suggesting that the reader did the same thing \"naturally\"?\n\nWhen did a post of you admitting that you fucked up turn into you forgiving the reader for his mistake?\n\nFor god's sake. Just own up to it. Show some integrity. You became an idiot when you jumped on the bandwagon. You had a chance to see why it wasn't smart and to learn from it. You didn't do that even though you spent time on the topic. That makes you an idiot twice.\n\nSo far you've shown you haven't learned the right lesson, you alleged the reader showed the same behaviour as you did and took out the right to forgive the reader alongside yourself.\n\nWhat's the point of your post? You haven't learned anything. You don't own up to your mistakes.\n\nThere's no knowledge to be gained here, there's no insight. \n\nAaaaaand it goes on.\n\nThis commenter [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/65d3jo/no_spoilers_i_jumped_on_the_hatewagon_for_this/dg9o2pj/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=masseffect) questions why you think your opinion is worth something or even equally valid to someone who has played the entire game.\n\nYou commented with some bullshit comparison amounting to nothing else than that you think your original opinion was valid. You wrote that on your own post in which you pretend that you've learned your lesson on **exactly** that point.\n\nJust let that sink in.\n\nI called you out on it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/65d3jo/no_spoilers_i_jumped_on_the_hatewagon_for_this/dg9x0ac/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=masseffect) making absolutely valid points.\n\nAnd what do you do? You delete your comment but you leave your post up.\n\nEveryone has a reason to do what they do. I've told you why I'm writing this comment. You had a reason to create your post. \n\nYou didn't have any insight to share. You weren't here to make a point how it's easy to end up joining a bandwagon. You weren't here to make a point how and why reviews etc. are to be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nThe comment you deleted got downvoted rather heavily. Your post got upvoted. You delte your comment but leave the post up. Are you looking for upvotes?\n\nYour post elicited mostly support in the comments, your comment only resulted in me calling you out. Are you looking to be pat on the back? Do you need someone to tell you how awesome you are? How you're better than all of the other people who trashtalked Andromeda? Do you need someone to tell you it's ok? Are you simply looking for attention?\n\nYou were being an idiot two times so far. I provided all the tools for you to understand how you're being an idiot and even gave you some additional information to take into account next time around. I gave you the chance to revoke your idiot status.\n\nLet's see what you did with that.\n\n&gt; EDIT 3: I'm sorry I'm not the best at forming arguments...but oh well. This community is usually nice but yeah ok my opinion is \"worthless\" and i'm just here to \"rake in that sweet karma\" sure ok.\n\nReally? You can't be serious right? That's 3/3 idiots, perfect score.\n\nThat's what makes you a persistent idiot. \n\nYou're not bad at forming arguements. You communicated your beliefs perfectly. Your beliefs are just stupid. That's all there is to it.\n\nI've also told you that your opinion is worthless due to how you've formed it. There's a difference. If you're not here to rake in that sweet karma then what are you here for?\n\nWhy are you on a website for discussions when you're clearly not here for a discussion? Why do you voice your opinion when you don't want to have it challenged? Why do you even read other people's comments when you're not willing to take in what they say?\n\nWhat does that make you? :-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey.

I&amp;#39;m the guy who wrote &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/65d3jo/no_spoilers_i_jumped_on_the_hatewagon_for_this/dg9x0ac/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=masseffect\"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt; which prompted this edit of yours:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 3: I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m not the best at forming arguments...but oh well. This community is usually nice but yeah ok my opinion is &amp;quot;worthless&amp;quot; and i&amp;#39;m just here to &amp;quot;rake in that sweet karma&amp;quot; sure ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On reddit everyone values civil discourses highly. Insulting other people or belittling them shuts people out of discussions even if their points are valid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite this being the usual stance in the comments I&amp;#39;m writing this simply because I think you&amp;#39;re an idiot and I want to let you know what makes you an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a quote from you:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Honesty is always the best policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idiots annoy me. Persistent idiots annoy me more. You&amp;#39;re a persistent idiot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You made this post to show you went from someone hating the game for a bad reason to actually playing it and enjoying it. Your ending statement is the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course because the original trilogy is so dear to us all, it&amp;#39;s natural to be protective and want to be cynical towards any new iterations, but this has taught me not to dismiss a game before even trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s supposed to show how you&amp;#39;ve learned from your experience but it really doesn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;this has taught me not to dismiss a game before even trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s your take away. It shows you haven&amp;#39;t actually identified the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You CAN dismiss a game without trying it out. You should just have a good justification. Batman: Arkham Knight was horribly optimized. On my system at the time it wouldn&amp;#39;t have been playable. That&amp;#39;s a good reason to dismiss the game. Then you should probably also differentiate a bit to give your opinion more credibility. For example by saying that not all parts of the game are bad, the performance is simply a dealbreaker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides not learning anything you&amp;#39;re also excusing yourself for your behaviour and lumping other people in with yourself:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course because the original trilogy is so dear to us all, it&amp;#39;s natural to be protective and want to be cynical towards any new iterations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it natural to be protective of something dear to yourself? Yes it is. But what does it have to do with the discussion at hand?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Were you being protective when you were laughing at &amp;quot;My face is tired&amp;quot; memes and upvoting them? Were you protective when you were watching bug videos on YT? Were you being protective when you decided it was a &amp;quot;steaming pile of shit&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer is there&amp;#39;s no connection. You know you weren&amp;#39;t being protective. You&amp;#39;re just writing it there to bridge the massive gap between being looking at something objectively and trashtalking it to rid yourself of responsibility. You&amp;#39;re making up excuses for your behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then you pretend that it&amp;#39;s natural of course because the OT is so dear to &lt;strong&gt;us&lt;/strong&gt; all?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course because the original trilogy is so dear to us all, it&amp;#39;s natural to be protective and want to be cynical towards any new iterations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do you write &lt;strong&gt;us&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We already established that you equate being protective with hopping on the bandwagon of trashtalking a game. How come you are suggesting that the reader did the same thing &amp;quot;naturally&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When did a post of you admitting that you fucked up turn into you forgiving the reader for his mistake?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For god&amp;#39;s sake. Just own up to it. Show some integrity. You became an idiot when you jumped on the bandwagon. You had a chance to see why it wasn&amp;#39;t smart and to learn from it. You didn&amp;#39;t do that even though you spent time on the topic. That makes you an idiot twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far you&amp;#39;ve shown you haven&amp;#39;t learned the right lesson, you alleged the reader showed the same behaviour as you did and took out the right to forgive the reader alongside yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the point of your post? You haven&amp;#39;t learned anything. You don&amp;#39;t own up to your mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no knowledge to be gained here, there&amp;#39;s no insight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aaaaaand it goes on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This commenter &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/65d3jo/no_spoilers_i_jumped_on_the_hatewagon_for_this/dg9o2pj/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=masseffect\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; questions why you think your opinion is worth something or even equally valid to someone who has played the entire game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You commented with some bullshit comparison amounting to nothing else than that you think your original opinion was valid. You wrote that on your own post in which you pretend that you&amp;#39;ve learned your lesson on &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just let that sink in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called you out on it &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/65d3jo/no_spoilers_i_jumped_on_the_hatewagon_for_this/dg9x0ac/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=masseffect\"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; making absolutely valid points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what do you do? You delete your comment but you leave your post up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a reason to do what they do. I&amp;#39;ve told you why I&amp;#39;m writing this comment. You had a reason to create your post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t have any insight to share. You weren&amp;#39;t here to make a point how it&amp;#39;s easy to end up joining a bandwagon. You weren&amp;#39;t here to make a point how and why reviews etc. are to be taken with a grain of salt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The comment you deleted got downvoted rather heavily. Your post got upvoted. You delte your comment but leave the post up. Are you looking for upvotes?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your post elicited mostly support in the comments, your comment only resulted in me calling you out. Are you looking to be pat on the back? Do you need someone to tell you how awesome you are? How you&amp;#39;re better than all of the other people who trashtalked Andromeda? Do you need someone to tell you it&amp;#39;s ok? Are you simply looking for attention?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You were being an idiot two times so far. I provided all the tools for you to understand how you&amp;#39;re being an idiot and even gave you some additional information to take into account next time around. I gave you the chance to revoke your idiot status.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see what you did with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 3: I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m not the best at forming arguments...but oh well. This community is usually nice but yeah ok my opinion is &amp;quot;worthless&amp;quot; and i&amp;#39;m just here to &amp;quot;rake in that sweet karma&amp;quot; sure ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really? You can&amp;#39;t be serious right? That&amp;#39;s 3/3 idiots, perfect score.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what makes you a persistent idiot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re not bad at forming arguements. You communicated your beliefs perfectly. Your beliefs are just stupid. That&amp;#39;s all there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also told you that your opinion is worthless due to how you&amp;#39;ve formed it. There&amp;#39;s a difference. If you&amp;#39;re not here to rake in that sweet karma then what are you here for?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why are you on a website for discussions when you&amp;#39;re clearly not here for a discussion? Why do you voice your opinion when you don&amp;#39;t want to have it challenged?

Andromeda still has plenty of issues to work out but it will only get better with time, and I hope more people like yourself give it a chance when they want to. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg9hvtz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492221634.0, "created_utc": 1492192834.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d3jo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d3jo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9w86x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ExceedLimits", "parent_id": "t1_dg9auyk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "YouTube comments should never really be taken seriously", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouTube comments should never really be taken seriously&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg9w86x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492239439.0, "created_utc": 1492210639.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d3jo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d3jo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgblzgo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PFTigerstripes", "parent_id": "t1_dg9r1ar", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;  independent reviewers like AJS (angry joe) or gameranx\n\nNo matter how independent you think a major YouTube face is, remember that they literally make their living through popularity and page views.\n\nOn top of that they are people, made even more susceptible to group-think because of their public position, and need to remain popular in the mainstream.
