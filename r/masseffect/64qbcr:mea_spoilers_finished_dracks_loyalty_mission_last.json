The krogan infertility problem never made much sense but at least we could reason females were just very rare. Now we know they&amp;#39;re not. Even if they&amp;#39;re all genophage afflicted each of those can produce one baby per year. The krogan really have no problem at all. Edge of extinction my ass. In a few years they&amp;#39;ll takeover the other Milky Way races and that&amp;#39;s not accounting for the slight amelioration of the genophage, or the possible cure that research into Okeer&amp;#39;s data might lead to which will allow each of those females to have 1000 babies a year. The lore is now officially nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg503ao", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491976957.0, "created_utc": 1491948157.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -15}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4vfc7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 51, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aksoileau", "parent_id": "t1_dg4uo5v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A dorky krogan that likes horticulture, never thought I'd see the day.
