BioWare sets up the BioWare Base at most of these, where they rent out a room and interact with the fans. Sometimes they&amp;#39;ll host their own panels. One year they ran their own fashion show, fitted out with its own catwalk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This year, the BioWare Base was naturally advertising ME:A. They had several PCs set up to test out the multiplayer. A small area was set aside to take the RC Nomad for a spin. They also had two word puzzles you could test your mental prowess on. If you completed all four challenges, you got a variety of patches. But the real prize was the chance to meet and interact with the devs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the special thing with BioWare. No other company goes to such lengths to meet their fans. I was able to meet two 343 Industries employees and squee over Halo, but I had to jump through hoops to make that happen. But for Mass Effect (and Dragon Age in years past), I simply had to walk into this room. If I tried to list all of the amazing people I&amp;#39;ve met, I&amp;#39;d be here all day. Suffice it to say, every year has been a treasure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I forgot to bring anything to get signed. Now, they always have little prints of DA or ME that they&amp;#39;re happy to give out, but it&amp;#39;s a lot more fun to have collector&amp;#39;s editions of the games or art books autographed. The one thing I did bring to PAX, however, was my laptop. So, I decided to cart that around, and over the course of three years created a &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/HywDCVW\"&gt;masterpiece.&lt;/a&gt; This also has Keythe Farley&amp;#39;s signature, who voiced the love of my life, Thane Krios.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran into a problem this year, however. I ran out of room on my laptop. So, I decided to cart my &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/UmyfbjO\"&gt;Xbone&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/4kfBWrt\"&gt;with me.&lt;/a&gt; It was a lovely blank canvas, after all. And yes, my arm did go numb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the course of three days, I got all but two of the signatures I wanted. When I mentioned this to the employees there, they actually texted one of the people I was missing to see where he was, so I could get his signature! Unfortunately, I missed the big one: Mac Walters, the Creative Director. No worries, the other BioWare people said. I could just mail him one of the prints, and he&amp;#39;d mail back his signature. They&amp;#39;d even let him know it was coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;#39;s what I did. I included a letter explaining just how much Mass Effect has meant to me over the years (I design nuclear subs for the Navy. One day, I wore my N7 hoodie down to one of the boats and one of the sailors called me Commander). And he sent me back free swag and another letter!\nPatrick Weekes fist bumped me for the piece of DA embroidery I was working on (that said my favorite phrase, taarsidath-an haalsam). Mike Gamble apologized to me for Thane&amp;#39;s death. I chatted for ten minutes with Ian Frazier about my personal headcanon. I talked to Jo Berry and Mike Laidlaw about hardcore porn fanfiction. These are all things I&amp;#39;m able to do because Bioware &lt;em&gt;cares.&lt;/em&gt; They care about their fans and are willing to meet us face to face to hear our stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I completely, 100% satisfied with Mass Effect Andromeda? No. I miss Shepard, Wrex, Garrus, Tali, and especially my space boyfriend, the love of my life, Thane Krios. But I love BioWare. So I will always stand by them.

He gets super butthurt if you don't romance him and every word that comes out of his mouth has me wanting to punch him.  *Flails a little in rage*\n\nDeep breaths.  Deeeeep breaths.  Romancing Thane is something that will drag your heart through the gutter and wring you dry.  You will get sucked in deep and never make it out alive.  He is space bae and space love and space sad.  Chris L'Etoile, who wrote Thane, sadly left the company shortly before ME2 launched, so they kind of bungled Thane's romance in ME3.  You can definitely tell there's a difference in quality between the two games.  I've had to come up with a very complicated and very sad headcanon in order to cope with the little we're given in the final game.  But he is space love.\n\nHis voice actor, Keythe Farley, is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met.  Another high point in my life.  And oh god that voice is sexy.  Even without the computer modulation his voice is like pure sex.\n\nAs for romancing Kaidan in ME3...he dumped me.  Plain and simple.  By me I of course mean Shepard because I can tell the difference between reality and a video game.  But he definitely dumped me on Horizon and while I headcanon that he's still madly in love with Shepard, he blew his chance.

The first thing he does when my glorious green boyfriend walks on the ship is insult him.  While my headcanon has a perfect suicide mission, I still love letting him die.  He gets super butthurt if you don&amp;#39;t romance him and every word that comes out of his mouth has me wanting to punch him.  &lt;em&gt;Flails a little in rage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deep breaths.  Deeeeep breaths.  Romancing Thane is something that will drag your heart through the gutter and wring you dry.  You will get sucked in deep and never make it out alive.  He is space bae and space love and space sad.  Chris L&amp;#39;Etoile, who wrote Thane, sadly left the company shortly before ME2 launched, so they kind of bungled Thane&amp;#39;s romance in ME3.  You can definitely tell there&amp;#39;s a difference in quality between the two games.  I&amp;#39;ve had to come up with a very complicated and very sad headcanon in order to cope with the little we&amp;#39;re given in the final game.  But he is space love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His voice actor, Keythe Farley, is one of the sweetest guys I&amp;#39;ve ever met.  Another high point in my life.  And oh god that voice is sexy.  Even without the computer modulation his voice is like pure sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for romancing Kaidan in ME3...he dumped me.  Plain and simple.  By me I of course mean Shepard because I can tell the difference between reality and a video game.  But he definitely dumped me on Horizon and while I headcanon that he&amp;#39;s still madly in love with Shepard, he blew his chance.
