The openness is never so vast as to feel tedious, and there&amp;#39;s heaps of both primary and secondary objectives throughout the game world. Andromeda probably has more open space, but The Witcher 3 made better use of its space, for sure. That&amp;#39;s not to say it was a perfect game, and that it didn&amp;#39;t suffer some of the same open world issues with regards to encounter design, but by and large it handled them much better. It definitely feels better to be guided through an open world and into the story-focused, linear segment that it does to simply talk to an NPC to start a loading screen to fly to the self-contained linear segments of Andromeda. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long-winded reply.

It was a good first time-experience, but the next 2 games were too good and spoiled it for me the subsequent times.\n\nFor ME2, it was one of the best. The ability to romance Tali, the multitude of new and old characters they introduce, the impact of the wonderful suicide mission, and how decisions in ME1 start to show up. The graphics were a big improvement, and the loyalty missions were a big part of getting to know each character. I enjoyed the combat and new abilities they added, but certain things really made me feel that ME3 was better. Combat-wise, on PC since the mouse sensitivity settings were so messed up, even after editing the coalesced.ini file, after immeditately cloaking and zooming in as infiltrator, the mouse sensitivity would go way up so I couldn't aim for a while. Other than that, having to constantly mine resources was a pain, as well as having to report back to the ship after every mission so you don't miss anything. I hated how sprint was limited, and how there was a limited variety of guns to use, with them mostly just straight-up one-upping each other. \n\nME3 was the best for me. I love combat in ME3, and all the combat options have such a wide variety such as the guns to use, squadmates to bring, and biotic combos. To be honest I really liked the story in ME3 the most. You get more one-on-one time with each character, plus I think the story helps to wrap up the whole series and the looming threat of the reapers. I liked the linear progression of slowly gathering all your forces to end up in the final battle against the long-standing foe. It was really nice that all the major decisions you made across the franchise just showed up in this game, and that you see the character development of everybody you've met across the games. My only complaints are the hub, and that the game really felt like it lost a lot of it's open-world elements in the sense that the only hub in the entire game was the citadel, a place with so many side-missions and floors that eventually it got tiring keeping up with all of them. I preferred to have less side-missions, or at least more missions that related more directly to the main story rather than going off and finding a dinosaur fossil on some planet.\n\nOverall, the Mass Effect Trilogy is probably one of my favourite if not my absolute favourite game series. I spent hours remembering all the story-aspects of the game and the characters they involve. The part I like the best about the series is that there is sometimes a \"perfect\" solution to a situation, but not always. It depends on the player most of the time and situational needs depending on the story that they craft. I think Mass Effect 3 really did a good job of consolidating all the decisions a player makes across the trilogy in that sense. You may want to just kill all the colonists in ME1, but what if you need the war assets in ME3? What if you want plan to keep mordin alive in ME3?
