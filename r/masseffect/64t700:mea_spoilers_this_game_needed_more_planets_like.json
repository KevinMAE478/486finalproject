SO much fun and gave me that &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a space explorer&amp;quot; feeling like nothing else. Plus having Vetra and Peebee with me, their banter was priceless. Peebee discovering that pretty much everyone else gets to drive the Nomad except her :P And SAM telling me that I will DIE if I leave the Nomad because I by default pushed the exit button out of reflex when I stopped and wanted to go explore, forgetting for a moment that I couldn&amp;#39;t. Loved it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m only about 50% through the game and I haven&amp;#39;t been to Eladeen yet but H-047c was super fun and wonderfully different.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg5lt4q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492010895.0, "created_utc": 1491982095.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t700", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5lwsb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NightTimeElk", "parent_id": "t3_64t700", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Highlight of that one for me was when I had Drack in my squad and I made a huge jump and he was just laughing his ass off.
