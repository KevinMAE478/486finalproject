Pretty much every game system acts completely independently from every other system, and only come together when there was no possibly way to keep them apart. There&amp;#39;s a lot of evidence to support my theory too: everything from the MSQ not needing any planet gameplay to the inventory system essentially being a hub for looting, equipment, mods, and crafting to all come together in a giant mess.
