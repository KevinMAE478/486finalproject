The open world and the nomad are great (imo, though I keep hearing some don't like it).

You destroyed Sovereign and delayed the arrival of the reapers.  You knew the next game would be about their arrival (well, so you thought--they decided to ignore their own plot in ME 2, but that's another topic).  \n \nIn Andromeda, you're introduced to a lot of things, but you're not really given information on any of them (in-game, or in the codex).  Like you just don't know.  They introduce things without any explanation or backstory, and that's a FUNDAMENTAL flaw of the game, imo.  ME 1 introduced the entire 'galaxy' of the Milky Way as a space-faring civilization as we know it, introduced Turians, Krogan, Asari, Salarians, Rachni, Quarians, and you got a good grasp of what they ALL were about in that one game.  ME 1 did exploration and discovery better than Andromeda did.. over a decade later.\n\nThe Jetpack is awesome, but the skills were not.  They took away some of the really cool skills (like Lash, Warp, Adrenaline Rush (it had a time-dilation effect Turbocharge doesn't), Sabotage, Barrier, Tech Armor), not to mention all of the Ammo powers, and either got rid of them, or nerfed them hard (Tech Armor, Barrier is now fairly crappy passive, and Ammo powers are consumables.. in SP.. ugh).  You have this massive list of skills and some of them are not unique.. the game did not need to have both Cryo Beam and Flamethrower.  That could have easily been made into some sort of customization option for the skill.  \n\nAnd then there's the animations, which have been done to death but are an obvious weakpoint.\n\nPlus there's the fact that somehow, despite the same team making the MP for 3 and Andromeda, the MP in 3 was WAY more fun than Andromeda's (and better balanced, and had more unique characters).  Andromeda's MP is basically an example of how to turn a casual horde-mode extra content into a huge grind, as you have to unlock every character 10 times to get all their skill points and appearance options, on top of getting all the guns and mods to 10.\n\nAndromeda isn't a bad game.  But I am 100% confident in saying it does not meet the standards and the expectations every Mass Effect game has set prior, and that's a real shame, because I wanted it to.

You knew the next game would be about their arrival (well, so you thought--they decided to ignore their own plot in ME 2, but that&amp;#39;s another topic).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Andromeda, you&amp;#39;re introduced to a lot of things, but you&amp;#39;re not really given information on any of them (in-game, or in the codex).  Like you just don&amp;#39;t know.  They introduce things without any explanation or backstory, and that&amp;#39;s a FUNDAMENTAL flaw of the game, imo.  ME 1 introduced the entire &amp;#39;galaxy&amp;#39; of the Milky Way as a space-faring civilization as we know it, introduced Turians, Krogan, Asari, Salarians, Rachni, Quarians, and you got a good grasp of what they ALL were about in that one game.  ME 1 did exploration and discovery better than Andromeda did.. over a decade later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jetpack is awesome, but the skills were not.  They took away some of the really cool skills (like Lash, Warp, Adrenaline Rush (it had a time-dilation effect Turbocharge doesn&amp;#39;t), Sabotage, Barrier, Tech Armor), not to mention all of the Ammo powers, and either got rid of them, or nerfed them hard (Tech Armor, Barrier is now fairly crappy passive, and Ammo powers are consumables.. in SP.. ugh).  You have this massive list of skills and some of them are not unique.. the game did not need to have both Cryo Beam and Flamethrower.  That could have easily been made into some sort of customization option for the skill.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s the animations, which have been done to death but are an obvious weakpoint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus there&amp;#39;s the fact that somehow, despite the same team making the MP for 3 and Andromeda, the MP in 3 was WAY more fun than Andromeda&amp;#39;s (and better balanced, and had more unique characters).  Andromeda&amp;#39;s MP is basically an example of how to turn a casual horde-mode extra content into a huge grind, as you have to unlock every character 10 times to get all their skill points and appearance options, on top of getting all the guns and mods to 10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andromeda isn&amp;#39;t a bad game.  But I am 100% confident in saying it does not meet the standards and the expectations every Mass Effect game has set prior, and that&amp;#39;s a real shame, because I wanted it to.  I pre-ordered the most expensive Andromeda because I was that loyal to the series and wanted to show that, but I will probably wait and see when it comes to next one if I want to bother, because unless they fix a lot of stuff, it might not be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg8u1p7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492178228.0, "created_utc": 1492149428.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658llw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658llw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658llw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658llw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg99q18", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Raven_Crows", "parent_id": "t1_dg8dn9l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hear hear.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hear hear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg99q18", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492212316.0, "created_utc": 1492183516.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8dn9l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Atheran", "parent_id": "t1_dg8cept", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In that case, I'll say that I liked the game as well, but not loved it.

AS you said, there are issues, and I&amp;#39;m hoping the upcoming patches fixes the issues. Personally, I didn&amp;#39;t have any bugs or odd animations like I&amp;#39;ve seen in those videos. Even if I did, I&amp;#39;d probably just laugh and keep playing, because I enjoy the story and characters. I agree with you that it&amp;#39;s not a good mindset, especially when it&amp;#39;s unwarranted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, I don&amp;#39;t really care if the majority like or dislike something. I hope others enjoy things of course, but in the end, it&amp;#39;s up to me if I like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg96t12", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492208642.0, "created_utc": 1492179842.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658llw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg99mu2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jaikarro", "parent_id": "t3_658llw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think one part of it is that there is no room for nuance on the internet, especially on Reddit.
