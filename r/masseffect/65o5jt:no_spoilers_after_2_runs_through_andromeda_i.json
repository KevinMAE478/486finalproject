Wrex is the tough mercenary, Garrus is the rogue cop, Tali is the inexperienced girl, Liara is the bookish researcher, and Kaidan and Ashley serve to 'experience the universe' alongside the player- giving context to issues like biotics, religion, and alien relationships in the Mass Effect universe.
