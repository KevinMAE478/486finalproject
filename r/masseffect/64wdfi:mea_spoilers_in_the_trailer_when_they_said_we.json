That's one sentence from one author several years ago without remotely having any data or idea how big the game is. The actual game is built on another engine, with higher graphics, no more reusable assets from previous games, several times as big map and twice as much dialogue. And if people quote the Witcher 3 which is similarly sized game built in Poland with a budget of 60 (?) million USD I wouldn't be surprised if ME:A built in Canada cost $80 or $100 million to make excluding marketing.
