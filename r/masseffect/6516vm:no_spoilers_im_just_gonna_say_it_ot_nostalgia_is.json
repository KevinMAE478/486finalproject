Some companion quests were awesome to me (liam&amp;#39;s was funny and condensed, vetra had an interesting one) while others just ticked me off. Peebee and Drack&amp;#39;s, while they had compelling stories, just never seemed to end! A couple of times I stumbled on some content and had forgotten that I hadn&amp;#39;t finished it yet. Jaal&amp;#39;s was the worst though. I just didn&amp;#39;t care. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said I thought some of the sidequests you could stumble on were really interesting. I liked the ice cave quest on voeld and the seismic hammer quest on eos. They offered decisions that really questioned your values.

Same thing with CDPR and the Witcher franchise. Cyberpunk has big shoes to fill being made in a post Witcher 3 world, as did ME:A. \n\nI think the game has some good ideas but falls flat in executing them but to pretend like we shouldn't compare the OT when this franchise should be good at doing the things the OT did is kind of silly.

Going to the opposite extreme and saying we can't then use that comparison to see where the game needs to improve or didn't deliver on being a \"good\" Mass Effect title is just going to shut down even more conversations, which I find counter productive. \n\nEven ignoring the OT we still have the fact that there are loading screens all over the place, tedious mechanics that do nothing more than pad game time, and broken systems or broken quests and lore that doesn't make sense in some places. \n\nI haven't met a single person who's played it extensively who can deny that there IS a Mass Effect buried underneath all this, but I'd say if this was any new or unknown IP we would not have spent the many hours on it pressing on to find it.

It&amp;#39;s how people make conclusions on their work, they compare to their other works and see how they improve or explore other avenues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To use a popular example now, Yoko Taro has been making (narratively) innovative and &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; titles and they get compared to the others both in gameplay and narrative in order to see how that content creator develops. Same thing with CDPR and the Witcher franchise. Cyberpunk has big shoes to fill being made in a post Witcher 3 world, as did ME:A. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the game has some good ideas but falls flat in executing them but to pretend like we shouldn&amp;#39;t compare the OT when this franchise should be good at doing the things the OT did is kind of silly. I feel this is one of those &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m clearly better than you because I can forget all the things Bioware has done better than this game before and just get lost in a game that gates a ton of content away or wastes your time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even ignoring the previous Trilogy a lot of the complaints come from the fact that even just talking Frostbite DA:I did more than ME:A has done, and ignoring JUST the combat comparing on a narrative/mechanic design level seems like an inferior game design wise. I know people have spent 100+ hours in it but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you weren&amp;#39;t yourself using your love of the previous franchise to stick with the game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#39;s definitely some nostalgia involved with a lot of critiques on the game but most conversations I&amp;#39;ve had about the narratives are less about the OT being superior but more wondering why we have, in a game made 5 years later by a AAA studio, less than a previous trilogy offered us. Going to the opposite extreme and saying we can&amp;#39;t then use that comparison to see where the game needs to improve or didn&amp;#39;t deliver on being a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; Mass Effect title is just going to shut down even more conversations, which I find counter productive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even ignoring the OT we still have the fact that there are loading screens all over the place, tedious mechanics that do nothing more than pad game time, and broken systems or broken quests and lore that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense in some places. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t met a single person who&amp;#39;s played it extensively who can deny that there IS a Mass Effect buried underneath all this, but I&amp;#39;d say if this was any new or unknown IP we would not have spent the many hours on it pressing on to find it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg6yuez", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492077812.0, "created_utc": 1492049012.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6516vm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg789bb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NeutralUnknown", "parent_id": "t3_6516vm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So basically, you enjoyed the game and don't want anyone ruining your mood with their criticism of areas they weren't satisfied with. \n\nUnfortunately for you, there will be comparisons between an immensely successful trilogy and its successor of the same franchise, as well as people that disagree with your equally-not-objective opinions on what the game did right and wrong.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So basically, you enjoyed the game and don&amp;#39;t want anyone ruining your mood with their criticism of areas they weren&amp;#39;t satisfied with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for you, there will be comparisons between an immensely successful trilogy and its successor of the same franchise, as well as people that disagree with your equally-not-objective opinions on what the game did right and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg789bb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492092409.0, "created_utc": 1492063609.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6516vm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7175e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DasGanon", "parent_id": "t3_6516vm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I will say this, there is one story condition that I am *happy* that MEA burned and threw to the ground that the OT had.\n\nCharisma points.\n\nEvery single game, \"What's the first thing I'm leveling?

ME 1 widely considered to have the best story and lore with mixed feelings about its combat depending on who you ask. ME 2 having arguably the weakest story but good character development and side quests, and better DLC (mostly). Then ME 3 which is extremely controversial with many hating it from start to finish for fucking over ME&amp;#39;s lore and such and some enjoying the combat and character interactions and such, some disliking it in entirety, others liking its multiplayer (a strange feature for a story rpg series) and other such things.

Nice crack at ME3 ending, but that is exactly how MEA has been handling choices. Half of which make more trucking sense, the other half don't matter. So far the game doesn't handle choices well. However I'm willing to give it a pass since it was mostly in ME2 and 3 which the choices taken in 1 are felt.

But because all your previous choices were strong and well made moments but the ending invalidated them all by letting you pick whichever ending you prefer. And fuck that stupid deus ex machina green ending. \n\n&gt; Somtimes I feel like I'm the odd one out for not leaving the OT at the door when booting MEA up. \n\nIt's not about leaving the OT behind and starting fresh. it's about wanting improvements and holding the OT as a stepping stone. And so far it doesn't feel like MEA used any of the previous 3 as a stepping stone and instead used Dragon Age Inquisition. \n\n&gt; But it's over and it ain't coming back so I moved on and got lost in another, slightly different galaxy. \n\nPersonally I'm just going to move on from the series if it keeps going with this formulaic \"open world\" genre of games a la MEA and DAI. I don't need to watch something I loved crash and burn in a pile of it's own making. \n\n&gt; Funny thing is, instead of looking at this game with nostalgia I let the game trigger the nostalgia for me.. which directly improved my experience.\n\nWhich is the problem. MEA shouldn't be about reliving the past, but about new experiences and attempts at writing a fresh intergalactic epic drama. Instead we get a rather well done game (technical issues aside) that delivers nothing fresh or new like the previous 3 did. \n\nAnd you know hat the greatest offence of MEA is too me?
