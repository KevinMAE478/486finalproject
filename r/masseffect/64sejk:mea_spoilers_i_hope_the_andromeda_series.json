Still, though, for those disappointing aspects there&amp;#39;s a great bit of hope. Given that we&amp;#39;ve only seen Heleus, one cluster in the galaxy, and though we&amp;#39;ve been told the Kett empire is large, galaxies are huge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My hope is that though the Kett will play a part, hopefully more interesting as we find the whole scope of their society, and (please God) get to see them as a bit more than pure evil, but that their empire won&amp;#39;t be the only thing to interact with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally have them only on one border and have a significant expanse you can explore. They were severely lacking as far as native interactions and the darker side of being a colonist invading a new land and I&amp;#39;ve seen plenty say it here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bioware seems more keen to listen to its players now (given the game&amp;#39;s ending they seemed to have taken some complaints regarding ME3&amp;#39;s ending into consideration). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they&amp;#39;ll see the disappointment and apathy that the Kett have so far been met with and will in turn try to not focus entirely on them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Give us the exploration, hosts of new races to meet and form relationships (positive and negative) with, and other aspects we clearly desire, and spice up the Kett where they are involved. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg54p8v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491983015.0, "created_utc": 1491954215.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sejk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sejk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg60jv6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pjc_nxnw", "parent_id": "t1_dg58ojk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And that's fine.

So I made sure I installed all the DLC and hit it. In the middle of 3 now. One thing that strikes me is how *cinematic* it is in comparison.\n\nI liked Andromeda, but I *love* the original trilogy. There's more quality to the content and going through all three back to back is an amazing experience (Citadel dlc is necessary imo). \n\nHowever it also highlights the flaws of ME:A for me. Andromeda needs more character focus, and the exploration is pretty and fun for a while but gets repetitive and lacks substance.\n\nPersonally I'd rather have had them spend that effort on quality character development and side quests (a good example for quests is Witcher 3, and characters kotor 2 or me2). Car conversations are great but I felt like they ended up relying on it too much for character development, and player conversation suffered.\n\nAlso better writing, but that's probably asking to much and it's not *bad* as is. They're very slowly getting better but I doubt it'll ever be what it was. Bioware means something a bit different these days, but that's its own conversation.   \n\nI get that people like exploration and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. In my opinion it just feels more watered down and seems to be a bunch of pretty views and busy work.\n\nWith Inquisition and Andromeda it seems like this is the direction Bioware is headed though. To me that's a shame, but it's better than DA2 and I'll still probably play their games. I just won't be super excited for their release. Then again ever since DA2 I've been super reserved about them haha, Inquisition was actually a huge pleasant suprise. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m with you on this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I beat Andromeda it made me really want to replay the Trilogy again. So I made sure I installed all the DLC and hit it. In the middle of 3 now. One thing that strikes me is how &lt;em&gt;cinematic&lt;/em&gt; it is in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I liked Andromeda, but I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the original trilogy. There&amp;#39;s more quality to the content and going through all three back to back is an amazing experience (Citadel dlc is necessary imo). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However it also highlights the flaws of ME:A for me. Andromeda needs more character focus, and the exploration is pretty and fun for a while but gets repetitive and lacks substance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally I&amp;#39;d rather have had them spend that effort on quality character development and side quests (a good example for quests is Witcher 3, and characters kotor 2 or me2). Car conversations are great but I felt like they ended up relying on it too much for character development, and player conversation suffered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also better writing, but that&amp;#39;s probably asking to much and it&amp;#39;s not &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; as is. They&amp;#39;re very slowly getting better but I doubt it&amp;#39;ll ever be what it was. Bioware means something a bit different these days, but that&amp;#39;s its own conversation.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get that people like exploration and there&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with that. In my opinion it just feels more watered down and seems to be a bunch of pretty views and busy work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Inquisition and Andromeda it seems like this is the direction Bioware is headed though. To me that&amp;#39;s a shame, but it&amp;#39;s better than DA2 and I&amp;#39;ll still probably play their games. I just won&amp;#39;t be super excited for their release.

Fun to drive. \n* Detail of Environments - Beautiful skyboxes, fauna, terrain and natural wonders.  I can't give this enough credit, worldbuilding team was on point.\n* Vaults - While the activation process was relatively the same everywhere, the vaults themselves were unique enough and a good addition.\n* Scanning - while overdone at times, I feel like this addition helped with the theme of exploration, and helped immersion.\n\nNeutral\n\n* Quests - Both games had fetch and collection quests that were overdone. I still think ME:A has overdone it with too many scan/kill/find 3 things and get nav point missions, those needed more story or depth.\n* Reused environments - both games re-used things like enemy bases, outposts, etc.  In both cases it sometimes made sense, and other times not really, but I don't think it's a big deal.  Its a ridiculous expectation for a unique texture and layout for every quest location.\n\nWorse:\n\n* Map Density - As I said, you just have too much stuff that reduces the wonder.
