They are an entire empire of zealots which sees every single species as inferior insects at worst, and genetic banks at best.\n\nThe reapers huskified you quickly and you lose your memories/consciousness in the process.\n\nThe kett commit a plethora of inhumane experiments to research a way to exalt your species. After that is found, they exalt the \"worthy\" and kill off the rest. Now youre an eternal slave, and will be used as a pawn to repeat the process on countless other innocent species.\n\nExaltation also doesnt make you go all conrad verner for the archon. Kett troopers still retain their memories of old, but their mental conditioning makes them unable to resist. The Moshae spoke to many kett when she was captured, and many showed feelings of nostalgia and longing for their past lives.\nI would honestly prefer to be turned into a mindless techno zombie over being exalted.\n\nAlso, the kett are very adept at warfare, and the archon is described as a strategical genius. Look up, how he defeated all organized angaran resistance when he first arrived in the cluster, its very brilliant.\n\nHowever, by the end of the game the archon loses it completely for some unknown reason.\nWhen he finds the Human ark, he should have destroyed the nexus and taken all arks hostage for exaltation. In one swift move, enemy leadership is dead, and you have alot of new test subjects. Maybe Primus would have stopped her rebellion after seeing that.\nHe probably also saw where Aya is in Ryder's memories. Why not invade it and destroy what remains of the angaran leadership?\n\nHe did none of these moves, which is very weird as the archon is not supposed to be stupid at all. He has conquered and exalted hundreds before us, so why did he miscalculate so badly?\nSomething changed him. Primus states that something is seriously wrong with him, as hes becoming more and more unhinged and unsettlingly obsessed with Meridian.\nAnd for Primus to go against her superior, something very serious should have justified it. We dont know what that is.\n\nAlso the kett have a bigass empire somewhere in andromeda. Our Archon is one of many, and when another, saner, archon arrives with overwhelming force we will probably be screwed.\n\nBut something I didnt like about the kett, was how the archon was the only kett with a unique model.\n\nAll the ascendants looked the same, which sucks because they are supposed to have free will and individuality. Its also boring to have the same boss fight over and over again.I would have made them unique.\n\nSame with archon's sword. All game you get teased about how badass and feared this enforcer is, turns out shes a destined with more health.

They are an entire empire of zealots which sees every single species as inferior insects at worst, and genetic banks at best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reapers huskified you quickly and you lose your memories/consciousness in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kett commit a plethora of inhumane experiments to research a way to exalt your species. After that is found, they exalt the &amp;quot;worthy&amp;quot; and kill off the rest. Now youre an eternal slave, and will be used as a pawn to repeat the process on countless other innocent species.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exaltation also doesnt make you go all conrad verner for the archon. Kett troopers still retain their memories of old, but their mental conditioning makes them unable to resist. The Moshae spoke to many kett when she was captured, and many showed feelings of nostalgia and longing for their past lives.\nI would honestly prefer to be turned into a mindless techno zombie over being exalted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the kett are very adept at warfare, and the archon is described as a strategical genius. Look up, how he defeated all organized angaran resistance when he first arrived in the cluster, its very brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, by the end of the game the archon loses it completely for some unknown reason.\nWhen he finds the Human ark, he should have destroyed the nexus and taken all arks hostage for exaltation. In one swift move, enemy leadership is dead, and you have alot of new test subjects. Maybe Primus would have stopped her rebellion after seeing that.\nHe probably also saw where Aya is in Ryder&amp;#39;s memories. Why not invade it and destroy what remains of the angaran leadership?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did none of these moves, which is very weird as the archon is not supposed to be stupid at all. He has conquered and exalted hundreds before us, so why did he miscalculate so badly?\nSomething changed him. Primus states that something is seriously wrong with him, as hes becoming more and more unhinged and unsettlingly obsessed with Meridian.\nAnd for Primus to go against her superior, something very serious should have justified it. We dont know what that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the kett have a bigass empire somewhere in andromeda. Our Archon is one of many, and when another, saner, archon arrives with overwhelming force we will probably be screwed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But something I didnt like about the kett, was how the archon was the only kett with a unique model.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the ascendants looked the same, which sucks because they are supposed to have free will and individuality. Its also boring to have the same boss fight over and over again.I would have made them unique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same with archon&amp;#39;s sword.
