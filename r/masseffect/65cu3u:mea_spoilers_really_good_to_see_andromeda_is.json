But if we&amp;#39;re being totally honest, SJW is a pejorative used to dismiss the content of someone&amp;#39;s arguments.   Let&amp;#39;s put the shoe on the other foot, if straight males only had two romance options, and needed to have one gay romance scene to complete the romance achievement, would we label people who complained about that as SJWs?  Or do we only use that term to dismiss people who complain for representation that isn&amp;#39;t hetero-normative? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t  know the answers to those questions, necessarily.
