Creeperlava(the developer/mod author) made ALOT for both ME2 and ME3. Again ALOT replaces almost every texture in the game including all DLCs and is really easy to install. I got all my mods off Nexus but you can also use Mod DB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; if anyone is interested in replaying the series and wants all DLC for ME2 free and unlocked (you can even log in with your EA account to log into cerberus network) just send me a pm. I&amp;#39;ll shoot you the links and the easy to install dlc unlocked updated march of this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg663ep", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492045398.0, "created_utc": 1492016598.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 67}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z5aj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z5aj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg75lrd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Delsana", "parent_id": "t1_dg64tuz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I prefer the ME credit version.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I prefer the ME credit version.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg75lrd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492087255.0, "created_utc": 1492058455.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg64tuz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 22, "report_reasons": null, "author": "autoportret", "parent_id": "t3_64z5aj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Had this on in the background when I came across this thread ...
