The side stories are infinitely more interesting than the main story&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of the side stories and planet stories have a lot of what you are saying is missing.  The political maneuverings on Nexus are interesting.  The power struggle between the head people is interesting and how the pathfinders fit into it really intrigues me. \n If they go forward with this as a series I really hope we play a more intergral part in Nexus politics than we did with Citadel.  Kadara is interesting.  Sloane isn&amp;#39;t really good but neither is Reyes.  How that plays out is going to be nice.  The Krogan.  Honestly loving how they seem to have their shit together more than any other race.

Eos, Voeld, Eladeen feel the same -- you have a normal desert, an ice desert, and a rock desert with different names for their identical forms of radiation. The introduction to Voeld and Eladeen is mirrored -- too cold get to someplace warm; too hot get to someplace cool. It's a missed opportunity to have the radiations effects Ryders combat: no health regen (and no healing after prolonged exposure) on Eos, receive increased damage (and no sprinting after prolonged exposure) on Voeld, and a stamina bar on Eladeen.\n\nThe Angara look and sound the same. It's disappointing that a race in touch with their emotions all sound so laid back -- with only a few aggressors.\n\nThe Asari faces are one.\n\nI've only just started Eladeen, so I can't speak to the story there, but the planet is already familiar. I'm anticipating the \"activate 3 pillars and head to the Vault\" sameness. There is no desire to explore because I know what I'm in for. Or at least I think I do and I'd like to be surprised. \n\nI would have more tolerance for Andromeda's flaws if they were the results of trying something different. It doesn't seem to innovate anywhere, which is a shame because you can see the potential with some of the ideas. The Pathfinder Profiles are a great concept that could be a defining feature but there isn't a reason to switch out of your favorite one. You either have a teleport and passives, a shoulder drone and passives, or just passives. It's like BioWare had all these plans to differentiate from the OT but couldn't decide on a direction and then played it too safe becoming a parody of Shep adventures. The OT was Star Wars and Andromeda was meant to be Star Trek but is actually Space Balls.\n\nAndromeda falls short in areas that previous entries have knocked out of the park, a biggen being menu and UI navigation. The reintroduction of the Inventory tab is somewhat boggling given how little you can actually do with it. It holds all of your stuff but you can't change your weapons, armor, or consumables on the fly. Gathering resources is less fun than it was in previous installments -- tying resource acquisition to planet viability might have been nice. Essentially having you hand pick them until a certain viability and then let colonists do it for you. What the hell else are they doing?\n\nThe R&amp;D could've been meaningfully tied to exploration and discovery, instead you have access to everything at once and are gated by the quantity of scans instead of it's quality. You're constantly scanning the same console or door or remnant standing lamp.\n\nI would've loved to head out to the radiation zone on Eos, have found a cave with a plant that upon scanning gave SAM an idea for a new consumable.

Also bugs.\n\n------------------------------                ", "edited": 1492012508.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am glad this post exists because reading the points that were made about unrewarding  exploration, poor AI, and weak side quests kinda summarize why I am feeling underwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MY biggest issue with Andromeda is how much of the core game feels or looks the same. Eos, Voeld, Eladeen feel the same -- you have a normal desert, an ice desert, and a rock desert with different names for their identical forms of radiation. The introduction to Voeld and Eladeen is mirrored -- too cold get to someplace warm; too hot get to someplace cool. It&amp;#39;s a missed opportunity to have the radiations effects Ryders combat: no health regen (and no healing after prolonged exposure) on Eos, receive increased damage (and no sprinting after prolonged exposure) on Voeld, and a stamina bar on Eladeen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Angara look and sound the same. It&amp;#39;s disappointing that a race in touch with their emotions all sound so laid back -- with only a few aggressors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Asari faces are one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only just started Eladeen, so I can&amp;#39;t speak to the story there, but the planet is already familiar. I&amp;#39;m anticipating the &amp;quot;activate 3 pillars and head to the Vault&amp;quot; sameness. There is no desire to explore because I know what I&amp;#39;m in for. Or at least I think I do and I&amp;#39;d like to be surprised. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would have more tolerance for Andromeda&amp;#39;s flaws if they were the results of trying something different. It doesn&amp;#39;t seem to innovate anywhere, which is a shame because you can see the potential with some of the ideas. The Pathfinder Profiles are a great concept that could be a defining feature but there isn&amp;#39;t a reason to switch out of your favorite one. You either have a teleport and passives, a shoulder drone and passives, or just passives. It&amp;#39;s like BioWare had all these plans to differentiate from the OT but couldn&amp;#39;t decide on a direction and then played it too safe becoming a parody of Shep adventures. The OT was Star Wars and Andromeda was meant to be Star Trek but is actually Space Balls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andromeda falls short in areas that previous entries have knocked out of the park, a biggen being menu and UI navigation. The reintroduction of the Inventory tab is somewhat boggling given how little you can actually do with it. It holds all of your stuff but you can&amp;#39;t change your weapons, armor, or consumables on the fly. Gathering resources is less fun than it was in previous installments -- tying resource acquisition to planet viability might have been nice. Essentially having you hand pick them until a certain viability and then let colonists do it for you. What the hell else are they doing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The R&amp;amp;D could&amp;#39;ve been meaningfully tied to exploration and discovery, instead you have access to everything at once and are gated by the quantity of scans instead of it&amp;#39;s quality.

Unfortunately, when you actually get to the game, most of it is boring &amp;quot;scan rock or talk to person&amp;quot; busy work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This wouldn&amp;#39;t be a deal breaker if the story, world building and characters were amazing. Unfortunately they are not. The story and villain are generic as can be and lifts heavily from Mass Effect 1 (and Halo) but with far lower stakes and intrigue. The world building is almost non existent outside the Angara, and even they never become as interesting as say, the Geth, Quarians, or Krogan. This is a significant issue considering Andromeda essentially abandoned 95% of the lore from the Milky Way, but puts little effort into making up that difference. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To sum up my experience with Andromeda, by the time I got to the 30 hour mark, I just wanted the game to end. Having replayed the trilogy easily half a dozen times, I never thought I would get bored of an ME game halfway through my first playthrough. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dg5qarn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492024361.0, "created_utc": 1491995561.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 85}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wvvq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wvvq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5xxd3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 20, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheManWhoPanders", "parent_id": "t1_dg5oiwb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; If I'm honest with myself I think I'm sticking with the game because it's a Mass Effect game, and I like Mass Effect.
