Part of it might be length (they really did make it too long), but part of it is that I think  they gutted SP combat by removing squad mate powers (no real reason to make team combos then, just take the two you want to hear nomad banter for or the ones with buffs for your spec), part of it is 3 power limit (you feel oddly restricted and the profile system is not intuitive for flowing combat or fun at all).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But another part is the story.. it consistently reminds you that you are not as cool or worthy as your father, that you are special only because of your AI making you so, and your squadmates repeatedly kinda brush you off in cutscenes regardless of what you do.  Makes you kind of feel kind of weak, as opposed to Shepard, who was respected from the start by their crew and allies, while still having people to prove themselves to (the council, udina) and someone you didn&amp;#39;t want to let down (Anderson).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could never get into Ryder the same way as I did Shepard.  And I think that&amp;#39;s a sort of overlooked aspect of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dgajrcy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492284047.0, "created_utc": 1492255247.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hs79", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hs79", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hs79", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hs79", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hs79", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hs79", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hs79", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb5u56", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SzyjeCzapki", "parent_id": "t1_dgb4f7n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Messed up???", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Messed up???&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dgb5u56", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492318475.0, "created_utc": 1492289675.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb4f7n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sterlingphoenix", "parent_id": "t1_dgb336m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Eh, I don't feel like getting my PC all messed up at this point.
