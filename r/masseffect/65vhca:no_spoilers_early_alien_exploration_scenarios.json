I am dying to know what will happen with all the storylines revealed in ME:Andromeda and can see some totally epic followup games right now, but I waited years for essentially a lot of cliffhangers, unfinished ideas, some terrible MMO-like sidequests and the feeling this could&amp;#39;ve been so much better and less annoying (because all the loading sure was annoying).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read someone post that the reason you cannot board the Tempest on a planet is because it would&amp;#39;ve ment you could have been looking outside of the Tempests windows which would&amp;#39;ve ment them having to make all those alternate views (and before settling an outpost, even an additional outside area to see when on the bridge). This totally made sense to me, even there they had to save dev time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong the game isn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;bad&amp;#39;. I thoroughly enjoyed the main quest-line and the game felt as a &amp;#39;mass effect game&amp;#39; but I have for example no desire to replay it at all and am just feeling it could&amp;#39;ve been so much better than it already is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dgea1y3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492499024.0, "created_utc": 1492470224.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vhca", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdof6b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EndTrophy", "parent_id": "t1_dgdlgen", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Same with destiny", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same with destiny&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "masseffect", "name": "t1_dgdof6b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492474026.0, "created_utc": 1492445226.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdlgen", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 103, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ImN0tASynth", "parent_id": "t1_dgdhixe", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/masseffect", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The more i see and read about this game, the more i feel bad.
