However, the distance from these lights is pretty short and I would expect it difficult to get up to the 65mph speed limit (many drivers are going at least 70 even in the far right lane), and in general it is just difficult to match the speed of highway traffic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been many occasions where a car settles right next to you as you&amp;#39;re on the ramp lane (which will take you off the highway if you stay in it), blocking your ability to change onto a highway lane. Thankfully my vehicle is quick enough to move ahead of a car blocking the lane, but at times I will need to slow back down to get in the only gap behind the car in the first lane.
