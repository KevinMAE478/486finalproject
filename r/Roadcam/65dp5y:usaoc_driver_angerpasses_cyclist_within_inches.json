There&amp;#39;s plenty of examples of him &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/wfoXzYfFrpA?t=15\"&gt;blocking traffic in dark icy conditions at a green light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWKRvgh1otU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=10\"&gt;weaving between cars&lt;/a&gt;, or stopping in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ozxFYf70a4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=16\"&gt;middle of the road at night trying to block traffic with his body&lt;/a&gt;. He even distracts himself with &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZU14yk5KxU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=5\"&gt;texting&lt;/a&gt; and impairs his hearing with &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/oZU14yk5KxU?t=33\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;. Not to mention the examples of &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/wfoXzYfFrpA?t=71\"&gt;him harrassing people&lt;/a&gt; and following them around shouting at them while they&amp;#39;re going into the grocery store or to the library and calling it &amp;quot;attempted education&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and I&amp;#39;ve never had an incident like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the same point I keep repeating to him, but he doesn&amp;#39;t listen, and he quotes some bullshit statistic that it&amp;#39;s 28 times more dangerous to ride on the sidewalk, or to the side of a lane. I&amp;#39;ve never had incidents like this, yet this guy uploads 5-10 videos a &lt;em&gt;week&lt;/em&gt; of him having trouble with motorists. He&amp;#39;ll literally tell me &amp;quot;Well maybe you&amp;#39;re just stupid and you&amp;#39;ve forgotten all your near-death experiences&amp;quot; when I tell him my experience as a cyclist who rides on sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying cyclists should be forced to ride on sidewalks, or the door zone, and the motorist in this video is definitely in the wrong, but how about at least making a minimal effort to stay safe if you&amp;#39;re trying to fight for cyclist safety. But he&amp;#39;s not about being safe (hence the texting/music). His constant references to what is technically legal makes it clear that he cares about winning an argument more than being safe (&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Texting and cycling is legal, you should worry about what you&amp;#39;re doing, cager&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Roadcam", "name": "t1_dgac8vq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492263189.0, "created_utc": 1492234389.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6os", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dp5y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6os", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dp5y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6os", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dp5y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6os", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dp5y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6os", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dp5y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6os", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dp5y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6os", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dp5y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgau0ko", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mplsbikewrath", "parent_id": "t1_dgagmqk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Roadcam", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's really astonishing how you can admit I have no responsibility to behave the way you think I should on the road, but maintain that I should anyways, one sentence apart.

Light timing and rush hour and all that, y'know.\n\nFurther, I'm not sure, given that most people drive faster than the speed limit, why \"holding up\" traffic a bit would be a bad thing. The speed limit, first of all, is a requirement that drivers agreed to obey when they got their driver's license, and second of all, is the maximum someone should ever be traveling - not a goal state such that preventing a driver from reaching constitutes doing something \"wrong.\"\n\n&gt;Just because you can legally do it doesn't mean you should. \n\nSure, but given that it's safer for me to take more of the lane than you think I should most of the time, it's both legally permissible and also a good idea, so I'm not sure what point you're trying to make. My guess is that you just have no foggy notion what's involved in minimizing risk of death and injury as a cyclist.\n\n&gt;Drive a fucking car if you insist on being in the middle of the road.\n\nWhy? Then I wouldn't be able to eat as many Nutter Butters as I want and still stay thin, I'd get places slower, and I'd continually be sitting stopped in traffic rather than blasting past it.\n\n&gt;It looks like the cops even dont give a shit about you.
