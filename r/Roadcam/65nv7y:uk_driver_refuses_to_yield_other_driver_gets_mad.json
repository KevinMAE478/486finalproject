For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since the Late Mergeseems to address many of the problems experienced with the conventional mergeduring congestion, the UNL also conducted field studies (footnote 1)to compare the safety and operational effects of the PennDOTLate Mergeand the conventional merge. The results of these studies revealed that the conflict rates are substantially lower with the Late Merge. At higher densities, about 75 percent fewer forced merges and 30 percent fewer lane straddles were observed for the Late Merge; and, at densities below 25 vpm, no conflicts were observed for the Late Merge, whereas conflicts were observed for the conventional merge.  The studies also found the capacity of the Late Mergeto be nearly 20 percent higher than that of the conventional merge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Roadcam", "name": "t1_dgby1lu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492371437.0, "created_utc": 1492342637.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6os", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nv7y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6os", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nv7y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6os", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nv7y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgde0o5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "poncewattle", "parent_id": "t1_dgd6s7h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Roadcam", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You just explained it better than I did!   :-) ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You just explained it better than I did!   :-) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Roadcam", "name": "t1_dgde0o5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492458665.0, "created_utc": 1492429865.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd6s7h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Individdy", "parent_id": "t1_dgby39w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Roadcam", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Obviously two lanes is faster than one, but when it reduces to one that limits the overall rate to that of one lane.
