In general, driving is a lot more complicated and harder to do properly than people realize.  People drive under less than ideal circumstances all the time and we all just get lucky.  Distractions happen all the time.

I think that making car safety systems better at avoiding accidents is the way to go.  Remove the human from the equation as much as possible and things will get much safer.  Had that car been self driving, this wouldn't have happened.  Had the car had automatic breaking, this wouldn't have happened.  Had the cammer's car been self driving or configured with crash avoidance systems, it might have even been able to get out of the way.\n\nThe idea of making everyone better drivers is great, however, it's impractical.  We're better off making the cars safer instead.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part I agree with you (not trying to be argumentative).  I also agree that people should train to react better in situations like this.  If they don&amp;#39;t, acting badly when things go wrong will be the norm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think that it&amp;#39;s making excuses though.  In general, driving is a lot more complicated and harder to do properly than people realize.  People drive under less than ideal circumstances all the time and we all just get lucky.  Distractions happen all the time.  It could be something as serious as just having had a death in the family or losing your job to as simple as you paying attention to the sketchy vehicle on your left when you get into an accident with the sketch vehicle on your right that you didn&amp;#39;t notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the large number of vehicles on the road and people driving them, I don&amp;#39;t think that simply expecting people to do better is the best course of action.  I think that making car safety systems better at avoiding accidents is the way to go.  Remove the human from the equation as much as possible and things will get much safer.  Had that car been self driving, this wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened.  Had the car had automatic breaking, this wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened.  Had the cammer&amp;#39;s car been self driving or configured with crash avoidance systems, it might have even been able to get out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea of making everyone better drivers is great, however, it&amp;#39;s impractical.
