But before you do brake, guy behind you saw that you&amp;#39;ll apparently go thru the intersection because you weren&amp;#39;t slowing down and decides that he&amp;#39;ll do the same even if that means running a red. They floor it to make sure they go thru before the red, but that&amp;#39;s when you slam on the brakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;^ This type of accident is common as fuck. you see it so often if you ever drove or been a passenger. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; braked and the other guy floored it, basically there is no following distance anymore since you can&amp;#39;t even react to it. THat&amp;#39;s what i meant by &amp;quot;kill&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;well, judging by how quickly the front car stopped, they made the decision to brake at the last second. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah that decision was caused by yellow--&amp;gt;red light, something you are supposed to brake for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why did it take them so long to decide to brake for a yellow. I&amp;#39;ll tell you again, they thought they could make it but decided last second to brake for it. That&amp;#39;s why they stopped so quickly. I assume that&amp;#39;s not how you should brake everytime you stop at an intersection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s plain reckless to assume something like that&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;??? Have you ever been on the road? Have you ever seen a car that ran thru an intersection at a very late yellow/early red? .... only to be followed by another car that was behind them that does run the red? I don&amp;#39;t care where you live, that happens way too often. You even see plenty of videos of that crap here. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Roadcam", "name": "t1_dgbgse6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492333999.0, "created_utc": 1492305199.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9kpwf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FeedingYouPie", "parent_id": "t1_dg9jmg8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Roadcam", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Happy to explain myself, nothing against you, just my breakdown of /u/Imheretoreddit comment.\n&gt; well, judging by how quickly the front car stopped, they made the decision to brake at the last second. \n\nYeah that decision was caused by yellow--&gt;red light, something you are supposed to brake for.
