Thanks for the good wishes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do miss a lot of school yeah, my attendance for this year so far is 23%, all the catch up work is hard and i have fallen behind, the school don&amp;#39;t really understand my condition so it makes it really hard to ask for special treatment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh as a little sidenote, have you tried acupuncture, it&amp;#39;s my next attempt to see if it helps as they can&amp;#39;t try me on any new medication as I&amp;#39;m too young and i&amp;#39;ve had my maximum number of different medicine or something like that. But yeah many people are doing research into acupuncture on migraines and believe it massively helps so if you haven&amp;#39;t looked into it maybe have a gander :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for the question!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AMA", "name": "t1_dgdb0xr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492449677.0, "created_utc": 1492420877.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd07lc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "matrawr", "parent_id": "t3_65rpnq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AMA", "controversiality": 0, "body": "hey OP, i guess i will think of a question, but i have been dealing with chronic migraines daily for the past 4 years.

Before my daily migraines i suffered from a few migraines a month. I got a concussion at 17 that tripped me into a permanent migraine state. I'm 21 now and have been to the ER multiple times, tried everything...and nothing. what's the stigma towards chronic migraines? I know almost everyone in my life doesn't understand the constant pain I am in and can't fathom how a simple little headache can end up in the ER. I have a high pain tolerance (broken multiple bones during sports and continued to play until i was forced not to). Basically the only people that understand what goes on is fellow migraine sufferers, which i have a very good friend who gets them too.
