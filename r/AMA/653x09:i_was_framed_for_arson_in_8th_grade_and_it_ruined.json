The public schools there were some of the best in the state, on paper. Anyway.&lt;br/&gt;\nIn 8th grade an acquaintance asked me to come check something out in the bathroom. He poured a soda bottle into a toilet. I didn&amp;#39;t know what was happening until he dropped a match in it. It was gasoline, and the toilet exploded and kept burning. Knowing for certain I would get blamed for this, being the shabby, poor, and let&amp;#39;s face it - gothy - kid at the school, I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do. So I left.&lt;br/&gt;\nLong story short, the kid told the police I had done it, and I told them what had happened. They charged both of us with 2 felonies and a misdemeanor: burning private property, burning a public building, and malicious destruction of property.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He plead out, getting a deal for probation and a transfer to a school for troubled kids. I lawyered up and plead not guilty. The superintendent of the school put me on &amp;quot;indefinite suspension&amp;quot; pending the results of my trial. My trial was scheduled for 11 months later.&lt;br/&gt;\nI was trapped in a suburb with nothing to do. Kids I had been friends with shunned me. It was the kind of town where people want nothing to do with a &amp;quot;criminal.&amp;quot; Mostly I played WarCraft II online and slept sometimes for days at a time. The sleeping all the time is what landed me in therapy for depression, and then eventually I was hospitalized for some suicidal tendencies.&lt;br/&gt;\nMy trial finally came around, and I was so excited to finally get this over with. I got to court at 8:30 AM, and I was supposed to begin my trial at 9. Problem: at 8:45 some fucktards crashed their planes into the twin towers, so everything in court was canceled that day. My trial got rescheduled for six months later.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, financial struggles were getting ridiculous. My single mother could no longer afford the mortgage on our house, so we moved into a small apartment the next town over. I was allowed to start high school there (essentially getting a free pass on 8th grade, which I had missed almost all of). Some people there were nice enough, but everyone had heard rumors about me and I had a target on my back from day one. One day during lunch period I was hanging outside smoking a cigarette, which was weirdly allowed at this school. Some kid ran up to me and said &amp;quot;Hey, what&amp;#39;s up?&amp;quot; and then punched my head into the brick wall behind me. I tried to run away but he chased me, knocked me on the concrete, straddled me with my arms pinned down and punched me in the face over and over. It was hard to tell for sure, but he hit me somewhere between 25 and 40 times. I blacked out at one point and when I came to he was still hitting me, saying shit like &amp;quot;have you had enough?&amp;quot; and then getting cheered on by a crowd of 15 people watching and going &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s had enough!!&amp;quot;. A few more hits and then he just got up and walked away.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was taken to the school nurse who took one look at me and called an ambulance. Anyway, to get to the end of this story quick - my head swelled up to twice its size and I couldn&amp;#39;t function for about two weeks. Then it was time to go back to school, and when I got there, I found that the kid who almost killed me got a week&amp;#39;s suspension as his only punishment. I was terrified when I was at school from then on, but I didn&amp;#39;t stay very long. I was torn between the fear and constant revenge fantasies. I wanted to strangle him to death. I wanted to slice his throat. Some days I brought my knife to school with me, thinking I might need it for defense. Some days I brought it thinking I&amp;#39;d stab him in the hallway. One day I had my hand on my knife and walked up right behind him in the cafeteria and I was pretty sure that was the moment I was going to slit his throat. But I didn&amp;#39;t. I did, however, stop going to school.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I finally got my trial, they had no evidence. Their only witness - the kid who did it - got up to the stand and answered every question he was asked with &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t remember.&amp;quot; The judge asked the jury to leave the room, and then chewed out the DA for wasting the state&amp;#39;s time and resources on my case. All charges were dropped.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started working dead end jobs at pizza places and such. Since I was still basically a social pariah to the kids I had gone to school with, I started hanging out with older dudes, 18-25 or so. I was about 15 at this point. Of course I started smoking weed with them, because that&amp;#39;s what people that age do, but I wasn&amp;#39;t fond of the high. It heightened my anxiety. One day my dealer had something else, though, and he smoked opium with me. That was a high I could get down with. It was hard to come by, though, so eventually he introduced me to percocet, which eventually led to oxycontin, which eventually led to heroin. I was waiting tables at Chili&amp;#39;s so high on dope that I had to go throw up in the bathroom, then do more dope, every couple hours.&lt;br/&gt;\nI got off the dope when a friend ODed, but still did oxys and percocet as if those were any better.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Fast forward. Age 21 I finally decided I needed to get out of the shitty jobs and try going to college. I got incredibly high scores on my GED and got accepted to a bunch of schools, ended up picking my state university because it was cheap and decent. I started out as a psychology major, which I was great at, but after a year and a half I realized the only thing I really wanted to do was write, so I went full on creative writing. My honors thesis was a book of poetry.&lt;br/&gt;\nFast forward. In February 2016 I finally got completely sober. No drugs, no alcohol. A few months later, I had a complete psychotic breakdown. I was seeing things, hearing things, and becoming incredibly paranoid that people were out to get me. People at my workplace. People in my family. I totally lost it and was hospitalized for over a month. Since then, I&amp;#39;ve been constantly cycling through different medications trying to find something that will make me functional. Some things make me sleep 20 hours a day. Some things make it so I can&amp;#39;t sleep. Taking me off one medication makes me paranoid and manic again. Taking me off another has zero effect. I know psychiatric research isn&amp;#39;t as far along as it should be, since there are still people who don&amp;#39;t believe mental illness is a real thing. But this is kinda ridiculous.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;m 30 years old, I can only manage to work one or two days a week and sometimes need to get replaced on those because I&amp;#39;ll wake up not being able to handle it. I&amp;#39;m being supported financially by a family member who is by no means wealthy, I have 50k in student loan debt, the state won&amp;#39;t accept my applications for disability, and the only thing keeping me from serious suicidal thoughts is the countdown to the new Star Wars movie.

I don&amp;#39;t feel bad about what&amp;#39;s happened to you. A lot of bad things have happened to good people, even me. I do feel bad that you allow it to run your life though.
