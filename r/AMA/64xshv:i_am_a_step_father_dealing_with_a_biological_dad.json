His mom bails him out, gives him a place to live rent free, lets him use her car etc.. But at 33 he is sleeping on a lazy boy in his moms living room of a dingy 1 bedroom... I guess that is enough for him... Not for me lol. Not for most guys I would imagine.. I just think it is CRAZY how Much time, money, effort, it took to get kiddo down here.. As I've said before, if we did even ONE of the things he has done to his kid, we would be in prison in this state..  It was ALL because she moved out of state to be with family... He separated her from her support system and abused her mentally and physically.. But the shitty state he is in didn't want the kid taken out of his school (even tho he was missing LITERALLY 40 days + a year) and out of state... The fact that the state signed off on sending kiddo to another state and changing schools and all that shows how bad it was... When kiddo came to us to stay he basically needed to be taught how to live everyday life..\n\nWe FINALLY got kid to stop wetting the bed, but have now noticed that whenever he is SUPPOSED to see his dad (his dad bails and doesn't usually come) he starts wetting the bed again, and behaviors become worse.. I just wish WHATEVER is wrong with his dad, be it drugs, alcohol, low IQ... I wish it would get figured out.. It makes me super sad that he doesn't have a father.. And that doesn't appear to be changing any time soon.. But he has me. I'm ex army and I am a loyal, hard working family man.. I will do my best to teach him the way of the Jedi, hoping he doesn't follow the dark side... Haha", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He uses...
