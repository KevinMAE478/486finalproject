If I dont have a First Responder kit in my car, I can get sued out my ass and even face jailtime for harming the person, by not being prepared. \n\nOn top of that, I dont know a single person that doesnt wear their work attire after work. If youre on the way home, and you have \"those kinds of shirts\" on, how is that \"cringy as fuck?\"\n\nI would say not to even bother responding to this, but I'd love to yell at you some more about how much of a douche you are coming across right now. \n\nThanks.
