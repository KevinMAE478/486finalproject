Curie understands this and sees the transfer to a synth body as a means of overcoming both hardware limitations and software programming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third generation synths are basically vat grown humans that have their identifying human flesh such as skin, face and sensory organs installed over a synthetic frame which is an improvement over the human body created by natural selection. They have an organic brain modeled after the human brain but it augmented with Institute technology. They are self-aware and capable of growing and learning as any other humans.
