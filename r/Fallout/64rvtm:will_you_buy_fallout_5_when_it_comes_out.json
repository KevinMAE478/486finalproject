Also, Fallout is, first and foremost, a roleplay if game. RPG&amp;#39;s should always, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; prioritize story, roleplaying, decisions, depth, and multiple quest solutions, not gameplay. And I find that stuff &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;, like you said, a game should prioritize fun, I don&amp;#39;t find running around dungeons shooting things because of... reasons, fun, I find roleplaying, real decision making, story, and depth all fun. Genres exist for a reason, different people consider different things as fun. It seems you&amp;#39;re much more into the action-adventure/exploration genre than the actual RPG genre, which is fine, but Fallout has always(until Fo4) been entirely in the RPG genre(I&amp;#39;m talking about the main games, Tactics and BOS don&amp;#39;t apply, and Fo3 was weaker on the RP than the others, but it was still there). I&amp;#39;d recommend you play The Legend of Zelda, Blood Souls, Just Cause, GTA, The Witcher, and similar games, they seem a lot more your style than Fallout(or what it&amp;#39;s supposed to be)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fallout", "name": "t1_dg6fk64", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492055065.0, "created_utc": 1492026265.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6e2fl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Arenta", "parent_id": "t1_dg6dx2h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fallout", "controversiality": 0, "body": "and thats  fine for you\n\nbut i like to enjoy playing a game.\n\nif i want an in depth story.  i've got a kindle with over 250 books on it.
