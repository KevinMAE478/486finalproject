Lore, Balance, and Feel.   \n\n-Fallout and F2 Power Armor obviously had the most canonical and lore friendly version of it.    \n-In terms of balance, it was certainly the most powerful version as well. Unlike the others on the list, it is the only kind that can make you actually invincible to some enemies. It made you a veritable powerhouse. It was also given to you late in the game, which is good.   \n-However, even though I have a hard time doing it, I'm gonna have to give the lowest rating for *feel*. Its raw power helps alleviate this, but the simple fact is that the isometric nature of the game heavily impacts how it feels to be in power armor.    \n\nI'll say it right away, Fallout 3 Power Armor is the worst in the series, in my opinion.    \n-As far as lore is concerned, it wasn't *too* bad. Not the worst, but middling, I guess. T-45 was new as an in-game thing, but it was referenced in previous games, so it's want technically lore breaking. It revamped Enclave armor for no real reason, and added in Power Armor training. I personally don't think power armor training was a bad thing though, because it worked as a great way to limit its use to only the late game.    \n-It is the weakest version of it in the series, full stop. The DR-only system played a huge part in this. It was and is an unrealistic way of representing a relationship between incoming damage and how armor deals with it.   \n-Besides being the weakest, it only barely feels better than it did in Fallout 1 and 2. It doesn't confer a feeling of power, both because of its weakness, and because of the fact that it is just normal armor with a different skin.    \n\nFallout New Vegas was a good blend of many things, and it's Power Armor was no exception.    \n-Lore wise, it's only \"sin\" was the use of training, but I do consider the training to be a good thing.    -\n-Its the second most powerful iteration in the series. To me, this fact is proof of the superiority of the DT system.    \n- As far as feel, it only barely beats out Fallout 3, and only because it it more powerful. Besides that, it still doesn't approach Fallout 4 in this regard.   \n\nFallout 4 power armor, like in Fallout NV, reflects the game as a whole.    \n-For lore, it's the worst. Fusion Cores shouldn't run out, or even exist as they do. T-60 looks cool, but it has no reason to exist besides giving the BOS a shiny new toy, and it certainly shouldn't\u200b be more powerful than T-51. X-01 shouldn't exist in the way it does in the game, period.    \n-For power, it's good *and* bad. It is only barely less powerful than in NV, but uses a strange and convoluted system for determining damage. It is also given to the player *way* too soon, which forced the addition of Fusion Cores, which as a said earlier, are not lore friendly.   \n-For feel, Fallout 4 takes the cake though.
