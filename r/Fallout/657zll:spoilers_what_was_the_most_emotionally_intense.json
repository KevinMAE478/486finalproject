You meet him as a unique ghoul at The Slog, and he sets you on a quest to get some spare parts so he can fix up an old Giddyup Buttercup. You can do this and earn some caps, but if you want the full extent of his story you need to travel to the Wilson Atomatoys Corporate HQ on your own. The place has been overrun with super mutants, and after you clear it out you have the chance to work your way into the head office, Arlen Glass' office. Inside is his desk and a door leading to his personal workshop, and inside that is a holotape recording of his wife and daughter. It's just a simple goodnight message, something for him to listen to while he's at work so he can think of them. In his old life Arlen was a workaholic and buried himself in his work, still a loving father but never taking enough time to spend with his family. When the bombs fell, one of them impacted directly in his neighborhood and killed his family instantly. If you bring the holotape back to Arlen you get to witness him listen to it for the first time in over two centuries. The grief on this man's face is palpable, and you can see the years of pain and regret flowing out of his posture and voice. It hit me hard to see him relive such painful, but fond memories. After the tape is finished he thanks you profusely for the gesture, and mentions he's going to finish his current project, then leave the Slog. If you come back to the Slog after a few days you notice that Arlen is gone, and the only things left in his workspace are some tools, a thank you note, and a recently fixed Giddyup Buttercup model.](/spoiler)\n\nThere's a fantastic video that details the story of Arlen Glass [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSS03vzzSjE) for those that wish to see.\n\nThe other scene that always sticks with me is one of those special little scenes that Bethesda likes to sneak into their games. It's a posed skeleton in one of the subway stations, I forget which one but my gut says it's the one that you go down with Glory for the first time. Early in the subway station is a little drugstore concession area with a ghoul hanging out behind a product shelf, and to the left of that shelf is a female bathroom. Inside said bathroom there is an empty baby pram sitting outside one of the stalls. Inside that stall there is a single skeleton wearing a dress, with her hand shoved down the toilet, clutching a baby's rattle. There is absolutely no other clarifying information than what is presented so this scene could be taken a lot of ways. But my personal interpretation is this: This woman was one of the unfortunate souls caught in the initial Boston blast. Since she was underground she survived the 'Big Boom', but her mind was shaken by the chaos erupting around her that she came to a very dark and sudden conclusion. She looks down at her child in the crib and realizes the world this child is about to be subject too. And rather than allow her child to come to any harm or horrific end in this apocalypse, she takes her baby and drowns it in the subway toilet out of mercy.\n\nA grisly thought, but one that I think is possible given the extreme circumstances of the day.", "edited": 1492138324.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s plenty that stick out to me, but two of the biggest ones are the quest line for Arlen Glass and one very particular mini-scene that I always make a point to visit in each playthrough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arlen Glass Spoilers:\n&lt;a href=\"/spoiler\"&gt;For those that don&amp;#39;t know, Arlen Glass was the chief toy designer at Wilson Atomatoys before the war.
