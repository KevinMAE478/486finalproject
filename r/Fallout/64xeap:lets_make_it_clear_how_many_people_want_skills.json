It forced you to make the sometimes difficult choice of how to upgrade your character by only giving one perk point per level unlike Fallout 3, where you could could fairly evenly distribute points across your abilities and then take perks that were - in most cases - the cherry on top that added little bonuses and shortcuts to gameplay. However, I was sad to see skills go away but I think it's the best solution for a game like Fallout 4.\n\nSkills and skill checks go all the way back to classic tabletop RPGs like D&amp;D where many actions you take require you to roll a skill check. In a turn-based system combat system, you're always rolling and in that kind of game skill checks are a critical and constant part of gameplay. \n\nHowever, when you get to the open-world first person shooter genre, skill checks really only start to become necessary in specific dialogue and scripted events (such as trying to repair something during a quest) and so most of the game, skill checks aren't used and skills simply become your players stats and ability/damage modifiers (e.g. percentage increase todamage you do, how accurate your are via gun movement and recoil, how far you can throw something, percent of damage you can soak, etc.).\n\nYou're not doing skill checks to climb rock face or assess whether a piece of scrap is valuable or look for traps or to listen if you can hear enemies nearby - these are all things that you simply do as the player.\n\nWhile skill checks can add more depth to dialogue, the same thing can be done based on the Perks system in Fallout 4 - especially the FONV skill check system which essentially sees if you've reached a certain threshold in a certain skill. So instead of having 25 in Explosives to convince Easy Pete to give you the explosives, you'd need at least one level of the Demolitions Expert perk.
