The further south and east you go in the game, the harder the enemies are going to get.\n\nFirst thing I would suggest, if you're running low on health, is to save all of the meat you get from killing any animals, and cook that.  You can get a lot more health from eating food than you can from stimpacks initially.  Of course, you can always invest in the Medic perk to have stimpacks heal more, but food is so plentiful that it's a valid way to play, as long as you're not in survival mode.\n\nNext, the 10mm ammo is plentiful, but you may want to also have a fall-back weapon that can use more common ammo.  You'll find that most of the raiders use .38 ammo, so you'll get a lot of that ammo.  If you can a decent pipe rifle or pipe pistol, you'll never need to worry about running out of ammo, and it's perfectly fine for small enemies, like radroaches or ghouls.  Also, melee weapons/unarmed weapons don't run out of ammo, and can be crafted to do a surprising amount of damage.\n\nThis game rewards you for exploring, with ammo, weapons, health stuff, etc.  It also rewards you for setting up settlements.  While those are not really main quests in the game, they will help quite a lot.  Having a place to travel to to sleep, clear up radiation, cook, craft weapons, etc. is very useful.  \n\nAlso, having a companion helps a lot.

The further south and east you go in the game, the harder the enemies are going to get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First thing I would suggest, if you&amp;#39;re running low on health, is to save all of the meat you get from killing any animals, and cook that.  You can get a lot more health from eating food than you can from stimpacks initially.  Of course, you can always invest in the Medic perk to have stimpacks heal more, but food is so plentiful that it&amp;#39;s a valid way to play, as long as you&amp;#39;re not in survival mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, the 10mm ammo is plentiful, but you may want to also have a fall-back weapon that can use more common ammo.
