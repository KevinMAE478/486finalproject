I would like share this information with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Backing up your saves: They are normally in your MyDocuments/Mygames/Fallout4/Saves. I can&amp;#39;t stress this enough, a cheap thumb drive can hold your games easily. For a bit more money you can hold all your mod files also. For how to do this, use Google and you will find it is simple. I think I needed 10 gigs of space total and my games are huge with a couple hundred mods to save.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Save Bloat: Everything that is in the game needs to be loaded, accounted for and physics taken into account everytime you are in an area. The cans on the ground, the bodies you left from last week, the weapons they were holding onto when they died. The game is pretty reliable as far as the corpses and the cans and stuff just get re-spawned normally. But the weapons are very different. When an enemy dies it drop it&amp;#39;s weapon on the ground. When the game clears the corpses it leaves these weapons behind, probably forever. They do this so you can still find the Legendary Explosive Mini-Gun that was dropped a month ago, the last time you cleared this area. This makes sense, until you play your game for many years of in game time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summation: My biggest &amp;quot;Set&amp;quot; has over 1100 hours put into it, the character has been in her world for almost 4 years. I usually would role play a good Minuteman General who travels the provisioner routes at least once a month to keep them clear of trouble. So let&amp;#39;s use that and the raiders in a town as an example. I think there are 5 there and they get killed once a month at least. 5 guns a month x 4 years = 240 weapons that will probably still be on the ground. My game was getting really unstable and the fps was dropping in some areas. I found a mod to make the ground white (Snow) and toggled the trees and grass. 2 weeks later, I had picked up well over 2500 weapons. (I stopped counting there.) It made a huge difference, the game was running almost as fresh as the first day out of the vault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you prevent this, other than picking up everything yourself? I use a mod that prevents them from dropping their weapons when they die and another to clean out my game. Two useful mods are &lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3757/\"&gt;No weapon drop on death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16199/\"&gt;Detect Dropped Weapon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, That&amp;#39;s all, I hope that I provided some useful information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:To update info and clean up the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "TL;DR If you're a big settlement builder this is for you ...\n\nHi, I make fallout 4 videos and I use my save game files as my sets.
