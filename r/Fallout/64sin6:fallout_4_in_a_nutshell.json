Still, a big point is people are aware that you have these settlements, its part of the reason bunker hill literately surrenders itself to you and diamond city submits to your primary faction of choice after the ending. Which does affect a few post ending quests like the synth mayor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Persuasion, on the other hand, has probably more encounters in 4 then it does in 3, infact I remember the majority of the quests in 3 being the point A point B (Litteraly 2 missions in the main questline for 3 involved a gauntlet run with little interaction. couldnt even stealth in them because of how narrow the subways were) Were as 4 always had 2 of 3 options available at all times, were straight persuasion didnt work stealth still works. (Plus the aformentioned making people surrender/yield and backoff if people actually bothered to take those perks) Same as new vegas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue with these persuasion arguments is littearly new vegas is the only &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; rpg ive seen use it so liberally, its not a fundamental mechanic of alot of rpgs like people want to preach.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fallout", "name": "t1_dg8l4jo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492163539.0, "created_utc": 1492134739.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8if2m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sigourn", "parent_id": "t1_dg83dt0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fallout", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How, if I may ask?

Let me incapacitate enemies from stealth if I can get enough time to choke them out without being seen, let enemies surrender if I cripple enough of their limbs and give the PC a few canned &amp;quot;Get the fuck out of here while you still can walk&amp;quot; lines when this condition is met. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Give me ways to interact with intractably hostile characters that do not involve killing them, and you can put in intractably hostile characters where they make sense without violating the sense of freedom of choice. And if you do that, you can then actually integrate nonlethal gameplay into the core game model and give me rewards for it that make sense, without undermining your game. Bonus XP, bonus rewards for taking the nonlethal path makes perfect sense if the nonlethal path is harder. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fallout", "name": "t1_dg7leam", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492121560.0, "created_utc": 1492092760.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7cgwg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MarxistSociologist", "parent_id": "t1_dg66ck6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fallout", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Note: I am not taking in to account companions here.
