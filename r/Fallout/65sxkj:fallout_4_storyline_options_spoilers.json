Especially Nuka World. So you get there and all of a sudden you're a raider..?

Killing the leaders aggros every raider in the park, and killing them all is tough not because they're strong but because you have to NOT hit any of their slaves. Harder than I thought it was tbh. Had to reload quite a few times, and Danse was fond of shooting the slaves too. Doing this strips Nuka World of so much content it is astounding! They should've added a storyline for the good guys too, seemed lazy. And the whole time I was going around the park I was wondering \"why am I even here? The loot is bizarre and takes a way from the feel of the Fallout series, each park having its own random story and enemies seems rushed and the missions were short as hell.\"\n\nOnly 100% good DLC was Far Harbour.

Especially Nuka World. So you get there and all of a sudden you&amp;#39;re a raider..? Forced into it by a technicality Bethesda has ignored plenty before (more raiders than you so you&amp;#39;d better listen or they&amp;#39;ll kill you). Killing the leaders aggros every raider in the park, and killing them all is tough not because they&amp;#39;re strong but because you have to NOT hit any of their slaves. Harder than I thought it was tbh. Had to reload quite a few times, and Danse was fond of shooting the slaves too. Doing this strips Nuka World of so much content it is astounding!
