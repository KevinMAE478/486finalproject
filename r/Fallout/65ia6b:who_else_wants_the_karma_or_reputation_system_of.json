It's a sort of let's play that they did, they skipped some parts, and only did the beginning (and they suck at it!) but they did cover that element.\n\nI have a fucking great idea for Fallout 5, and I'm not afraid to say it. I am a bit shy about posting exactly what it is, because it's been shit on a couple times, but I will say this, I think one element I really want to see is, a system where instead of choosing one faction and damning/murdering all the others, you have to bring up as many factions as possible.\n\nAny of you play Crackdown? Xbox 360 launch title, kind of like GTA with super powers? Looked stupid, ended up being a lot of fun? Love it or hate it, it had this one cool game mechanic. Your objective on each island/city was to kill the kingpin of this gang, and you could go right to his stronghold from the beginning and go right for him. But, he had these half dozen lieutenants who managed a certain part of the gang. Weapons, training, vehicles, and so on. And if you took out these lieutenants, the entire gang, all across the city, suffered. And if you took them all out, it made the kingpin significantly easier.\n\nI say put that in Fallout 5, but in reverse. There are all these factions, and they're in shambles, and they're at each others' throats. So while the main quest itself would be rather short (long story short: Deathclaw Behemoth; longer story: Learn what a Tarrasque is), but the faction quests would be fairly detailed. First you'd join them. Then you'd negotiate peace with their rival faction(s). Then you'd restore them to power (keeping in mind that giving any faction more power than a rival would result in a strained relationship, so you'd have to bring rivals up together), and finally, forge an alliance between former rivals. And each faction would provide some kind of support for the final fight.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't leave room for an evil playthrough. Like Fallout 4, there's no endgame that works for an evil faction. The main enemy will just kill you regardless of your alignment/past actions because That's Just What It Does. But, maybe one of the factions would be a raider/Gunner/Talon Company type group with corrupt leadership that you can take over and clean up and then earn the trust of the other factions with. Maybe not make them good guys, but maybe something like the Dark Brotherhood in Elder Scrolls. I dunno. Never put much thought into an evil playthrough. It just doesn't fit. Fallout 3 and New Vegas had evil options because there were evil factions with legitimate and achievable endgames.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fallout 3 was about the struggle between good and evil. Fallout 4 is about hope and rebuilding.&amp;quot; Maybe not verbatim, but a good quote from one of the devs. In a video where they were introducing Nuka World. It&amp;#39;s a sort of let&amp;#39;s play that they did, they skipped some parts, and only did the beginning (and they suck at it!) but they did cover that element.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a fucking great idea for Fallout 5, and I&amp;#39;m not afraid to say it. I am a bit shy about posting exactly what it is, because it&amp;#39;s been shit on a couple times, but I will say this, I think one element I really want to see is, a system where instead of choosing one faction and damning/murdering all the others, you have to bring up as many factions as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any of you play Crackdown? Xbox 360 launch title, kind of like GTA with super powers? Looked stupid, ended up being a lot of fun? Love it or hate it, it had this one cool game mechanic. Your objective on each island/city was to kill the kingpin of this gang, and you could go right to his stronghold from the beginning and go right for him. But, he had these half dozen lieutenants who managed a certain part of the gang. Weapons, training, vehicles, and so on. And if you took out these lieutenants, the entire gang, all across the city, suffered. And if you took them all out, it made the kingpin significantly easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say put that in Fallout 5, but in reverse. There are all these factions, and they&amp;#39;re in shambles, and they&amp;#39;re at each others&amp;#39; throats. So while the main quest itself would be rather short (long story short: Deathclaw Behemoth; longer story: Learn what a Tarrasque is), but the faction quests would be fairly detailed. First you&amp;#39;d join them. Then you&amp;#39;d negotiate peace with their rival faction(s). Then you&amp;#39;d restore them to power (keeping in mind that giving any faction more power than a rival would result in a strained relationship, so you&amp;#39;d have to bring rivals up together), and finally, forge an alliance between former rivals. And each faction would provide some kind of support for the final fight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&amp;#39;t leave room for an evil playthrough. Like Fallout 4, there&amp;#39;s no endgame that works for an evil faction. The main enemy will just kill you regardless of your alignment/past actions because That&amp;#39;s Just What It Does. But, maybe one of the factions would be a raider/Gunner/Talon Company type group with corrupt leadership that you can take over and clean up and then earn the trust of the other factions with. Maybe not make them good guys, but maybe something like the Dark Brotherhood in Elder Scrolls. I dunno. Never put much thought into an evil playthrough. It just doesn&amp;#39;t fit. Fallout 3 and New Vegas had evil options because there were evil factions with legitimate and achievable endgames.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fallout", "name": "t1_dgbe18r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492330054.0, "created_utc": 1492301254.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnzu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ia6b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbh905", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TAJack1", "parent_id": "t3_65ia6b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fallout", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't even wanna think about Fallout 5 but a reputation system would be nice.
