The magnitude of this risk is impossible to determine with ant certainty as no one will be able to perform a high quality randomized study. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At best, you could prospectively track a group of people who report that they use gear and compare them to another group that are as similar as possible, but you would have a very difficult time finding a group of people who are very similar. As well, I doubt you could separate out the effect of ancillaries like AIs, let alone effects of different compounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things that will probably increase the risk of bad things happening:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;higher doses &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;longer duration of use&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;more cycles &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;using compounds other than testosterone&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;using multiple compounds simultaneously &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; not doing regular blood work &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, doing anything increases your risk. Adding on other stuff probably increases it, but nobody knows how much. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodybuilding", "name": "t1_dgd9aa0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492443823.0, "created_utc": 1492415023.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qbo2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qbo2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qbo2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qbo2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qbo2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qbo2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdlde3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zachigolf", "parent_id": "t1_dgdl1m3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodybuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nope but another common misconception on this sub ks that the guys with impressive physiques are all abusing gear.
