It is extremely likely for it to raise blood pressure / triglyceride levels and often requires multiple medications on top of accutane  to treat these things.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, accutane is also commonly coupled with a &amp;quot;purging&amp;quot; effect where severe breakouts occur in the first few weeks of treatment, and can result in severe scarring, and doctors will prescribe yet another drug on top of that to quickly treat that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is accutane safe? Yes, under supervision. Is it safe on steroids? It&amp;#39;s definitely not certain, and probably shouldn&amp;#39;t be used as a first method considering the cause of the acne is increased hormones. Accutane is, and always will be, a last resort when the cause of acne is unknown, and unresponsive to treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source : &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3509883/\"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3509883/&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodybuilding", "name": "t1_dgar22d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492298224.0, "created_utc": 1492269424.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaq476", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SmallFatAndWeak", "parent_id": "t1_dganydi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodybuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "70% is a pretty good hit rate for never getting acne again, plus 'relapse' is a subjective term in this context, some people get acne again but it definitely won't be the same intensity as before", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;70% is a pretty good hit rate for never getting acne again, plus &amp;#39;relapse&amp;#39; is a subjective term in this context, some people get acne again but it definitely won&amp;#39;t be the same intensity as before&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodybuilding", "name": "t1_dgaq476", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492296847.0, "created_utc": 1492268047.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dganydi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KythosMeltdown", "parent_id": "t1_dgahzf2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodybuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No it's not. ~30% of people have a relapse at some point.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No it&amp;#39;s not. ~30% of people have a relapse at some point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodybuilding", "name": "t1_dganydi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492293344.0, "created_utc": 1492264544.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgahzf2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SmallFatAndWeak", "parent_id": "t1_dgagxfj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodybuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It sounds perfect for you, it's main attraction is that the acne suppression is basically permanent.\n\nIMO the side effects are way overblown and basically nonexistent at 20mg ed, might be worth a try", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds perfect for you, it&amp;#39;s main attraction is that the acne suppression is basically permanent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMO the side effects are way overblown and basically nonexistent at 20mg ed, might be worth a try&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodybuilding", "name": "t1_dgahzf2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492278464.0, "created_utc": 1492249664.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i1ce", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgalfd3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zeronineteen", "parent_id": "t1_dgagxfj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodybuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The side effects you get depends on your genetics.
