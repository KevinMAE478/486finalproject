For example my delts have always been strong and a decent size so I found during my push days my delts grew way too fast compared to my chest. Front delts are taxed a lot during pressing movements so I literally only did lateral raise variations for a while on push days and my physique balanced out nicely after a few months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ppl is awesome though, are you doing a 6 day split or 3? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodybuilding", "name": "t1_dg810cn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492138449.0, "created_utc": 1492109649.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6545j3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8w7w0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ardee2124", "parent_id": "t1_dg7zsp9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodybuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How heavy do your dumbbells go?
