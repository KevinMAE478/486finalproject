So many of these posts are very well intentioned but an improperly set goal can lead to frustration/quitting or a lack of intensity because you are not actually striving for anything. Having a goal of &amp;quot;aesthetics&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;strength&amp;quot; is not a goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A properly designed goal should have 5 elements:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attainable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time bound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want to compete in my first men&amp;#39;s physique show 12 months from now&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want to bench press my own body weight in the next 6 months&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want to gain 6 lbs of LBM in the next year&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These types of goals give you something to strive for and a deadline to hit. Without a properly set goal you are just going through the motions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a specific goal in mind the advice you recieve will be much more beneficial and geared towards what YOU are trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodybuilding", "name": "t1_dg42phr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491933369.0, "created_utc": 1491904569.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 58}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pik7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pik7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pik7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pik7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pik7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pik7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pik7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pik7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pik7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pik7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4h30e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RepsForFreedom", "parent_id": "t1_dg4g8zy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodybuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It definitely does take longerI've been at the same weight +_ 2 or 3 lbs for the past 4 months, but there definitely progress over time.

I've noticed I can either do:  \n\nA) 20lbs for every set. The first 2 sets are way easy, second is medium, final set is challenging.  \n\nB) 25 pounds for the first set, 22.5 for second (since Im too tired from the first set to match it), 17.5 for third, and only like 15 for last.  \n\nEach set for option B takes a huge toll on me vs doing the sets with one weight straight across in option A. But I'm still going close to failure on the last set of A.\n\nMy question:\n\nI assume the size gains should be similar between both, since the average weight used across all sets for either options is 20 pounds. Is that correct?\n\nI realy hope so because I find option B to be way too tiring (maybe not with curls lol but with squats it definitely is) and it affects the rest of my workout. I usually have to leave early due to feeling sick from exherting myself so much on each set.\n\nIn know my tag says aspiring competitor so I should know this. I just always saw better gains doing a PL style program with only a couple accessories. Joints can't handle it aanymore so I'm in unknown territory.\n\n***TLDR - is 4x15x20lbs for curls equal, from a hypertrophy standpoint, to doing 15x25, 15x22.5, 15x17.5, 15x15 for 4 sets of curls instead?

Joints can&amp;#39;t take it anymore so I&amp;#39;m switching to a more high volume, medium intensity style of training.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m confused about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say I&amp;#39;m doing 4x15 curls. I&amp;#39;ve noticed I can either do:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A) 20lbs for every set. The first 2 sets are way easy, second is medium, final set is challenging.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B) 25 pounds for the first set, 22.5 for second (since Im too tired from the first set to match it), 17.5 for third, and only like 15 for last.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each set for option B takes a huge toll on me vs doing the sets with one weight straight across in option A. But I&amp;#39;m still going close to failure on the last set of A.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I assume the size gains should be similar between both, since the average weight used across all sets for either options is 20 pounds. Is that correct?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realy hope so because I find option B to be way too tiring (maybe not with curls lol but with squats it definitely is) and it affects the rest of my workout. I usually have to leave early due to feeling sick from exherting myself so much on each set.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In know my tag says aspiring competitor so I should know this. I just always saw better gains doing a PL style program with only a couple accessories. Joints can&amp;#39;t handle it aanymore so I&amp;#39;m in unknown territory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TLDR - is 4x15x20lbs for curls equal, from a hypertrophy standpoint, to doing 15x25, 15x22.5, 15x17.5, 15x15 for 4 sets of curls instead? Since the total poundage comes out to 1200lbs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bodybuilding", "name": "t1_dg4j6k5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491958122.0, "created_utc": 1491929322.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pik7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pik7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4yck1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Smc546", "parent_id": "t1_dg4nybo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodybuilding", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Your arms and shoulders are looking good man.
