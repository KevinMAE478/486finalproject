If I am breaking any rules, please give me a chance before removing :-))\n\nThank you so much for your review @rulerofspam :-)\n\nGlad to hear you liked the taste.  Also nice to hear that overall you prefer it over Quest, except for the cost part.\n\nTell you guys what. Let me see if I can sweeten the deal here.\n\nBefore I do that, a note on costs.  Given what we put in, our costs are reasonable and not significantly higher than bars like Quest.  First, we use high-quality non-GMO ingredients, most of them being ORGANIC. Even our WPI is cold-processed coming from cows not fed with hormones or antibiotics.  Most bar makers have traded down to compromise on ingredients to keep their costs low.  Second, we ALWAYS MAKE IN SMALL BATCHES.  This guarantees that our bars are fresh even when we don't use any preservatives.  Yes, this is the more expensive way, but it is the RIGHT way for the consumer.  Most bars add artificial preservatives and emulsifiers to increase shelf life. Our goal is to allow you guys eating as close to real food, or eating as naturally as possible.  In spite of these rigorous requirements, we still give a shelf life of just over 3 months without using refrigerators. That's actually a pretty good deal in my opinion.\n\nAnyway back to the deal, I don't have the might of Quest to afford constant discounting unless I sell away a few of my limbs and a kidney :-)  But I don't want to use that as an excuse.  We are trying to gain traction with discerning people like you. So we will do what it takes for you to at least try these bars out.\n\nI have created a special code just for reddit users.  Use code REDDIT20 to get 20% off plus Free Shipping.  Our regular code that we circulate everywhere else can be used only once.  But this code will allow you to use the discount UP TO 5 TIMES!\n\nWith this discount, we are pretty much the same price as Quest bars.\n\nI hope you agree that this is a great deal :-)\n\nFinally, we are tweaking the bar to make it even more flavorful without losing any of the envious macro and micros we have achieved with this formulation.  That would take a few months.  But as it stands right now, it is still a much cleaner tasting bar.  Don't take my word.  Check out real customer testimonials and real youtube videos of people trying it out for the first time.\n\nI really hope you all give us a shot. I am happy to answer any other questions.\n\nKrishna\nFounder, Oorja Nutrition", "edited": 1492201209.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note to moderators: Just responding to my product&amp;#39;s review.  If I am breaking any rules, please give me a chance before removing :-))&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for your review @rulerofspam :-)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Glad to hear you liked the taste.  Also nice to hear that overall you prefer it over Quest, except for the cost part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tell you guys what. Let me see if I can sweeten the deal here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I do that, a note on costs.  Given what we put in, our costs are reasonable and not significantly higher than bars like Quest.  First, we use high-quality non-GMO ingredients, most of them being ORGANIC. Even our WPI is cold-processed coming from cows not fed with hormones or antibiotics.  Most bar makers have traded down to compromise on ingredients to keep their costs low.  Second, we ALWAYS MAKE IN SMALL BATCHES.  This guarantees that our bars are fresh even when we don&amp;#39;t use any preservatives.  Yes, this is the more expensive way, but it is the RIGHT way for the consumer.  Most bars add artificial preservatives and emulsifiers to increase shelf life. Our goal is to allow you guys eating as close to real food, or eating as naturally as possible.  In spite of these rigorous requirements, we still give a shelf life of just over 3 months without using refrigerators. That&amp;#39;s actually a pretty good deal in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway back to the deal, I don&amp;#39;t have the might of Quest to afford constant discounting unless I sell away a few of my limbs and a kidney :-)  But I don&amp;#39;t want to use that as an excuse.  We are trying to gain traction with discerning people like you. So we will do what it takes for you to at least try these bars out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have created a special code just for reddit users.  Use code REDDIT20 to get 20% off plus Free Shipping.  Our regular code that we circulate everywhere else can be used only once.  But this code will allow you to use the discount UP TO 5 TIMES!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this discount, we are pretty much the same price as Quest bars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you agree that this is a great deal :-)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, we are tweaking the bar to make it even more flavorful without losing any of the envious macro and micros we have achieved with this formulation.  That would take a few months.  But as it stands right now, it is still a much cleaner tasting bar.  Don&amp;#39;t take my word.
