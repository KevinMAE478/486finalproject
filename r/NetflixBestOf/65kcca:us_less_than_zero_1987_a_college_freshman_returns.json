His former girlfriend, Blair, is now involved with his ex-best-friend, Julian. She warns Clay that Julian needs help\\: he is using a lot of cocaine and has huge debts. What follows is a look at the youth culture of wealthy post adolescents in Beverly Hills with a strong anti-drug message. Apart from the setting and the names, the film has very little to do with Bret Easton Ellis's book by the same title on which it was based.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n&gt; The film received mixed reviews from critics.
