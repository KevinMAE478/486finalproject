In other words, he was the last major political figure who embodied Samurai values/Bushido. He led a rebellion of disenfranchised Samurai(the Satsuma rebellion) at the end of the 19th century against the Meiji leaders who were attempting to modernize Japan in response to Western imperialism. He famously died during the final battle of the rebellion, but his body wasn't recovered which led legends about escaping to to a foreign land and planning his return to Japan. Many of Katsumoto's characteristics are exaggerations of Saigo's - being a former leader among the Meiji Oligarchs and embodying Samurai values in a time where many felt they had to adopt western values and practices. \n\nFurthermore, if you pay attention to the film, you should notice Katsumoto is the driving character behind the events of the movie. He starts and leads the rebellion, he is the vehicle through which we are introduced to what it means to be a Samurai, etc. We do learn these things through the minor samurai characters, but majority of information is given through the character of Katsumoto. It is also significant that he is the last of the Japanese samurai to die in the final battle. It's a deliberate choice to make that specific character the last to die. His death is the death of the Samurai. This is further cemented in the final scene where Tom Cruise's character gives the emperor *Katsumoto's* sword. Not some random katana, not his personal red sword, but Katsumoto's. The blade Katsumoto pledged to defend the emperor with, even when he was technically an enemy of the state. All these are significant details that carry the idea that the Samurai died with Katsumoto. Another way to think of it is, what if Katsumoto survived that battle? Would the Samurai be dead? All his men died. No one else, at least with any significant cultural or political significance, carries Samurai values. I think the answer is they would still \"live\" on.
