If you're at a deficit then you're going to lose everything, and no amount of protein will stop the muscle loss. It seems there are plenty of posts here thinking it helps prevent muscle loss, but it won't. \n\nYou're only exercising once a week. And I cannot tell what you mean when you say exercise. If you're trying to lose weight (keyword is weight, not fat and not muscle. There's also water retention, bone structure, etc.) then one needs to keep at a deficit like you've been doing. Forget BMI, forget BF% as it's only useful in a long term trending analysis.\n\nThe human body is thermodynamics at it's core. Here are a few things that may benefit most in this post:\n\n1. Fat is typically stored when one eats in excess of their bodies needs. It's our way of storing away for \"winter.\"  Keep this in mind through out all of this.\n\n2. Body Fat % only matters if one is a -_Professional_ Body Builder, OR if one wants visible Abdominals. \n\nMen\n\n4-6% (shredded, not worth it)\n\n7-10% (abs visible always, full time gym)\n \n10-15% (lean and fit, the goal)\n\nWomen\n\nNotice how drastically different these numbers are.\n\n12% (shredded, no period, not fertile, not worth it)\n\n12-17% (vert fit, a lot of exercise)\n\n17-25% (fit and lean, this one or the one below is a womans ideal if she's not a pro body builder)\n\n25-30% (where most women want to be but don t realize it because media lies, numbers aren't the same for men)\n\n\nMen and Women _can_ use similar weight lifting, cardio and core exercises. If one is a female and worried about bulding arms, it will NEVER happen. It cannot happen without \"help\" which won't be used, so no need to worry. Women just don't produce enough testosterone. \n\nEVEN if you're in the high end of Testosterone as a woman you literally need 10 times MORE to get the manly arms. Stop worrying about that and start lifting weights.\n\nIn order to lose more Fat than Muscle you have to weight lift five times a week. By exercising once a week and eating at a deficit you've told your body its \"winter\" and it's time to burn everything it can. The what, how fast, and when is your metabolism. Casual body builders who eat at a deficit still lose muscle. It cannot be stopped.\n\nThe normal non-chemically induced routine is too eat in surplus, lift heavy but safe, five times a week. Both Muscle and Fat will develop. If done properly less fat then muscle will develop. \n\nThen they change the cycle to a cutting phase. Burn off the fat while keeping as much Muscle as possible. \n\nIf one is overweight then there are two ways to go about this: Lift heavy, exercise the entire weekday, eat lean but in excess in order to provide muscles the fuel to develop and heal. The more muscle one has the more your body needs to keep going, so it's a pleasant side effect. Instead of needing 1500 Kcals a day, one will need 1700, then, 1900. This will be awesome when you go to the fat burning cycle. Your body will eat all that fat ro keep your muscles around. It will still eat some muscle but not as much.\n\nOne can't just stop excercising though. Muscles need to be torn then heal, torn then heal. Both slow twitch and fast twitch.\n\nIt sounds like the OPs plan was to deprive oneself of calories and expect all the fat to burn. It's not going to work that way. You'll change your metabolism to say.. woah I don't actually need that much to survive and oh look I'm not lifting weights anymore so lets reduce the daily need by eating those muscles.\n\nHeres my suggestion:\n\nIf obese, so nothing but core and treadmill until you're at an ok weight. I've seen friends drop serious weight with just this. Stop measuring anything but weight. You're not working your muscles, so why measure BF or BMI or anything but weight right now.\n\nThen get to a weekly plan where you strengthen your core for two months, then start lifting heavy (heavy for you, not heavy for that dick on the smith) \n\nStart eating more protein but not a ton at once. You can damage your kidneys badly by taking too much protein. It's easy to find a gram calculator.\n\nIf you're already at an ok weight and want to focus on dropping body fat, you'll need to go UP in weight first. Muscles count as weight also... Gain the muscle, minimize the fat gain. THEN go back to your deficiency workout. If you didnt have a ton of muscles to begin with you're going to end up worse off.\n\nLet's step back and put all this in perspective. You and every other human will ALWAYS burn muscle when eating at a deficit. But you can burn more fat then muscle. So calculate the amount of muscle versus fat you want to END UP at, then scale up from there. If you want to be 180lbs and 6% body fat, figure out the amount of fat and muscle you need to be at when you start cutting. Obviously you'll need more fat and muscle then the 180lb 6%bf person has. Because you're going to lose both.\n\nThe distribution of fat loss and muscle loss is too hard to nail down in a general sense as it's all about your own metabolism and body. \n\nThink about that pic where the guy fixed the Gold Ring. He added MORE Gold and MORE filler then needed because he knew he'd lose both when shaving down to fit the lean part of the band.

Burn off the fat while keeping as much Muscle as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If one is overweight then there are two ways to go about this: Lift heavy, exercise the entire weekday, eat lean but in excess in order to provide muscles the fuel to develop and heal. The more muscle one has the more your body needs to keep going, so it&amp;#39;s a pleasant side effect. Instead of needing 1500 Kcals a day, one will need 1700, then, 1900. This will be awesome when you go to the fat burning cycle. Your body will eat all that fat ro keep your muscles around. It will still eat some muscle but not as much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One can&amp;#39;t just stop excercising though. Muscles need to be torn then heal, torn then heal. Both slow twitch and fast twitch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like the OPs plan was to deprive oneself of calories and expect all the fat to burn. It&amp;#39;s not going to work that way. You&amp;#39;ll change your metabolism to say.. woah I don&amp;#39;t actually need that much to survive and oh look I&amp;#39;m not lifting weights anymore so lets reduce the daily need by eating those muscles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heres my suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If obese, so nothing but core and treadmill until you&amp;#39;re at an ok weight. I&amp;#39;ve seen friends drop serious weight with just this. Stop measuring anything but weight. You&amp;#39;re not working your muscles, so why measure BF or BMI or anything but weight right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then get to a weekly plan where you strengthen your core for two months, then start lifting heavy (heavy for you, not heavy for that dick on the smith) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start eating more protein but not a ton at once. You can damage your kidneys badly by taking too much protein. It&amp;#39;s easy to find a gram calculator.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re already at an ok weight and want to focus on dropping body fat, you&amp;#39;ll need to go UP in weight first. Muscles count as weight also... Gain the muscle, minimize the fat gain. THEN go back to your deficiency workout. If you didnt have a ton of muscles to begin with you&amp;#39;re going to end up worse off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s step back and put all this in perspective. You and every other human will ALWAYS burn muscle when eating at a deficit. But you can burn more fat then muscle. So calculate the amount of muscle versus fat you want to END UP at, then scale up from there. If you want to be 180lbs and 6% body fat, figure out the amount of fat and muscle you need to be at when you start cutting. Obviously you&amp;#39;ll need more fat and muscle then the 180lb 6%bf person has. Because you&amp;#39;re going to lose both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The distribution of fat loss and muscle loss is too hard to nail down in a general sense as it&amp;#39;s all about your own metabolism and body. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about that pic where the guy fixed the Gold Ring. He added MORE Gold and MORE filler then needed because he knew he&amp;#39;d lose both when shaving down to fit the lean part of the band. That&amp;#39;s your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dgc3axy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492382234.0, "created_utc": 1492353434.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m874", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbne10", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ErikTheElectric", "parent_id": "t3_65m874", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What leads you to think that you're losing muscle? \n\nIt sounds like your programming just sucks.
