I read about symptoms of magnesium deficiency and bought a supplement, and it was like night and day. Suddenly I had the energy and endurance of a generally normal person. I mean, it has waxed and waned based on normal factors (diet otherwise, whether I&amp;#39;m exercising regularly, grieving), but I am much more energetic than before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dg9i7q9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492222024.0, "created_utc": 1492193224.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 49}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cp3p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cp3p", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9idkw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Delvify", "parent_id": "t1_dg9i7kr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just started using chronometer a few days ago, and this is exactly what I'm doing now too.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just started using chronometer a few days ago, and this is exactly what I&amp;#39;m doing now too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dg9idkw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492222218.0, "created_utc": 1492193418.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9i7kr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ILikeMultis", "parent_id": "t1_dg9i1h8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Eat Spinach, Yoghurt, Almonds ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat Spinach, Yoghurt, Almonds &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dg9i7kr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492222019.0, "created_utc": 1492193219.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9i1h8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 23, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JohnnyRyde", "parent_id": "t1_dg9gm9e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Could you elaborate?
