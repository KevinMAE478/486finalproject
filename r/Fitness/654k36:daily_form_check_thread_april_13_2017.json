When you warm up, get on the bad girl machine (lol) it's the one where you force your knees out and put a moderate weight on there you can get 20 reps of relatively easily. Now this is important -- when you push your knees out, lean in and try to mimic the position of the bottom of the sumo deadlift. You're going to teach your brain what it FEELS like to activate the glute group in that position. Do this for at least three sets of 20, and really focus on the sides and back of your butt. You'll feel it activate. \n\nNext, go find a wall with a mat next to it and put your feet up on the wall, knees bent at 90-100 degrees, and slowly slide them down the wall spreading your legs apart until you feel the adductors stretch. You want to loosen these up before you go deadlift. Hold for at least one minute, maybe more. Just go by feel. \n\nNow go get a band and wrap it around your knees. Squat down slightly, and do a crabwalk to one side and then the other. You'll feel your glutes activate when you do this. \n\nNow when you go to deadlift, you will be warmed up and the right muscles will be primed. Lower the weight by 10% and focus on pushing your knees out and SQUATTING the weight up. The wider your knees, the closer your hips in relation to the bar, and the better leverage your glutes will have, and again - the glutes are what you should be firing primarily. \n\nYour next exercise should focus on the glutes since they're a weakness. Do wide stance box squats or glute bridges with a wide stance. Pick something that puts you in that similar position. The law of specificity dictates that the closer a movement to the target movement, the more carryover you'll have. 3 sets of 6-8 at a difficulty of 8-9 out of 10 should suffice. \n\nThe most important thing is to teach your brain to connect with your glutes!\n\nHope this helps.

That statement either makes sense or it doesn&amp;#39;t. Just focus on getting stronger quads. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, put the damn bar on some 2 inch blocks for crying out loud. For you right now, pulling from the floor is like squatting too low. It may placate the depth police, but at the cost of your lumbar spine. Fuck the naysayers. You should have that bar at least two inches higher than it is now. You can even stack plates on the floor if your gym doesn&amp;#39;t have blocks. But please stop pulling from the floor. It&amp;#39;s not worth it until you&amp;#39;ve addressed the issues that I mentioned above. A solid six months of pulling from blocks, trap bar variations, and STRENGTHENING THOSE DAMN QUADS will save you a lifetime of lower back issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dg8hpsp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492158863.0, "created_utc": 1492130063.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654k36", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654k36", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8rvxq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrZainyyy", "parent_id": "t1_dg82nnh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My squat is 120kg x 5 and Deadlift is is 125kg x 5, ratios are kinda off lmao.
