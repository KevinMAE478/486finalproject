After nearly a year I&amp;#39;d lost 4 kgs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started logging my food on August 1 last year and the weight started falling off. Down to 91 kgs as of today and feel better than ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With regard to overtraining, it&amp;#39;s easy to do and sometimes I feel run down as I was running 5 km nearly every day and hitting the gym to lift weights for an hour in the arvo with no rest days at all. So I changed to 20 mins of HIIT running in the morning and 30 mins of lifting weights in the arvo. Still losing fat, gaining muscle, feeling great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone is different, but long jogs aren&amp;#39;t the key. Diet is far and away the most important factor. HIIT is effective, whether lifting weights or pounding the pavement. Get a heart rate monitor and get used to hitting 100% effort for 30 seconds to a minute. Rest and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also July is very ambitious with regards to weight loss. You should probably be under 90 kgs - no matter how muscular you are. That is  likely to take close to a year. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dgdd2w1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492456290.0, "created_utc": 1492427490.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qiyl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcjiwf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bchmgal", "parent_id": "t3_65qiyl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Watch Alan Thrall's video on overtraining.
