I finished a set and a guy made his way from the bathroom over to the dumbbells where I'm currently at.\n\n\nHe started hammer curling 40 lbs on each side, looking great, getting a nice pump going. But then he started slowing down a little.... a little more... and a little more... then he pushed out one last rep... and suddenly, he froze. He didn't move for a couple seconds. Something happened. I quickly glanced up, worried maybe he pulled something? Maybe.. but I saw a sheer look of terror in his eyes.\n\n\nThen it hit me. The stench of morning eggs mixed with oatmeal and some sort of protein powder formed a vile monstrosity that made it's way towards my senses. My nostrils started sizzling. I felt the stinging sensation as as they slowly start to disintegrate. It was like the fuse of a dynamite being burned. The putrid gas was so bad, I gagged in the inside and lost a couple of breaths in the process. I HAD to get up, and move some feet back. As I did this, I noticed the culprit right in front of me. He has now engaged in emergency butt clench mode, trying to retract what's left. He finally managed to penguin wobble into the bathroom area and disappear from my sight. He cleaned up in about 15 minutes, before he got out and quickly walked out of the gym.\n\n\nI felt so bad for the guy. I wished I knew what to say to save his face, but I felt like anything done would just add more embarrassment to the poor thing. Good thing he was wearing sweats that day!

I finished a set and a guy made his way from the bathroom over to the dumbbells where I&amp;#39;m currently at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He started hammer curling 40 lbs on each side, looking great, getting a nice pump going. But then he started slowing down a little.... a little more... and a little more... then he pushed out one last rep... and suddenly, he froze. He didn&amp;#39;t move for a couple seconds. Something happened. I quickly glanced up, worried maybe he pulled something? Maybe.. but I saw a sheer look of terror in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it hit me. The stench of morning eggs mixed with oatmeal and some sort of protein powder formed a vile monstrosity that made it&amp;#39;s way towards my senses. My nostrils started sizzling. I felt the stinging sensation as as they slowly start to disintegrate. It was like the fuse of a dynamite being burned. The putrid gas was so bad, I gagged in the inside and lost a couple of breaths in the process. I HAD to get up, and move some feet back. As I did this, I noticed the culprit right in front of me. He has now engaged in emergency butt clench mode, trying to retract what&amp;#39;s left. He finally managed to penguin wobble into the bathroom area and disappear from my sight. He cleaned up in about 15 minutes, before he got out and quickly walked out of the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt so bad for the guy.
