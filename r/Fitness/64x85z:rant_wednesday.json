For reference my entire life I&amp;#39;ve been 5&amp;#39;0 and around 112 lbs. As of today I&amp;#39;m 121lbs. I was still around 114-115 in December with 0 exercise. Why isn&amp;#39;t the scale changing at all? Why don&amp;#39;t I feel like my body is changing? I know a 6-8 month gym hiatus is a lot but come on. Right now my body hurts, I&amp;#39;m tired all the time and I feel defeated. I know I&amp;#39;m rambling but today I just lost it and started crying. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I feel like my body won&amp;#39;t ever be the way it used to. I started taking BCAAs this week and I swear it&amp;#39;s just making me feel sick and nauseous. I feel like my stomach always hurts or I feel sick. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I really, really started to kill it in cardio these last 2-3 weeks. The other weeks my cardio was super mild. I don&amp;#39;t feel like I have more energy, my body just hurts all the time now. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dg78l9u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492093180.0, "created_utc": 1492064380.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x85z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg77vj8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "1gn0ranc3", "parent_id": "t3_64x85z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yesterday everything went alright, did a nice warm up, calf press was going nicely.
