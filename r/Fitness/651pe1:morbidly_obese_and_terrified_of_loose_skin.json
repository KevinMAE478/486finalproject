That link is to his comment where he talks about loose skin.\n\nFrom posts like that and articles like [this](http://www.livestrong.com/article/116397-prevent-sagging-skin-during-weight/) it seems to come down to: take it slow, eat healthy (fruit, vegetables, chicken, nuts, etc), drink lots of water (healthy and keeps the skin hydrated), and exercise.\n\nAs for motivation I'd say don't expect change too fast. See it as a permanent change in lifestyle, and sooner or later you'll get used to your new healthy lifestyle and eating habits, and losing weight + maintaining a healthy weight will come naturally.

A few tips on how I try and avoid it:\n\n1. Get rid of the junk food in your house. All of it. When cravings happen, you want to make it as hard as possible to get to the bad food. Often I'm craving sugar late at night but I'm just too lazy to walk to the shop to get it, so I'll just go to bed instead.\n\n2. If you don't cut things out entirely, you won't crave them as badly. I drink diet soda, flavoured sparkling water, and always have some hot chocolate (made with water so minimal calories) before bed. That's a decent amount of sweet stuff, so my body doesn't see it as \"restricting sugar\". It also means if I do crave sweetness, if I guzzle some diet soda it both solves the craving and fills me up.\n\n3. Try some version of intermittent fasting. This is an eating plan where you fit all your meals into a specific window of time-anywhere from 8 hours downwards. I found this helpful because it meant I could have two BIG meals a day, which stopped my body thinking I wasn't eating enough. It's also almost a mini-binge! Personally I couldn't fully fast outside the window, so I'll wake up and have coffee and a piece of fruit in the morning, then have a big lunch at ~12 and a big dinner at ~8. The big dinner then helps prevent late night cravings because I'm already pretty full and I already have my hot chocolate to look forward to!\n\nQuite a long comment for only 3 tips, but I hope this helps!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one else has addressed the &amp;quot;binge eating&amp;quot; part of it, and this is what I struggle with most when I&amp;#39;m on a cut - I&amp;#39;ll be perfectly healthy for a few weeks, then ruin it by going all out on one day and hitting 5,000 calories easy.

Honestly though, I think sticking to the diet and worrying about losing the weight over time at a manageable and gradual - yet consistent - pace is the best approach. Accept there will be some loose skin, but you&amp;#39;re only 22, so the chances are your skin may be more elastic then some of the other people you&amp;#39;ve seen, meaning it may not be as loose as your worried about. Plus any loose skin may continue to tighten after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck, keep researching up on the process of dieting and keep working at it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dg6qp39", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492067816.0, "created_utc": 1492039016.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651pe1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651pe1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6z4pv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EmilytheMeme", "parent_id": "t1_dg6ywxo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Never was a beach person anyways.
