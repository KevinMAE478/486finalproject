I started walking 3k a day after work, then 5k, then 7k. I began logging my calories, and I lost weight. I stopped walking and started going to the gym to be more efficient with my time. It took a lot of effort to be comfortable at the gym, but I did it. I lost 100 pounds in the first year, and then I slowly came to a plateau at 365, which maintained steady for 1.5 years. I stopped all exercise and gym activity when my mom died. I just couldn&amp;#39;t focus on anything and was no longer motivated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This past winter, I gained back to 388, and it scared me back into action. From mid January to now, I have lost 33 pounds and am sitting at 355. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I currently do one hour on the elliptical for cardio, at level 16. It&amp;#39;s a steady pace with a few hard bursts to raise my HR. My heart has gotten quite healthy compared to what it was, and it now takes more effort to raise my HR, which i&amp;#39;m happy about. I also do some circuit training with machines, alternating days from arms/back to legs. It&amp;#39;s not intense, but I currently feel proud of what I do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I count and track my calories extremely carefully. The initial drop has slowed, and i&amp;#39;m now losing two pounds a week, which is what I plan for. I am not crash dieting. I know how to lose in a healthy manner and live this new lifestyle of moderation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also track my weight every day using the TDEE spreadsheet found here on &lt;a href=\"/r/Fitness\"&gt;/r/Fitness&lt;/a&gt;  to see the fluctuation and see my weekly average come down slowly, and that gives me great satisfaction to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, here&amp;#39;s my main question...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have the summer months off of work (May-August). We will be in a new city for my wife&amp;#39;s summer job. I have 4 months where I won&amp;#39;t really be doing anything, don&amp;#39;t know anyone, and I want to spend my days at the gym to seriously take a crack at getting my body into shape. No matter what, I want to weigh 325 at the most by the end of summer. I think it&amp;#39;s realistic, and i&amp;#39;m not expecting miracles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I need to know how I can workout at the gym for roughly 6 hours a day without hurting myself. I need help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I primarily want to accelerate my fat loss, and gain lean muscle. I don&amp;#39;t have a desire to be &amp;quot;ripped&amp;quot; per se, but I want more muscle to help burn more calories and to have good health and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will definitely be making an appointment with a personal trainer when I get there who can help set up a program and teach me some new things, but I know Reddit has some amazing people with a lot of knowledge.

You&amp;#39;re not used to it. You have to build up to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would suggest gradually increasing your activity level over the course of the summer. Your body needs time to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would suggest starting from your current activity level and add an exercise program (e.g. Couch to 5k for cardio) on top of your usual exercise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, if after 2-3 weeks you feel like you&amp;#39;ve adapted (eg: You don&amp;#39;t feel as winded when exercising), add a second exercise program (e.g. Strong Lifts for strength). Then after another couple of weeks or so, after having &amp;quot;adapted&amp;quot;, add some more, but always gradually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key is to do it gradually, otherwise you might put yourself in harm&amp;#39;s way. You have to crawl before you learn to walk, and learn to walk before you run ;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I just wanted to add that you shouldn&amp;#39;t expect to work out intensely 6 hours a day. As a beginner, it&amp;#39;s unrealistic to do that much. However, you could always pick up hiking for low intensity, or just incorporate lots of walking, but always start with a little and increase gradually. 6 hours a day is for elite or very advanced athletes.
