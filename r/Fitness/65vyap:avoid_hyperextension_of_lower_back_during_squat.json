For me, bending too far forward and the butt wink have been my problems.  When I bend too far forward, I have to use my entire set of back muscles to power the weight back up.  If I drop too low, then the butt wink means I have to use my low back muscles to assist.\n\nThe whole point of squats is to exercise your legs.  If I get a good leg workout, then it's good.  The better my form is, the better my leg workout will be.  If my form isn't perfect, and I either bend forward or do the butt wink, then I can get a back injury and the workout is bad.  So, I widen my stance in order to give myself some more ability to go lower with better form.  I have learned to be sensitive to right before I am going to lean forward or butt wink, and I stop the movement there.  This means that on some days, I don't go down to parallel.  When this happens, I finish my workout weights, but I just don't go parallel.  Instead, I decrease the weight for my next workout, get my form back and work my way back up.  If it is too bad, then I decrease the weight for the rest of this workout, too.\n\nOver time, as long as I am willing to stop the movement right before my form suffers, and as long as I'm willing to decrease the weight sufficiently to get my form back, then my form gets better and better and the weights keep going up.  My legs get more flexible.  My back gets stronger, but not so tight.  I can go lower without such a wide stance.  And all with higher weights.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some things that have worked for me to improve my squat form over time:\n* Do goblet squats instead for awhile\n* Grip the bar closer to my shoulders\n* Pinch my shoulder blades together before unracking the weight (goes along with closer grip)\n* Widen my stance a bit\n* Don&amp;#39;t go as low\n* Focus on Leg joints bending - no back\n* Lighter weights anytime my form suffers&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to have completely different issues with squats.  For me, bending too far forward and the butt wink have been my problems.  When I bend too far forward, I have to use my entire set of back muscles to power the weight back up.  If I drop too low, then the butt wink means I have to use my low back muscles to assist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole point of squats is to exercise your legs.  If I get a good leg workout, then it&amp;#39;s good.  The better my form is, the better my leg workout will be.  If my form isn&amp;#39;t perfect, and I either bend forward or do the butt wink, then I can get a back injury and the workout is bad.  So, I widen my stance in order to give myself some more ability to go lower with better form.  I have learned to be sensitive to right before I am going to lean forward or butt wink, and I stop the movement there.  This means that on some days, I don&amp;#39;t go down to parallel.  When this happens, I finish my workout weights, but I just don&amp;#39;t go parallel.  Instead, I decrease the weight for my next workout, get my form back and work my way back up.  If it is too bad, then I decrease the weight for the rest of this workout, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time, as long as I am willing to stop the movement right before my form suffers, and as long as I&amp;#39;m willing to decrease the weight sufficiently to get my form back, then my form gets better and better and the weights keep going up.
