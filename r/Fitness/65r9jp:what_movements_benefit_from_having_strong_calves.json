Whenever I get done jumping rope, my calves are on fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dgdu7q9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492480462.0, "created_utc": 1492451662.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65r9jp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdvjb8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WorstAsianEver", "parent_id": "t3_65r9jp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hiking as well.
