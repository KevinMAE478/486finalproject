Great Leg workout.   Seats usually suck though.  Bonus points if it has pedal straps.  B+ (A- with straps)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rowing Machine&lt;/strong&gt;: Low Impact. Full Body workout.  Requires some form knowledge.  A-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elliptical&lt;/strong&gt;:  Low Impact. Good workout for multiple muscles groups. A&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treadmill&lt;/strong&gt;:  I hate these fucking things, they&amp;#39;re so boring. If you want to run go run outside. Just dress appropriately for the weather.&lt;br/&gt;\n  Anyway, Medium impact. Not as good at training leg muscles as elliptical or cycling.  Does not burn the most calories per time spent. C+&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small Bonus&lt;/em&gt;: Any machines that have a built in fan. Makes a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small Bonus&lt;/em&gt;: Any machine where you can set up a Smart phone/tablet to stream movies or something while you workout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a machine but highly recommended if it must be indoors:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Swimming&lt;/strong&gt;:  Awesome full body workout.  Requires form Knowledge. A-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your goal is only cardio conditioning, not say training for cycling or running, just pick whichever you like best and will keep doing.  Or mix it up to keep things from getting less monotonous.   I&amp;#39;d also mix up HIIT and LISS. Don&amp;#39;t limit yourself to one or the other. Both have their place in a workout routine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But seriously, swimming.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dg7g3dh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492113695.0, "created_utc": 1492084895.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65379t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg762dt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Radedo", "parent_id": "t3_65379t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I fucking hate running (particularly on a treadmill) with all my heart, usually I just use the stationary bike, but I recently tried the recumbent bike and boy that thing is so comfy I never wanna leave.\n\nI think a stationary bike would engage your abs, arms, and core in general a bit more though( mostly because you'll spend half your time trying to hold yourself up so your butt isn't completely asleep by the time your done -_-)\n\nSame with a rowing machine of course, which I also really like but haven't used in a long time.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fucking hate running (particularly on a treadmill) with all my heart, usually I just use the stationary bike, but I recently tried the recumbent bike and boy that thing is so comfy I never wanna leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think a stationary bike would engage your abs, arms, and core in general a bit more though( mostly because you&amp;#39;ll spend half your time trying to hold yourself up so your butt isn&amp;#39;t completely asleep by the time your done -_-)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same with a rowing machine of course, which I also really like but haven&amp;#39;t used in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dg762dt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492088037.0, "created_utc": 1492059237.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65379t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65379t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg85hgk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thorrism", "parent_id": "t1_dg7o5x9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This. /S", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This. /S&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dg85hgk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143338.0, "created_utc": 1492114538.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7o5x9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MerryChristmasMr", "parent_id": "t3_65379t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My favorite cardio machine is the prowler.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite cardio machine is the prowler.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dg7o5x9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492124752.0, "created_utc": 1492095952.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65379t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65379t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65379t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65379t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ilga", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Elril", "parent_id": "t1_dg7hy7y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good answer.\n\nGood track to workout to.

I enjoy the &lt;a href=\"http://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/CYBEX/p_625AT_1?wid=1000&amp;amp;hei=800\"&gt;arc trainer&lt;/a&gt; due to it&amp;#39;s calories burned. MFP estimates it at about 19cal/min. I try not to do this machine too often because I&amp;#39;m overweight and don&amp;#39;t want to destroy my knees. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stationary bike is probably my second favorite because it doesn&amp;#39;t cause as much stress on the knee as the arc trainer.
