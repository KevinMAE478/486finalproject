It's not that our lower back is too weak, its actually stronger than the rest of the body so we naturally move the load to the back to lift the weight. It's most likely that your hamstrings can't handle all of the load. It looks like you have proportionally long femurs like me which causes us to have to start the deadlift with our hips higher than most people. Having higher hips puts more tension on the hamstrings which is why it is the weak link. \nI recomend you try deadlifting sumo for a while. Your body type is probably better suited for it. I recently switched to sumo and it's so much more natural. I'd prefer to pull conventional, and I still do but just not as heavy, but i'm just not built for it.
