Low mobility in the hips is not super uncommon and if you sit in chairs a lot and haven&amp;#39;t done a ton of exercises that stretch your Achilles tendon you might have low ankle dorsiflexion. Both of these things destroy ones ability to squat and therefore exercises that stretch the Achilles tendon and that stretch your hips can have more of an effect that adding more working sets. It also has the benefit of not increasing recovery time which is important for the legs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously you should test to see if this is the case for you but improving this aspect of your squats may lead to a significant increase in weight you can move. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dg8o54t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492167870.0, "created_utc": 1492139070.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655g5e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655g5e", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9848q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dlldp", "parent_id": "t1_dg8ulo4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So maybe just a focus on mobility stuff, keeping it light, would be better.
