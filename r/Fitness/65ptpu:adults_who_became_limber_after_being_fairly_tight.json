[His hip-flexor yoga stretch tutorial and video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/54fphc/the_hip_flexors_are_the_muscles_near_the_front_of/) were just what I needed. Getting better at this one helped my squat so much. I have to quadruple up the yoga mat so it doesn't hurt my knee, but damn, does it target that hip-flexor. There's a bunch of ways to stretch hamstrings so just hit the webs and work the ones you like. I have two stretches I like.\n\nBut those aren't my tip. My tip is this: **You're not breathing correctly when stretching.** I learned how to breathe for deeper stretches from a Licensed Physical Therapist and a Doctor of Osteopath, two different people, on separate occasions.\n\n1. Get into that first initial stretch position for whatever you're working on. Get to the limit of your chosen stretch where it starts to tug and hurt just a little bit, letting you know you've gone about as far as you should go. Now most people will hold their breath here or breathe really shallow. Then they start to bounce a little, sucking up the pain. Tendons and muscles screaming that they're gonna snap. Wrong. Way. To. Breathe.\n\n1. let out all your breath while holding the stretch position. Don't force it out. Just persuade it out. It'll feel weird and counterintuitive. Your body wants to hold on to a breath at this point. But you're not gonna do that. You're gonna breathe out.\n\n1. with that breath gone, stop breathing for a moment, stretch just a little further. You'll get just a little deeper than the previous step. You may only get a few more millimeters but you'll still get it. \n\n1. after getting those few extra millimeters, hold that stretch depth. Take a breath in. Not deep, not shallow. Just a normal breath.\n\n1. Repeat step 2, 3, and 4 (x 2)\n\n1. Hold final depth for five breaths. Breathe normal. Not shallow.\n\n1. Next stretch.\n\nYou'll make progress. Each session you stretch you'll get just a little bit deeper. You just need to learn how and when to breathe and when to hold your breath. You'll make that yoga class of housewives, behind the glass, jealous of just how flexible a powerlifter can be.", "edited": 1492407205.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I became much, much more flexible in my 40&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quoting myself responding to a similar question:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hip-flexors stretch I do was introduced to me by our own &lt;a href=\"/u/Antranik\"&gt;u/Antranik&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/54fphc/the_hip_flexors_are_the_muscles_near_the_front_of/\"&gt;His hip-flexor yoga stretch tutorial and video&lt;/a&gt; were just what I needed.

You progressively work the entire range of hip mobility.\n \nShiiko are the squatting exercises that sumo wrestlers do. It's a constant alternation between a deep squat hip stretch and a one-legged rise that reinforces not only strength but balance and stability. \n\nAfter thousands of reps, one day on the way down my hips just kind of magically dropped past parallel and I settled into my first deep squat.

Once I learned to engage my hips and hinge correctly, taking my back completely out of the movement, I moved on to squats. By that point squatting was easy because my hips had great range of motion precluding the involvement of my back in the movement.

Your first and only early goal should be to build up to a twenty minute sit.  This will be tough but it will be worth it. I am able for the first time in my 42 years on this earth to put my hands flat on the floor after doing these squat sits as I call them for six months.  It has also improved my gait and I no longer look like I am 42 and stiff anymore.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eastern style squats.
