Of course five pounds isn't going to make a huge visible difference when you're borderline obese (your BMI comes out to exactly 30, though you said you used to be really fit, probably have more muscle than average). The mirror will just drive you mad, so ignore it for awhile. Second, I think you need to look at your TDEE and calorie counts again. Given the information you provided, dropping another 400 calories would put you at 1400 a day. That's really low for what is a relatively slow cut.

The second, and only other thing, is to lower your calorie intake. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some easy math tells us your deficit is at an average of 100 calories a day. You say your diet is consistent, but then even your consistent weekdays show a variation of 400 calories, with the weekends being far worse. If you want to actually see results, bring that variation to about 200 a day, 7 days a week. Don&amp;#39;t have cheat days. You can have a cheat meal, but fit it into your macros. Once you actually have a consistent diet, dial your calories down another 400 a day. Then you&amp;#39;ll start to see the results you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two other things I want to make a note of: First off, stop staring in the mirror. Of course five pounds isn&amp;#39;t going to make a huge visible difference when you&amp;#39;re borderline obese (your BMI comes out to exactly 30, though you said you used to be really fit, probably have more muscle than average). The mirror will just drive you mad, so ignore it for awhile. Second, I think you need to look at your TDEE and calorie counts again. Given the information you provided, dropping another 400 calories would put you at 1400 a day. That&amp;#39;s really low for what is a relatively slow cut. You should be able to maintain a 500 calorie deficit at ~2000 a day, provided you&amp;#39;re active (even with a &amp;#39;slow&amp;#39; metabolism). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Fitness", "name": "t1_dg798gj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492094789.0, "created_utc": 1492065989.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652yfx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhx4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652yfx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7gl93", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CrashBandicoot1990", "parent_id": "t1_dg7g1jv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fitness", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I know I used to be very fit.
