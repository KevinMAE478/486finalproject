That was the weight I was going for.  For some weird reason bent over rows was the only one I started at a weight less than what the program called for (think it was just cus it was the first exercise I did with more than just the bar, so was nervous) so that one might still not be following the traditional path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was also DL my body weight already on that day too... but DLing I think is a lil different.  You can take more with that one, and the weight doesn&amp;#39;t end up over your head on lil arms.  Also much easier to add &amp;quot;less than the program calls for&amp;quot; with that one if it becomes a struggle (which I think it might next time).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forgot about the whole male/female thing and that it can be different.  What I think I have been &amp;quot;convinced&amp;quot; to do... is not deload per se, but on things I can &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; like this last one, but know it was a struggle... keep doing the same weight for at least 2-3 sessions of it, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; try to move up.  Even though my last DL was fine, I still might consider doing that for that as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had actually had that plan in a way from the start.  My goal was never to kill myself in the name of &amp;quot;strength&amp;quot;, but to still get stronger.  (Note:  still not killing myself... yet.  I feel like I recover fine).
