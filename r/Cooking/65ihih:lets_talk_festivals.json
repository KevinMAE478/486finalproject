Often, trips are a week or longer in the summer, so ice is pretty much out and who wants to drag an empty cooler around for 5 days once the ice is gone.\n\nOne big difference is that my canoe trips are usually pretty full of paddling and portaging part of the day with some fishing or hiking thrown in. I usually aim for about 3500 calories/day and lose a few pounds anyway.\n\nWhen I'm on these trips, weight isn't the issue as much as space is. I've got a 17' canoe with enough capacity for two big guys, gear, and food for a week. You have to portage a bit, but you can make more than one trip, so weight isn't the main concern, you just have to fit everything in the boat. For cooking gear, I'll bring a back packing stove, a back packing cookset, a cast iron fry pan for frying fish, a coffee kettle for heating water, plastic utensils, and a cup, bowl, and plate. If it's a larger group, I bring a collapsible kitchen sink for washing dishes.\n\nI bring things like pasta and rice packets, and freeze dried mashed potatoes with gravy packets. Add some canned meat products for protein. You can also bring some onions as they'll keep as long as you're not keeping them locked up in your car with temps getting over 120\u00b0 F. Peppers will also keep for a few days without cooling. Both are pretty versatile and will go a little ways to make your meals seem a bit less like slop that you're shoveling into your food hole in between bouts of drunken debauchery. \n\nCanned white meat chicken usually pairs with just about any of the normal pasta/rice sides like alfredo. I'm referring to the type of side dish that comes in a pouch with the seasoning mixed in that you just need to simmer with water. Some call for margarine and/or milk. Bring some olive oil and powered milk. Use half as much oil as is called for margarine (margarine is half water).\n\nCanned roast beef is pricier and usually comes in some sort of gravy or broth so it's a bit less flexible. It does go well with instant mashed potatoes though.\n\nTuna packets are another good choice. They can be paired with some pasta sides or rice, or you could bring some tortillas and mayo packets to make tuna wraps. Add some diced onion and pepper for crunch.\n\nFreeze-dried meals intended for camping are also an option. Most of them just require adding boiling water and letting them steep for a bit. I'm not a big fan of most of them as they're sort of samey and the textures are off. However, adding one or two for some variety might be nice and the scrambled eggs are nice for a change of pace for breakfast if you're eating mostly oatmeal.\n\nLook for some individual serving size items of foods that you like or could be used to enhance your meals. Things like pickles and olives are absolutely delicious after you've been outdoors sweating and drinking. Your body will be craving the salt.\n\nInstant oatmeal packs are good for making breakfast. Get a variety pack and either toss the flavors you don't like or give them to somebody else.\n\nTrail mix keeps well in hot conditions and makes an easy snack. Lunches could be granola bars or protein bars, both keep well. Bring powdered Gatorade or similar. If you don't bring your own water, the water provided onsite at some festies might be drinkable, but taste horrible. Having something to cover the taste can be helpful, not to mention, you'll need to replace your electrolytes.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your requirements are similar to what I have when I go canoe camping in wilderness areas.

I usually aim for about 3500 calories/day and lose a few pounds anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m on these trips, weight isn&amp;#39;t the issue as much as space is. I&amp;#39;ve got a 17&amp;#39; canoe with enough capacity for two big guys, gear, and food for a week. You have to portage a bit, but you can make more than one trip, so weight isn&amp;#39;t the main concern, you just have to fit everything in the boat. For cooking gear, I&amp;#39;ll bring a back packing stove, a back packing cookset, a cast iron fry pan for frying fish, a coffee kettle for heating water, plastic utensils, and a cup, bowl, and plate. If it&amp;#39;s a larger group, I bring a collapsible kitchen sink for washing dishes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bring things like pasta and rice packets, and freeze dried mashed potatoes with gravy packets. Add some canned meat products for protein. You can also bring some onions as they&amp;#39;ll keep as long as you&amp;#39;re not keeping them locked up in your car with temps getting over 120\u00b0 F. Peppers will also keep for a few days without cooling. Both are pretty versatile and will go a little ways to make your meals seem a bit less like slop that you&amp;#39;re shoveling into your food hole in between bouts of drunken debauchery. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Canned white meat chicken usually pairs with just about any of the normal pasta/rice sides like alfredo. I&amp;#39;m referring to the type of side dish that comes in a pouch with the seasoning mixed in that you just need to simmer with water. Some call for margarine and/or milk. Bring some olive oil and powered milk. Use half as much oil as is called for margarine (margarine is half water).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Canned roast beef is pricier and usually comes in some sort of gravy or broth so it&amp;#39;s a bit less flexible. It does go well with instant mashed potatoes though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuna packets are another good choice. They can be paired with some pasta sides or rice, or you could bring some tortillas and mayo packets to make tuna wraps. Add some diced onion and pepper for crunch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Freeze-dried meals intended for camping are also an option. Most of them just require adding boiling water and letting them steep for a bit. I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of most of them as they&amp;#39;re sort of samey and the textures are off. However, adding one or two for some variety might be nice and the scrambled eggs are nice for a change of pace for breakfast if you&amp;#39;re eating mostly oatmeal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for some individual serving size items of foods that you like or could be used to enhance your meals. Things like pickles and olives are absolutely delicious after you&amp;#39;ve been outdoors sweating and drinking. Your body will be craving the salt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instant oatmeal packs are good for making breakfast. Get a variety pack and either toss the flavors you don&amp;#39;t like or give them to somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trail mix keeps well in hot conditions and makes an easy snack. Lunches could be granola bars or protein bars, both keep well. Bring powdered Gatorade or similar. If you don&amp;#39;t bring your own water, the water provided onsite at some festies might be drinkable, but taste horrible. Having something to cover the taste can be helpful, not to mention, you&amp;#39;ll need to replace your electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Cooking", "name": "t1_dgarvhs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492299388.0, "created_utc": 1492270588.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ihih", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ihih", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbsj6s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stefanica", "parent_id": "t1_dgaofea", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Cooking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have made really decent camp chili with beef jerky and dried beans/rice (Vigo brand).", "edited": 1492326426.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have made really decent camp chili with beef jerky and dried beans/rice (Vigo brand).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Cooking", "name": "t1_dgbsj6s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492354034.0, "created_utc": 1492325234.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaofea", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dark_Jinouga", "parent_id": "t3_65ihih", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Cooking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "possibly something incorperating dried/cured/smoked meat? dont really use them at all but the whole concept behind it was to make it last long without cooling, and I bet there are fucktons of good ways to use it depending on what it is.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;possibly something incorperating dried/cured/smoked meat? dont really use them at all but the whole concept behind it was to make it last long without cooling, and I bet there are fucktons of good ways to use it depending on what it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Cooking", "name": "t1_dgaofea", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492294157.0, "created_utc": 1492265357.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ihih", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ihih", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ihih", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ihih", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ihih", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc8tio", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "75footubi", "parent_id": "t1_dgbh2h5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Cooking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, but there are better options that require similar amounts of prep or less (ie MREs) that don't taste absolutely vile.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, but there are better options that require similar amounts of prep or less (ie MREs) that don&amp;#39;t taste absolutely vile.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Cooking", "name": "t1_dgc8tio", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492389923.0, "created_utc": 1492361123.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbh2h5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shudsee", "parent_id": "t1_dgbgoif", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Cooking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sure there is;

Google spreadsheet is your friend here, since people can plan what they&amp;#39;re going to make for meals in it then one person can consolidate ingredients in the sheet and make a big costco run on the way to get stuff in bulk. Honda EU2000i can handle the compressor on the fridge and a couple blenders at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gotta stop now before I go way off topic and tell you how to run a theme camp.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Cooking", "name": "t1_dgaqgqx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492297374.0, "created_utc": 1492268574.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ihih", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ihih", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgawmia", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fljg", "parent_id": "t1_dgar55n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Cooking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not sure if \"a huge gas bottle\" is allowed on the camping grounds. will look into a cooler though.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure if &amp;quot;a huge gas bottle&amp;quot; is allowed on the camping grounds. will look into a cooler though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Cooking", "name": "t1_dgawmia", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492305987.0, "created_utc": 1492277187.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgar55n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GeneralCusterVLX", "parent_id": "t3_65ihih", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Cooking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Vegetables are great, last and are pretty underrated top that off with canned, smoked and dried stuff and you're good to go.\n\nIf your going on festivals/camping a lot with the same group of friends invest in a gas cooler.
