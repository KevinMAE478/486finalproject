I&amp;#39;m going to go full heretic here, and suggest some grated mozzarella, because I used to use the &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; stuff and it was too wet even after draining, meaning the base soaked up the water and didn&amp;#39;t turn out well. Slap them in the oven, take them out when the cheese is browned, and there you go - cooked crust all over.
