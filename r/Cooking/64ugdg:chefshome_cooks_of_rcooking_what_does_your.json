Then plan your meals - even if it is just loose planning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I shop I&amp;#39;m always thinking &amp;quot;Okay, bread, meat, cheese that&amp;#39;ll be sandwiches for lunch for 3 days, I&amp;#39;ll make a lasagna on Monday and that&amp;#39;ll be dinner that night and also tuesday, I have chicken in the freezer I&amp;#39;ll pull that out monday so it&amp;#39;ll be thawed for wednesday and I&amp;#39;ll cook that with rice that I already have so I should buy broccoli and I&amp;#39;ll take the leftovers for thursday&amp;#39;s lunch. Thursday dinner I&amp;#39;m going out with the girlfriend so no big deal there.... etc etc etc.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like everything else in life it becomes way, way easier once you have a plan. Even better some day six months or a year from now after you&amp;#39;ve cooked a bunch of recipes and learned a little bit you&amp;#39;ll be home on some thursday night and realize you forgot to go to the store, you&amp;#39;ll open your fridge and see pork chops, 2 eggs, some leftover rice and broccolli, and a red pepper that is on its way out and you&amp;#39;ll whip up a stirfry without a book and without even thinking about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Cooking", "name": "t1_dg5xh6u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492036009.0, "created_utc": 1492007209.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ugdg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5t7rr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Funk_Doctor", "parent_id": "t3_64ugdg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Cooking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you have the freezer space, a vacuum sealer is a great investment.
