There&amp;#39;s also a technical aspect to it. I think it works best if you slightly undercook the pasta, drain it and put it back in the pot, add the sauce to the pasta, add a bit of pasta water, and stir to mix while on heat (residual heat on an electric stovetop would be enough). I think the stirring action is what does the emulsification and thickening, and since its on the heat, you evaporate any excess liquid until you get to the consistency you desire. I can imagine if you&amp;#39;re just pouring a bit of slightly starchy pasta water into a pot of sauce before serving, it might not have much of an effect. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Cooking", "name": "t1_dg78cs2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492092630.0, "created_utc": 1492063830.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yqts", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yqts", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yqts", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg64vh6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mister_Sporks_Hands", "parent_id": "t1_dg628ca", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Cooking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No it won't but 'need' is subjective and depends greatly on the type of sauce.
