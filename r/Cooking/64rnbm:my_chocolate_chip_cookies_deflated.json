Every box of baking soda I&amp;#39;ve bought there has been completely flat - so flat, I would need 2+ tsp in a batch to make a decent cookie.  I stopped buying it there, and bought it instead at a store with more baking goods turnover, and wow what a difference.  With fresh baking soda the same cookies are almost too leavened with only a scant 1/4 tsp, and I have to smoosh them a bit before baking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Cooking", "name": "t1_dg6246a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492041216.0, "created_utc": 1492012416.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rnbm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ansd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "socratessue", "parent_id": "t1_dg5yezg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Cooking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No, it doesn't expire.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, it doesn&amp;#39;t expire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Cooking", "name": "t1_dg7ansd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492098688.0, "created_utc": 1492069888.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5yezg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hammiesink", "parent_id": "t1_dg5saxm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Cooking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Baking soda can expire..?
