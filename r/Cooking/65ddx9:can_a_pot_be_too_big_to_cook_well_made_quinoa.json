You'd want a much bigger burner to produce enough heat to bring 120 quarts up to a boil.\n\nA really wide pan increases the amount of evaporation than a really narrow one.  Cooking sauces for long periods on a really wide pan isn't a good idea because of the increased amount of evaporation; if you walk away for a half hour it's much more likely to scorch. \n\nThe issue with rice is basically the same.  If you were to cook a quarter cup of rice in your dutch oven, evaporation would make the water level difficult to nail.  If you were trying to make enough rice to feed 50 people on your back burner, you might have an issue with the amount of heat that burner puts out.\n\n8 cups of rice in a 5 quart Dutch oven is going to be fine.  Keep in mind, though, that evaporation means that rice recipes don't actually scale linearly.  Rice requires 1 cup of water per cup of rice, plus whatever extra water you need to account for evaporation.  Evaporation's roughly constant as you add more rice.\n\n&gt; How good is an enameled Dutch oven at steaming large amounts of food such as potatoes and vegetables compared to stainless, triply &amp; aluminum?\n\nThe material isn't really going to make a difference here.  However, you'd obviously be able to steam more in a 12 quart stock pot than a 5 quart dutch oven, simply because of size.\n\n&gt; Also, the Dutch oven won't take longer to steam, boil or cook food compared to other materials?\n\nMinimally so.  Iron's a very good heat sink, which is part of why it's popular for skillets and soup pots.  Aluminum is a much better conductor and holds much less heat.  So it will take a couple min less for an aluminum pot to get up to temp than a dutch oven will.  It's not a big issue for most uses and you can start preheating the pan a minute earlier during your prep to account for that.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main issues with pan size is evaporation, hotspots, and heat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a pan is significantly wider than your heating element, you&amp;#39;re probably going to end up with hot spots on the pan: the edges will be cool and the center will be hot.
