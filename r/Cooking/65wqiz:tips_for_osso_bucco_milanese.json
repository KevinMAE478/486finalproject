If only tomatoes, you might have to adjust the amount of liquid. That being said, I also don't like the idea of using store bought tomato sauce. If you have tomato paste, however, drop a good spoonful of it while you're saut\u00e9ing the vegetables, and let it caramelize for a good 2-4 minutes.

You don't need liquid to completely cover the meat. 2/3 of the way is fine. However, when you are braising, take the time of flip the meat every half hour or so. If you don't, everything not submerged will dry out (due to steam) and will not have a great appearance.\n\n3. The oven temperature seems high.
