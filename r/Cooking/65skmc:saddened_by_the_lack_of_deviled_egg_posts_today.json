After that, run under cold water to soak and peel immediately. This works for the freshest of eggs and it took me three years to perfect this with many frustrated shredded eggs thrown in the disposal.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is for 1/2 dozen hard boiled eggs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half all eggs and retain yolks in mixing bowl. Crush yolks with fork and add I TBS white vinegar, 1tsp yellow mustard and 1/4 cup of Mayo (props if you make the SE Mayo from said fresh eggs, too) Salt and pepper to taste. Optionally, I add a hit of Umami to mine with 1tsp MSG or fish sauce. Mix well. I scoop the mix into a ziplock bag and snip a little corner to help fill the eggs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you can use and variations from this you wish, but this is the most standard DE I have found. Like, it tastes what you think a DE should taste like. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: stuffs&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Cooking", "name": "t1_dgdm7le", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492471481.0, "created_utc": 1492442681.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh7f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65skmc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdz2i3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ITGirl88", "parent_id": "t3_65skmc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Cooking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I forgot to take a picture but I made deviled eggs for Easter.
