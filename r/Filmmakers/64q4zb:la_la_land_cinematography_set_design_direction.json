It was getting all this hype in the press and with the Oscars being in a couple days I wanted to see if it was deserving of all this hype.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to say I loved this movie and being a cinematographer myself I think a lot of it had to do with the cinematography.  It was absolutely incredible and my favorite since the Revenant.  The movements following the actors were just so fluid and natural, the blocking was amazing as well.  Costume design with all the pastel colors made it visually appealing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think from a technical standpoint this has to be the best in it&amp;#39;s genre when it comes to set design, costume design, lighting, camera work etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Filmmakers", "name": "t1_dg4f0ic", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491953545.0, "created_utc": 1491924745.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r1ip", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q4zb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r1ip", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q4zb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4nrh5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Papatheodorou", "parent_id": "t1_dg4l435", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Filmmakers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Me too!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me too!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Filmmakers", "name": "t1_dg4nrh5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491963131.0, "created_utc": 1491934331.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4l435", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rebel_scum13", "parent_id": "t3_64q4zb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Filmmakers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I can't wait to pick this up on Blu-Ray next week.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t wait to pick this up on Blu-Ray next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Filmmakers", "name": "t1_dg4l435", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491960232.0, "created_utc": 1491931432.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r1ip", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q4zb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r1ip", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q4zb", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r1ip", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q4zb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5o21e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrMarkZ", "parent_id": "t1_dg5eo3c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Filmmakers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Same.

It confirms for me that awards are all politics. There is so much I like about the film, but the most distracting thing about the move was the bad focus!! Shouldn&amp;#39;t that disqualify the film for best cinematographer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The single take shots were conceptually fantastic, yet, the focus was constantly off. I leaned to my wife early on in first screening, when I saw too many out of focus moments, &amp;quot;I bet the filmmakers think it is cool to shoot on film.&amp;quot; Get to the credits - bingo they shot on film and they didn&amp;#39;t get the shots! This really bummed me out as it was so distracting to me, and it was worse for me on our second viewing in a much better theater.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Filmmakers", "name": "t1_dg4d9ng", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491951582.0, "created_utc": 1491922782.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -15}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4452u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 20, "report_reasons": null, "author": "VeinyPickle", "parent_id": "t3_64q4zb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Filmmakers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I made a small album of some parts of the movie where I think the cinematography, set design, costume design, and direction REALLY worked together.\n\nUnderstandably, the movie is better with the music (it is a musical after all), but if you view these scenes without the audio, you can really focus on the cinematography and how it was completely intertwined with the set design of the film.\n\nI want to know from everyone, what did you think about the movie from such a technical standpoint?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made a small album of some parts of the movie where I think the cinematography, set design, costume design, and direction REALLY worked together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Understandably, the movie is better with the music (it is a musical after all), but if you view these scenes without the audio, you can really focus on the cinematography and how it was completely intertwined with the set design of the film.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to know from everyone, what did you think about the movie from such a technical standpoint?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Filmmakers", "name": "t1_dg4452u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491937436.0, "created_utc": 1491908636.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r1ip", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q4zb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4l37b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gibbaroo", "parent_id": "t3_64q4zb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Filmmakers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Seriously clever visuals.
