You can do MOVING shots (walking, tracking, following, etc.) and keep focus or pull focus by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t do that on a DSLR with another company&amp;#39;s glass and adapters unless very specifically bought. Then it requires a 2nd person to focus pull and another $2k system for that, etc. And you&amp;#39;re going to have to pay people to do that, and if you&amp;#39;re not paying well, they&amp;#39;re going to suck at it and you&amp;#39;ll have shitty shots anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A solid production camera and variable lens can be amazing for reliability, quick turn around, easy workflow and just never quitting on set. As a mainly one man film crew, if I could do it all over again, I&amp;#39;d take my Gh4 money, the metabones, the 4 Rokinon primes i have, the 8inch LCD, the gimbal, the shoulder rig, and trade is all for a production camera and single variable lens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this isn&amp;#39;t too rambling and is helpful for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Filmmakers", "name": "t1_dgd13ka", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492427718.0, "created_utc": 1492398918.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcy3e3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Clver16", "parent_id": "t1_dgcxl1i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Filmmakers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "For 4k\n\nWhat you think about the red raven vs the Ursa mini pro?\n\nAlexa is so out of the budget", "edited": 1492395985.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 4k&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you think about the red raven vs the Ursa mini pro?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alexa is so out of the budget&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Filmmakers", "name": "t1_dgcy3e3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492423499.0, "created_utc": 1492394699.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcxl1i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NeenerNanner", "parent_id": "t1_dgcsjnq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Filmmakers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, that is true.
