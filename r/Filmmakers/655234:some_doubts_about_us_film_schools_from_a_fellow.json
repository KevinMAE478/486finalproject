So moving my ass out of home and search for opportunities has never been an issue to me and from what I can see from most people&amp;#39;s experiences here, in this specific industry , it&amp;#39;s vital that you work your ass off and form connections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to consume all the videos and articles online that teach me everything I can about directing, producing, writing... I don&amp;#39;t know, I&amp;#39;m just trying to know a bit of everything even if my biggest passion is to make it as a director. But like I said previously, even though that my dream is directing just being able to work in the industry would be a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It definitely helped, like all the people who came here and lost a little bit of their time to tell their experiences and help my cause ahah!
