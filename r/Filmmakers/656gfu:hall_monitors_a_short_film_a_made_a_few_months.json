At the moment it's ruining the narrative flow.

Think how you can cut at least 2 minutes.  Being able to edit your work effectively is hugely important.  I've been doing this for a lot of years and still work with very experienced people who find it difficult to self-edit.  It's a skill, and one that you're better to learn from the get-go than struggle with when you have people like me breathing down your neck about schedules and budgets and deadlines!  Take another run at this and imagine you've never seen it before (it's hard!).  What information do you think is absolutely vital to the narrative and what are scenes that you kept in because you really like them or they mean stuff to you?  Those are the scenes you need to look at with a critical eye.  They're the most difficult to get rid of, but be brutal.  Taking a step back do you think the audience would really get them?  What do they add to the narrative?  Could the story stand without them?  If you're not sure then you either need to set them up better or get rid.  Ooft, like I say, it's difficult.\n\nOverall I think you've done a really great job.  I respect you enough to give you honest feedback no matter what your age but always bear in mind that whatever feedback you get is one person's opinion.  You should always take opinions on your work as a whole - listen to constructive criticism and use it to change things or consolidate things you feel deeply about.  It's very rare that people make films just for them, or just for fun.  There's usually a client involved, so if there are things you feel strongly about keeping in then you need to be able to defend them. Defend how they work for the narrative, for the structure as a whole, and for the audience.  \n\nI wish you the very best of luck as you move forward with making films - keep at it!\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492154283.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good stuff and I get that you&amp;#39;re 14 but I&amp;#39;m not going to mince words because I think what you&amp;#39;re here for is a critique from people who have been doing this for a lot of years - so here goes...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love your credits on the paper - I mean really love it - but it&amp;#39;s in the wrong place.
