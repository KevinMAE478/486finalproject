I like drum and play videogames. The reason I&amp;#39;m making this post is because I really, really want to make these sorts of videos, and eventually branch out into making short films and feature films. The problem is I cannot find anyone near my age who wants to also. I recently came across a YouTuber called CACox97 who has gained best friends/Company partners through the Internet and got to know each other through internet related events like talking on Skype and making gaming videos as that was all they could really do, seeing as they live plane-flight-distances apart. This is something I would really like to do (to answer some of the more experienced &amp;quot;media makers&amp;quot; out there, yes, I am going to take the concept and do my own thing with it). So if anyone who wants to do this who, preferably in the age 14-17 range, would like to have a shot at this then please say so, or if anyone has experience going through this process please drop some advice on how to go about this... thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: for some reason there aren&amp;#39;t too many female filmmakers around my age group, but if there are, you are welcome to do this...
