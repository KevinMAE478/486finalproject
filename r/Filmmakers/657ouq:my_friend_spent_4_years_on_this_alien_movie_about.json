NOT a strong opening.\n\nOkay, this film desperately needs a new editor. Well shot, good audio, but poor pacing and editing. \n\nI'm only 3 minutes in and it feels like it's been a lot longer than that. I'm not saying he needs quick cuts and to keep up with short attention spans, no, I just mean that it should never start BORING. Almost 2 minutes of blank screen and an annoying noise, then to a guy we don't know slowly walking through a shot. \n\nIt feels very indie, very inexperienced. I feels almost like the director thinks the audience should create the story in their head instead... I have no idea what's going on and it's already 5 minutes into the film. If you're going to be dull, quiet and not show much or make any noise for the first 5 minutes, at least make it engaging.\n\n8 minutes into the film and there was a 30 second shot of a guy spinning a disco ball in a garage... wtf is going on here? Almost 10 minutes in and we don't know who our main character is, why he's at this cabin, why he's handling bees, who the other bee guy is, why is he playing with a disco ball, looking utterly bored out of his mind... is that what you want the audience to feel? A sense of complete boredom? It's just silence with an out of focus shot of a guy spinning an out of focus disco ball that sort of looks neat. Seems like they were more interested in getting an interesting shot than having it make any sense in the pacing or structure of a story.\n\n10 minutes in and nothing has really changed? He sat next to a lake. Quiet and bored. These are the type of films most film schools will try and teach their kids to avoid. Avoid the \"artsy\" film that's more interested in a shot of still water than trying to tell a story. So far we've seen a guy in a cabin, bored. helping with bees? Then sits down, tired and bored. Then he goes into a garage and looks at a disco ball, clearly bored. Then he goes to a lake, still bored, sitting down. We see some out of focus birds and some \"artsy\" shot of the water. 10 minutes in!!!!! NO substance. No idea what the story is about, NO idea who our main character is, what is motivation is, what his story is about, why anything is happening. We basically have absolutely nothing of value for the audience. He's clearly at someones cabin, we have that I guess? He has a job as a sidekick bee keeper? He seems bored a lot? \n\n10:30 in, he's now walking in the middle of the woods, at night, and two random guys are digging... in the middle of the woods... What does he do? \"HEY THERE\" \"uh... hello\" \"Nice to see you again\" Huh? Does he know these people? \n\n2 minutes of a static shot on his face while he stares into the sky. 2 minutes. 1 shot. just his face as he stares into the sky. then he hears a noise??? oh it's just the dog. somehow the dog got out of the house and walked through the middle of the woods and found him. no idea how far out he is, how the dog got out, how the dog found him, what he's doing out there in the first place (smoking weed i guess?). \n\nFinally we get dialogue. 15 minutes into the movie we get a conversation. Short and brief. The guy blames his dog on harassing his animals last night. Yet we don't know who this guy is or how he knew he had a dog with him. didn't the dog sneak into the tent in the middle of the night? did this stranger somehow see the dog sneak into his tent in the middle of the woods last night? So many questions. How did he even know he was sleeping there. \n\nNow he drove to ANOTHER part of the forest so he can sit in the sunlight against a tree. Let's sit on this shot for a minute also. Just quiet, no music, no noise, just this guy sitting against a fucking tree. The audience will like that, right? They don't even know this guy, they don't know his name, who he is, why he's here, what he's doing, but dammit they want to see him sit against a tree for a full minute! We've seen him sit next to a lake, we've seen him sleep, we've seen him stare, we've seen him walk, now we see him sit against a tree.\n\nOK, I made it about 18 minutes in. I can't do anymore. Finally someone else showed up, which seems like she'll be in the rest of the film, but I can't do it. \n\nHand your footage off to another editor. This was extremely hard to watch. The audio is fine, the picture is fine, but there's absolutely no substance. 18 minutes into the film and we don't know anything about the main character, his motives, who he is, why he's there, what he's doing, why he's at this cabin, why anyone should give a shit. You HAVE to give us a reason to care about the main character.\n\nYou could start with him having a phone conversation while he's driving out to the cabin. \"I know... I know, I just, I needed to get away. I don't need to be at the funeral, I spent the last moments with her. I just, I need this for me.\" Boom. Now we understand WHY he's trying to relax out in the woods, why he's sitting in the middle of the forest, smoking weed looking up at the stars. It gives us a reason to FEEL for him. Then he runs into an unlikely girl who's also running away from something. They share their struggle together and bond over it. \n\nI wouldn't write all of this info out if I thought this was complete garbage with no way to save it. I honestly think you could have something good here if you get it into the hands of a better editor, someone who will cut all the fat and only keep the SUBSTANCE. Someone who can string a story together, a cohesive story with a REASON to watch it. \n\nBest of luck, hope you post an updated version in the future. \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A minute and 45 seconds of a buzz noise and almost black screen to start.
