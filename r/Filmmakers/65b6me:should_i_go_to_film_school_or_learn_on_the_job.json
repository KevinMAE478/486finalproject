We were filming in NY, in the middle of mid-town &amp; had limited filming permit.  Somehow the guy editing needed a cable (very specific), that he forgot, otherwise he could do the magic that he does.  There are not many stores that carry this - however I'd worked in the apparel industry in that area and was able to locate that cable in one of the stores.  They had one cable.  In another incident, the girl I was working with forgot ALL the costumes for the first sceen we were going to shoot (out in the boonies of New Jersey).  Please don't asked how a person could forget a whole rack of close.  Then she started to panic.  I told her to quietly get in the car, pretend like everything was okay.  As the caravan headed out, we sneaked off the Brooklynn to pick up the clothes.  The director called me repeatedly and I told him we were lost but we'd be there ASAP.  And we were.  If I'd said \"so-n-so forgot all the costumes, he would have freaked out\".  We were delayed by 3 hours.\n\n\nBeing on set teaches you how to deal with different personalities in real life situations.  Working on set, I've learned how to stage a home to make it camera ready.  I learned script break down, scheduling, logistics, food service, permits, set design and set building and a bunch of other stuff.  I also have a background in interior design, fashion design and product development.  Everthing I've every been interested in has pointed towards film making.\n\n\nWhat should you do?  Sit with pen and paper and ask youself \"what do I want to learn in film making right now?\" - then go volunteer on other people's films, companies are always looking for interns (I did that as well), and then start watching film making videos on YouTube (film making, screen writing, lighting, animation - 2D, 3D &amp; stop motion.. ect)... by exposing your brain to all this information that \"Aha!\" moment will hit.  As your knowledge base grows you become an asset as a film maker.   Whatever issues a film maker encounters on a set, make sure you learn what they didn't.  For example, some film makers don't know how to make posters for their films, learn how to do that on YouTube - then do practice posters of your own films.  Like Wayne Dyer said \"when you see it, you'll believe it\".   If you work on a film and the director is having problems with editing, then learn how to edit in Premier Pro (it's FREE on YouTube).  Follow the film makers that wear many hats.  Your brain has the capacity to learn a great many things...\n\nI was on a film set once, where the assistant director didn't know how to do a script break down (which I needed, so I'd know what scenes were being shot first, what actors are to be on location, so I could schedule the make up artist, what costume was needed, what props were to be needed, equipment, ect).  So I ended up working with the director and did the script break down (I'd done it before).  I also have to mention, the girl got the AD position because she was really hot and flirted with the director &amp; he fell for it.

That was the advice I was given by seasoned professionals when I asked about film school.  They were right and I&amp;#39;ve never regretted not going to formal film school.    I&amp;#39;ve taken film making courses that were interesting like editing, lighting ect...  What you&amp;#39;ll learn working on set is pricesless, supplement that with all the information that&amp;#39;s on YouTube, follow your favorite film makers, ect - by doing this your brain will become seeded with &amp;quot;film&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ll eventually realized, film school is for beginner begginers. Film shcool teaches the basics (that you can learn on someone else&amp;#39;s film project at no cost) but not the meat and potatoes of film making.
