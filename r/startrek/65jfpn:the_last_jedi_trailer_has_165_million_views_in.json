There's so much of it that the prospect of 'getting into Star Trek' is daunting. I speak from personal experience. There's... what? Five TV series with dozens of episodes per season? How many movies from how many eras? Even when I decided to give TNG a try I had people chiming in, \"You need to start on Season 3.\" \"No you need to start with Season 2.\" \"No you need to first watch the best episodes of 1+2+the pilot before continuing with the rest of the series.\"\n\nAnd the movies aren't good at standing on their own compared to other franchises. There's a vocabulary and sprawling cast of characters across hundreds of years to become familiar with. In addition there's strange species, customs, technologies, and ethics to learn about. The ethics of Star Wars are bite-sized and approachable: Empire bad, Rebels good. What's inside is what counts, and what's inside can eventually grow into greatness.

If parents want to show their kids TNG, they have to buy *seven seasons* of media. And that's for one of five shows. And that's not counting the movies!
