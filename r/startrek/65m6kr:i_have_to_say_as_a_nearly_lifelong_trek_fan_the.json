From what I&amp;#39;ve seen of their idea of new visuals (squid like Klingons, and the ugliest trek ship I&amp;#39;ve ever seen) they aren&amp;#39;t going to be doing justice to the other shows in the prime timeline, and it&amp;#39;s definitely not an improvement from the Kelvin timeline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess what I&amp;#39;m trying to say, is that Paramount&amp;#39;s Kelvin timeline has a consistent vision behind it, and does a good job of making new visuals. Now, we have yet to see if that&amp;#39;s the case for Star Trek Discovery, but unless they&amp;#39;ve done a drastic turn around from the styling that has been shown/leaked I have doubts that they can create a good visual reboot. Beyond that, the show seems to be steeped in negative rumors, and seems to have changed creative hands at least once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree with OP that so far the only thing about the show that makes me excited is the casting, but I think the Star Wars prequels show that you can have good casting and still end up with a terrible product.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startrek", "name": "t1_dgbetfr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492331198.0, "created_utc": 1492302398.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m6kr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m6kr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc30mi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AnneBancroftsGhost", "parent_id": "t1_dgbib6c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startrek", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Star Wars Insider magazine for \"fan club\" members was already great and got awesome during production off the prequels.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Star Wars Insider magazine for &amp;quot;fan club&amp;quot; members was already great and got awesome during production off the prequels.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startrek", "name": "t1_dgc30mi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492381792.0, "created_utc": 1492352992.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m6kr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m6kr", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m6kr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbos5t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CaptainKyloStark", "parent_id": "t1_dgbo5u0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startrek", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I just think the podcast really really sucks.
