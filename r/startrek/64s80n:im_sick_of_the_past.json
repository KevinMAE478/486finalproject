The story begins 10 years after some badass organic based race almost destroys everything in the alpha quadrant in war. Well, not actually even a war: more of an ethnic cleansing. The organic race basically brings every species in the alpha quadrant to brink of defeat but at the last minute inexplicably leaves and almost every race is left broken and having to rebuild. The organic race never communicates nor tries to engage with anyone so afterwards everybody is left with only questions. They don't show themselves or try to share technology, however, some races are able to destroy or disable some of them and the technology gets spread to the winds, so to speak. Every planet and species starts to deal with the aftermath in their own way. The federation, Romulan and Klingon empires and everyone else then is in a race to both and try to capitalize off the organic alien tech (which is shown to be far superior and advanced than all current tech known) and rebuilt what they lost. But there wasn't a 'regression' in technology; everyone just got the shit kicked out of them. In addition, star fleet was forced during the war to do some very ethically shady stuff to try and survive like: allow human augmentation, cybernetic enhancement, gene splicing with other species, and had to stand up an actual 'defense force' that was solely concerned with war. The other alpha quadrant species also did many morally shady things to try and survive. After the war, starfleet tries to go back to a peaceful space exploration type mission and the other alpha quadrant species struggle with their place since everyone basically got their asses handed to them. \n\nThe ship that the story focused on was an amalgamation of alpha / delta / gamma quadrant tech and was federation, however, due to how weak everyone is the federation was forced to allow members of any race to join starfleet if they qualified and allow them to serve onboard. Basically, this ship is kind of an olive branch so all the differing species could serve onboard and try to maintain peace amongst them. Also, many survivors of the war wanted to join starfleet because it represented the best chance at 'going back' to before the massive attack. The characters were awesome: The chief engineer was a grumpy and aloof cardassian but was an engineering genius, the doctor was radically enhanced with intelligence and other sensory augmentations (devices derived from the borg) and her assistant was an emancipated EMH like the doctor from voyager but very aware it was a hologram, the tactical officer was a hardened war vet with some of her having been replaced with cybernetics, the ships counselor and diplomat was Vorta, the science officer was a descendant/upgrade of Data (but always had her emotion chip so she was the funny/wisecracking character), the first officer was a Romulan who had done horrible things to protect Romulus during the war, there was a chick who came from a planet where everything and everyone was linked at the cellular level (like the chick Gaia from the foundation series), the navigation/pilot was young hotshot who was seen as being the most naturally gifted starship pilot since Sulu, and the captain was the grand nephew of William Riker and was a former federation officer turned smuggler who was granted amnesty and given command of the ship because he could get this unruly crew to work together. In addition, the crew wasn't just federation based: there were klingons, Breen, romulan, ferengi, and even a gem hadar that had been altered to survive without ketracel White. And also a ferengi bartender...because that is a requirement apparently.\n\nAll the tech was upgraded from the war and the federation had been forced to use dominion, borg, and other alpha quadrant tech: basically the best tech from all species thus found by the federation. The ship is basically the most advanced thing created from all 3 quadrants and was tasked with going around the ruined alpha/beta/gamma quadrants and helping the different species and empires rebuild. It was a ship of exploration but was also badass and very advanced. \n\nThe main arc of the show would have been seeing how everyone was dealing with almost being wiped out and the issues that come from such a massive shift in perspective for all the well known species. In addition, the emergence of 'species x' and their departure brought a whole bunch of new races and people to the alpha/gamma quadrants so there would be plenty of new characters as well. Starfleet, wanting to put the war behind them, would want to get back to its mission of exploration and have to try and be the 'example' again after having fallen so far. The show would've been darker and more real, but the crew would have had to rise above their pasts and try to emulate the 'greats' like Picard and Janeway and Sisko.\n\nThus, you get all the best characters and species and tech from VOY, TNG, and DS9, but also have an entirely new dynamic and have more than enough stuff to build on going forward. You would have the ability to create entirely new species and dangers while still having all the former lore of the past to have those 'descendant' episodes and can use the expansive history of the previous series' for 'what happened there' episodes. Want to see Admiral Nog? There ya go. CDR Tom Paris, instructor at the academy? Sure. Want to see how the founders dealt with it?

It was about the future of us, real people, the problems of the day magnified under the eye of a futuristic society where there is no more war, no suffering, just acceptance and tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You guys all want a post-NEM series, but I can&amp;#39;t relate with a post-Borg, post-Dominion, post-future of a fictional future world where the technology is no longer realistic or a natural evolution of today&amp;#39;s technological advancements, but the evolution of the &amp;#39;90s&amp;#39; futuristic technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s also why this show won&amp;#39;t be Prime timeline, Kelvin timeline, book timeline, whatever timeline we&amp;#39;ve seen before. It&amp;#39;s a fake world with fake people and the writers are going to build this show&amp;#39;s world however they want. They&amp;#39;ll blow up Vulcan if its to the benefit of the story. They went with the TOS-era because it&amp;#39;s the most iconic and memorable, everything else from there  (including its fake &amp;#39;60s technology) is going to be changed and switched up as we&amp;#39;ve seen with, well, everything we&amp;#39;ve seen and heard so far with DSC. And thank God they&amp;#39;re doing that. As much as it sucks, a Star Trek that wasn&amp;#39;t polarising for a large part of the fanbase in 2017 would fall flat on its face with anyone outside of the existing fandom. I&amp;#39;m going to go into this open-minded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t a prequel. In a way, by going backwards, we&amp;#39;re going forwards.

TNG is my favorite Trek and for many reasons, but the number of different particle beams Geordi was able to cone up with went well into deus ex machina territory.  The writers need to be or at least act like science fiction writers.  It's awesome to invent stuff but if it's from whole cloth and not based on something real, you have to limit that stuff.\n\nThen there's the drama.  The drama we've seen before has been action drama based on warfare and conflict or political drama or personal drama.  I say if you limit the amount of warfare/attack drama, you can make it lies valuable through its scarcity...so long as you don't get boring.  \n\nGood writing could up the ante on the personal stuff by making us care.  I hate to drag another franchise/property into the argument but Battlestar Gal\u00e1ctica, for all its faults, made us care about the characters and did so by letting storylines go on for many episodes and intertwine with other people's stories.  Star Trek has, for too many series, used ongoing story as an occasional thing, opting to have a story per week.  The ongoing stuff usually took the form of other races/factions or a war, so it was just the occasional resurgence of Klingons/Romulans/Cardassians/Dominion (though I confess I'm shaky on DS9's later years).\n\nIf you want to give me interesting characters to care about, challenge me by making me spend time with those enemies.  Let me have storylines set on Klingon and Romulan ships.  Let me care about these characters before they just show up on the view screen as the villain.  If I care about both sides of a conflict, it'll be more interesting.  Time spent with the enemy can really serve the story.  Look at Wrath of Khan.  I saw Khan with his people and understood a bit of his point of view.  The worst part of Star Trek Beyond was that there was no time spent with the enemy, no sympathy for his cause, and no tragedy when he was defeated.  They sacrificed that for a surprise reveal and to the detriment of their story.  It was a few steps from greatness, but they went another way.\n\nGive me all that and I almost won't care what era it's set in.

It&amp;#39;s awesome to invent stuff but if it&amp;#39;s from whole cloth and not based on something real, you have to limit that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the drama.  The drama we&amp;#39;ve seen before has been action drama based on warfare and conflict or political drama or personal drama.  I say if you limit the amount of warfare/attack drama, you can make it lies valuable through its scarcity...so long as you don&amp;#39;t get boring.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good writing could up the ante on the personal stuff by making us care.  I hate to drag another franchise/property into the argument but Battlestar Gal\u00e1ctica, for all its faults, made us care about the characters and did so by letting storylines go on for many episodes and intertwine with other people&amp;#39;s stories.  Star Trek has, for too many series, used ongoing story as an occasional thing, opting to have a story per week.  The ongoing stuff usually took the form of other races/factions or a war, so it was just the occasional resurgence of Klingons/Romulans/Cardassians/Dominion (though I confess I&amp;#39;m shaky on DS9&amp;#39;s later years).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to give me interesting characters to care about, challenge me by making me spend time with those enemies.  Let me have storylines set on Klingon and Romulan ships.  Let me care about these characters before they just show up on the view screen as the villain.  If I care about both sides of a conflict, it&amp;#39;ll be more interesting.  Time spent with the enemy can really serve the story.  Look at Wrath of Khan.  I saw Khan with his people and understood a bit of his point of view.  The worst part of Star Trek Beyond was that there was no time spent with the enemy, no sympathy for his cause, and no tragedy when he was defeated.  They sacrificed that for a surprise reveal and to the detriment of their story.  It was a few steps from greatness, but they went another way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Give me all that and I almost won&amp;#39;t care what era it&amp;#39;s set in.  Though they will need to go further into the future at some point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startrek", "name": "t1_dg4zz8z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491976821.0, "created_utc": 1491948021.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s80n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4sio0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "simon_thekillerewok", "parent_id": "t1_dg4nwpu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startrek", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's a problem with the episodic nature of most Star Trek in general.

The prevailing comments on these threads almost always remove _all_ agency from the creative team in charge and only because they made a choice that _some_ don't happen to like as much as their dream show that nobody will ever make. \n\n  I mean seriously, think about it for a second. Put yourself in a guy like Nicholas Meyer's shoes and imagine reading some of the comments here. Imagine how sad this all must look, how infuriating it must be to see people who have never spent a _minute_ in the TV and film production business _assert as fact_ that you are doing a terrible job and that you have not made the \"correct\" creative choices. \n \n While we are on this thought experiment, Imagine this. Imagine that Discovery's choice of era was actually a creative choice. That maybe, _just maybe_ the show-runners actually do have a story to tell that they _wanted_ to tell. That perhaps Fuller came into the project with a specific idea that he wanted to explore and now the current team is exploring as we speak. Is it really so hard to allow these people at least _some_ personal and creative agency here? Are we so damn cynical and bitter just because we did not get season twenty-two of TNG ere Star Trek that we will cut off any exploration of other eras at the knees? \n \n  Here is the reality that I think needs to be said and I am sorry that this is going to be blunt but it is what it is. The last episode of 24th century era Trek aired in 2001 and the last film premiered in 2002. For us as Trek fans, that is not a huge deal. We live, eat, and breath this stuff so as far as we are concerned, there is no gap. For the normal TV audience. The ones that perhaps watch Trek casually or are young enough to not have watched its past incarnations when they premiered, there is a _huge_ gap. Fifteen years might as well be a life-time as far as a network goes. \n\n  To add more complications. the 24th century Trek era covers _twenty-one seasons_. Even if you base your show in the early 25th century, you are still going to draw _heavily_ from those twenty-one seasons. You could pick a new ship, new crew, and even a new galaxy but you would still be referencing those seasons if not in terms of canon then in terms of style, storytelling, and the general status quo of everything. \n\n  People here are saying \"why can't Trek go forward?\" Well, because making a post-Voyager/Nemesis show would carry with it a expectation that it would _connect_ seamlessly to those prior twenty-one seasons. That it would be continuing a story that was started in 1987 and continued till 2002. If a post TNG show did not _feel_ like TNG, it would get nailed just as hard as Discovery is getting hit by a vocal portion of fans right now. \n\n  So here is the big question. Did you really expect CBS to make your dream show? The one you have created in your head over the past 15 years or so since Nemesis? Did you really expect them to pick right up where Voyager and Nemesis left off without missing a beat? Do you _honestly_ think that there is a place in the general TV landscape for yet another TNG style show? Do you think that modern audiences who have not yet eaten, breathed, and lived TNG era Trek as you have will want to jump in on that without the background you have in the franchise? \n\n  A final question. Do you really think that _every_ Star Trek creative team is _obligated_ to deliver only the Trek that _you personally_ want and if they don't, they must be creatively bankrupt? \n\n  To get more blunt, Trek is not ours. It does not belong to the fans and it is a good thing that it doesn't. We are loyal viewers but few (if any) of us have stopped and considered how a Trek show can fit into not only the mass market (and \"mass market is not a dirty word, it is what pays for these shows) media landscape. We know what _we_ want but some of us don't seem to care what others might want, what others might want to _create_. \n\n  Going with a TOS era show is not automatically a cash-grab. It is not arbitrarily a creatively bankrupt idea. Considering the show-runners (including Fuller in the beginning), I _seriously_ doubt that there was no creative motivation behind the time-period choice. Is it so hard to believe that they have a good idea and ran with it? \n\n  TOS is a pretty big set of blank pages at this point. There is a lot of canon around it but the creative team is _embracing_ that canon and telling a story based on that canon. Anyone who thinks that a TOS show is more limited by its three seasons and six shows than a TNG+ show is limited by its twenty-one seasons and four films is not really seeing the whole picture.\n \n I am sorry that this is so blunt but I have been giving this a lot of thought and to be honest, it is just sad and disappointing to see so many fall back on the tired, old, and rather rude and thoughtless \"It is a cash-grab\" or \"creatively bankrupt\" stuff over and over. \n  \n  The show could still be terrible but it would not be the choice of time-period that makes it that way.

Fifteen years might as well be a life-time as far as a network goes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To add more complications. the 24th century Trek era covers &lt;em&gt;twenty-one seasons&lt;/em&gt;. Even if you base your show in the early 25th century, you are still going to draw &lt;em&gt;heavily&lt;/em&gt; from those twenty-one seasons. You could pick a new ship, new crew, and even a new galaxy but you would still be referencing those seasons if not in terms of canon then in terms of style, storytelling, and the general status quo of everything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People here are saying &amp;quot;why can&amp;#39;t Trek go forward?&amp;quot; Well, because making a post-Voyager/Nemesis show would carry with it a expectation that it would &lt;em&gt;connect&lt;/em&gt; seamlessly to those prior twenty-one seasons. That it would be continuing a story that was started in 1987 and continued till 2002. If a post TNG show did not &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like TNG, it would get nailed just as hard as Discovery is getting hit by a vocal portion of fans right now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here is the big question. Did you really expect CBS to make your dream show? The one you have created in your head over the past 15 years or so since Nemesis? Did you really expect them to pick right up where Voyager and Nemesis left off without missing a beat? Do you &lt;em&gt;honestly&lt;/em&gt; think that there is a place in the general TV landscape for yet another TNG style show? Do you think that modern audiences who have not yet eaten, breathed, and lived TNG era Trek as you have will want to jump in on that without the background you have in the franchise? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A final question. Do you really think that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; Star Trek creative team is &lt;em&gt;obligated&lt;/em&gt; to deliver only the Trek that &lt;em&gt;you personally&lt;/em&gt; want and if they don&amp;#39;t, they must be creatively bankrupt? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get more blunt, Trek is not ours. It does not belong to the fans and it is a good thing that it doesn&amp;#39;t. We are loyal viewers but few (if any) of us have stopped and considered how a Trek show can fit into not only the mass market (and &amp;quot;mass market is not a dirty word, it is what pays for these shows) media landscape. We know what &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; want but some of us don&amp;#39;t seem to care what others might want, what others might want to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going with a TOS era show is not automatically a cash-grab. It is not arbitrarily a creatively bankrupt idea. Considering the show-runners (including Fuller in the beginning), I &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; doubt that there was no creative motivation behind the time-period choice. Is it so hard to believe that they have a good idea and ran with it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TOS is a pretty big set of blank pages at this point. There is a lot of canon around it but the creative team is &lt;em&gt;embracing&lt;/em&gt; that canon and telling a story based on that canon. Anyone who thinks that a TOS show is more limited by its three seasons and six shows than a TNG+ show is limited by its twenty-one seasons and four films is not really seeing the whole picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am sorry that this is so blunt but I have been giving this a lot of thought and to be honest, it is just sad and disappointing to see so many fall back on the tired, old, and rather rude and thoughtless &amp;quot;It is a cash-grab&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;creatively bankrupt&amp;quot; stuff over and over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The show could still be terrible but it would not be the choice of time-period that makes it that way. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startrek", "name": "t1_dg5gouc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491999730.0, "created_utc": 1491970930.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
