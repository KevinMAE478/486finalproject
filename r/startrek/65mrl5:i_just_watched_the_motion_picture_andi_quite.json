I get that is't supposed to foreshadow Spock's actual death. But still. Dumb.\n\nRicardo Montalban is more than \"over-the-top\". It's moronic, cartoonish, and buffoonish. He doesn;t deliver a single believable line. All he does is stick his chest out and quote Moby Dick. For being a super genius, he sure is an idiot. He doesn't do one smart or clever thing. He achieves everything by lucking out and having those brain bugs. That's it.\n\nHow the hell is Starfleet going to mistake one planet for another? If Ceti Alpha 6 \"exploded\" (WTF) that would make 5's orbit get closer to the sun, not further away. So how the hell are they going to mistake it for 6? Dumb.\n\nWhy didn't Chekhov just beam away the moment he learned where they were? Dumb.\n\nThe \"Genesis Device\" might be one of the most clumsily contrived pieces sci-fi schlock, ever. It's magic. It might as well be \"The Force\". I understand what it's trying to do. It's trying to be the thing that stands the Star Trek Philosophy Coin on it's edge. Cumberbatch as Khan did a much better job doing this. He was the \"Genesis Device\", and that made him much more compelling and interesting as a villain.\n\nSo, when the Enterprise and the Reliant first encounter each other, just what the hell is that all about? Kirk doesn;t raise the shields, even though he is reminded that regulation demands that he do it, and for good fucking reason. Something like this happened before, where they were approaching a friendly vessel taken over by hostiles, and got their asses handed to them, thus the regulation. But Kirk doesn;t do it because ????? I think it was because they wanted to set him up as some kind of maverick. And to what end? It doesn;t pay off, at all, except to get his crew members killed and his ship maimed in a colossal fuck up. Not only does it not set up anything important, but his ass should have been thrown in the brig, but no one cares. It's just business as usual with this completely incompetent an negligent admiral in charge.\n\nKhan himself is supposed to be some super genius, but he apparently couldn't be bothered to check Starfleet regulation on this kind of engagement. If he had, he would know Kirk was supposed to raise the shields, and he would have no reason to believe Kirk wouldn't do that. What would his clever plan be if Kirk had just raised the shields, like he's supposed to? They're trying to play it off like this some clever cat and mouse game, but the reality is, they are both complete morons.\n\nWhile we're in the topic of how stupid these characters are: What about that scene where Kirk and Spock practically spell out their idiotic little code while Khan is listening. They know Khan is listening, but they couldn't have made their secret code any more obvious. And then Khan is setting there listening, and this information flies right over his head. Some super genius.\n\nThe writers clearly had theme about Kirk growing old very fast. He's winging about being old and acting all morose like he's staring into the maw of death at the age of, what, 45? 48? He sees his friends die around him, he sees the symbolic birth of his son (Genesis), and he embraces his role as a father. The lesson should be about accepting growing older, but instead they ruin it at the end when he says \"I feel young\". No, that's wrong. They threw spaghetti against the wall, hoping something would stick. The writers were hoping we would fill in the gaps with our own interpretation. Nicolas Meyer even said so in a commentary. I consider it lazy.\n\n&gt;NuTrek is a different beast. The focus on action to the detriment of plot coherence being a function of high budgets \n\nNot true. As I've demonstrated above, WoK is a very silly movie. Not only that, but Star Trek 2009 mirrors WoK's themes very closely, and the over-all theme is the same as Star Trek's over-all main them: *Communal achievement*. How are they not Star Trek films when their main themes and plots are all too familiar to Star Trek? The fact that it has some badass action is a bonus, not a detriment. And it's not *mindless* action, either. It's set up nicely, and it's always about the characters doing something to accomplish their goals.\n\nFor example, in WoK, I quite enjoy the production value that went into the space battles. It's clear that it was a strong focus for the movie. It's a ships-at-sea movie, but in space. However, as I've demonstrated earlier, it's hard for me to buy the circumstances behind the Enterprise's and Reliant's first engagement, so the battle just feels hollow for me.
