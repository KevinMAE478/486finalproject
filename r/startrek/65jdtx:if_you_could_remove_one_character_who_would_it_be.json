Here&amp;#39;s the thing: Crosby, as much as I&amp;#39;m disappointed she got shafted midway through season 1, is not as good of an actor as Sirtis. With the exact same material, Sirtis could have made Hernandez a much more interesting permanent fixture than she could make Troi, or than Corsby could make Yar. Meanwhile, with Crosby in the less complex role of Deanna Troi and vanishing along with Crosby midway through season one- well, nothing of value would be lost except &lt;em&gt;Yesterday&amp;#39;s Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, writing Troi out of the show before the first season ends and keeping a differently named version of Yar&amp;#39;s character around instead would drastically change the entire series of Next Gen, but since I really like Yar (at least in theory) and don&amp;#39;t particularly care for Troi, I think the show as a whole would be better off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I know that doesn&amp;#39;t quite follow the prompt, but it&amp;#39;s still my best answer, haha!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startrek", "name": "t1_dgbcx5b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492328535.0, "created_utc": 1492299735.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jdtx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jdtx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbsnkf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Doctor-Detroit", "parent_id": "t1_dgbo52s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startrek", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Empathic menopause!
