It's not the technology of the setting that resulted in creative stagnation of latter-day Trek. It was simply that the same team of writers was out of ideas and unwilling to try sufficiently new things. We'd had all the Klingon, Cardassian, and Borg stories that could be compellingly told.\n\nI'd much rather we just do the TNG premise again: Go forward another hundred years, make all the bad guys from the last round allies (or too weak to matter), and invent some new threats to explore.  \n\nI totally agree that we can't just have Klingons being Klingons, etc. Something has to change. But it would be infinitely more popular and in-keeping with the optimistic tone of Trek to make Klingons, Cardassians, and Romulans all full-fledged Federation members (and treat them the way TNG treated Vulcans - barely there), make the Borg a third-rate power, and demand something completely new. There would be struggles, as there were with early failed TNG villains like the Ferengi and the Conspiracy bugs, but TNG ultimately struck on a winning formula by bringing on the Borg and Romulans, and there's no reason to think we couldn't succeed again.\n\nMeanwhile, with the advent of cgi we have a lot of opportunities we never had with previous Treks, both for new kinds of aliens and new kinds of planets.

It would spoil the stories that people love, retroactively. That may be a recipe for narrative drama, but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a recipe for ratings or fan success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t think this needs to be so complicated. It&amp;#39;s not the technology of the setting that resulted in creative stagnation of latter-day Trek. It was simply that the same team of writers was out of ideas and unwilling to try sufficiently new things. We&amp;#39;d had all the Klingon, Cardassian, and Borg stories that could be compellingly told.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d much rather we just do the TNG premise again: Go forward another hundred years, make all the bad guys from the last round allies (or too weak to matter), and invent some new threats to explore.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I totally agree that we can&amp;#39;t just have Klingons being Klingons, etc. Something has to change. But it would be infinitely more popular and in-keeping with the optimistic tone of Trek to make Klingons, Cardassians, and Romulans all full-fledged Federation members (and treat them the way TNG treated Vulcans - barely there), make the Borg a third-rate power, and demand something completely new. There would be struggles, as there were with early failed TNG villains like the Ferengi and the Conspiracy bugs, but TNG ultimately struck on a winning formula by bringing on the Borg and Romulans, and there&amp;#39;s no reason to think we couldn&amp;#39;t succeed again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, with the advent of cgi we have a lot of opportunities we never had with previous Treks, both for new kinds of aliens and new kinds of planets.

Remember, Star Trek is still entertainment. It has its high points - discussing important questions of morality and ethics that are still brought up today. But in terms of entertainment, IMHO BSG and Expanse blow any of all of Star Trek out of the water. BSG also tackles morality and ethics (frankly in a far more nuanced and mature way then Trek), and The Expanse has extensively detailed world building, character development and hard sci fi goodness.\n\nBoth BSG and The Expanse have far more weight to their production and action. No more TV remote hand phasers and red shirts falling over. There is realistic gunfights, there is blood and sweat and tears. Entire worlds (The 12 Colonies, Eros) get annihilated in gory detail. I remember seeing a scene in The Expanse where a character (who seemed like was being set up to be a main character) gets quickscoped by a railgun shell. There is blood, there is atmo leaking out out of the damaged hull. The main threat is not rubber faced aliens who embody individual human vices, its either *deadly biomechanoids that look just like us and could be anywhere at any time* or *godlike alien nanotechnology that sees humans as nothing more than building materials and treats the laws of physics as a suggestion rather than the rule.* Trek treats its treknobabble flippantly, without internal consistency. In The Expanse, the \"soft sci fi\" elements are treated with the respect they deserve by the exasperated main characters.\n\nTrek at its best was when it starts to display signs of shows like BSG and The Expanse. *In the Pale Moonlight* is one of the best episodes of Trek, period. Sisko's actions to bring the Romulans into the war mirror Protogen's efforts to set the system ablaze so they can experiment on the Protomolecule. *The Best of Both Worlds* showed the Borg as they should be - an implacable, incomprehensible practically unstoppable force of nature, and such behavior likely inspired the Cylons and the Protomolecule.\n\nWhen Trek bombs, it bombs *hard*. Voyager was atrocious, not just due to poor writing, but how much wasted potential it had. Voyager wasn't just *bad*, it was *disappointing.* The only saving grace was excellent performaces by Jeri Ryan and Robert Picardo, and the eventual development of BSG, the show that Voyager could have been. BSG had two god tier first seasons, although admittedly faltered toward the end, but it never sank to the level of *Threshold* or *Spock's Brain*. The Expanse never has a low point, being consistently good to excellent.\n\n&gt;The key is getting rid of the military-style discipline on the ships. Or at least, evolving it.\n\n&gt;Focus on the myriad of aliens, as wild as it can get.\n\n&gt;Get rid of the rigid Naval mentality. We need to see our heroes having intense fun doing what they are doing.\nThey are free people doing what they love. We should see their eyes light up and the neon alien worlds infront of them. No pulling faces at the \"bizarre\" alien thing infront of them. They should dive right in.\n\nThis is a lofty goal, but a terrible thing in the unforgiving blackness of space. BSG and The Expanse show what Trek never really touched - *how dangerous space is*. There is vacuum exposure. There is life support failures. There is deadly military threats. A regimented command structure is a necessity in such a small closed system like a space craft. You can't have time to deliberate, someone has to change the air filters, pronto. The Enterprise-D is rightfully derided as a cruise ship in space. The Battlestar Galactica and the Rocinante actually feel like space craft.\n\n&gt;It always created a bitter taste that they were just trudging through space, like a chore. They should be free. They should love doing what they do. Everyone on the ships (bar voyager, cause... delta) was there because they wanted to be there.\n\nIf you don't have hardship and conflict, there is no drama, and thus nothing of interest.

The main threat is not rubber faced aliens who embody individual human vices, its either &lt;em&gt;deadly biomechanoids that look just like us and could be anywhere at any time&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;godlike alien nanotechnology that sees humans as nothing more than building materials and treats the laws of physics as a suggestion rather than the rule.&lt;/em&gt; Trek treats its treknobabble flippantly, without internal consistency. In The Expanse, the &amp;quot;soft sci fi&amp;quot; elements are treated with the respect they deserve by the exasperated main characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trek at its best was when it starts to display signs of shows like BSG and The Expanse. &lt;em&gt;In the Pale Moonlight&lt;/em&gt; is one of the best episodes of Trek, period. Sisko&amp;#39;s actions to bring the Romulans into the war mirror Protogen&amp;#39;s efforts to set the system ablaze so they can experiment on the Protomolecule. &lt;em&gt;The Best of Both Worlds&lt;/em&gt; showed the Borg as they should be - an implacable, incomprehensible practically unstoppable force of nature, and such behavior likely inspired the Cylons and the Protomolecule.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Trek bombs, it bombs &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. Voyager was atrocious, not just due to poor writing, but how much wasted potential it had. Voyager wasn&amp;#39;t just &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, it was &lt;em&gt;disappointing.&lt;/em&gt; The only saving grace was excellent performaces by Jeri Ryan and Robert Picardo, and the eventual development of BSG, the show that Voyager could have been. BSG had two god tier first seasons, although admittedly faltered toward the end, but it never sank to the level of &lt;em&gt;Threshold&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Spock&amp;#39;s Brain&lt;/em&gt;. The Expanse never has a low point, being consistently good to excellent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The key is getting rid of the military-style discipline on the ships. Or at least, evolving it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Focus on the myriad of aliens, as wild as it can get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get rid of the rigid Naval mentality. We need to see our heroes having intense fun doing what they are doing.\nThey are free people doing what they love. We should see their eyes light up and the neon alien worlds infront of them. No pulling faces at the &amp;quot;bizarre&amp;quot; alien thing infront of them. They should dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a lofty goal, but a terrible thing in the unforgiving blackness of space. BSG and The Expanse show what Trek never really touched - &lt;em&gt;how dangerous space is&lt;/em&gt;. There is vacuum exposure. There is life support failures. There is deadly military threats. A regimented command structure is a necessity in such a small closed system like a space craft. You can&amp;#39;t have time to deliberate, someone has to change the air filters, pronto. The Enterprise-D is rightfully derided as a cruise ship in space. The Battlestar Galactica and the Rocinante actually feel like space craft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It always created a bitter taste that they were just trudging through space, like a chore. They should be free. They should love doing what they do. Everyone on the ships (bar voyager, cause... delta) was there because they wanted to be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have hardship and conflict, there is no drama, and thus nothing of interest. There&amp;#39;s a reason S1 of TNG is considered the worst of the series.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startrek", "name": "t1_dg87vmp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492146025.0, "created_utc": 1492117225.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654ys0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654ys0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga8nez", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anhrb", "parent_id": "t1_dg8mcve", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startrek", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree completely.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startrek", "name": "t1_dga8nez", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492256803.0, "created_utc": 1492228003.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8mcve", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Stezinec", "parent_id": "t1_dg7oego", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startrek", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; It is not hard to create a Utopia.
