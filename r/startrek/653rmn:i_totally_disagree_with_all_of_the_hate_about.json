Just soft-reboot it all, go 20+ years past Voyager/Nemesis and everything is fair game again... and if you don&amp;#39;t want to deal with the regular Klingon/Romulan plots anymore, make a Transwarp Ark Ship and go to Andromeda, sadly (or luckily) Mass Effect Andromeda stole that idea for what i wanted to do with the next Star Trek Show, and they did a decent enough job at it in the context of the Mass Effect universe. I don&amp;#39;t need Trek anymore to do this now...  i&amp;#39;m open for anything really, but all i see is them messing up again and again and i&amp;#39;m very sceptical about Destiny. I mean... the 50 year anniversarry date was known for years now, they knew it was coming and they didn&amp;#39;t have the show ready to go, delayed it even further, have a director who leaves and it all seems to be a mess... and what do we know so far? \nWe&amp;#39;ve seen one ugly ass concept drawing. We know the captain is not the center of the show (as if Star Trek was ever something else than a ensemble cast, the SHIP is the Hero, the Captain is just the guy making all the decisions) and we got Sasha from Walking Dead playing some token LGBTQ+ character...  (a few decades after people stopped giving a shit about inclusiveness, now everybody is just offended all the time about things that don&amp;#39;t matter if you do it wrong... which is easy because people are weird as fuck these days).&lt;br/&gt;\nWe know they are pandering to the &amp;quot;Are you PC bro?&amp;quot; crowd before they even talk about what the god damn show is going to be about.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they want this crap to carry their CBS All Access platform... because that will go over well.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry, i get excited when they actually show something to get excited about, ok?  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startrek", "name": "t1_dg7c6w8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492103299.0, "created_utc": 1492074499.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653rmn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7c2qe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Donners22", "parent_id": "t3_653rmn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startrek", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The last sentence sums it up.\n\nAs long as it's good, I couldn't care less whether it's TOS-era, post-Nemesis or elsewhere.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last sentence sums it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as it&amp;#39;s good, I couldn&amp;#39;t care less whether it&amp;#39;s TOS-era, post-Nemesis or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startrek", "name": "t1_dg7c2qe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492102936.0, "created_utc": 1492074136.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qixm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653rmn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7dz0a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Flyberius", "parent_id": "t3_653rmn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startrek", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I totally agree.\n\nWithout some sort of soft-reboot (which I believe this will be), I don't see how we could go any further.
