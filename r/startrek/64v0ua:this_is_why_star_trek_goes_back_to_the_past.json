They made a combined $2.5 billion worldwide on a total $350 million production budget. I don&amp;#39;t think those movies were risky at all. With a whole generation that hadn&amp;#39;t had a new Star Wars movie come out in their lifetimes, they were always going to make a boatload of money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in many ways, they were the precursors of our current movie environment. Producers saw that you could make horrible movies but if they were connected to a popular franchise you&amp;#39;d still make a ton of money. They also had gratuitous CGI, stupid fight scenes, and plots that didn&amp;#39;t make sense--and didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to make sense--all elements of today&amp;#39;s Marvel-type movies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, The Force Awakens and Rogue One have &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; made $3 billion so in some sense they are bigger successes. But they are also better movies than the prequels (+ markets are larger these days, inflation), despite being formulaic and somewhat bland.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess you can blame the audience for this, because they (we) keep seeing these movies, but I also think it&amp;#39;s rather short-sighted on Hollywood&amp;#39;s part. They will never create a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Star Wars&amp;quot; because they don&amp;#39;t take risks like that anymore.
