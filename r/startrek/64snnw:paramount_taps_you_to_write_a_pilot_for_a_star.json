I've got plenty of ideas for a series set in the 2390s (fifteen years after *Nemesis*, since that movie came out fifteen years ago), building on the events of DS9, tech introduced in \"Voyager\", and the backstory from the 2009 movie... but the Enterprise-E would probably still be around. Okay, I'll give you my pitch for the 2390s show instead. \n\nThey're exploring former Romulan space in the Beta Quadrant: territory that used to be cut off by the Neutral Zone. Since the Hobus disaster that destroyed Romulus (thank you, 2009 movie) the Romulan Star Empire has collapsed: in its place there are several successor states, factions that want to restore the empire, a faction that still wants reunification with Vulcan, a bunch of alien species formerly ruled by the Romulans who now have independence (and some of whom want to try building their own empires now), Klingons looking at expanding their own territory... plus of course plenty of completely unrelated strange new worlds.\n\nNew tech: our starship (let's call it the Odyssey because that's a cool name) is about ten years old, and its most obvious technological advance is that it has a quantum slipstream drive. This allows near-instantaneous travel to wherever they want to go, but unfortunately it takes a lot of power so they need to use it sparingly and generally rely on warp drive. \n\nNow, the crew. I think I would better distinguish the differences between the science, ops and tactical stations, because in TNG and VOY they all seem to overlap. So: the science officer is a senior staff member again, they're the coordinator of all the ship's scientific divisions, and their station deals with external sensors and data interpretation; the ops officer deals with internal sensors, system functions and operations; the tactical officer is not a senior staff member, is entirely separate to being chief of security, and their job is basically weapons plus comms. \n\nThe captain: she's a Coridanite, ideally played by Gina Torres. She fought in the Dominion War when she was fresh out of the Academy. I'd recycle something from the \"Enterprise Relaunch\" novels: that the Romulans devastated Coridan in the 2150s, which is why they didn't join the UFP until a century later.\n\nThe first officer: he's human, say mid-fifties, also a Dominion War veteran \u2013 after which he was involved in the joint Federation-Klingon-Romulan occupation of Cardassia (meaning he has an up-close-and-personal view of how Romulans operate). He also used to work for Starfleet Intelligence.\n\nThe science officer is our everyman character \u2013 he's also a Bolian. He's nice, sensible, kind of dorky, like someone's uncool dad. (And he actually is a parent: Bolians are polygamists, and he has a wife who's a civilian on a starbase who has another husband who has another wife \u2013 the latter two are back on the homeworld raising the kids.)\n\nThe ops officer and the helm officer are best friends who used to date back in the Academy, both about 27 years old \u2013 they're our funny playful Tom-and-Harry characters. The ops officer is a Bajoran woman, and the helm officer is a human man. One way they really differ is on politics, though: the ops officer is much more cynical about the Federation in general (Bajor joined when she was a pre-teen) and tends to look at it in terms of how it can benefit Bajor, while the helm officer is more idealistic about all its utopian principles. \n\nOur not-quite-human character is the chief engineer: he's a Vulcan, sort of in the mould of Ambassador Soval. There could be something interesting made out of his dealing with his repressed emotional reactions and prejudices \u2013 not only with the openly emotional crew of the Odyssey, but also in reaction to the Romulans who are to some extent emotional Vulcans.\n\nAnd the security chief is an Andorian woman, and if I could woo her away from NCIS then I would totally cast Pauley Perrette. So now you know what the security chief is like.\n\nThere are other characters as well, but they'd be more in the background. We'd see the chief medical officer, but also others in the medical staff who work under her. We'd see the tactical officer, a male Deltan ensign who would end up dating the helm officer partway through the first season. We'd see the various specialist team leaders of the science division (e.g. chief biologist, geologist, environmental scientist, anthropologist...) and of the engineering division (for the quantum drive, the warp drive, the environmental systems, the mainframe...), junior officers for all of these, the second-in-command of security and the junior officers there, etc. etc. Basically, there's a *lot* of variety with who gets to go on away missions.\n\nOh, and because they're actually venturing into a region of space where there's been zero former Federation presence, every time they return to a starbase they're actually going to the same place: a space station in the former Neutral Zone, which I'll call Deep Space 12. It looks like [the second Deep Space 9](https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/startrek/images/5/53/Deep_Space_9_%282%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150130143622) from the books.
