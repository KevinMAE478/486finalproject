I figured I\u2019d give it a shot, and I was quickly hooked.

I stuck through it, and I&amp;#39;m glad I did. Riker with beard &amp;gt; Riker with no beard.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I actually liked Tasha Yar. I was sad she was killed off so quickly. Data keeping her memory close through the rest of the series was very touching to me.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reginald Barclay is the most endearing man, even with his holosuite sex addiction. (Come on, he was totally getting it on in there.) I told my boyfriend once, \u201cI\u2019d date him,\u201d after watching The Nth Degree. My boyfriend thinks I\u2019m crazy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Borg are amazing. Resistance is futile.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I cried so much through TNG. There were so many sad and depressing episodes. (That was something I did not expect going into it.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I love the Klingons. After Ambassador K&amp;#39;Ehleyr showed up, Worf\u2019s character really began to develop. He quickly became one of my favorite characters. I loved every episode that gave insight into the Klingon Empire.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Data\u2019s poem \u201cOde to Spot\u201d didn\u2019t get the recognition it deserved. What a masterpiece. Riker should be ashamed for falling asleep. No excuses.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How is Picard still mentally intact at the end of TNG? Especially throughout Season 6. The poor man was tortured physically and emotionally throughout that entire season. All of that after he had barely recovered from his transformation to Locutus and back. How is he not broken? Why is that season so sad? Argh, Star Trek tears. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Data almost always saves the day. It happened so frequently that even on episodes/movies where Data was out of the picture, I just said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Data will show up\u201d to my boyfriend. He never let me down.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Star Trek Deep Space 9&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Favorite episodes (not in order)&lt;/em&gt;: Emissary, Blood Oath, Family Business, The Visitor, In the Pale Moonlight, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Favorite Characters (not in order)&lt;/em&gt;: Quark, Jadzia, Worf, Garak&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thoughts on DS9&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Holy shit, Emissary, what a pilot! I don\u2019t think any of the other Star Treks opened with something as good. This was a great introduction to the brilliant and complicated mind of Benjamin Sisko. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I referred to Odo as \u201cOoze Dude\u201d for the first season, and my boyfriend will never let me forget it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I got to see Alexander Siddig and Aaron Eisenburg at Dragon Con 2016 last year in the midst of my DS9 watch. They actually spoiled many things for me, but I wasn\u2019t upset. Just excited to see them! I witnessed Aaron Eisenburg showing off Nog\u2019s dance from \u201cYou\u2019re Cordially Invited\u2026\u201d and telling the story behind it (which happened to be the next episode I was going to watch!) It made that episode special for me. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jadzia was one of my favorite characters from the start. I accidentally spoiled her death for myself with some poor google searches, so I always knew it was coming. Every time something dramatic happened to her, I got super anxious, thinking, \u201cIS THIS IT?!\u201d When it finally happened, I was so let down. Her death was bullshit. I yelled and ranted for days after I watched that episode. Even to people who didn\u2019t watch Star Trek, which I received funny looks for. I didn\u2019t dislike Ezri Dax, but I was pretty salty through the last season every time Ezri was on screen.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The entire Pah&amp;#39;Wraith storyline was kind of bullshit (Maybe I\u2019m salty about Jadzia.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Even though the Pah\u2019Wraith story was bullshit, Dukat was an outstanding villian. Probably the best or one of the best in all the shows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As a big Battlestar Galactica fan, I really loved DS9. I loved the rough and tough lifestyle of people on the space station. The constant struggle for stability. Amazing space battles. It was great.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Star Trek Voyager:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Favorite Episodes (not in order)&lt;/em&gt;: Tuvix, Scorpion, Year of Hell, Relativity, Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Favorite Characters (not in order)&lt;/em&gt;: B\u2019Elanna, The Doctor, Seven of Nine, Tuvok&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thoughts on Voyager&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I never fully realized how BIG the Enterprise-D was compared to the other ships until I started Voyager.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Like I said before, I love the Borg, and I knew going in that Voyager had a fairly large story devoted to the Borg. I didn\u2019t know much about it. I didn\u2019t know anything about Seven of Nine. I just knew I wanted to watch it for the Borg. I was extremely disappointed on how long it took to get to that point.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I like to fantasize what the rest of Voyager would be like if Tuvix had been allowed to exist. I didn\u2019t care for Neelix too much. I didn\u2019t dislike him, and he definitely had his moments. I was just not impressed by his character. I did love Tuvix, for the brief period I had with him. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I REALLY DISLIKED Kes. Her character was so flat. The only moments I liked were when she was possessed in \u201cWarlord\u201d and when old Kes came back and started wrecking everything. Angry, destructive versions of Kes represent my feelings for normal Kes. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When the Borg FINALLY appeared in \u201cUnity,\u201d I actually yelled and cheered, dancing around the living room. I was so stoked. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I\u2019ve heard some hate Seven, but honestly, Seven is one of my favorites on Voyager. From the moment she arrived, Voyager picked up for me (BORG).  She\u2019s also infinitely superior to Kes. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I could watch an entire series focused on the Doctor. He\u2019s brilliant.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I LOVE Barclay. Have I mentioned that yet? His role on Voyager was something that I DIDN\u2019T SPOIL for myself! When he showed up for the first time, I was incoherent with excitement, \u201cYES, MORE REG, AHHH!\u201d My boyfriend still thought I was crazy. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally, Star Trek Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Favorite Episodes (not in order)&lt;/em&gt;: Shadows of P\u2019Jem, Carbon Creek, Regeneration, Doctor\u2019s Orders, The Augments&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Favorite Characters (not in order)&lt;/em&gt;: Phlox, Tucker, Shran, Porthos&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thoughts on Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I\u2019m sorry, but Seasons 1-2 may as well not exist for me. They were boring and empty, save for a few moments (BORG). &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Archer BROUGHT HIS BEAGLE INTO SPACE. That\u2019s awesome. Porthos is awesome. Pups in space. I support it. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Through T\u2019Pol, I did get a better understanding of Vulcans and why they reign in their emotions so tightly. Voyager touched on it a bit with Tuvok flashbacks, but I was able to see much more of the struggle and development Vulcans went through during the era of Enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Xindi were awesome, and it was interesting to see what all of that was about (After the Xindi Wars call out in Star Trek Beyond). It was cool to see more screentime for non humanoid aliens. I wish we could have gotten a flashback of the Xindi-Avians and maybe some more time to screen time of the Xindi-Aquatics. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The entire season 4 of Enterprise is probably my favorite season of any of the Star Treks. I know they tried to tie up so much so quickly, but that\u2019s why I like it. It was just one powerful story arch after another, and it was quite a rush to binge watch. It almost makes up for seasons 1-2 being awful. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Andorians are awesome. If Andorians are one of the founders of the Federation, why are they not represented in other Star Treks? After watching Enterprise, I was sad I wasn\u2019t introduced to them in TNG, DS9, or Voyager. One day, I\u2019ll tackle TOS to get another view of them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: I\u2019m\u2026 done. I\u2019m done now. I always had another Star Trek to look forward to. Now that I\u2019m done with Enterprise, I don\u2019t have anything left. I could watch TOS, but I don\u2019t really have a desire to. I\u2019ve watched a couple of episodes of it on BBC America, and it\u2019s a little too dated for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m now waiting in anticipation for Discovery. I know most fans don\u2019t expect much from it, but I\u2019ll stay optimistic. It won\u2019t give me more Borg, but it\u2019ll give me more Klingons. (I own way too much Klingon merchandise now.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Qapla\u2019!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I forgot to mention it, but I have watched the TNG films.

A virtual war is being waged between two worlds solely by computer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you like those watch these too:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This Side Of Paradise- Everyone is chill and happy on a planet and Kirk is NOT HAVING IT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Errand of Mercy- Another message episode that introduces you to the Klingons (though they look way different) and it has Kor who shows up in DS9&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Trouble With Tribbles - You can skip this one since it&amp;#39;s mostly covered in the DS9 episode but if you are into TOS by the time you get here this one is a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dagger of the Mind- A madman is running a futuristic insane asylum&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tholian Web- The back story of the Enterprise episode. The Defiant is phasing out of our universe and into another dimension, and Kirk is trapped aboard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Space Seed- You can skip this one or watch to get the back story on Khan who will show up in Star Trek II&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shore Leave- This is another that&amp;#39;s fun and ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arena- Another classic but the Gorn costume is awful! If you can get past that it has a good message and gets referenced in Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spock\u2019s Brain- often referred to as the worst episode ever, it is so bad that it&amp;#39;s fun! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then for the movies, you can skip the Motion Picture and Star Trek V the Final Frontier but the Wrath of Khan, The Search for Spock, and the Voyage Home are all an arc that go together. And Star Trek 6 the Undiscovered Country is really good and explains a lot of the Klingon Politics that shape the TNG era, plus Michael Dorn is in it playing his own grandfather!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startrek", "name": "t1_dg7lslt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492122039.0, "created_utc": 1492093239.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7fess", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "icjs2", "parent_id": "t1_dg6jqhm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startrek", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; most popular episodes of TOS\n\nPlease list! :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;most popular episodes of TOS&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please list! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startrek", "name": "t1_dg7fess", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492112274.0, "created_utc": 1492083474.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6jqhm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fikustree", "parent_id": "t3_650d4z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startrek", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Watch the most popular episodes of TOS and then the original movies.
