The trouble is Earth. On Earth there is no poverty, no crime, no war. You look out the window of Starfleet Headquarters and you see paradise.

Out there, there are no saints, just people - angry, scared, determined people who are going to do whatever it takes to survive, whether it meets with Federation approval or not.\"\n\nThis really sums up the difference between TNG and DS9. The TNG crew are the saints in paradise, but the DS9 crew are truly out on the frontier. The station is in terrible condition (for the first few seasons, anyway), they're neighbors with Cardassians and Klingons, half the station's crew are not Starfleet and are basically holocaust survivors, and problems can't always be solved in a single episode. They have to do the best with what they have. Sometimes that means going against their morals, and even then it isn't always enough. These people are not the paragons of morality that the TNG crew are because they simply do not have that luxury.\n\nAs for characterization, you'll see the same issues if you go back and re-watch the first season of TNG. It gets better. Quark seems like your typical Ferengi, but he really isn't. It's not apparent now, but it will be later, particularly once more typical Ferengi show up. Profit is certainly *not* his only motive or goal. Dax may not seem like it now, but she is a party animal and a huge fan of Klingon culture, both thanks in large part to the previous host, Curzon. Kira is deeply spiritual and has a series-long arc about coming to terms with her past and how she views Cardassians. She also develops a great respect and friendship with the rest of the crew and becomes much less insubordinate, if not any less opinionated. Bashir becomes much more professional and humble, and forms an extremely strong friendship with O'Brien. Odo has some hangups about being raised in a lab. He also worked for the Cardassians during the occupation and is more emotional than he seems. The Cardassian tailor, Garak, who you've seen once already, is also a fascinating character. Though he doesn't look it now, Nog, the young Ferengi, will have a powerful arc. Dukat's barely removed from Hitler, but you may wind up liking him anyway. Damar, who doesn't show up for several seasons, starts as a nobody and eventually becomes one of the best characters on the show.\n\nI'd suggest finishing the season and seeing what you think of the last two episodes, Duet and In the Hands of the Prophets. Those are much more representative of what the show will become, with Duet really starting Kira's character development and ItHotP marking the first time the situation undergoes a permanent change. The show starts to get its act together in the second season and really gets going with the third and the introduction of the Dominion. The fourth season brings in the Klingons as a major part of the show and adds Worf to the cast.\n\nAll of that said, DS9 may just not be for you.
