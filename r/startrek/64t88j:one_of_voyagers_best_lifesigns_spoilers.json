In this episode, The Doctor is able to download the consciousness of a dying Vidiian from a synaptic back-up and use that data to recreate a healthy holographic version of the same person. Denara\u2019s enormously grateful and quickly falls for the Doctor. We have excellent use of Robert Picardo, who\u2019s probably the best actor on the show; he does a great job here of distinguishing himself from Data. Both the Doctor and Data are artificial lifeforms are often used for exploration of existential themes, but a key difference here is that although the Doctor is physically constrained as a hologram, he\u2019s already equipped with considerable knowledge about humanity giving him a considerable advantage over Data in their parallel pursuit of self-fulfillment. While the Doctor knows what humans are like and why they do the things that they do, he lacks the first-hand experience to contextualize what he knows about being human. He recognizes people\u2019s feelings, he\u2019s even programmed with the bedside manners to address these feelings as a Doctor (he\u2019s not particularly adept in this area, but it\u2019s programmed in there).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This episode has some great beats:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Establishing that this is when the Doctor\u2019s adaptive learning routines have brought him to the point of recognizing personal desires to the extent that they can define who he wants to be,  beyond what he was made to be. We\u2019ve had hints of this in earlier episodes, but this is the major jumping off point for the character, with significant implications for the future of AI in the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It touches on really interesting sci-fi themes. You\u2019re meant to wonder at how a person could love a program. It\u2019s a weird area to touch on, but it\u2019s a meaty one (a whole movie was made around this theme in 2013 with \u201cHer\u201d). But if you dwell on that much longer, Denara isn\u2019t really \u201cthere\u201d either. &lt;strong&gt;The Denara hologram believes itself to be more \u201creal\u201d than the real person that\u2019s lying unconscious on the operating table&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a really great contrast to the Doctor who since the beginning of the show has consistently been asserting that he is NOT a person. Her presence forced him to rethink his own belief on whether or not he could consider himself to be a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be one of the most romantic episodes of Star Trek. The show dwells on that dizzy feeling of butterflies in the stomach that people get when they first meet someone. It might outlandish and campy, but the earnest spirit of the episode is really endearing.  But more substantially, the characters both have deepseated insecurities about themselves, and they\u2019ve erected walls between them and others as a preventative measure. However, the two characters brush past these defenses and share their most vulnerable sides of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It touches on terminal illness and going beyond the question of whether or not these holograms are alive, it goes on to ask more broadly about how to weigh quality of life. It doesn\u2019t end with a deus ex machine that solves all of their problems by the time the credits roll. The episode ends with the knowledge that Denara will die shortly afterwards. They\u2019re quite &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; star-crossed lovers. However the focus in the final scenes are on the good final moments they have in the present rather than the grim future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The episode\u2019s not perfect, there\u2019s definitely a lot of shortcuts that have to be taken given the show\u2019s format. Things like the cardinal sin of having characters say their feelings instead of showing their feelings. Plus having it\u2019s flow broken with an awkward insertion of scenes to support a boring multi-episode subplot about a spy on Voyager. But I think this episode is a great example of why Voyager is still worth watching even it may not be the best of the Star Trek shows in aggregate. (This episode also comes from the same season in which we had \u201cThreshold\u201d, clearly the worst episode in the entire franchise). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Lifesigns_(episode)\n\nI\u2019m on a Voyager re-watch and I want to take a break to talk about how much I enjoyed this episode. \nThis episode digs into some red meat sci-fi material here, with interesting implications for the rest of the franchise as well.
