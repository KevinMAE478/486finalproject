It holds up better because there were orders of magnitude more money being thrown at it, not to mention the incredible talent of the then newly-formed ILM vfx company.  But the style of the clothing and ship interiors is as much a product of &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; time as TOS was of the 60s.  The whole pure white aesthetics of Leias ship in Episode IV was also pretty contemporaneous of the late 70s/early 80s...that was what was considered &amp;#39;modern&amp;#39; in those days, just the same as the primary colors and cut of the clothing were of the 60s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you look at the style of the prequel trilogy its just as different compared to the original trilogy as TOS is compared to TNG and beyond.  Look at TNG, that show practically &lt;em&gt;screamed&lt;/em&gt; late 80s fashion.  You see some of the shit extras are wearing (especially the civilian outfits) and its like, good fucking God that&amp;#39;s just awful.  The set design was also extremely 80s, all the mauve everywhere, the tan leather upholstery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startrek", "name": "t1_dgauxgg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492303673.0, "created_utc": 1492274873.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgas43t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jared2013", "parent_id": "t3_65iduq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startrek", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Star Wars had an amazing look back in the day.
