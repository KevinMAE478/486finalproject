Since you are a Dr. I will say number 2 is right up your ally, as a roving amateur proctologist/gynecologist myself I found it very interesting. I got to see one mans invention of a garage door opener turned into a robo-sodomist. He inverted the entire machine so the rail was basically placed inside a channel cut into the mattress. The arm that would tug the door along was modified to include a u channel paralleled to the track that could be adjusted to accommodate a bag of various dildos in a clamp. The motor was against the head board and the dildo was clamped to the U channel. Given a proper amount of lubrication and dexterity, he could kneel in a doggy position and press the opener remote and the dildo would be crept foreword. I believe a rheostat was incorporated to give speed control.

Either way, with patience, you can work just as fast with a non-rigged nail gun (some people take the whole mechanism out completely) as you could a rigged one. It just takes 2-3 days to master it depending on how much you work with it. I used to rebuild pallets and never messed with my nail gun and you could easily rapid fire that thing if you were good enough. I wont even get into the amount of times me and my co-workers would get into nail gun fights (everyone would use their fingers to hold the tip back to shoot nails at each other, our stations were more than 50 ft. Away from each other so it wasnt like you were actually gonna get stuck with one, they'd bounce off your clothing), you'd think people wouldnt be that stupid but when you're working at a pallet rebuilding place everyone is kind of an idiot.
