That takes another month, so by the time it&amp;#39;s ready for smoking your second plant is finished and ready for harvesting to go into the drying+curing cycle too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If all goes well and you don&amp;#39;t have a single failure or disaster, then you&amp;#39;ll have (given the size limitation in the new law) about 120-140 grams of properly-cured bud to smoke every month, &lt;em&gt;per household&lt;/em&gt; (_not_ per person, unfortunately.).  You have a five-month startup lag, sure - but it&amp;#39;s all gravy afterwards, if you don&amp;#39;t screw up or go on vacation or get sick or anything (ever).  The problem with the new law in this regard is that it allows absolutely _no_ margin of error or accident for this sort of continuous production, you&amp;#39;d have at absolute most only four strains to smoke, and there&amp;#39;s very little prospect for any cross-breeding either.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dgapkra", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492296028.0, "created_utc": 1492267228.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ismp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ismp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgap4z5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ConvertsToMetric", "parent_id": "t1_dgap4el", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[^(**Mouseover** or **click** to view the metric conversion for this comment)](http://fiddle.jshell.net/ConvertsToMetric/xhk4y5h5/show/light/?3%20feet%20=%200.9%20m%0A \"3 feet = 0.9 m\nPost feedback in /r/ToMetric\")", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://fiddle.jshell.net/ConvertsToMetric/xhk4y5h5/show/light/?3%20feet%20=%200.9%20m%0A\" title=\"3 feet = 0.9 m\nPost feedback in /r/ToMetric\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouseover&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;click&lt;/strong&gt; to view the metric conversion for this comment&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dgap4z5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492295336.0, "created_utc": 1492266536.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgap4el", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dgaobf5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dgap4el", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492295309.0, "created_utc": 1492266509.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ismp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ismp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ismp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc070h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stupid_comment_above", "parent_id": "t1_dgax9el", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hey man, maybe you did, maybe you didn't, if so great.  \n\n  Anyone can set up a little ghetto grow for cheap.
