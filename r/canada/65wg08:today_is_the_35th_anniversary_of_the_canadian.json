It contains a get-out-of-jail-free card in the beginning:\n\n&gt;The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such **reasonable limits** prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\n\nEvery time the \"reasonable limits\" is tested, it's with a test (like the [Oakes test](https://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/ccs/index.php/i-o/774-oakes-test)) that uses even more subjective lines of reasoning.\n\nI've put a number for every statement in the Oakes test that is answered based on personal opinion:\n\n&gt; 1.    The government must establish that the law under review has a goal that is both \u201cpressing[1] and substantial.\u201d[2] The law must be both important[3] and necessary.[4] Governments are usually successful in this first step.\n\n&gt;2.  The court then conducts a proportionality analysis using three sub-tests.\n\n&gt;a. The government must first establish that the provision of the law which limits a Charter right is rationally connected[6] to the law\u2019s purpose[7]. If it is arbitrary or serves no logical purpose, then it will not meet this standard.\n\n&gt;b. Secondly, a provision must minimally impair[8] the violated Charter right. A provision that limits a Charter right will be constitutional only if it impairs the Charter right as little as possible[9] or is \u201cwithin a range of reasonably supportable [10] alternatives.\u201d\n\n&gt;c. Finally, the court examines the law\u2019s proportionate[11] effects. Even if the government can satisfy the above steps, the effect of the provision on Charter rights may be too high a price to pay for the advantage the provision would provide in advancing the law\u2019s purpose. \n\nor, tl;dr: The charter of rights and freedoms only applies to you if the government decides, at the time, that it's \"reasonable\" for the charter to apply to you.

It contains a get-out-of-jail-free card in the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such &lt;strong&gt;reasonable limits&lt;/strong&gt; prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time the &amp;quot;reasonable limits&amp;quot; is tested, it&amp;#39;s with a test (like the &lt;a href=\"https://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/ccs/index.php/i-o/774-oakes-test\"&gt;Oakes test&lt;/a&gt;) that uses even more subjective lines of reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve put a number for every statement in the Oakes test that is answered based on personal opinion:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government must establish that the law under review has a goal that is both \u201cpressing[1] and substantial.\u201d[2] The law must be both important[3] and necessary.[4] Governments are usually successful in this first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court then conducts a proportionality analysis using three sub-tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a. The government must first establish that the provision of the law which limits a Charter right is rationally connected[6] to the law\u2019s purpose[7]. If it is arbitrary or serves no logical purpose, then it will not meet this standard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;b. Secondly, a provision must minimally impair[8] the violated Charter right. A provision that limits a Charter right will be constitutional only if it impairs the Charter right as little as possible[9] or is \u201cwithin a range of reasonably supportable [10] alternatives.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;c. Finally, the court examines the law\u2019s proportionate[11] effects. Even if the government can satisfy the above steps, the effect of the provision on Charter rights may be too high a price to pay for the advantage the provision would provide in advancing the law\u2019s purpose. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or, tl;dr: The charter of rights and freedoms only applies to you if the government decides, at the time, that it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;reasonable&amp;quot; for the charter to apply to you. They can justify what is reasonable, and what is not, using tests that are pretty much entirely subjective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a government document that is supposed to guarantee your freedoms and rights, it is shockingly unclear about how far those freedoms and rights extend.
