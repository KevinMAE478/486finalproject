I used aerobreaking through Jool's atmosphere to get them into orbit and then positioned them in place around various moons and got them into different orbits.  Then I sent a return craft type ship to the Jool system as well and positioned it in an orbit around the planet itself.  Then I sent the main mission, a spacecraft with 1 astronaut who's job it was going to be to explore the moons of Jool, one by one.  Landing on the first moon I had a rover attached to the lander and used that to explore the first moon.  After I walked around a bit I got back into orbit (using the lander) and left the rover behind.  Then I flew to one of the tankers and refuelled and flew to the next moon and landed there and so on.\n\nEventually I got to one moon that had water and continents (Laythe).  It was really hard and I reloaded a lot, but I managed to land there on an island.  I explored a bit and then tried to leave, but my lander didn't have enough fuel to get back..  at all.\n\nSo the next part of the mission was a much larger lander that was attached to a large spaceship.  I put that in orbit around Laythe along with another tanker.  Refuelled and eventually was able to land 5km away from the other lander.  Then I had to spend a really long time walking to the other lander.  This was the stupidest part of the mission.  But it had to be done.  The rescue lander was built in stages, so once fuel was gone from the first stage it detached and new engines kicked in from the next stage.  It was more than enough to get me in orbit, and I was even able to refuel using one of the remaining tankers and use the fuel to get all the way back to Kerbin.  Didn't even use the original return craft, it stayed behind sitting in a really not so great orbit around the planet.\n\nI think the mission lasted 12 years in game time, but my astronaut did make it all the way back home.  It was a pretty inefficient mission overall.  Imagine NASA sending random tankers to random places and then half-arsedly flying around the solar system refuelling without much of a plan in place.\n\nAnyway, there is a lot more to master in this game than the 3-4 bottlenecks I identified, but once you get past the first 2 you can actually do some pretty fun stuff in the game that's totally worth it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are really two bottlenecks in the game, an understanding of all the concepts behind getting into orbit, and the same thing for docking.
