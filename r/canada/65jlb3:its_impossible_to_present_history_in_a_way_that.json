Going to day schools like other kids was much more common statistically, and much like the white kid versions the day schools were not as prone to these kinds of problems. And residential schools didn't generally mean being abused beyond the widely used and accepted corporal punishment used on all school children that was not considered a bad practice most kids would have a roughly similar experience to whites with the addition of some racist sentiment (though many natives themselves were working at  schools and the teachers at least liked them enough to work in often remote and bad schools teaching them), having to speak English or French (since the teachers generally couldn't even speak anything else), and conversion to Christianity (another thing that was accepted and not considered wrong at the time as it is now). Also, depending on how feasible it would be (base don like location) some schools did include time off and a few even weekends off, with the kids leaving on Friday and returning on Sunday for church. Was their an increased aspect of racism as a driver for bad actions in an unfortunate amount of cases? Of course. No one disputes that. And of course the system had the concept had the support of some genuinely horrible people like John A. MacDonald (the guy practically scammed a country unwanted by many into existence ffs) who even in their time were disliked by many? Yes, but he didn't creat the concept of residential schooling in Canada and meticulously design them as torture institutions for natives. That the kind of unfortunately common and hyperbolic misinformation that's a problem. \n\nResidential schools in general were bad because the concept leaves too much room for unmonitored abuse, but people need to be carful about moral relativism and misinformation. A factual discussion of the topic is a better one that two opposing fanatics screaming histrionic things they heard from someone else and decided to regurgitate. We consider all sorts of things like corporal punishment, keeping kids away from family, or even trying to Integrate others into your culture wrong today based on our current social morals that were considered normal and in some cases even great ideas in the past. And we have the benefit of hindsight when we judge the past. We're probably going to be the subjects of similar overly emotional arguments for things we currently consider perfectly fine practices.\n\nTL;DR: residential schools not black and white, generally a bad thing because of both some racism issues and flaws with the concept, moral relativism and hysteria too common in discussions of the topic, being bad schools doesn't them a nefarious system of genocidal concentration camps.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re incredibly big on baseless guess work and personal opinion.

And residential schools didn&amp;#39;t generally mean being abused beyond the widely used and accepted corporal punishment used on all school children that was not considered a bad practice most kids would have a roughly similar experience to whites with the addition of some racist sentiment (though many natives themselves were working at  schools and the teachers at least liked them enough to work in often remote and bad schools teaching them), having to speak English or French (since the teachers generally couldn&amp;#39;t even speak anything else), and conversion to Christianity (another thing that was accepted and not considered wrong at the time as it is now). Also, depending on how feasible it would be (base don like location) some schools did include time off and a few even weekends off, with the kids leaving on Friday and returning on Sunday for church. Was their an increased aspect of racism as a driver for bad actions in an unfortunate amount of cases? Of course. No one disputes that. And of course the system had the concept had the support of some genuinely horrible people like John A. MacDonald (the guy practically scammed a country unwanted by many into existence ffs) who even in their time were disliked by many? Yes, but he didn&amp;#39;t creat the concept of residential schooling in Canada and meticulously design them as torture institutions for natives. That the kind of unfortunately common and hyperbolic misinformation that&amp;#39;s a problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Residential schools in general were bad because the concept leaves too much room for unmonitored abuse, but people need to be carful about moral relativism and misinformation. A factual discussion of the topic is a better one that two opposing fanatics screaming histrionic things they heard from someone else and decided to regurgitate. We consider all sorts of things like corporal punishment, keeping kids away from family, or even trying to Integrate others into your culture wrong today based on our current social morals that were considered normal and in some cases even great ideas in the past. And we have the benefit of hindsight when we judge the past. We&amp;#39;re probably going to be the subjects of similar overly emotional arguments for things we currently consider perfectly fine practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: residential schools not black and white, generally a bad thing because of both some racism issues and flaws with the concept, moral relativism and hysteria too common in discussions of the topic, being bad schools doesn&amp;#39;t them a nefarious system of genocidal concentration camps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dgd59pw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492434654.0, "created_utc": 1492405854.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jlb3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jlb3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jlb3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd37br", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EPOSZ", "parent_id": "t1_dgbvqzr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Here's also some information on 20th century residential schools that's pretty good.](http://www.c2cjournal.ca/2015/05/some-other-truths-about-indian-residential-schools/)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.c2cjournal.ca/2015/05/some-other-truths-about-indian-residential-schools/\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s also some information on 20th century residential schools that&amp;#39;s pretty good.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dgd37br", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492430941.0, "created_utc": 1492402141.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jlb3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jlb3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc4p8u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CrazyPersonPills", "parent_id": "t1_dgbwd61", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; There's a difference between instruction in English and French and beating children who spoke their own language to each other socially.

Archaeologists only have to worry about their own bias.  They&amp;#39;re mostly studying trash.  People generally don&amp;#39;t think about influencing how people will think of them in a thousand years when throwing rubbish on the midden pile.  As the story, and many others, rightly point out, history is full of bias.  People regularly fool themselves even when writing in their private journals!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This really brings us to the central point:  Truth is subjective.  Talk to people you know about current events and you&amp;#39;ll likely uncover some pretty significant points of disagreement.  We all interpret the world we live in differently.  It&amp;#39;s difficult for one person to say something about Trump or Trudeau here without pissing off somebody else who sees things differently.  Some people have wrong, uninformed opinions, but others are informed and right, but see things in a different light.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given that we can&amp;#39;t talk meaningfully about the present we live in without offending people, why should we expect the past to be any different?  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dgb0gh5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492311223.0, "created_utc": 1492282423.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jlb3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgash6a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "84900t8", "parent_id": "t3_65jlb3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's actually a very Canadian thing to watch something just for a mention of your very minor role in it.

Hitler&amp;#39;s trains being on time, Chingis Khan&amp;#39;s non-savage side, All the good things that the Communists did, China helping the Tibetan people, or perhaps more controversial, early aboriginals having acne.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone might be offended by these aspects.  Some don&amp;#39;t want to talk about the good things about Hitler because it makes him seem like a good guy.  We like our stories involving good guys and bad guys and if he is the hero of this story... then who are we?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s not difficult to understand why French people are upset that they have been depicted as the villains of Canadian history. Any part of the oppression of French people by English Canadians has been wiped out.  All French are dirty people who are inept and incapable of doing anything right.  The English are fast, efficient, and clean.  They are gentlemen scholars all around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had it been the reverse that it was a story about all the oppressive shit English people had done people would have been equally as pissed.  The writer and director decided to go with an obvious pro-English slant on history and made every effort possible to disparage French aspects of history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The CBC was forced to write a formal apology.  Why?  Because this documentary follows a long history of anti-French slant from the CBC.  I remember when the CBC was doing the 1995 Quebec referendum.  After it failed they pretended like all the English parts of Canada were doing all these favors for the French people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the first stories the CBC reported was of the Dionne Quintuplets in foster care.  They reported how they were being treated well and in a clean home, while portraying all French as being dirty ill fit parents.  CBC reported on the quints for years, right up until the first one died. Can&amp;#39;t tell that story.

Its hard to say were the line is, of course, but for example i feel i have no right to feel offended by the English dispersal and exile of the Acadians in 1755 (approx.).

Interesting story, but we cant even trace it back that far, we can only trace it back 4 or 5 generations from me, about 2 generations before we switched the family name to an anglicized version. Family story goes that was so that ancestors children could have a better time finding work, which could lead one to think that at that time (mid to late 1800s?) there was trouble for the french in this part of the country (and also the northern US states). \n\nShould my family be offended by the Acadian exile?

Family story goes that was so that ancestors children could have a better time finding work, which could lead one to think that at that time (mid to late 1800s?) there was trouble for the french in this part of the country (and also the northern US states). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should my family be offended by the Acadian exile?
