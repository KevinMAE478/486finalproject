I would want him gone, but even the government is bound by the constitution and laws.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/high-risk-sex-offender-winnipeg-apay-ogouk-1.4064591\"&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/high-risk-sex-offender-winnipeg-apay-ogouk-1.4064591&lt;/a&gt; 2017 article&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/hiv-assault-suspect-faces-new-charges-1.915538\"&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/hiv-assault-suspect-faces-new-charges-1.915538&lt;/a&gt; 2010 article&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg8u4mh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492178409.0, "created_utc": 1492149609.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655vo1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655vo1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8tol1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rayden202", "parent_id": "t1_dg8thml", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We don't know his status.
