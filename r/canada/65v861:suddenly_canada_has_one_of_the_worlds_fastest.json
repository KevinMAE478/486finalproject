Using credit the way we have to buy houses will certainly accomplish that. \n\nHowever, there will come a day when this Ponzi scheme will end.\n\nKeep in mind, housing makes up about 14-16% of total Canadian GDP. It is all being driven by borrowed money. Christie Clark likes to say she has the fastest growing economy in Canada. She does; except she also has an economy where housing makes up an astounding 22% of BC's GDP, leading the whole country in that department. It's not a coincidence that BC is the fastest growing economy.\n\nWhen this money needs to be paid back, the pain will be felt nationwide. As people divert money from the economy on discretionary spending and start to pay down the debt, we will see all this malinvestment biting us back in the butt.\n\nDeleveraging (getting rid of debt) is very painful. And especially when a housing bubble is involved, it will be extremely painful because the rate of home ownership is very high in Canada, meaning that when prices go down, almost everyone will feel it in their wallet. Everyone will have their biggest asset lose tremendous value.\n\nYou can take data at its face value and say we're the fastest growing, but we're only there because we're using a temporary stimulus in the form of private debt. It's not fundamental nor sustainable growth. To the contrary, it is a signal for an upcoming catastrophe in the housing sector and therefore, our GDP.\n\nEdit:\n\n[A good video on the credit cycle and how it drives the economy -- for beginners.

We are seldom seeing people taking out loans to build a new business to do something productive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, we see people borrowing like mad to join the speculative market in housing to make a quick buck. This is driving the construction, finance, insurance and real estate sectors of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And on the surface, it looks like the economy is doing pretty well. Using credit the way we have to buy houses will certainly accomplish that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there will come a day when this Ponzi scheme will end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, housing makes up about 14-16% of total Canadian GDP. It is all being driven by borrowed money. Christie Clark likes to say she has the fastest growing economy in Canada. She does; except she also has an economy where housing makes up an astounding 22% of BC&amp;#39;s GDP, leading the whole country in that department. It&amp;#39;s not a coincidence that BC is the fastest growing economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When this money needs to be paid back, the pain will be felt nationwide. As people divert money from the economy on discretionary spending and start to pay down the debt, we will see all this malinvestment biting us back in the butt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deleveraging (getting rid of debt) is very painful. And especially when a housing bubble is involved, it will be extremely painful because the rate of home ownership is very high in Canada, meaning that when prices go down, almost everyone will feel it in their wallet. Everyone will have their biggest asset lose tremendous value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can take data at its face value and say we&amp;#39;re the fastest growing, but we&amp;#39;re only there because we&amp;#39;re using a temporary stimulus in the form of private debt. It&amp;#39;s not fundamental nor sustainable growth. To the contrary, it is a signal for an upcoming catastrophe in the housing sector and therefore, our GDP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0\"&gt;A good video on the credit cycle and how it drives the economy -- for beginners.

This is the second part of Keynesian economics that governments so often fail to act on. Paying back debts will constrain money growth and keep inflation in check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they fail to do this (I&amp;#39;m not optimistic) inflation will begin to rise and the central bank will have to raise rates. If they do that there is a significant risk of crashing the economy as private debts begin to default at higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alternatively the central bank could let inflation rise higher, which will further reduce debt and interest payments, but will leave an awful lot of savers very, very unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dgdx8j5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492483846.0, "created_utc": 1492455046.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v861", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v861", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge8vs0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shockme123", "parent_id": "t1_dgdzsy3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Shitty to say the least", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shitty to say the least&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dge8vs0", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492497489.0, "created_utc": 1492468689.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v861", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge8zll", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "yummybits", "parent_id": "t1_dgdzsy3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There is labour demand, but it's not huge.
