I know kids. &amp;quot;No fair, how come he gets banana bread and I have to eat this apple?&amp;quot; Whine. Complain. Kids are ridiculous when it comes to this stuff - they&amp;#39;ll cry if their piece of cake is slightly smaller than the next one. Probably drove the teacher crazy. It&amp;#39;s entirely possible this kid was rubbing his banana bread in the other kids&amp;#39; faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know some people say there&amp;#39;s no correlation between sugar and behaviour, but as a parent I&amp;#39;ve seen kids go apeshit after eating cake and ice cream. This kid might be so disruptive after getting sugar at snack time that it affects the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this child is special needs, he probably already occupies too much of the teacher&amp;#39;s time and may need a teaching assistant. The mother says his autism is mild, but some of those kids can be even harder to manage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously I don&amp;#39;t know the whole story, but there&amp;#39;s always another side to things that we don&amp;#39;t see - and if you had a kid in that class who was begging you for banana bread every day because so-and-so gets it, or who can&amp;#39;t learn because banana bread kid bounces off the walls after snack time, you might be on the teacher&amp;#39;s side. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg7zk50", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492136893.0, "created_utc": 1492108093.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653xob", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7zq4m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shadowbananapeg", "parent_id": "t3_653xob", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What the fuck is wrong with banana bread, i hate all these people", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the fuck is wrong with banana bread, i hate all these people&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg7zq4m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492137071.0, "created_utc": 1492108271.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653xob", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg815lk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dogribb", "parent_id": "t3_653xob", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "With walnuts and chocolate chips?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With walnuts and chocolate chips?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg815lk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492138607.0, "created_utc": 1492109807.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653xob", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg818is", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TangoMike22", "parent_id": "t3_653xob", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "WTH?
