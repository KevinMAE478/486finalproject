Though I will admit that is not hard when you are just to the north of Trump\n\nCanada isn't respected and loved. Canada is pushed aside. Made irrelevant.

Just because articles get upvoted on reddit because we're legalizing weed does not mean Trudeau is by any means \"loved\" on the world stage.\n\n&gt;he ran a higher defect that Trudeau is doing now. The last prime minister to balance the budget was a Liberal.\n\nDon't be ignorant. The last two fiscal years were a straight surplus. There is documented proof of that. It's a well known fact. Trudeau's end game plan is also to run $1 trillion in debt, and continues to run  WELL over $10 billion in debt per year.\n\n[Teeny tiny little deficits. So small you can *hardly* see them deficits.](http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2674491168/) Yeah that was a lie, and Harper was right.\n\n&gt;Can I get a source on the economy thing?\n\nWell, in general, I believe until 2015 the GDP was on a sharp rise. GDP isn't a great indicator, but it serves its purpose I suppose.\n\nAs of now our GDP is near stagnant. Some months it has even fallen. Not to mention that the government is expected to run $1 trillion in debt by 2050, which we will eventually have to become accountable for, which will tank the government budget.\n\n&gt;Islamophobia is a real issue in Canada. But I am glad that you are privileged enough to have never experienced it. And really, it is the Conservatives who are making a big deal about m-103.

Loss of industry is a real issue. Unemployment is a real issue. The crashing housing market is a real issue. Homelessness is a real issue. All of these issues the federal gov't now ignores.\n\nUniversity SJW's getting triggered about \"unexpected jihad\" memes or a package of bacon being left outside a mosque are not issues that are relevant to Canada.

Harper is responsible for what Canada did under him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can say that, but it is nothing to be ashamed of. Unfortunately, sorry to burst your bubble, but Canada did not deploy RCAF forces to kill Arab babies in Syria, much unlike what you think went down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Canada is respected and loved under Trudeau right now. Though I will admit that is not hard when you are just to the north of Trump&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Canada isn&amp;#39;t respected and loved. Canada is pushed aside. Made irrelevant. Most foreigners don&amp;#39;t even know who Justin Trudeau is. Just because articles get upvoted on reddit because we&amp;#39;re legalizing weed does not mean Trudeau is by any means &amp;quot;loved&amp;quot; on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;he ran a higher defect that Trudeau is doing now. The last prime minister to balance the budget was a Liberal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be ignorant. The last two fiscal years were a straight surplus. There is documented proof of that. It&amp;#39;s a well known fact. Trudeau&amp;#39;s end game plan is also to run $1 trillion in debt, and continues to run  WELL over $10 billion in debt per year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2674491168/\"&gt;Teeny tiny little deficits. So small you can &lt;em&gt;hardly&lt;/em&gt; see them deficits.&lt;/a&gt; Yeah that was a lie, and Harper was right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can I get a source on the economy thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, in general, I believe until 2015 the GDP was on a sharp rise. GDP isn&amp;#39;t a great indicator, but it serves its purpose I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of now our GDP is near stagnant. Some months it has even fallen. Not to mention that the government is expected to run $1 trillion in debt by 2050, which we will eventually have to become accountable for, which will tank the government budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Islamophobia is a real issue in Canada. But I am glad that you are privileged enough to have never experienced it. And really, it is the Conservatives who are making a big deal about m-103. The government has passed similar motions about other minorities plenty of times without the Cons making a fuss about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is not a real issue. Poverty is a real issue. Loss of industry is a real issue. Unemployment is a real issue. The crashing housing market is a real issue. Homelessness is a real issue. All of these issues the federal gov&amp;#39;t now ignores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;University SJW&amp;#39;s getting triggered about &amp;quot;unexpected jihad&amp;quot; memes or a package of bacon being left outside a mosque are not issues that are relevant to Canada.
