It&amp;#39;s pandering, and it&amp;#39;s what the Liberal government is good at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question is, is all this pandering really necessary?  Last I checked, 2/3rds of Canadians supported legalizing pot.  Couldn&amp;#39;t we just tell the other 1/3rd to fuck off and deal with the evidence, instead of going to such ridiculous lengths to try to re-assure them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For what it&amp;#39;s worth, I&amp;#39;ve heard almost everything about driving stoned.  I&amp;#39;ve seen one study that said it increases the risk of low-speed fender benders, but decreases the risk of fatal accidents.  I&amp;#39;ve seen another that puts the number of drivers who were killed and tested to have pot in their system was so low as to be insignificant.  I&amp;#39;ve seen another that put the risk factor for driving stoned somewhere between taking an SSRI, and caffeine withdrawal.  It&amp;#39;s obvious that pot isn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;inert&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to affecting your driving ability, and I think we should be happy it&amp;#39;s finally going to be legal and agree to not drive stoned under any circumstances - we have to be ambassadors to this drug.  But can&amp;#39;t we also take a level headed, evidence-based approach to this sort of thing?  Or is that asking too much of the Liberals?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dgb79kl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492320477.0, "created_utc": 1492291677.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k0tk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k0tk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k0tk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc175a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ButtholeSmurfer", "parent_id": "t1_dgbeo8k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What an outrage!
