If pot's legal, they'd better have a damn good reason to go looking for \"something\" in your car (merely because they got a 'bad sniff test' off  you and your character).\n\nIf everyone who smokes pot is driving around at the 2ng level, then when the police *want* something that violates your civil rights (car/body search, seizure of something, whatever...), they can always pipe up with a statement of \"...maybe we should give you a test for cannabis?\".  Now, hmmmm...  \"Get charged with driving over .2mg?\" or \"...Have your car or person riffled for a fishing trip simply because your brother has a record, but you don't - but you're probably a bad seed too?\" (anyone in a smaller town knows what I mean).   I was under the impression that LE was not there to make the laws, but simply to enforce them.   Parliament and Justice make the laws, not the dummies with the guns.   Canada was supposed to founded on that model, no?  Why did Bill Blair have so much power over that committee?\n\nThis is strategic, legislated leverage for police over the populace.\n\nI'm starting to see this new legislation as potentially far worse than the current status quo.

If at the end the police officer who is trained to conduct the test believes on reasonable grounds the person is impaired by drug they will be read a demand under 254(3.1) of the Criminal Code to submit to an evaluation at the police station by an evaluating officer.

Always have always will. If they feel like testing you they will and you have no power to stop it.    \n\nThere is nt such thing as \"suspicion of sobriety\". The test currently to administer an approved screening device roadside under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code is a reasonable suspicion the driver has alcohol in their body. The key is a reasonable suspicion. This differs greatly from just mere suspicion. Odour of alcohol, admission of consumption, open liquor, bodily signs of consumption or observed to be consuming would be a reasonable suspicion. A police officer can not just administer it to anyone. First after getting numerous zero readings, complaints will happen and supervisors are going to wonder why people keep providing zero samples. It is embarrassing as hell to have someone provide a sample and register a big fat zero. Second the entire process is recorded. Third it opens a police officer up to problems in court during impaired trials. If he testifies that he administers the ASD and 90% of the time gets readings of zero it will seriously call into question the current trial. Readings of zero are rare.

Section 254(2) allows a peace officer to demand a breath sample if he/she has a reasonable suspicion the driver has alcohol in their body. A field sobriety test is not required. If you register a fail roadside you are arrested and go to the police detachment to provide two more samples into an approved instrument.
