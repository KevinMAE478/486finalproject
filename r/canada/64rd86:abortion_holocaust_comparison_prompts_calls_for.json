But doing that doesn't crowd out the possibility of doing religious missionary work that does the same thing. Just because you have one store selling coconuts doesn't mean you can't have two. And, in fact, I'd argue that you can be appreciative of Christian missionaries for destroying many of the pagan religious practices of various cultures which were significantly worse for their societal health, one being polygamy, for example.

They don't.\n\nI'm not so sure this is true.

Going through it a second time now.\n\n\n&gt;The Salvation Army also does good work until you hear the president say that homosexuals and the parents of homosexuals should be put to death. And their not even wrong as they are following the tenants of the good book.\n\nYet they still do good, don't they? I don't agree with them. Yet if they manage to do good, without doing harm, why not let them continue to do good?

Many Christians join their ranks and as a matter of fact I&amp;#39;m considering joining them as a field tech. But doing that doesn&amp;#39;t crowd out the possibility of doing religious missionary work that does the same thing. Just because you have one store selling coconuts doesn&amp;#39;t mean you can&amp;#39;t have two. And, in fact, I&amp;#39;d argue that you can be appreciative of Christian missionaries for destroying many of the pagan religious practices of various cultures which were significantly worse for their societal health, one being polygamy, for example. Your interpretation of missionary work is extremely flawed. It&amp;#39;s nothing like what you said at all. I should know; I know people who did missionary work in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;if the government made it as easy to start up the same sort of soup kitchen in a non religious environment.

It's like the Catholic church which operates soup kitchens out of community centres for the homeless out of the goodness of its heart.  The Church which runs such NGOs will never say to the homeless, *\"Here's a bun, but by the way, while you're chowing down on that bun, you must listen to us as we shove a vision of the world down your throat as if it's the only one that exists!\"*  Alberta's famous [*Hope Missions*](https://hopemission.com/home/) in Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer and Wetaskiwin are Alberta's best known soup kitchens and homeless shelters... and they never execute their work with a bible in hand to throw in the face of the homeless (hell... you wouldn't even know it's a religious organization).\n\n2. You're probably familiar with the [Covenant Health](https://www.covenanthealth.ca/) network.  This includes *Catholic* Caritas Centres found in Alberta, many hospitals in Alberta, as well as other places in Canada, and around the world.  They're PUBLIC medical centres which accept funds from the provincial government and local Catholic Church fundraising, and/or are also ran by Catholic boards.  Sometimes they operate as walk-in clinics (where they will actually give you objective info on abortions, HIV prevention for gay clientele -- which includes issuing condoms -- and other things mandated by *PUBLIC* health, but which may be against the Vatican's teachings... Regardless they keep religion out of it, as they should).   In other places in Alberta they operate old-folks homes.  In some circumstances, there are entire hospitals which operate along the same principle (Two of Edmonton's main hospitals, the Misericordia Hospital and the Grey Nuns hospital, both fall under their purview, as do other hospitals around the province such as Vegreville's St.Joseph hospital, Banff's Mineral Springs hospital, Camrose's St.Mary's hospital, Lethbridge's St. Michael's Centre, etc).   But bottom line, the Catholic Church is providing a PUBLIC service as a good-will gesture to the community, as what they see as a duty to their fellow man (or woman).  To provide this public service, they suck-up the religious side of things (which is quite moderate in Canada, regardless... and not as hardline on an individual level in Canada as Africa or even the Vatican).  Bottom line, they won't tell the gay person being tested for HIV and who is asking for HIV prevention advice to not use a condom and to see a priest so as to be converted to become straight.  They will not tell a woman seeking abortion advice to fuck off (they will give objective abortion options as part of their advice, with NO preaching or religious bias... And... SHOCKER... they will actually provide abortions within their *Catholic ran and endorsed public hospitals*, whether you or I like it or not), and they will treat everyone equal, regardless of personal circumstances, religion or sexual orientation.  \n\n3. The YMCA, although not a *public* organization per se, has strong Catholic church involvement in its management and mandate (it's the Young Men's Christian Association - YMCA, just as the YWCA is the Young Women's Christian Association).   I don't know about you, but they've never thrown the bible at me whenever I asked to get on a treadmill.  \n\nNow, with these anologies behind us, back to the PUBLIC schools with Catholic boards:  The Catholic school boards, individual Catholic schools, and their teachers know there is a HUGE difference between the public schools which they operate (as a public community service), and that of a church.  \n\nThey fundamentally believe that preaching is to be left within the confines of a Church, and that public schools are to be left as public schools (It's a feel-good volunteer thing for the church to run public schools, which they view as part of their good-deed to society, but they know their place, and generally they do a pretty good job of towing the line).  \n\nEven though the Catholic schools can understand and accept that, if you are someone who cannot accept that, well... there's always a church somewhere which may preach the lines you wish to be fed.", "edited": 1491938709.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools aren&amp;#39;t churches, and the Catholic church &lt;em&gt;knows this&lt;/em&gt; (even if the rogue teacher in the example in the article does not).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The church has undertaken a role to provide provincial PUBLIC education as part of it&amp;#39;s public service commitment (basically a volunteer role out of the goodness of their heart, rooted from a time when the public system wasn&amp;#39;t developed enough to effectively deliver education when the provincial governments were still in their infancy.

Religion has no place in public schools, but I believe as long as you&amp;#39;re meeting a basic curriculum you should be able to setup and attend a school for your specific religion, but tax payers shouldn&amp;#39;t be on the hook to fund it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg4k7v6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491959247.0, "created_utc": 1491930447.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rd86", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rd86", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rd86", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rd86", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rd86", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rd86", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rd86", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rd86", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rd86", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4w6hi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EpicDanB", "parent_id": "t1_dg4vrrm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fair enough, I am neither a Christian nor a Muslim.
