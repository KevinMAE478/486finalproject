My main point is that Rebel makes a lot of grandiose claims about the prevalence based on what is a pretty anecdotal case, some of which I&amp;#39;m not even sure I entirely believe simply because I don&amp;#39;t Rebel has ever shown you can trust anything they produce. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be naive to believe that illegal immigration is 0, that&amp;#39;s never going to be true but how prevalent is it? No one knows unless the RCMP decides to study it and release those numbers. Even at hundreds of people a day that&amp;#39;s still a drop in the bucket relative to the entire population, and I just generally don&amp;#39;t view illegal immigration as a big issue, some cab companies running illegals from the U.S to Canada is pretty small potatoes in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg9pwve", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492231281.0, "created_utc": 1492202481.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg91z2m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jaudark", "parent_id": "t1_dg8robl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not fabricated as I've been reading it since Feburary in [*La Presse* (Wikipedia link)](https://goo.gl/OYBtBK).\n\nhttp://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201702/11/01-5068582-passages-desesperes-de-migrants-en-monteregie.php", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not fabricated as I&amp;#39;ve been reading it since Feburary in &lt;a href=\"https://goo.gl/OYBtBK\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;La Presse&lt;/em&gt; (Wikipedia link)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201702/11/01-5068582-passages-desesperes-de-migrants-en-monteregie.php\"&gt;http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/201702/11/01-5068582-passages-desesperes-de-migrants-en-monteregie.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg91z2m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492200715.0, "created_utc": 1492171915.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6587dq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6587dq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6587dq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6587dq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6587dq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6587dq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6587dq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8tf5k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zee-wolf", "parent_id": "t1_dg8tahm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "WMD in Iraq.\n\nGas attacks in Syria few years ago and now.
