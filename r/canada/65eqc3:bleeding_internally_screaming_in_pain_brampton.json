Just because everything isn't shiny and new doesn't mean its not best practices or evidence based. A lot of the time technology costs a lot for marginal improvement. \n\n&gt; Patients get bad sleep because of the way everything is setup...\n\nWards are very hard to change once built. Current trend is in the direction I'm sure you'd agree with with single rooms, and set ups to maximize viewing from the central desk.\n\nOther reasons for lack of sleep include early morning labs. Unfortunately abandoning morning labs means that no lab work will be available to act on until midday. \n\n&gt; No technology talks to each other unless it is the same manufacturer...\n\nI agree technology should talk to each other. Unfortunately that is not the case. This is a big barrier especially as Canada is overall a small market and generally there would be resistance to completely redesigning products to meet our needs.\n\nRegarding monitors, they are a) expensive, b) fall off and trigger alarms and c) patients hate being on them. I know I would choose to be woken up for 4 am vitals over having to wear telemetry and a BP cuff to bed.\n\n&gt; Rooms literally can't be cleaned properly because of how they are..\n\nAgree. This is also a trend in hospital design.\n\n&gt; You need everyone wearing masks that comes in with contagions or possibility of contagion..\n\nMost patients and visitors chafe at being asked to possible undertake basic infection control measures such as wash their hands. \n\n&gt; Hospitals are too small overall...\n\nAreas built for wards are generally unsuitable for outpatient clinics. Overbuilding is inefficient. Hospitals are \"too small\" because we have large numbers of patients who need LTC care or better home care (which is way cheaper) who are stuck in normal hospital rooms.\n\nAlso we have plenty of ORs available, just no government funding to run them, hence multiple times per year OR \"slowdowns\".\n\n&gt; Food quality is sub par...\n\nAgree. You had me at sub par.\n\n&gt; Paper charts are used...\n&gt; Make integrated records system...\n\nIn Ontario there is a central system that collects the info from hospitals, and labs although it is clunky and slow. I once asked a Ministry of Health official why they couldn't just tell companies you have five years to make a compatible system or else and got told that companies would just write off the Ontario market.\n\nAlso to speak to the sad state of EMRs, with respect to note writing and ease of note reading, paper charts beat most of them in ease of use!\n\n&gt; Nurse forging orders is rampant...\nEMRs take care of this pretty nicely\n\n&gt; Gov won't hire staff MD so you have residents and even students working wards. Provides bad level of care.\n\nResidents work the wards as an apprenticeship. A few notes:\n1) Residents are MDs who have completed two classroom and two clinical years of training at minimum.\n2) Junior residents are supervised closely by senior residents who are almost certified specialists and many with more formal training than family physicians.\n3) In general ward staff physician is a) in house during the day (typically doing clinic) reachable as needed b) rounding with the team on any new and sick patients in the morning and c) reviewing the work at the end of the day.\n4) At the end of the day, most places without residents you may get seen once a day by the staff physician unless a need arises so in the end it is very similar\n5) If residents didn't work the ward then, we'd have a bunch of early career staff physicians who would start unsupervised practice with no clue what to do. Every fully qualified specialist came from somewhere. Every person had to be someone's first.\n\n&gt; Gov sells a few residency spots to foreign governments...\n\nThese docs get spots that otherwise funding doesn't exist for. \n\n&gt; We also accept tons of other foreign trained doctors to residency...\n\nAnyone who gets a spot that isn't directly funded by a foreign government is either a canadian permanent resident or citizen regardless of where they trained. Foreign trained doctors compete for a very limited number of spots open to them and generally have to agree to return of service agreements. Those who beat out canadian grads in the second round are often quite good.\n\nI would also add there are some people who graduate from Canadian schools who I don't think deserve to match over many of the excellent IMGs and FMGs out there. We also need to end this entitlement that every Canadian grad feels they \"deserve\" a residency in their \"chosen field\". Sorry, not everyone can be a Neurosurgeon.\n\n&gt; Family physicians in many rural communities are given very lucrative recruitment packages...\n\nThen there will not be any physicians in rural areas. Keep in mind that family docs in rural areas also do the obstetrics, ER and run the hospital wards. \n\n&gt; Use \"nudging\" to make MD aware of how they fare against peers...\n\nI don't think most doctors who underperform do it because they are too lazy to be better or don't know that others outperform them. There is also a known phenomenon of doctors refusing to take patients with expected poor outcomes when they are incentivized to meet outcome targets.\n\n&gt; No security really in hospital...\n\nI'd say predator is worse than infectious but yes I agree.\n\n&gt; Psych...\n\nPsych patients are generally on locked wards. Patients with dementia may benefit from this, but you may get an outcry. Other competent patients are free to leave if they want, and this would be seen as a huge violation of their rights.\n\n&gt; Pharmacists...\n\nAgree.\n\n&gt; Stop making residents and staff work more than 16hr...\n\nGenerally there is some sleep or downtime on 24 hour calls so it's not working them straight. Having done both night float and call during clerkship, night float (required to make 16 hour shifts work) is infinitely more exhausting. They have studied this multiple times and there have been NO benefits to limiting shift lengths below 24 hours. I think something that really helps is that most non-urgent things you make wait until the morning anyways if it's past midnight.\n\nIf I was to make any change it would be to have a dedicated person take admits past midnight. Would allow people covering to get more sleep and still be fresh for coverage calls happening at the tail end of their shift. \n\n&gt; Overall just need more physicians in hospitals...\nAgree.\n\n&gt; Checkout I think it's called GE hospital of the future...\n\nProblem is you're talking huge capital outlays especially where entirely new hospitals are required.\n\n&gt; 2. Make cost of tests and alternatives a highly informed subject for new students and residents...\n\nMost of the stuff on choosing wisely is already taught to medical students by staff. These aren't uncontroversial things. The problem is that there are huge populations of doctors (and patients) that simply don't want to listen to current evidence.\n\nAlso costs change over time and sometimes costs offer real benefits. I had to do a test once which included costs as part of the evaluation of what a \"correct\" answer was. I said I'd give a patient a twice a day med instead of a five times a day med and lost marks because it was marginally more expensive. And that's a simple comparison. What about comparing Diamicron with Januvia for my patient with Diabetes?\n\n&gt;3. Do thorough analysis of bill codes in fee for service model...\n\nVery few physicians actually make the amounts you're stating. I don't know any anesthetist making those amounts. There was a small number of physicians in Ontario billing over a million and supposedly they were working almost every day a year. They were predominantly Opthalmologists and Radiologists, the two fields who have benefitted the most from efficiency in out put from technology. While I think fees should be adjusted, I think they should keep some of the benefit of increased output. \n\n&gt;4. Do not allow billing for resident provided services in fee for service model...\n\nExcept the staff still spends a decent amount of time on those patients in morning and afternoon rounds and being available for resident questions. I would say some discount for indirect supervision would be warranted (defined as being available in hospital for support) but no discount for direct supervision (as this takes as much time or more than doing the procedure without a resident). Don't forget most staff are paid 0 to teach residents. They take on medico-legal risk and generally do put in a lot of effort to supervise so I don't think its fair that it goes unpaid.\n\n&gt; 5. Automatic data analysis of all billed fees to find for statistical anomalies...\n\nAgree. Currently audits are underfunded and random, so of the handful of docs that commit fraud almost none get caught. Focusing audits on those with anomalies makes it possible to catch fraudsters without inordinate spending on enforcement.\n\n&gt;6. Mandatory that every individual must have a family physician...\n\n1) We have a shortage of family docs in most communities. Eliminating rural incentives will mean a severe shortage in much of the province. Does it count as having access if you can never get in?\n2) This implies it is even constitutional to force a patient to attend a family physician.\n3) You do really overestimate the cost of hospital vs. cost of longitudinal care. Most of the cost of care comes at end of life and that comes eventually regardless of how much care you get before then. If anything we need more palliative care docs.\n\n&gt;7. National pharmacare plan...\n\nExcept billions lost from private individuals not from government. None the less I agree we should have one.\n\n\nDisclosure: I'm just graduating med school now, starting residency in a few months.

A CCU/ICU is slightly better. A panopticon style quiet design would be better. \n- No technology talks to each other unless it is the same manufacturer.

Not to mention that all of this should be on patient doors so patients can sleep and this should also be back at the nurse station so any abnormalities can be quickly seen. \n- Rooms literally can't be cleaned properly because of how they are. Clean rooms need to be used where aerosolized disinfectant can be automated when a patient leaves, along with UV sterilization. Kill your lethal C Diff snd MRSA while reducing ongoing labour costs. \n- You need everyone wearing masks that comes in with contagions or possibility of contagion. You have very sick people. New borns. Post op patients. All being exposed to possibly highly infectious people all sitting in a room together. \n- Hospitals are too small overall. Always at capacity physically. Build the next one BIGGER. Make it 5x bigger than necessary. Worst case scenario you can have inpatient clinics and family medicine clinics there. Or teaching clinics. It's not going to be too unused. Same thing for OR's. \n- Food quality is sub par, high salt, simple carb, not tailored to individuals. Worse recovery or health for patient. \n- Paper charts are used. Handwriting is hard to read. Things get mixed up, is that a 7 or a 1. \n- Make integrated records system electronic provincial wide mandatory in 2yr. Some have a bit but it's not fully integrated everywhere. You can see a clinic doctor in suburb for X and go to hospital week later for X and the two wouldn't know. \n- Nurse forging orders is rampant. \"Oh he was fussy so we have him Tylenol.\" And nothing can be done be done because of nurses Union. The MD reporting them would also face unofficial backlash from all nurses then. \n- An MD cannot do much against incompetent nurses because of the Union. Bad nurses continue being bad and patient suffers. \n- Gov won't hire staff MD so you have residents and even students working wards. Provides bad level of care. \n- Gov sells a few residency spots to foreign governments each year for like 100k+ per year per spot. So a 5yr program gets half a million to the government. As far as I know it's mostly Saudi Arabia. We train their doctors. They have to go back. We also accept tons of other foreign trained doctors to residency and sometimes not all of the Canadian students will become residents in their chosen fields because we have preferred some international candidates instead. Lose money because investment in students is lost if they can't become doctors or go abroad (Aus, UK, US). Provides bad level of care for more money. \n- Family physicians in many rural communities are given very lucrative recruitment packages. Many doctors from South Africa are recruited. Maybe stop spending money on that. \n- Use \"nudging\" to make MD aware of how they fare against peers. Anonymous. Ie. Your patients have 3x more complications than average. It works. Behavioral psychology or something it's called. \n- No security really in hospital. You can walk right up to almost any ward and room. Maybe stop this so you don't have Joe Smith walking around who could be a predator or worse, infectious. \n- Psych. Patients and elderly patients can wander off property and nobody would immediately know. Put cattle RFID tags on them. \n- Pharmacists are doing good work in hospitals but overworked and understaffed. They check interactions and make suggestions. Very important. \n- Nurses. Not to rag on them. I know many. Many good. But many are not. We are also moving away from highly trained RN to less trained. Even worse. We are moving to using more Nurses Aids. Barely any training. Often spotty English. \n- We should probably stop allowing for new immigrants to bring their aging parents over without a serious tax compensation. It happens a lot and it is a huge drain on the system. I understand the compassionate reason but we are not really in a fantastic position to provide services to these people. They also often require use of an interpreter which is mandatory even if the MD speaks the language. \n- Stop making residents and staff work more than 16hr. Handover is the most dangerous for a patient but memory, reaction times, decision making and critical thinking plummets after 16hr, worse after 20-24hr. Many of these people shouldn't even be driving home because they are so impaired. But yet are making medical health decisions. It is nonsense. Handover is an informal update of the ongoing care of patients and events. It needs to be more formalized and mandatory time spent doing this no matter what. \n- Overall just need more physicians in hospitals. Costs money. See savings below. \n\nCheckout I think it's called GE hospital of the future. 99% of the tech is available today. Expensive. But not stupidly expensive and not without reason. I don't know if they have ideal hospital design though. Key is just noise, comfort, and contagion prevention. \n\nOverall problem: Not enough money to build, hire, provide basic care overall but not bad enough that people are dying in droves. Solutions:\n1. Fix nurse garbage per other comment. The &lt;1.0 FTE game so everyone gets a hunch of 1.5x and 2.0x OT. There is not a shortage. It is planned. It is not a secret. It costs tens of millions. \n2. Make cost of tests and alternatives a highly informed subject for new students and residents. Harder to change old set in ways doctors. This could save something like $30 X 200 of a type of doctor in an urban region hospital X 4 tests per day ordered. Maybe $10m savings. No less effective of a test or treatment. Each speciality has these types of choices that can be made so for 10 specialties in a hospital it could be $20-50m annual savings. (Choosing wisely it's called). \n3. Do thorough analysis of bill codes in fee for service model. Many dated and unnecessary or inappropriate. Anesthesiologist working 1yr hard hours full time shouldn't be making 1.5m. Sorry. Just not appropriate in our socialized medicine model. Surgeons making 800k+ is okay given the ultra specialization and hell surgery can be. Rural family doctor doesn't need to make 600k over an urban Doctor doing same stuff making 350k. A radiologist doesn't need to make 1.5m to checkout scans all day. They should all be paid well but when you go above 600k it is getting into absurd territory. This would save around $500m at minimum in BC, or AB, or SK+MN (per province). \n4. Do not allow billing for resident provided services in fee for service model. Routinely a staff physician will have a few residents covering their patients and the services the resident provides will be billed for by the staff physician. This removes the incentive for the staff to actually be in the ward /hospital and doing work. \n5. Automatic data analysis of all billed fees to find for statistical anomalies. Then use \"nudging\" to advise outliers they are an anomaly. Investigate likely fraudulent claims. Many medi center doctors are billing for triple the number of patients they could've possibly seen per day because oversight is extremely lax. \n6. Mandatory that every individual must have a family physician. Stopping a patient from getting into the hospital saves 10x+ the funds more family doctors would cost the system. Prevention is the goldmine of savings. \n7. National pharmacare plan. Idiotic we don't have this. Billions lost. \n\nThat's all for now. The system is so mismanaged you have no idea. The public has no idea. The media doesn't know. The majority of decision makers; government, health authorities, hospital admin/exec are essentially \"faking it till you make it\" and just doing what isn't catastrophically bad or just not making any changes all together. It is very bad and there is probably $6b wasted outside of ON/QC. I am less familiar with ON system and QC is a black box.
