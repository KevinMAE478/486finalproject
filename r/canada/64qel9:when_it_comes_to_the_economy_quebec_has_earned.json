But... ignorance is everywhere, ignorance will never have a border.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I take from this is that, especially in Quebec, tax breaks towards specific industries really help (ie: Gaming industry in Montreal who is adding several thousand new jobs over the next few years).  I think that Quebecois are over taxed, and that if they alleviated those taxes more, they&amp;#39;d have even more economic growth.  Perhaps even more tax revenue.

having a fond kinship with the British Monarchy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus bashing America for political &amp;amp; social division is very popular, as is pride in the Commonwealth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this also makes Quebec very unpopular, because Quebec reminds Anglo-Canadians that they might be even more divided than America deep down &amp;amp; that a huge chunk of the population doesn&amp;#39;t give a shit for the British monarch, even in a symbolic or ceremonial way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throw in the fact that Quebecois culture exposes how much Anglo-Canadian culture mirrors American culture, and all of it combined strikes at the very heart of what they constructed to be their national identity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus you have a recipe for insecure lashing out &amp;amp; a passive agressive mentality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple fix however, just start bashing America. lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg4v2i1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491971047.0, "created_utc": 1491942247.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qel9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qel9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qel9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5plvb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Faitlemou", "parent_id": "t1_dg50k70", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "T'en fait pas je faisais de l'ironie", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&amp;#39;en fait pas je faisais de l&amp;#39;ironie&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg5plvb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492022513.0, "created_utc": 1491993713.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg50k70", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NewVegasResident", "parent_id": "t1_dg4v8ct", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks a lot...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg50k70", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491977555.0, "created_utc": 1491948755.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4v8ct", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Faitlemou", "parent_id": "t1_dg4gfl9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Quebec is doing ok, this is what's wrong haha", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quebec is doing ok, this is what&amp;#39;s wrong haha&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg4v8ct", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491971228.0, "created_utc": 1491942428.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4gfl9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 32, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FeatherNET", "parent_id": "t3_64qel9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The fuck is wrong with this subreddit?
