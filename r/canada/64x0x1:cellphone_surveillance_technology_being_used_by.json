With stupid crap like this, they just may succeed in making Canada tip toward communism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this. With this phone surveillance, they are trying to emulate what I have. Some time ago, I wrote an obfuscation technique for software. When you compile against a compiler, then disassemble, you can see the source code for that program(opcodes). With my software, ALL instructions are MOV instructions. Very hard to decipher. The CSIS wants this, they are always trying to trick me into giving it away to them. They are always trying to steal it from me. But Im not selling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they are trying to make their own to hold us all hostage.
