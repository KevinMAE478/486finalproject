It&amp;#39;s impossible to show them anything negative about Trump, to them every reliable source is fake news and every alt right website and paranoid Facebook post is the gospel &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that Trump spoke the truth when he said that he could shoot a man in the middle of fifth avenue and not lose a single voter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Living in the Bible Belt fucking sucks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg76me3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492088985.0, "created_utc": 1492060185.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 172}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6523gj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg73l9s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zaphod_beeble_bro", "parent_id": "t1_dg6zcpo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Make sure he doesn't see us or he's gonna wave us over an ask us to throw some tinder on the fire with him cause \"we're totally buddies remember??\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure he doesn&amp;#39;t see us or he&amp;#39;s gonna wave us over an ask us to throw some tinder on the fire with him cause &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;re totally buddies remember??&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg73l9s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492084129.0, "created_utc": 1492055329.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6zcpo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2001, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ru-ya", "parent_id": "t3_6523gj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nervously sweating as our neighbours' new landlord is setting the building on fire.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nervously sweating as our neighbours&amp;#39; new landlord is setting the building on fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg6zcpo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492078441.0, "created_utc": 1492049641.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2001}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6523gj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6523gj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6523gj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ds2y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 40, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RushDid2112", "parent_id": "t1_dg7aawv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "^^^labrador ^^^^isn't ^^^^^a ^^^^^^province", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;labrador&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;province&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg7ds2y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492108108.0, "created_utc": 1492079308.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 40}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7aawv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 26, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Desalvo23", "parent_id": "t1_dg73piv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would suggest you visit Labrador and Nunavut at some point in your life.
