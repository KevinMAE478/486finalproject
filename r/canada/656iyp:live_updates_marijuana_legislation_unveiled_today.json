If you can't have it for free, it ain't really legal.", "edited": 1492132401.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a quick glance at the proposed regulations, I noticed a few things that didn&amp;#39;t seem to stick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Games as promotions are illegal. So much for Roll Up the Joint to Win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) It will be illegal to transport clones, and illegal to carry more than 30 cannabis seeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Four plant limit per home, regardless of how many people want to grow in a household. You&amp;#39;re only allowed to grow at home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) It&amp;#39;s illegal to make, or solicit the service of making, solvent-based extracts for anyone other than yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Trafficking to minors has a penalty of 14 years, as does \ntrafficking outside of the proposed law. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) No vending machines or self service allowed in stores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) There&amp;#39;s a strange mention of harm to victims, and victim surcharge, which is odd because cannabis prohibition is one of the most victim-less crimes on the books. It&amp;#39;s a good reminder that the law isn&amp;#39;t changing because they&amp;#39;re changing the law, it&amp;#39;s changing because it&amp;#39;s unjust. All of the proposed regulation should be weighed against the cause of harm and clear definition of victim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8) Citizens with cannabis related charges will be refused licensing under the new regulatory system (or can be), so justice may be long denied for those hurt by prohibition, forced into the black market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9) The Minister can order you to test your cannabis, but there&amp;#39;s no mention of who pays for the test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10) With a warrant and, if needed, law enforcement escort, Health Canada can send an inspector into your garden.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11) There&amp;#39;s mention of liability to corporate officers, but no firm punishments or revocation of corporate charter. Maximum fine is $1,000,000. To a company worth over a billion dollars in a pre-legal market, that isn&amp;#39;t much. In a legal market, it&amp;#39;s a puff of smoke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12) The Minister is now in charge of industrial hemp licensing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13) You&amp;#39;re still not allowed to give a plant away. If you can&amp;#39;t have it for free, it ain&amp;#39;t really legal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg8ff2d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492155690.0, "created_utc": 1492126890.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656iyp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656iyp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8408y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ruglescdn", "parent_id": "t1_dg83ghj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Probably.
