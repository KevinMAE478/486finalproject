There was a culture of animal abuse on dairy farms when I grew up.  If the cow kicked my father while he was milking, in his rage he would beat it unmercifully, with whatever implement was nearby - shit shovel, hay rake, or milk pail.  It happened a long time ago, but I venture to say that he probably would have used the sharp points of the rake on a cow which especially would have pissed him off. \n\nI saw that, and probably thought it was OK.  I remember mistreating the younger calves and heifers, which were under my care, because I thought that was part of the necessary education a cow had to receive.  Crazy, isn't it?  Well, it's true, and not only on our farm.  Friends of mine would relate stories similar to mine, when told (or boasted by me) about how my dad whaled on some cow that morning, etc.  It was common. \n\nAnd these young workers who have been charged learned a similar thing.  A cow is not something they would have an emotional attachment to - nowadays these factory farms are a business, and if a cow isn't producing, it's dealt with quite cruelly.  There is no such thing as retirement for a milk cow - being put out to pasture without having to produce milk, while it lives out its remaining non-producing years, till dying a natural death.

There was a culture of animal abuse on dairy farms when I grew up.  If the cow kicked my father while he was milking, in his rage he would beat it unmercifully, with whatever implement was nearby - shit shovel, hay rake, or milk pail.  It happened a long time ago, but I venture to say that he probably would have used the sharp points of the rake on a cow which especially would have pissed him off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw that, and probably thought it was OK.  I remember mistreating the younger calves and heifers, which were under my care, because I thought that was part of the necessary education a cow had to receive.  Crazy, isn&amp;#39;t it?  Well, it&amp;#39;s true, and not only on our farm.  Friends of mine would relate stories similar to mine, when told (or boasted by me) about how my dad whaled on some cow that morning, etc.  It was common. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And these young workers who have been charged learned a similar thing.  A cow is not something they would have an emotional attachment to - nowadays these factory farms are a business, and if a cow isn&amp;#39;t producing, it&amp;#39;s dealt with quite cruelly.

Again, I'm not suggesting that improvements can't be made but you do have to understand that animals raised in any condition get sick. Milking cows by hand in a pastoral setting places cows at many different risks, these risks are just as compromising for welfare. So a balance needs to be struck here.
