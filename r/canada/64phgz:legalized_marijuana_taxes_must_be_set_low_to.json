There is really no reason that once fully legalized for recreational purposes the production needs to be regulated any different than tobacco. A pack of 25 cigarettes is ~20g of tobacco and is profitable at what $6-7 + $4 bucks tax. Current tax rate on tabacco in Ontario is 15.475\u00a2 per gram (or per cigarette if less than 1 gram). There is no way big marijuana is going to be able to get $8-12 a gram when the market is saturated, even if they still need to grow it indoors. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg4j9t7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491958218.0, "created_utc": 1491929418.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64phgz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64phgz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64phgz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4b4ty", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ruglescdn", "parent_id": "t1_dg49bba", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The risk of prosecution (for production and retailing) is built into that current $10 price.
