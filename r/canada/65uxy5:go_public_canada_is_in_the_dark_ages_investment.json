They will usually do a brief suitability questionnaire (asking about risk tolerance, income, time horizon, etc.) and help people invest in suitable, usually bank-owned, mutual funds. They do not sell equities, ETF, bonds, etc. Many of their customers do not realize that these people do not have the ability to sell most of the kinds of securities that are out there. Many, but not all, mutual funds have high fees attached.\n\nThe second type are investment advisors working under banners like RBC Dominion Securities, Scotia MacLeod, CIBC Wood Gundy, etc. These people are able to sell a much broader range of securities. Some are good at what they do and some are not. Specific buys and sells must be approved by their clients, with them giving explanations for any recommendations they make.\n\nBoth the first and second type operate on what is called the \"suitability\" standard. This means that investments must be appropriate in light of someone's age, stage, risk tolerance and goals. For example, for a 65-year-old client with limited funds, a portfolio with mostly low-risk investments would be suitable. Things like risky small-cap equities would not be suitable. However, the suitability standard doesn't require the salesperson to act in the best interests of the client. If there are two suitable low-risk investments, Fund A and Fund B, but Fund A nets the salesperson more in commissions, Fund A is likely still suitable.\n\nThe third type are discretionary portfolio managers. Somewhat confusingly, many discretionary portfolio managers will also be investment advisors, working under the same brands mentioned above. Some have both discretionary and non-discretionary clients. What the portfolio manager does (ideally) is understand a client's goals, risk tolerance, etc. thoroughly in order to execute a portfolio on the client's behalf, and the client signs off on that understanding. The portfolio manager then has \"discretion\" to act on the client's behalf and does not need the client's specific approval for everything. In this circumstance, the portfolio manager is held to what's called the \"fiduciary\" standard. This means they must put the client's interests ahead of their own. In the above example, they could not sell the client Fund A.\n\nThere are a lot of nuances I haven't gone into, but the above is the basics. There are good and bad people at every level; I'm not slagging on mutual fund salespeople. However, the unfortunate thing is that many Canadians are with mutual fund salespeople without knowing it, and many advisors and portfolio managers do not take on clients who don't have a significant amount to invest. \n\nMeaning, if you've got just $10,000 to invest, or even $100,000, you're more than likely only going to attract the attention of the mutual fund guys, and not even be aware of what else is out there. Investing in bank mutual funds is not necessarily a bad thing, but people in this situation should really do their research and consider alternatives like self-directed investing.\n\n", "edited": 1492440508.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisor vs. adviser thing that CBC seems to be doubling down on is fairly misleading on its own.
