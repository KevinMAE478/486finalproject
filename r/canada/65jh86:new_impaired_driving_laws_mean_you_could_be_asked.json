They are very good at detecting very recent marijuana use. If less than 24 hours has elapsed between your last joint and the time of the test, you will likely test positive. And more sensitive laboratory tests can easily detect it up to 72 hours after intake. Chronic heavy users facing a sensitive saliva test can be detected for up to a week in general.\n\nAnd lab sensitive tests test down to 0.5 ng. In other words, it sounds like the test that will be used is near lab quality (which sounds expensive) and will leave a casual user exposed for 72 hours afterwards for facing a \"positive\" test.\n\nThe testing thresholds also seems absurdly low.

Even if that were true, toking would pale in comparison to drinking as a road hazard, since research indicates that a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10% quintuples the risk of an accident. But according to an analysis that\u2019s about to be published by the journal Addiction, the increase in crash risk associated with marijuana use is roughly 20% to 30%, as opposed to the widely cited estimate of 92%.\n\nIn other words, if your chance of having an accident is 1 in 60,000, then it's 1 in 50,000 *if you are high at the time*, but we should spend billions on testing to send people who have never driven high to jail?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the swabs, how long will they detect back? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=\"http://www.narcocheck.com/en/saliva-drug-tests/thc-marijuana-saliva-test.html\"&gt;commercially available one says&lt;/a&gt; 4-6 hours but has a tolerance of 25 ng to test positive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to the legislation:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 nanograms to 5 nanograms of THC: Punishable by a fine of up to $1,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 nanograms or more: Mandatory minimum penalty of a $1,000 fine for a first offence, with escalating jail time for those convicted more than once \u2014 from 30 days for a second conviction to 120 days for each subsequent offence.
