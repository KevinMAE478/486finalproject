All of the Indians who are well intentioned have blended into society. What's left is these sad displays you see here.\n\nThis rhetoric is relevant across the country. Every province has those who think that their native populations are engaged in a perpetual pity party. The problem, though, is that we've actually fucked them multiple generations deep. Yes, they have the opportunity to join modern society, but we shouldn't be surprised that they don't seem to have the will to thrive we'd expect from them. The residential schools created a generation of parents who hadn't been parented, who'd had traumatic childhoods which tried to cleanse them of their identity and culture. After residential schools, we had massive, disproportionate numbers of FN children being caught up in the foster system and removed from their homes. The next generation were the first we really 'left alone,' and even then we had beatings, significant targeting by law enforcement, midnight marches, etc. And pretty much all of them grew up with a family history not conducive to trusting the outside world. That we're surprised that they don't have the will or the desire to leave the reservation, to merge into a society that tried to destroy a significant thing they identify with within the lives of their parents or grandparents, is truly strange. It's easy for somebody who grew up outside of FN culture to say \"come on, we're not so bad out here,\" but the baggage they have is understandably significant.\n\nIt's generally accepted that children who are forced into the foster system face greater challenges, are more likely to end up in the justice system, will on average have lower lifetime incomes, etc. Childhood is impactful. With indigenous Canadians, we've fucked with their ability to raise their kids in pretty large scale for multiple generations in a row. Those kids who haven't been parented have a hard time parenting. Sometimes children of struggling parents can find other adult figures to help bridge the gaps, but if the problem is community-wide, that's even less likely. To expect them to raise well-functioning, supportive communities at a rate similar to our own is unreasonable. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with the indigenous population in Manitoba is that there is no self accountability and it pays to be a victim. All of the Indians who are well intentioned have blended into society. What&amp;#39;s left is these sad displays you see here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This rhetoric is relevant across the country. Every province has those who think that their native populations are engaged in a perpetual pity party. The problem, though, is that we&amp;#39;ve actually fucked them multiple generations deep. Yes, they have the opportunity to join modern society, but we shouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised that they don&amp;#39;t seem to have the will to thrive we&amp;#39;d expect from them. The residential schools created a generation of parents who hadn&amp;#39;t been parented, who&amp;#39;d had traumatic childhoods which tried to cleanse them of their identity and culture. After residential schools, we had massive, disproportionate numbers of FN children being caught up in the foster system and removed from their homes. The next generation were the first we really &amp;#39;left alone,&amp;#39; and even then we had beatings, significant targeting by law enforcement, midnight marches, etc. And pretty much all of them grew up with a family history not conducive to trusting the outside world. That we&amp;#39;re surprised that they don&amp;#39;t have the will or the desire to leave the reservation, to merge into a society that tried to destroy a significant thing they identify with within the lives of their parents or grandparents, is truly strange. It&amp;#39;s easy for somebody who grew up outside of FN culture to say &amp;quot;come on, we&amp;#39;re not so bad out here,&amp;quot; but the baggage they have is understandably significant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s generally accepted that children who are forced into the foster system face greater challenges, are more likely to end up in the justice system, will on average have lower lifetime incomes, etc. Childhood is impactful. With indigenous Canadians, we&amp;#39;ve fucked with their ability to raise their kids in pretty large scale for multiple generations in a row. Those kids who haven&amp;#39;t been parented have a hard time parenting. Sometimes children of struggling parents can find other adult figures to help bridge the gaps, but if the problem is community-wide, that&amp;#39;s even less likely.

The Indian Act never actually required mandatory attendance for every FN child, but it was changed in the 1920s to stipulate that *any* child could be compelled by the government to attend residential school, and it appears that rule (or the spirit of that rule) was adhered to well into the 50s and 60s at various levels of government (weird fact - the Indian Act still technically allowed the federal government to dictate the school First Nations children attended until 2014 when the provision was removed). \n\nFrom the same wikipedia article you're quoting, you can see that parents were still coerced into participation and children by various combinations of federal and local governments. The federal government for instance made attendance a precondition for some benefits, and local governments who simply refused to allow certain families to send their children to regular schools. School boards and provincial governments saw First Nations youth (even Metis youth, who weren't covered by the Indian Act) as an unnecessary hassle, and a problem they'd rather the federal government deal with. They could force FN families to send their children to residential schools with threat of prosecution or institutionalization of their children, with little recourse for FN families. Residential schools were also able to keep parents from withdrawing their children from residential schools even if they'd entered into the school voluntarily, based on admissions contracts which would be enforced by police warrant.\n\nIt wasn't until 1951 that the Indian Act was amended to allow the federal government to partner with provinces to encourage integrated education. Prior to receiving federal money the provinces didn't really want FN students. And even then, the Churches (mostly Anglican and Roman Catholic iirc) opposed integration and lobbied hard for more students in residential schools, whose enrollment would keep growing until the peak year of 1957.\n\n&gt; The government tried to close them down completely in 1940s and 50s, but 'a slim majority of Indian bands, along with regional and national native organizations, wanted residential schools to stay open.'\n\nAgain, wikipedia notwithstanding, it generally wasn't FN people who wanted the schools to stay open - they wanted *schools* in general, schools which they would be in charge of. Instead, it was religious institutions who lobbied for the continuation of the schools and were rewarded with control of them in most cases.\n\nBy the 1960s, the TRC shows that the federal government was using residential schools as a child welfare institution - more evidence that the institutions absolutely did continue in a mandatory fashion into the 1960s.
