That conduct in the workplace was sexually inappropriate...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I now recognize that I crossed boundaries inappropriately. A workplace should not have any sexualized tone.

She is amazing, a rock-star and should be the real female role model that comes out of this disaster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I ever found myself in a difficult legal predicament and could afford it my first phone call would be to her office. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg6ydy1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492077232.0, "created_utc": 1492048432.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6vxkk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t3_64yo6n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg6vxkk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492074192.0, "created_utc": 1492045392.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
