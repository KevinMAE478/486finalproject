Every source of financial advice they had access to indicated that that was the case.  It turned out to be false.  That's not their fault.  They literally did not know better, unless they were investment bankers.\n\n&gt;focused on the optimization of themselves rather than the future of the generation that succeeds them (e.g. pension plan, housing, jobs or education).\n\nMost of my peers (I'm a millennial), are living with their parents, usually rent-free.  Much of the time, their parents are  delaying retirement to support their adult offspring (who can't get jobs despite being qualified, yes it's a vicious cycle).  That doesn't seem particularly selfish to me.  The \"fuck you, got mine\" mentality absolutely exists, but it's not a generational phenomenon.  You only see it among the older generation because they've actually \"got mine\".  The folks my age who become bankers, executives, and politicians, in all likelihood, will tell their kids and grandchildren \"fuck you, got mine.\"\n\n&gt;(e.g. pension plan, housing, jobs or education).\n\nMy generation is the most educated of any that has ever existed.  Clearly the Boomers have taken care of our education just fine.  In much of the world, including Canada, but especially the US, education has increased exponentially in price, but that was not so much the fault of a generation of working class people as it was the fault of a broken tuition system.\n\nHousing prices can't really be blamed on the Boomers either, at least exclusively.\n\nThe job market is only partly their fault, but it's a corner they were backed into (nobody wants to starve to death if their pension runs dry and they live past 90).  Considering productivity and profits right now, blame the corporations instead.\n\nI've given up on pensions and social insurance at this point.  Personally, I don't think the system was built sustainably to begin with, but even more optimistic people have to admit that fixing the crisis is not likely in the cards, and that people born after 1985 will benefit far less from CPP than they pay in.  But even still, I can't blame my parents' generation for this problem, because it wasn't caused by \"people born between January 1946 and January 1961.\"  It was caused by people from a variety of generations who, due to a variety of reasons ranging from incompetence to myopia to greed, made poor policy decisions.  I can blame them, because its their fault.  And I can be angry, because their decisions negatively impacted my life and they got off scot-free.

It accomplishes nothing and divides people into two separate groups who hate each other for stupid, manufactured reasons based on lies and statistics, while making actual problem-solving all that more difficult by driving a wedge between two demographics who need to work together to solve the problems.\n\nI invite you to tell me what you think my narrative is.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They knew better but did so anyways because they were not interested in investing in a sound alternative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, as far as any of them were aware, real estate, the stock market, relying on their pensions, and riding out the end of their careers &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; the sound alternatives.  Every source of financial advice they had access to indicated that that was the case.  It turned out to be false.  That&amp;#39;s not their fault.  They literally did not know better, unless they were investment bankers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;focused on the optimization of themselves rather than the future of the generation that succeeds them (e.g. pension plan, housing, jobs or education).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of my peers (I&amp;#39;m a millennial), are living with their parents, usually rent-free.  Much of the time, their parents are  delaying retirement to support their adult offspring (who can&amp;#39;t get jobs despite being qualified, yes it&amp;#39;s a vicious cycle).  That doesn&amp;#39;t seem particularly selfish to me.  The &amp;quot;fuck you, got mine&amp;quot; mentality absolutely exists, but it&amp;#39;s not a generational phenomenon.  You only see it among the older generation because they&amp;#39;ve actually &amp;quot;got mine&amp;quot;.  The folks my age who become bankers, executives, and politicians, in all likelihood, will tell their kids and grandchildren &amp;quot;fuck you, got mine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(e.g. pension plan, housing, jobs or education).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My generation is the most educated of any that has ever existed.  Clearly the Boomers have taken care of our education just fine.  In much of the world, including Canada, but especially the US, education has increased exponentially in price, but that was not so much the fault of a generation of working class people as it was the fault of a broken tuition system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Housing prices can&amp;#39;t really be blamed on the Boomers either, at least exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The job market is only partly their fault, but it&amp;#39;s a corner they were backed into (nobody wants to starve to death if their pension runs dry and they live past 90).  Considering productivity and profits right now, blame the corporations instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve given up on pensions and social insurance at this point.
