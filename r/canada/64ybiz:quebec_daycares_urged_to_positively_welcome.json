I think more likely it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;preventative&amp;quot; measure. But the school is really big into teaching about respecting personal space, it&amp;#39;s hard to argue without looking like an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem from my perspective these days is there&amp;#39;s no room for nuance. We can all agree physical bullying is bad, but how do you tell if a kid is physically bullying another?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the time I was bullied in school it wasn&amp;#39;t an obvious fist fight, and it was never one obvious incident. It was more like you were in gym class playing basketball and some other kid would biffs the ball at the back of your head when the teacher wasn&amp;#39;t looking, then it was, &amp;quot;oops, missed that pass. Sorry *whispers* loser.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tag policy is likely because you can&amp;#39;t tell if a kid is intentionally pushing another kid down on the playground to bully them or if it was actually an innocent game of tag. I also imagine the school administration is fucking terrified of getting in the paper because they didn&amp;#39;t do anything to prevent bullying. Imagine if a kid did get pushed down and some parent went to CBC about how the school is doing nothing to protect their precious angel. It&amp;#39;d be a lot easier for the school admin to say, &amp;quot;We have a zero tolerance physical contact policy to prevent bullying and the offender is being dealt with.&amp;quot;, than it would for them to go, &amp;quot;LOL, kids will be kids. They&amp;#39;re just having fun.&amp;quot;, CBC would have a friggn blast with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, it&amp;#39;s likely they&amp;#39;re more afraid of what &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; happen if they do nothing and something happens than anything that has/will actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg666sq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492045495.0, "created_utc": 1492016695.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg65777", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 33, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mrjinpengyou", "parent_id": "t1_dg62z04", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What the fuck.
