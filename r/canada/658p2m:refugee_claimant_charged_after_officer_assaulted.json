I've traveled to multiple continents and developed an appreciation for different cultures. I've hosted foreign tourists and love interacting with them. \n\nDoesn't mean I have a grain of sympathy for border hopping \"refugees\" from the USA. My parents and my friends made it here from all over the world, often making huge sacrifices in the process, and never broke any laws. Yes some of them did rely on government handouts when they arrived but put in every effort to stop depending on those handouts as soon as they could. \n\nI sympathize with the Hispanics hopping into the USA, because those guys are going under the radar and often immediately get to work doing hard labor that Americans don't want to do, and 99% of them don't dare to commit further crimes or even report crimes against themselves because that would expose them. \n\nThe border hoppers from the USA to Canada immediately present themselves to authorities and apply for asylum, which suggests that they just want to freeload. This has to stop. If American citizens do it, they go to jail and then get sent home and banned from re-entry. Why can't we do it to these border hoppers? I'd be LESS offended if the border hoppers immediately headed for the nearest city and started living under the radar, working odd jobs for cash.\n\nThese actions also reflect incredible ignorance/stupidity on the part of the border hoppers. If you already have asylum status in the US, you're safe as long as you don't commit crimes. If Donald Trump were to attempt to deport all of them without cause (which is constitutionally illegal if they already have legal asylum status), the backlash would be strong enough to cause a civil war if he didn't back down - even many Republicans would chew him out, so don't be so fucking paranoid. Come on man, two of Trump's travel bans in a row were struck down - doesn't that suggest anything? Even with illegal immigrants, deportation is a long drawn out process - that should be another sign. If they really want to move to Canada so badly, fucking apply under the skilled worker system - oh wait maybe they don't qualify? Or be brave enough to go home and then legally apply for asylum in Canada?\n\nI voted for Trudeau even though I was kinda leaning towards Conservative because I was offended by Harper's attempt to make the niqab an election issue (and I'm not even Muslim).

", "edited": 1492147001.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents are immigrants, grew up in Toronto so many of my best friends are immigrants of all ethnicities, including Vietnamese and Iranian refugees. I&amp;#39;ve traveled to multiple continents and developed an appreciation for different cultures. I&amp;#39;ve hosted foreign tourists and love interacting with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t mean I have a grain of sympathy for border hopping &amp;quot;refugees&amp;quot; from the USA. My parents and my friends made it here from all over the world, often making huge sacrifices in the process, and never broke any laws. Yes some of them did rely on government handouts when they arrived but put in every effort to stop depending on those handouts as soon as they could. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sympathize with the Hispanics hopping into the USA, because those guys are going under the radar and often immediately get to work doing hard labor that Americans don&amp;#39;t want to do, and 99% of them don&amp;#39;t dare to commit further crimes or even report crimes against themselves because that would expose them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The border hoppers from the USA to Canada immediately present themselves to authorities and apply for asylum, which suggests that they just want to freeload. This has to stop. If American citizens do it, they go to jail and then get sent home and banned from re-entry. Why can&amp;#39;t we do it to these border hoppers? I&amp;#39;d be LESS offended if the border hoppers immediately headed for the nearest city and started living under the radar, working odd jobs for cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These actions also reflect incredible ignorance/stupidity on the part of the border hoppers. If you already have asylum status in the US, you&amp;#39;re safe as long as you don&amp;#39;t commit crimes. If Donald Trump were to attempt to deport all of them without cause (which is constitutionally illegal if they already have legal asylum status), the backlash would be strong enough to cause a civil war if he didn&amp;#39;t back down - even many Republicans would chew him out, so don&amp;#39;t be so fucking paranoid. Come on man, two of Trump&amp;#39;s travel bans in a row were struck down - doesn&amp;#39;t that suggest anything? Even with illegal immigrants, deportation is a long drawn out process - that should be another sign. If they really want to move to Canada so badly, fucking apply under the skilled worker system - oh wait maybe they don&amp;#39;t qualify? Or be brave enough to go home and then legally apply for asylum in Canada?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I voted for Trudeau even though I was kinda leaning towards Conservative because I was offended by Harper&amp;#39;s attempt to make the niqab an election issue (and I&amp;#39;m not even Muslim). Looks like I will have to change my vote in 2019 if the Liberals continue to condone this shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg8seol", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492174926.0, "created_utc": 1492146126.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658p2m", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658p2m", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658p2m", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658p2m", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8nkca", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dogribb", "parent_id": "t1_dg8le0m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Strong work comrades", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong work comrades&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg8nkca", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492167010.0, "created_utc": 1492138210.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8le0m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CCCP_OK", "parent_id": "t1_dg8fgdl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "IS GOOD SOLUTION!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;IS GOOD SOLUTION!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg8le0m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492163906.0, "created_utc": 1492135106.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658p2m", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8jpcm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mrcrazy_monkey", "parent_id": "t1_dg8fgdl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Easy there Stalin", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy there Stalin&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg8jpcm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492161584.0, "created_utc": 1492132784.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658p2m", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8rcum", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zee-wolf", "parent_id": "t1_dg8fgdl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Damn.
