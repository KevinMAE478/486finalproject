It's assumed that you've been exposed to more different types of problems in 10 years than you have in 3, but the guy who has 3 years across 3 different positions/companies/products may have more experience than the person who spent 10 years working with one position/company/product.  What's more important is the scope, scale, and diversity of the problems you've had to solve with the language.  You can't figure that out with a job posting, but you can with an interview. \n\nOne big thing that isn't considered is how fast the industry changes and how different a .NET program from 10 years ago looks like today.  Ten years ago if you wanted to build a web application with .NET, you were using ASP.NET WebForms.  You were designing/styling/dynamicizing all of your pages in XAML with C# in the backend.  Your application architecture was likely page-driven, and you were likely binding a lot of your code to events like Page_Load(), Page_Refresh(), etc.  If you were \"cutting edge\" you had a ScriptManager that was allowing you to perform AJAX requests and creating a \"flicker-free browsing experience\".  You were probably creating SqlConnection() objects everywhere in the backend, and if you needed multithreading or asynchronicity you were creating ThreadPools and BackgroundWorkers.\n\nToday if you're writing a web application in .NET you're probably using ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET WebAPI, meaning you're creating C# controllers that send/receive JSON data, or mabe Views, but let's be honest you're feeding JSON into your front-end, which could be anything but is likely some Javascript framework like React or Angular with CSS3, or maybe even a CSS preprocessor.  Your application is likely far less page-driven and far more entity and action-driven, which lends itself better to the multitude of AJAX-style requests you're making to the server to dynamically load data. You're probably using an ORM in the background, maybe Entity Framework or NHibernate or some other cool framework you found off Nuget, and if you need asynchronicity or multithreading you're using asynchronous methods and the task parallel library.\n\nNow, if you spent the last 10 years doing things the old way and have no idea what the hell is going on in the second paragraph, then congratulations!  Your 10 years of experience are almost useless and you have a lot of catching up to do.  Realistically though if your fundamentals are good you can learn the new stuff, which is what a lot of good tech companies try to test you on in technical interviews.

It&amp;#39;s assumed that you&amp;#39;ve been exposed to more different types of problems in 10 years than you have in 3, but the guy who has 3 years across 3 different positions/companies/products may have more experience than the person who spent 10 years working with one position/company/product.  What&amp;#39;s more important is the scope, scale, and diversity of the problems you&amp;#39;ve had to solve with the language.  You can&amp;#39;t figure that out with a job posting, but you can with an interview. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One big thing that isn&amp;#39;t considered is how fast the industry changes and how different a .NET program from 10 years ago looks like today.  Ten years ago if you wanted to build a web application with .NET, you were using ASP.NET WebForms.  You were designing/styling/dynamicizing all of your pages in XAML with C# in the backend.  Your application architecture was likely page-driven, and you were likely binding a lot of your code to events like Page_Load(), Page_Refresh(), etc.  If you were &amp;quot;cutting edge&amp;quot; you had a ScriptManager that was allowing you to perform AJAX requests and creating a &amp;quot;flicker-free browsing experience&amp;quot;.  You were probably creating SqlConnection() objects everywhere in the backend, and if you needed multithreading or asynchronicity you were creating ThreadPools and BackgroundWorkers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today if you&amp;#39;re writing a web application in .NET you&amp;#39;re probably using ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET WebAPI, meaning you&amp;#39;re creating C# controllers that send/receive JSON data, or mabe Views, but let&amp;#39;s be honest you&amp;#39;re feeding JSON into your front-end, which could be anything but is likely some Javascript framework like React or Angular with CSS3, or maybe even a CSS preprocessor.  Your application is likely far less page-driven and far more entity and action-driven, which lends itself better to the multitude of AJAX-style requests you&amp;#39;re making to the server to dynamically load data. You&amp;#39;re probably using an ORM in the background, maybe Entity Framework or NHibernate or some other cool framework you found off Nuget, and if you need asynchronicity or multithreading you&amp;#39;re using asynchronous methods and the task parallel library.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if you spent the last 10 years doing things the old way and have no idea what the hell is going on in the second paragraph, then congratulations!  Your 10 years of experience are almost useless and you have a lot of catching up to do.  Realistically though if your fundamentals are good you can learn the new stuff, which is what a lot of good tech companies try to test you on in technical interviews. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg89jv8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492148041.0, "created_utc": 1492119241.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6563op", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7wa9j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MatthewFabb", "parent_id": "t1_dg7v7cp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yup.

Some IT types get a little too caught up in the &amp;quot;sex appeal&amp;quot; of prospective employers. Like if its not google or facebook or apple, or its not some new &amp;quot;innovative&amp;quot; startup doing new things, then it isn&amp;#39;t shit. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvfU1NpCJQQ\"&gt;I actually loved that commercial General Electric did that kind of poked fun at this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The work I do is decidedly &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;-sexy  - mostly internal applications for a manufacturing company. No one outside my company will ever know or care about the work I do... hell, most people inside the company don&amp;#39;t either. But it&amp;#39;s still vital, and not a lot of people know how to do it, so it pays well, even if it isn&amp;#39;t glamorous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say it can&amp;#39;t be hard for younger people to get their foot in the door.
