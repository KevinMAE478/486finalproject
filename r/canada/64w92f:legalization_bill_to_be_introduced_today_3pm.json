So you keep your fermentation barrels going until the next time the still shows up in town, then you bring &amp;#39;em on down and the guy distills it all for you for a nominal price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Creates a business for him, makes safe booze for you, and gives the government a cut via licensing/taxes/etc. Everyone&amp;#39;s happy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;a href=\"https://www.eav.admin.ch/eav/en/home/themen/herstellung-von-spirituosen.html\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a more official source about this subject.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dg698lv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492048562.0, "created_utc": 1492019762.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg67d3t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Justredditin", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ri1a", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Precisely.

Look into how \"The Beer Store\" operates in Ontario.\n\nYou can buy singles and six-packs at the LCBO, but The Beer Store has a government-supported monopoly on sales of beer in packages larger than 6. It also has a government-supported monopoly on sales/distribution of beer to restaurants, bars, etc.\n\nIt's a company owned and operated by three massive *non*-Canadian breweries, AB Inbev, Molson-Coors, and Sapporo.\n\nOne of the shitty things they do is to make it *extremely* difficult for small brewers (your \"craft brewers\") to get their beers on the shelf.\n\nHere's an example. Let's say you start up \"CST400 Beers Inc.\", and you make *one* kind of beer. Chances are, since you're a craft brewer, it's an IPA. Doesn't matter though, you only make the one beer.\n\nLet's say you want to sell it in six packs of cans, six of bottles, twelve of cans, and twelve of bottles.\n\nIn order to get on The Beer Store's shelves, you have to pay *four* listing fees, once for *each type of packaging you want to sell*. Of one kind of beer. This fee covers the *staggering* expense and effort of...plugging some information into the store database.\n\nThen, you have to pay a \"stocking fee\" for each of these four products, *for each and every Beer Store you want them sold in*. So you want to put all four on the shelf in *one store* in your hometown? Four fees to list, then four to stock. Now you want to put all four on the shelves in the other Beer Store across town? You already paid to list, but now you pay all four \"stocking fees\" all over again for that new store.\n\nThen, once your beers *are* being sold, you owe The Beer Store an *additional* fee for *each and every unit sold*.\n\nAlso, you know they'll put your beer at the very tippy-top of the \"choice board\", with only that tiny little label there to advertise the wares you have on offer. It's obscure, hard to read, people aren't spending all day staring at labels and taking chances on new beers, *plus* your price is higher than the pisswater brands because you don't own the Beer Store so you've gotta pay them to carry it.\n\nThere's also the bullshit way they handle sales to restaurants/bars. Let's say \"CST400 Beers Inc.\" is right across the street from \"Bill's Tavern\", and Bill is pretty stoked to sell CST400 IPA in his tavern. Well, what ends up happening is that instead of walking across the street to arrange the sale, Bill has to call The Beer Store to place an order, The Beer Store orders from the brewer, the keg gets picked up from the brewery and shipped to a Beer Store warehouse, then it gets shipped out from there to Bill's tavern. It's insane. The Beer Store is a government-sanctioned useless middleman.\n\nAnyway, **TL;DR: At least in Ontario, \"they'll do weed the way they do craft beer\" would actually be a *really* bad thing. Not because the beer is bad, but because the system set up to sell and distribute it is insane and hugely advantages the big (foreign!) players.**", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you are drawing a parallel to the state of alcohol sales in Canada, so I&amp;#39;d like to remind you there is something called craft beer which is produced and sold be small companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that this example in particular kinda reinforces the worry expressed above.
