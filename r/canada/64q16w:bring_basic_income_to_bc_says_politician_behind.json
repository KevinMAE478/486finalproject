Capitalism has set a bleak stage for a massive amount of young people struggling to find their place in the world, and it's only going to get worse without wealth distribution. Struggling and suffering in heavily exploited and oppressed societies need to be addressed by society as a hole. We have pretty much accepted that social isolation, lack of direction, and poverty are a necessary part of life.\n\nScenario B: We give the person enough so they can comfortably eat and live.

Wealth redistribution also unincentivizes corporates that function soley on profit margins. Their needs to be some artificial system to increasingly block profits from a corporation. Then, incredibly brilliant CEOs would thrive not by turn-key exploitation, but by effective work environments aligned with values and actions which resonate with your employees. Then the ultra rich and powerful would get that way through innovation and providing legitimate value to the society you operate within, not simply taking from others and pretending it was a result of your wit and charisma. \n\nThe fact of the matter is capitalism has gone way too far and no wonder we have such huge widespread societal problems. I can't just go fishing for my food or build my own shelter because the guys that did it before me ruined these realities for individuals through greed and callousness.
