The result of a test on an approved screening device would not, by itself, lead to a charge. It would lead only to further investigation, including a test on an approved instrument at the police station.\n\nDrug-impaired driving offences \n\nThe legislation would also create three new offences for having specified levels of a drug in the blood within two hours of driving. The penalties would depend on the drug type and the levels of drug or the combination of alcohol and drugs. These elements were included in the proposed legislation after careful consideration of the available scientific evidence on cannabis and driving. The levels would be set by regulation. For THC (the main psychoactive compound in cannabis), the proposed levels would be: 2 nanograms (ng) but less than 5 ng of THC: Having at least 2 ng but less than 5 ng of THC per millilitre (ml) of blood within two hours of driving would be a separate summary conviction criminal offence, punishable only by a fine. This lower level offence is a precautionary approach that takes into account the best available scientific evidence related to cannabis. This offence would be punishable by a maximum fine of up to $1,000. 5 ng or more of THC: Having 5 ng or more of THC per ml of blood within two hours of driving would be a hybrid offence. Hybrid offences are offences that can be prosecuted either by indictment, in more serious cases, or by summary conviction, in less serious cases. Combined THC and Alcohol: Having a blood alcohol concentration of 50 milligrams (mg) of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, combined with a THC level greater than 2.5 ng per ml of blood within two hours of driving would also be a hybrid offence. Both hybrid offences would be punishable by mandatory penalties of $1,000 for a first offence and escalating penalties for repeat offenders (e.g., 30 days imprisonment on a second offence and 120 days on a third or subsequent offence). The maximum penalties would mirror the existing maximum penalties for impaired driving. These would be increased in Part 2 to two years less a day on summary conviction (up from 18 months), and to 10 years on indictment (up from 5 years). The latter would make a dangerous offender application possible in appropriate circumstances.\n\nhttp://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=8894959\n\nSection 86\n\nPower to enter\n\n86 (1) Subject to subsection (7), an inspector may, for a purpose related to verifying compliance or preventing non-compliance with the provisions of this Act or of the regulations, enter any place, including a conveyance, in which they believe on reasonable grounds (a) an activity that may be regulated under this Act is being conducted;

An effective method of controlling drug distribution would be to have a licensing and registration system for all marijuana plants and marijuana users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A marijuana possession and acquisition licence (PAL) could be acquired by vetted citizens, only after background checks, reference checks, investigations into past relationships and mental health. Like gun owners, they could pay hundreds of dollars to take a multiple day long safety course, allow their homes to be inspected without warrant, and of course, if their licence expires, they would be criminally charged for illegal possession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like firearms, it would also be very helpful to register each marijuana plant, to ensure that legally licensed purchasers are not selling it to unlicensed people. A government system that classifies different plants based on the amount of THC it contained, or arbitrarily on its appearance is a proven system with firearms, so should be applied to marijuana too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Paper licences to control where they can use their marijuana would be equally effective as the ATT system used for firearms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dgcxeya", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492422548.0, "created_utc": 1492393748.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcmz8s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iTzDusty", "parent_id": "t1_dgclr8r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Its funny, no one cared about people losing rights under the Firearms Act, but now that its applied to weed, oh boy here we go.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its funny, no one cared about people losing rights under the Firearms Act, but now that its applied to weed, oh boy here we go.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "canada", "name": "t1_dgcmz8s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492408507.0, "created_utc": 1492379707.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgclr8r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MadFistJack", "parent_id": "t1_dgc1l3s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/canada", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah thats kinda their M.O. get people with no functional knowledge of the issue in a room with anti-think of the children-groups and get them to write laws that are so ambiguous, vague, and restrictive that they mostly discourage people from using it and that the actual law ends up being a rag tag collection of piecemeal court decisions.

This is the section on impaired driving.\n\nFor THC (the main psychoactive compound in cannabis), the proposed levels would be: 2 nanograms (ng) but less than 5 ng of THC: Having at least 2 ng but less than 5 ng of THC per millilitre (ml) of blood within two hours of driving would be a separate summary conviction criminal offence, punishable only by a fine. This lower level offence is a precautionary approach that takes into account the best available scientific evidence related to cannabis. This offence would be punishable by a maximum fine of up to $1,000. 5 ng or more of THC: Having 5 ng or more of THC per ml of blood within two hours of driving would be a hybrid offence. Hybrid offences are offences that can be prosecuted either by indictment, in more serious cases, or by summary conviction, in less serious cases. Combined THC and Alcohol: Having a blood alcohol concentration of 50 milligrams (mg) of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, combined with a THC level greater than 2.5 ng per ml of blood within two hours of driving would also be a hybrid offence. Both hybrid offences would be punishable by mandatory penalties of $1,000 for a first offence and escalating penalties for repeat offenders (e.g., 30 days imprisonment on a second offence and 120 days on a third or subsequent offence). The maximum penalties would mirror the existing maximum penalties for impaired driving. These would be increased in Part 2 to two years less a day on summary conviction (up from 18 months), and to 10 years on indictment (up from 5 years). The latter would make a dangerous offender application possible in appropriate circumstances.\n\nhttp://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=8894959\n\nClearly states: 5ng while driving is considered a hybrid offence.\n\nRepeat offenders will get more and more time.\n\nSmoke weed for seizures and drive to work?
