JT was there when it began, and here he remains, one of the last connections to that former Chelsea. Super stars and unimaginable wealth came to the club, and he remained throughout it all, becoming a super star himself, arguably the best defender in Europe in his prime.

His passion for the club means so much to the fans because he loves the club in the way that only a fan does - he loves Chelsea like we do. I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that never again will we see a player at Stamford Bridge who combines such passion for and understanding of the club with the staggering scale of on-field achievement that John Terry has.

Chelsea winning the Champions League in 2012 was redemption for Moscow, but not as I'd fantasised it, with JT suspended and missing out on the night. It wasn't quite perfect, but football fans are always chasing fairytales - we all dream of those incredible endings and perfect resolutions - and the reality is that football doesn't ever work out like that, nothing can be as perfect as we dream of it. We accept compromises of perfect dreams. Leicester had their own fairytale, but Ranieri's sacking shows how even that couldn't be sustained. So little is permanent in football, the game is too dynamic.
