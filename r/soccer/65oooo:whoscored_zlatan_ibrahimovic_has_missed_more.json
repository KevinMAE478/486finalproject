Ibra has been good this season but he hasn't been decisive enough in key moments. At the start of the season especially he was missing sitter after sitter. More often than not he fails to challenge the keeper also - this is where the \"keeper always has a worldie against us\" comes from, more often than not they don't. They are simply making multiple saves that they'd be slaughtered for if they hadn't saved it. \n\nI'd like to keep him on, overall he has been a big influence on the team and with the way we play, he offers far more than just goals. However we'd be top four if he had been more decisive at times. Same goes for Pogba.
