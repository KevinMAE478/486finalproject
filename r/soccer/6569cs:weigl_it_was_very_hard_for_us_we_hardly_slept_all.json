Hardly comparable to this but yes, second worst performance for me lol. \n\nThough the thing about G\u00f6tze is, he has all the defensive capabilities and stability needed. Against Bayern he played extremely well defensively for example, he knows how to defend, especially since against Bayern Dortmund sat deeper with less pressing and less movement in general, defending in their own half rather than pressing in Bayern's. He proved to be the perfect G\u00fcndogan replacement in that game also with an assist, but his general issue still was his lack of mobility. \n\nDortmund, outside of that particular Bayern game, play a high tempo style with high intensity where the goal is to instantly overload and press the moment the ball is lost. It has been like that since the Klopp days. But G\u00f6tze couldn't keep up with the pressing, he always was sluggish and slow, didn't get into the right positions quick enough, which lead to gaps in the midfield, which lead to a lack of general midfield presence, which lead to easy counters and the Dortmund's defense being overrun again and again. In that regard G\u00f6tze was a major liability in why Dortmund suffered so much defensively, nevermind he always was out of fuel after about 50 to 60 minutes too. Point being, he can defend if Dortmund sit deeper like against Bayern, but not if Dortmund play their high press against the other teams, he can't keep up then because of his health issues. But without that injury, if he can keep up with the mobility and intensity needed, he'd be absolutely crucial both defensively and offensively next to Weigl.\n\nAnd yea I caught that Tuchel interview as well if you're referring to the post match interview. But I think the own goal and lack of fitness may have played a part as well, because up until that point Bender was heads and shoulders ahead of Sokratis in terms of defending. Or maybe Tuchel didn't want to risk experiments since Pischu and Sokratis played much more this season, but to me taking Pischu or Sokratis off and leaving Bender on would have been better imo. Even just based on the first 45 minutes.\n\nI'm not sure if you remember the second Benfica game for instance, but that game for about the first 30 minutes Dortmund played extremely well with their press.

A 2:0 victory would not have been undeserved at all, and could have been higher if Dortmund players hadn't been marginally offside several times, or Monaco defenders hadn't managed to scramble to a slide tackle clearance in the last moment a dozen times. \n\nIf Dortmund hit a good day next week, and if Reus can return similarly strong as he did after the first injury, and if Bender and Castro can play as well, I absolutely can see Dortmund crushing Monaco even in their own stadium.

They have played in the biggest games before and know how to deal with the pressure, being able to instill confidence, personality and leadership in the dressing room. As for Sahin, he has been injured a lot, and there have been plenty times where he would have been a good improvement to Weigl who in this season massively suffered from G\u00fcndogan's absence. \n\nAs for Bender, I agree, he actually played surprisingly well both before and after his mistake. I'm not sure why he was subbed, either a mental issue or a lack of fitness or an injury, but he did play a good first half. However, only defensively. Offensively he does simply not offer the same build up Bartra would have offered. With Bartra the game would have had an entirely different complexity. \n\nNow as for G\u00f6tze, I massively disagree here. For me G\u00f6tze is one of the most important players. The reason for that is because he can fill the G\u00fcndogan role the best of any player in the squad, his ball control, technical ability and passing ability leads to great control and dominance in the midfield. His downside was what eventually turned out to the be his health issues, a lack of intensity and pace. He always looked sluggish and slow compared to everybody around him. Without that he'd already be an undisputed starter in the midfield. \n\nAlso, Durm was massively important during Dortmund's best spell this season. An utterly selfless player who frequently racked up the highest km numbers every game. He ran and ran and ran all over the pitch, covering Dembele wherever he went, allowing Dembele to focus on his attacking responsibilities and giving him much greater freedom. If not Durm Sch\u00fc can play that role as well as he did against Wolfsburg. But both were injured, and neither Passlack nor Ginter are close to that intensity or level. Durm is the engine behind Dembele who allows him to shine. \n\nKagawa has been on fire ever since he got playing time this season, and Pulisic, well, Pulisic had great actions. However, this is down to two primary reasons. The first being the Monaco defender simply not being able to keep up with his explosiveness. The second was Sahin who played a great 6, which lead to Weigl who played on Puli's side, to push further up. That resulted in Monaco's 4-4-2 having to press him, which in turn opened up space for Puli to exploit. While it's true that Pulisic took great advantage of that, the main reason to even enable him was Sahin's presence allowing Weigl more forward freedom. \n\nAll the same, in the first half Dortmund played without their usual intensity, they didn't even begin to get into pressing and overload situations. Usually Dortmund is instantly on top of the opposition when losing a ball, pressing from three different directions and winning the ball back high up the pitch.

Bayern can let a quiter player like Lahm be the captain because their team is full of seasoned veterans who love mentoring young players.

Only Piszczek&amp;#39;s concentration started to come apart at the seams which costed us 1 goal while scoring 2 solid goals after a lot of pressure in Monaco&amp;#39;s second half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make a completely unnecessary estimation of how things would&amp;#39;ve gone without the incident: less individual mistakes and lapses of concentration would save most attacks by monaco but they probably would still be able to score 1  and Dortmund would score 2 if things started of slow and up to 4 if the entire game went like the second half.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "soccer", "name": "t1_dg85oqg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492143555.0, "created_utc": 1492114755.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg83885", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kamiki01", "parent_id": "t1_dg826bl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/soccer", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you say so.

In both halves of the season key players are permanently injured. Reus, G\u00f6tze, Sch\u00fc, Bender, Sahin, Rode, Guerreiro, Durm all have had lengthy spells out while Castro, Schmelle, Sokratis, Bartra, Ginter and B\u00fcrki all continue to be out on and off as well.

Without those Dortmund has a squad of players that, while experienced, aren't natural leaders. Castro, Schmelzer, Pischu, Sokratis all are more quiet personalities, which only leaves Auba and Reus as true leaders and of those Reus is gone and Auba has to rely on service without being able to impact the game himself from a deeper playmaking position. That leaves Dortmund short of direction especially in midfield and defense, moreso when playing against perceived smaller and low table teams who play more based around aggression, with which the young and inexperienced players can't deal that well, leading to a lot of points having been dropped against the likes of Frankfurt, Augsburg, Ingolstadt, Hertha or Darmstadt. It's a lack of consistency that cost Dortmund this season, and that consistency stems from the youth players like Dembele, Puli, Guerreiro, Weigl or Ginter being unable to maintain a consistent level.\n\nAlso, Pulisic did not step up massively, much less in the Bundesliga considering he had his best performances in the CL. He follows the same pattern every time with the second leg game against Benfica being the exception. If he starts he's invisible, but when he gets subbed in he has two or three good scenes.
