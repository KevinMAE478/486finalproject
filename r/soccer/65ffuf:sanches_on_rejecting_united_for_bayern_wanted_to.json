Edit: wow, why am i getting downvoted for this statement? Bayern clearly has the better players on sanches position. United may have pogba, but he&amp;#39;s also still young. Players like Herrera or fellaini or in the summer Schneiderin don&amp;#39;t match up with the likes of vidal, thiago or xabi Alonso. The Bayern midfielders all have more experience on a higher level and could definitely be considered world class unlike those from man utd.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "soccer", "name": "t1_dg9t0xm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492235189.0, "created_utc": 1492206389.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ffuf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgab4yk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "goodguy1994", "parent_id": "t3_65ffuf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/soccer", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm happy for you Renato.
