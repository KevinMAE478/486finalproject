But apparently you,Merkel, don't care about your little filthy subjects. Your Tornadoes*(they mean Panavia Tornado reconnaissance planes)*  still fly above the ground of the caliphate to assassinate Muslims. However, we remain steadfast by the grace of Allah.\n\n&gt;From now on, all the disbelieving actors, singers, athletes and all prominent figures in Germany and other crusaider nations are on the death list of the Islamic state.\n\n&gt;And so long as the following requirements are not fulfilled: Remove tornadoes from Syria. Ramstein Air Base must be closed.\n\n* The one from the left-wing group states:\n\n&gt; Today we attacked BVB's bus with specially designed explosives. The bus is a symbol of the BVB's policy, which does not work adequately against racists, Nazis and the right-wing populist. On the contrary, for many years now, humans with a despicable misanthropic attitude  are allowed to enter the stadium -  instead of consulting  local antifascists, to banish such ideology from the stadium.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bus was only a symbol and the players were not the target of this symbolic act, but they too did not do enough in the past for an antifascist stadium scene.\n&gt; \n&gt; No ground to the Fascist!\n&gt; Antifa means attack!\n&gt; Die Germany! \n&gt; \n\nI'd like to remind you that the german police as well as the german state attorney both are highly suspicious that the letter from the left-wing group is real.\n\nEdit7: According to multiple news outlets the arrested suspect is 25year old Iraqi. Another suspect is a 28year old German, both said to have connections or are associated with the Islamic State terror group.\n\nEdit8: BVB Boss Watzke visited Marc Bartra in the hospital and states that he is well given the circumstances, will watch the match today on TV.\n\nEdit9: Marc Bartra's dad on his son's injuries and current condition:\n\n&gt; Marc is doing well, only his head is throbbing.. He told us to stay calm because everything will be fine. The first thing he heard was a loud bang. At first his head hurt, then his arm. He did not know what was going on. Because of the bang we was dizzy for about 5 minutes (..) He did not know exactly what had happened. Someone told them to lie down on the floor.

The team from Borussia Dortmund was on their way to the stadium. Three detonators were exploded as the bus passed Wittbr\u00e4uckerstra\u00dfe 563. The bombs were placed behind a hedge.  \n\n&gt; The detonation severely damaged the team bus. One of the occupants suffered a serious injury on his arm through a broken window pane. The bombs were equipped with metal pins. One metal pin was found lodged into the headrest of a bus seat. The explosions impacted more than 100 meters. The question of how the bomb was ignited and the type of explosive that was used is currently the subject of criminal investigations.\n\n&gt; Due to the circumstances of the crime, the attack is being investigated as a terrorist attack.

It&amp;#39;s depressing to jump to these conclusions but violence against football and its fans will continue to rise and we are really lucky that yesterday wasn&amp;#39;t a catastrophe. I&amp;#39;m not sure what point I&amp;#39;m trying to make but we as fans of the sport and citizens of the world have to place more accountability on the actors behind these attacks. Claiming it was a big firework was a really weak way to rationalize this situation. What happened yesterday is not normal! And we must keep that in mind because this will, unfortunately, not be the last time we face situations like these either at the football stadium, in the subway of St. Petersburg or in the markets of Sweden. These are attacks on our culture, our way of life, you must imagine that in any one of these attacks it could have been you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "soccer", "name": "t1_dg60gea", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492039394.0, "created_utc": 1492010594.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xqn7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5x77k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Darylwilllive4evr", "parent_id": "t3_64xqn7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/soccer", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Awful and doesn't even make sense.
