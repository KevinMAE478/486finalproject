It never explicitly says that Ronaldo is innocent, they just spin it in a way that he has know clue about what they are talking about and that he never recieved anything.\n\nEdit2: if you read the original article from Spiegel everything Gestifute writes makes sense in the context of the settlement and their story.\n\nGestifute writes:\n\n&gt;The alleged victim **refuses to come forward and confirm** the veracity of the accusation.\n\nFrom the Spiegel article:\n\n&gt; According to this agreement, which contains eleven clauses, **Susan K. agrees to keep silent** about what has happened in the bedroom. It commits itself to abandon all allegations of accusation. Ronaldo must pay her $ 375,000.\n\n\n&gt;(...)\n\n&gt; **According to this agreement, which contains eleven clauses, Susan K. agrees to keep silent about what has happened in the bedroom**\n\n&gt; (...)\n\n&gt;Clause 11 states: \"Ms. P will assure that it has irrevocably destroyed all electronic and written records resulting from the alleged act.\"\n\n\n&gt;(...)\n\n&gt;**If she violates the agreements, she must repay the money. Should Ronaldo be harmed by an indiscretion, she would have to pay for it.**\n\n&gt;(...)\n\n&gt;The agreement with Ronaldo stipulates in clause 4 what she has to do when she is approached by third parties about the events in June 2009. She has to say \"nothing to say\" about it. If she were to be addressed on the street, she had to \"move along\".\n\nSo she can't come forward and speak or she will have to payback the money she got from the settlement.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGestifute also states:\n\n&gt;  The newspaper has based their entire narrative on documents which are **unsigned** and where the parties are **not identified**, on emails between lawyers whose content does not concern Cristiano Ronaldo and whose authenticity he cannot verify, and on an alleged letter that is said to have been sent to him by the so-called victim, but was **never received by Cristiano.**\n\nFrom the Spiegel article:\n\n&gt; In the document Susan K. has the abbreviation \"Ms. P\", Ronaldo is \"Mr. D\".\n&gt; \n&gt; (...)\n&gt; \n&gt; The agreement was signed on 12 January 2010. From Susan K., from several lawyers.** Cristiano Ronaldo did not sign personally. For him, his Portuguese lawyer,** Carlos Os\u00f3rio de Castro, who has been regulating the legal rights of the footballer for years, **signed**.\n&gt; \n&gt; (...)\n&gt; \n&gt; On January 12, 2010, the parties met. The mediator was also **present. Ronaldo wasn't.**\n&gt; \n&gt; (...)\n&gt; \n&gt; Ronaldo's troops are anxious to exclude any possibility of secret betrayal. This is also the question, for example, of how K. could tax the agreement sum. If she did not, the lawyers would be afraid that the US tax authority would be interested in the money money on her account, and K. would have to explain where she had received the money form. Ronaldo's lawyers discussed sending the $ 375,000 from a company , which normally sells the commercials for Ronaldo: Multisports &amp; Image Management, registered in the European tax haven of Ireland. On July 31, Os\u00f3rio de Castro finally gave the green light to the agreement negotiated by the US attorneys.\n&gt; \n&gt; (...)\n&gt; \n&gt; The letter that Susan K. wrote to Ronaldo is also a component of the out-of-court agreement. Clause 10 states that **the letter must be read to Ronaldo, by his lawyer, Os\u00f3rio de Castro.**\n\nSo Gestifute also, more or less, \"confirms\" the Spiegel article because Ronaldo never was present,never signed personally and never personally received said letter.\n\nEdit3: So i'm not saying Ronaldo did or did not do what the woman claims but the settlement and everything seems to have happened the way it was described by Der Spiegel.\n\nEdit4: Seems like a lot of people in this thread didn't read the article by Spiegel and assume Spiegel is accusing him of raping her. They don't. They are just reporting on the settlement and are retelling her version of the events.\n\nSo,if you didn\u2019t read the article here is a short summary from the original reddit thread about the article:\n\n&gt; TL;DR from the article:\n&gt;  \n&gt; \u2022\tRonaldo paid 375,000 usd to a woman who accused him of sexual assault.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2022\tThis happened the morning of June 13, 2009 in Vegas.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2022\tThe woman reported the alleged assault to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police the same day. She didn't provide a name but she spoke of a \"public figure\" and an \"athlete\".\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2022\tBoth parts reached an agreement seven months later before an intermediary (mediator?) of the state of Nevada.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2022\tCarlos Osorio, his lawyer, signed the agreement.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2022\tIn the agreement Ronaldo is referred as Mr. D and the woman as Ms. P.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2022\tThe woman, in her twenties, agreed to drop all the charges against him and to give him the names of all the people she had talked.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2022\tThe woman also agreed to destroy any electronic or written material generated or received as a result of the case.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2022\tThe agreement specified that the woman could write a letter to Ronaldo.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2022\tDer Spiegel has also had access to that letter, in which she describes in detail her view of the alleged rape.\n\nThe article also included a scanned part of the settlement agreement: http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-1130091-galleryV9-tdnb-1130091.jpg\n\nAnd this part from the article shows that there are police records:\n\n&gt; It is confirmed that K. reported to the police on the day of the alleged attack, at 14.16 o'clock. There is a protocol that records the call to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. SPIEGEL is in possesion of said protocol. In the so-called CAD report, the case has a file number which later also finds itself in the settlement between K. and Ronaldo.In the CAD report, the reason for the call is listed in the category \"Type\": 426. The code for a reported sexual offense.The policeman, who is talking to K., notes that the caller is resolved, crying, and not giving the name of the alleged perpetrator. It was a \"public figure,\" an \"athlete\". \n\n\nHere is a bigger translation from one kind redditor, although he hasn\u2019t translated the last bit of the article yet:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/65div3/der_spiegel_claims_cristiano_ronaldo_agreed_to/dg9qmg7/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/65div3/der_spiegel_claims_cristiano_ronaldo_agreed_to/dg9uwrr/\n\n\nAnd here is the whole article translated via google translate, not the best English but it is readable:\nhttps://pastebin.com/zP9SDkzp", "edited": 1492211980.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;no way they are going to sue them. if they sue they have the burden of proof and that would probably mean that they have to make everything public - something they 100% aren&amp;#39;t willing to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is PR101 - talk about how everything is completely wrong and that you are about to sue so it seems like you are in the right.

She didn&amp;#39;t provide a name but she spoke of a &amp;quot;public figure&amp;quot; and an &amp;quot;athlete&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022   Both parts reached an agreement seven months later before an intermediary (mediator?) of the state of Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022   Carlos Osorio, his lawyer, signed the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022   In the agreement Ronaldo is referred as Mr. D and the woman as Ms. P.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022   The woman, in her twenties, agreed to drop all the charges against him and to give him the names of all the people she had talked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022   The woman also agreed to destroy any electronic or written material generated or received as a result of the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022   The agreement specified that the woman could write a letter to Ronaldo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022   Der Spiegel has also had access to that letter, in which she describes in detail her view of the alleged rape.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The article also included a scanned part of the settlement agreement: &lt;a href=\"http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-1130091-galleryV9-tdnb-1130091.jpg\"&gt;http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-1130091-galleryV9-tdnb-1130091.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this part from the article shows that there are police records:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is confirmed that K. reported to the police on the day of the alleged attack, at 14.16 o&amp;#39;clock. There is a protocol that records the call to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. SPIEGEL is in possesion of said protocol. In the so-called CAD report, the case has a file number which later also finds itself in the settlement between K. and Ronaldo.In the CAD report, the reason for the call is listed in the category &amp;quot;Type&amp;quot;: 426. The code for a reported sexual offense.The policeman, who is talking to K., notes that the caller is resolved, crying, and not giving the name of the alleged perpetrator. It was a &amp;quot;public figure,&amp;quot; an &amp;quot;athlete&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a bigger translation from one kind redditor, although he hasn\u2019t translated the last bit of the article yet:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/65div3/der_spiegel_claims_cristiano_ronaldo_agreed_to/dg9qmg7/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/65div3/der_spiegel_claims_cristiano_ronaldo_agreed_to/dg9qmg7/&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/65div3/der_spiegel_claims_cristiano_ronaldo_agreed_to/dg9uwrr/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/65div3/der_spiegel_claims_cristiano_ronaldo_agreed_to/dg9uwrr/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here is the whole article translated via google translate, not the best English but it is readable:\n&lt;a href=\"https://pastebin.com/zP9SDkzp\"&gt;https://pastebin.com/zP9SDkzp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "soccer", "name": "t1_dg9su17", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492234946.0, "created_utc": 1492206146.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 67}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ev1o", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ev1o", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9tvs0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 41, "report_reasons": null, "author": "msonix", "parent_id": "t1_dg9se3g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/soccer", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Only against Bayern.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only against Bayern.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "soccer", "name": "t1_dg9tvs0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492236299.0, "created_utc": 1492207499.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9se3g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 32, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bout_It_Bout_It", "parent_id": "t1_dg9oici", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/soccer", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Cristiano hasn't moved this fast for a season or two.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cristiano hasn&amp;#39;t moved this fast for a season or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "soccer", "name": "t1_dg9se3g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492234374.0, "created_utc": 1492205574.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ev1o", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga20i1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "groundeadph", "parent_id": "t1_dg9oici", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/soccer", "controversiality": 1, "body": "faster than blitzkrieg?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;faster than blitzkrieg?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "soccer", "name": "t1_dga20i1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492247137.0, "created_utc": 1492218337.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ev1o", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgad811", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Leijonhufvud", "parent_id": "t1_dg9oici", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/soccer", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, he kind of has to.
