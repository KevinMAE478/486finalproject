Chelsea changing to more of a 4-2-3-1 wasn\u2019t the solution either Costa still remained isolated and United were able to drop more bodies into midfield to protect the defence. They really needed a front 3 today to attempt to stretch the back 3 maybe going for a more mobile option up top in a front 3 would have faired better today. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rashford was brilliant today and his leading the line was far better than at West Brom, he didn\u2019t go towards the man on the ball too much cutting off any space for them to create and attempted to remain on the shoulder of the Chelsea defence, which he\u2019s best at. United used him effectively with early balls for him to run onto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man oritentated marking was a great decision from Mourinho and Herrera executed it perfectly, he was easily MoTM disrupted the whole Chelsea system.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "soccer", "name": "t1_dgc95zj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492390374.0, "created_utc": 1492361574.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2074}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q2mc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q2mc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc9v2d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 64, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bafa94", "parent_id": "t1_dgc95vb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/soccer", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[We coming.](http://www.spurscommunity.co.uk/index.php?attachments/img_0429-jpg.29461/)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.spurscommunity.co.uk/index.php?attachments/img_0429-jpg.29461/\"&gt;We coming.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "soccer", "name": "t1_dgc9v2d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492391256.0, "created_utc": 1492362456.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 64}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc95vb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 334, "report_reasons": null, "author": "The_B1ack_One", "parent_id": "t3_65q2mc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/soccer", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Hotspur send their regards", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hotspur send their regards&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "soccer", "name": "t1_dgc95vb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492390369.0, "created_utc": 1492361569.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 334}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q2mc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc96xe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 56, "report_reasons": null, "author": "scarlet0709", "parent_id": "t3_65q2mc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/soccer", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Man did Mourinho Mourinho'd hard there.

Didn't stop working and did so much. He desperately needs a midfield partner that will work as hard as him. Bakayoko would be the ideal player in the summer. People have been saying Hazard was poor but he was also solid today imo. Probably his best performance from a work rate point of view. His off ball movement was stellar. Outside of that, everyone was dreadful. I can't even say with a clear conscience that we didn't show up because that's been the textbook performance in the matches we lost aside from the loss to Palace. Press high and fast and you've essentially done half the work to beat us. Every time it happens we look shellshocked and don't know what to do. Conte clearly doesn't have the players he wants which is why, regardless whether we win the league or not, we need to get the right additions in the summer. David Luiz was fucking dreadful.... AGAIN.

He's not getting any better.\n\nIt may not have an effect on the title race but I can absolutely say we're NOT beating Spurs next week. They just repeat what United did and they can beat us 5-0. In fact, I may not even watch the match. It's going to be bad. We just need 4 wins from the remaining 6 matches so that's reason to feel confident if you're a Chelsea fan. I just hope this is a warning to the players. I'm not particularly fussed about Spurs catching simply because I remember sweating it out in 2010 when we only won the league over United by 1 point. Could be worse. \n\nAlso people can say Herrera MOTM, but that's Rashford for me. Don't know why United fans, or even Jose for that matter, would want Ibra to come back or even look at signing Lukaku if Ibra doesn't return. Rashford has the quality and is the best option in the long term. He can be just as good as Harry Kane. \n\nI'll hope for a surprise win over Spurs next week but it's on to Southampton. Just secure the league and you're golden. You can rest as Conte plays the kids for the remainder of the season. Just a woeful performance today. Worst performance since switching to a 3-4-3.
