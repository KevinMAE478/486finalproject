No, I guess my experience in life is just different from yours and that&amp;#39;s led me to take different precautions than my parents did. I came off sounding like a hypochondriac pussy? For taking precautions to protect my kids? That just makes you sound like a child with little experience with the real world and those who live in it. A fucking dickhead as well. I&amp;#39;ve worked for a dozen years as a 911 responder and don&amp;#39;t need to do any &amp;quot;research&amp;quot;. My life experiences at work are enough research for me. There&amp;#39;s really bad shit happening out there to people. From wealthy areas to the hood. And to me it seems to happen more frequently than even 10 years ago. I just can&amp;#39;t take the same liberties with my kids that my parents did with me. But that&amp;#39;s from my experiences, judging by the tone of your comment, your experiences (or lack of), are different than mine. Go ahead and check out Wikipedia from in your parents basement, leave a comment, tip your fedora, and take a sip of your dew and live your oblivious life to the world around you. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "name": "t1_dg70pze", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492080158.0, "created_utc": 1492051358.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6twlu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AKA-Destinova", "parent_id": "t1_dg6qwe9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Showerthoughts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Lmao everything you just said is a joke.
