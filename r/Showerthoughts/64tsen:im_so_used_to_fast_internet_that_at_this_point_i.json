Due to 5G operating in the millimeter wave spectrum the functional cell edge is vastly shorter than LTE (&amp;lt;1 mile compared to potentially 15+ miles for spectrum used for LTE). Unless the FCC greatly increases power limitations for broadcasts (won&amp;#39;t happen) or technology sees significant improvements 5G would need to be deployed on a 10x scale that LTE is. Thus, I think it will only be reserved to urban and suburban areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "name": "t1_dg62oqd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492041827.0, "created_utc": 1492013027.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg59kam", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 59, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HeliaxPrime", "parent_id": "t3_64tsen", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Showerthoughts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just wait until the 5G networks have expanded as large as 4G is CURRENTLY, up to 10Gb/s, and you'll wonder how you ever lived with LTE", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just wait until the 5G networks have expanded as large as 4G is CURRENTLY, up to 10Gb/s, and you&amp;#39;ll wonder how you ever lived with LTE&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "name": "t1_dg59kam", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491989400.0, "created_utc": 1491960600.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 59}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tsen", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tsen", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5uim1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "brunzehn", "parent_id": "t1_dg5b06q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Showerthoughts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The abbreviation bps is often used to mean bit/s, so that when a 1 Mbps connection is advertised, it usually means that the maximum achievable bandwidth is 1 Mbit/s (one million bits per second), which is 0.125 MB/s (megabyte per second), or about 0.1192 MiB/s (mebibyte per second).", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The abbreviation bps is often used to mean bit/s, so that when a 1 Mbps connection is advertised, it usually means that the maximum achievable bandwidth is 1 Mbit/s (one million bits per second), which is 0.125 MB/s (megabyte per second), or about 0.1192 MiB/s (mebibyte per second).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "name": "t1_dg5uim1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492032159.0, "created_utc": 1492003359.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5b06q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 23, "report_reasons": null, "author": "austex3600", "parent_id": "t3_64tsen", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Showerthoughts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "3G speeds - ~25mbps\nSpeeds when in big city on cellular : 30+Mbps\n\nHome wifi , I pay for 30mbps\nRegularly receive 0.5-6mbps. :( ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;3G speeds - ~25mbps\nSpeeds when in big city on cellular : 30+Mbps&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Home wifi , I pay for 30mbps\nRegularly receive 0.5-6mbps. :( &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "name": "t1_dg5b06q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491991304.0, "created_utc": 1491962504.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tsen", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg581ep", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "I_Am_A_Sasshole", "parent_id": "t3_64tsen", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Showerthoughts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I used to be able to get 4G, but since that phone broke my current phone only gets 3G.
