Within a couple of days I was struggling to breathe and I was vomiting every thirty minutes. I didn&amp;#39;t eat for a week and combined with vomiting I dropped to 76 pounds( 13 year old male). It literally got to the point where I thought one night that I would die because I couldn&amp;#39;t get any air. The next day I went to the doctor and he gave me a decongestant. I was able to breathe after that and spent the next week getting over the allergies and eating. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "name": "t1_dgcalod", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492392231.0, "created_utc": 1492363431.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m9gl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcrgmj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "metalclassicrock123", "parent_id": "t3_65m9gl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Showerthoughts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The worst thing about breathing through your mouth: If something smells bad, you now have to taste it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst thing about breathing through your mouth: If something smells bad, you now have to taste it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "name": "t1_dgcrgmj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492414614.0, "created_utc": 1492385814.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m9gl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbrg10", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "forgivenfreeonfire", "parent_id": "t3_65m9gl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Showerthoughts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmLz4LKhqc4", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmLz4LKhqc4\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmLz4LKhqc4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "name": "t1_dgbrg10", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492351405.0, "created_utc": 1492322605.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m9gl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbxbi4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "saphear", "parent_id": "t3_65m9gl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Showerthoughts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "When something becomes a constant enough in your lives you take it for granted ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When something becomes a constant enough in your lives you take it for granted &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "name": "t1_dgbxbi4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492369181.0, "created_utc": 1492340381.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m9gl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc281d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Brodoof", "parent_id": "t3_65m9gl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Showerthoughts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Repost ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repost &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "name": "t1_dgc281d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492380529.0, "created_utc": 1492351729.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
