If you are wondering why its a little weird to have an age gap here is my opinion as a 31 year old who wouldn't date someone who is 21. \n\nYou are such a fucking liar. If one of the girls on GW18 started coming after you I bet you wouldn't last 10 seconds. You're just a hypocritical guy who thinks they're some kind of paragon by stating this lie. Guys are naturally attracted to young fertile women. I'm 34 and I refuse to date women my age or older. They either have a bunch of kids I want nothing to do with, they're almost ALWAYS boring as fuck and their idea of fun is sitting around the house watching Netflix, they have so much baggage and trust issues from whatever some other guy has done that it's exhausting and a waste of my time to put up with all the walls and drama. Younger women are way more fun, more adventurous, they still want to do things like travel. \n\nStop lying.\n\n&gt;It's been 10 years since I was 21.  In that 10 years I think I have figured out a lot about myself.  Things I like to do for fun, things I want to do with my life, and whats really important to me.  A lot of that is very different for me now then what it was at 21. I don't think I'm so smart or so wise, its just that there is something to be said for an extra decade worth of experience when figuring out what you want from life.  \n\n&gt;For example, I still like to go out and have a drink but I don't want to drink like I did when I was 21. \n\nSo don't drink like that. Do you really think that there are only either not drinking at all or extreme binge drinking ? Dating a 21 year old doesn't mean you suddenly have to binge drink\n\n&gt; I don't think its wrong for 21 year olds to live their lives like that but I don't want to do it again.  If I was dating someone who is 21, I would either have to do it again so that person could have the experience they want, or if I did what I wanted, I would feel like I was keeping that person from doing something that is normal for a 21 year old.\n\nSounds like a personal problem. Maybe you should get over your made up problems. I've dated 21 year olds and at no point have I binge drank for them and neither did I keep them from it if it was what they wanted to do.\n\n&gt;I would also have a problem if I felt like I was projecting my values onto this person. I don't want to be a teacher because I think everyone needs to figure out whats important for themselves. I want someone who has already figured this stuff out independently and finds we are compatible. Of course there can be a very mature younger person but I think someone like that is pretty exceptional and very rare.    \n\nBullshit. I've dated plenty of younger women who were mature and did none of these things you assume they do.\n\n&gt;I have a friend my age who is dating someone who is 23.  She has a great body and my friend says the sex is good.  They spend so much time fighting.  \"Why did take you an hour to text back\"  I can't help but think this is a fight he wouldn't be having with someone more mature.  Sex is only a part of a good relationship.  While a great body helps good sex, for both men and women, so does experience and knowing what you like.\n\nAnd again you'd be wrong. I've had relationships with older women who have pulled that shit. Yet another reason I no longer do that.\n\n&gt;Why the stigma? For someone like my friend, I wonder what he gets from this relationship.\n\nHe gets a young hot fun woman he can do fun things with. Maybe you're a boring person and prefer dating boring women.\n\n&gt;Is this girl going to help him grow as a person?\n\nWhy do you assume she's not ? You sound jealous as fuck.\n\n&gt;I also wonder if perhaps he is not as mature in his personal relationships as my other peers. \n\nSo wanting to be with someone who is fun and lively and energetic is immature ? Lol then I'd prefer to stay immature for the rest of my life. \n\n&gt;Is he going to be a positive influence on this girl?  Of course all of this would vary from person to person but age is at least a general indicator of experience and maturity.  So when an age gap is apparent I think most people have these thoughts and questions and a stigma is born.  \n\nNo this stigma is GARBAGE you know why ? Because it ONLY applies to MEN. You NEVER hear this stigma when it's a 40 year old woman and a 60 year old man in those cases it's the \"they're both adults\" line. A 23 year old is. FUCKING ADULT if she wants to date older guys that's her CHOICE. Nobody is forcing her to date older guys. Not all older guys are trying to manipulate or do something sinister.\n\nThis stigma exists because of judgemental jealous people like you who haven't accepted that they can't even attract a younger woman. So you have to make up all this nonsense to make yourself look better....The mere fact that you commented that your friends young gf has a good body just proves you're jealous.\n ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If your point is people shouldn&amp;#39;t judge others lives then sure.

If one of the girls on GW18 started coming after you I bet you wouldn&amp;#39;t last 10 seconds. You&amp;#39;re just a hypocritical guy who thinks they&amp;#39;re some kind of paragon by stating this lie. Guys are naturally attracted to young fertile women. I&amp;#39;m 34 and I refuse to date women my age or older. They either have a bunch of kids I want nothing to do with, they&amp;#39;re almost ALWAYS boring as fuck and their idea of fun is sitting around the house watching Netflix, they have so much baggage and trust issues from whatever some other guy has done that it&amp;#39;s exhausting and a waste of my time to put up with all the walls and drama. Younger women are way more fun, more adventurous, they still want to do things like travel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop lying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been 10 years since I was 21.  In that 10 years I think I have figured out a lot about myself.  Things I like to do for fun, things I want to do with my life, and whats really important to me.  A lot of that is very different for me now then what it was at 21. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m so smart or so wise, its just that there is something to be said for an extra decade worth of experience when figuring out what you want from life.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, I still like to go out and have a drink but I don&amp;#39;t want to drink like I did when I was 21. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t drink like that. Do you really think that there are only either not drinking at all or extreme binge drinking ? Dating a 21 year old doesn&amp;#39;t mean you suddenly have to binge drink&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think its wrong for 21 year olds to live their lives like that but I don&amp;#39;t want to do it again.  If I was dating someone who is 21, I would either have to do it again so that person could have the experience they want, or if I did what I wanted, I would feel like I was keeping that person from doing something that is normal for a 21 year old.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a personal problem. Maybe you should get over your made up problems. I&amp;#39;ve dated 21 year olds and at no point have I binge drank for them and neither did I keep them from it if it was what they wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I would also have a problem if I felt like I was projecting my values onto this person. I don&amp;#39;t want to be a teacher because I think everyone needs to figure out whats important for themselves. I want someone who has already figured this stuff out independently and finds we are compatible. Of course there can be a very mature younger person but I think someone like that is pretty exceptional and very rare.    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bullshit. I&amp;#39;ve dated plenty of younger women who were mature and did none of these things you assume they do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have a friend my age who is dating someone who is 23.  She has a great body and my friend says the sex is good.  They spend so much time fighting.  &amp;quot;Why did take you an hour to text back&amp;quot;  I can&amp;#39;t help but think this is a fight he wouldn&amp;#39;t be having with someone more mature.  Sex is only a part of a good relationship.  While a great body helps good sex, for both men and women, so does experience and knowing what you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And again you&amp;#39;d be wrong. I&amp;#39;ve had relationships with older women who have pulled that shit. Yet another reason I no longer do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why the stigma? For someone like my friend, I wonder what he gets from this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gets a young hot fun woman he can do fun things with. Maybe you&amp;#39;re a boring person and prefer dating boring women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is this girl going to help him grow as a person?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do you assume she&amp;#39;s not ? You sound jealous as fuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I also wonder if perhaps he is not as mature in his personal relationships as my other peers. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So wanting to be with someone who is fun and lively and energetic is immature ? Lol then I&amp;#39;d prefer to stay immature for the rest of my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is he going to be a positive influence on this girl?  Of course all of this would vary from person to person but age is at least a general indicator of experience and maturity.  So when an age gap is apparent I think most people have these thoughts and questions and a stigma is born.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No this stigma is GARBAGE you know why ? Because it ONLY applies to MEN. You NEVER hear this stigma when it&amp;#39;s a 40 year old woman and a 60 year old man in those cases it&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;they&amp;#39;re both adults&amp;quot; line. A 23 year old is. FUCKING ADULT if she wants to date older guys that&amp;#39;s her CHOICE. Nobody is forcing her to date older guys. Not all older guys are trying to manipulate or do something sinister.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This stigma exists because of judgemental jealous people like you who haven&amp;#39;t accepted that they can&amp;#39;t even attract a younger woman. So you have to make up all this nonsense to make yourself look better....The mere fact that you commented that your friends young gf has a good body just proves you&amp;#39;re jealous.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "name": "t1_dgdat3k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492448914.0, "created_utc": 1492420114.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -23}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcm0n9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 190, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MetalFace127", "parent_id": "t1_dgch127", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Showerthoughts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If your point is people shouldn't judge others lives then sure.
