I genuinely would have been miserable and depressed as shit if I&amp;#39;d gone bald at 19. I was super handsome at that age but looked horrible with short hair, kinda similar to the way Jude Law looks when he&amp;#39;s bald. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been on a ton of hair loss forums over the years and I cannot stress to you the number of dudes in their late 20s and early 30s who will come onto the forums and talk about how they are so fucking crushed by hair loss. And instead of being at the early stages they&amp;#39;re way beyond help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some guys don&amp;#39;t care. And some guys even look great with a completely bald head. If that&amp;#39;s you then shave it and move on no big deal. But if you&amp;#39;re not one of those guys and you&amp;#39;d rather keep your hair there are proven ways to do it so at least explore your options and don&amp;#39;t underestimate how different you might end up looking and feeling if you continue to lose hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "name": "t1_dg7919z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492094287.0, "created_utc": 1492065487.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650j2t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg74kh8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chladnipatterns", "parent_id": "t1_dg73wj4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Showerthoughts", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Shave your head.
