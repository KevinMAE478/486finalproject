We've actually read the reports and followed the details rather than just the headlines and popular mass media narratives, so we have a bit of a different perspective.\n\nAlso, beyond the specifics of the UNC case, before anyone starts throwing rocks about how much one group of fans values education, I would suggest you consider your own glass houses.\n\nHow many of YOUR schools have men's basketball and football players with the same average GPA and SAT/ACT scores as the broader student population? If they are lower (and we all know they are) how do you explain the fact that those, by definition, below average students are able to consistently be successful academically at your schools? Is the academic quality at your preferred school so poor that students with a 2.5 high school gpa and an 800 SAT score can consistently legitimately succeed there academically, or are these students getting lots of extra help and being funneled to easy classes? What's the major clustering sitiuation like for your basketball and football players? Did you not recruit all the same players that UNC did, if these players went to KU instead of UNC, do you honestly think they would have flunked out? Etc. etc. etc. \n\nLet's be clear, this is not an argument of \"UNC is innocent because everyone doesn't it.\" Rather, it is pointing out the reality that college athletes being \"student athletes\" is a farce and a giant house of cards, and it has been for quite some time. There's not a single competitive D1 school in the county that prioritizes academics in recruiting top-sport athletes, and not a single one that has athletes with the same average academic profile as the broader university (unless the university is really poor academically). And yet... there's also not a single school in the country that consistently flunks out these below average student. If you haven't realize this before, you may be suffering some serious cognitive dissonance right now. Sorry. \n\nSo, please, spare us the self-righteous bullshit about how much you value academics for your sports teams.
