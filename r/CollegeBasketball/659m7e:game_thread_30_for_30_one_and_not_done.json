In the one-and-done era, K has 2 titles. But only 1 of those 2 teams was a one-and-done team, really. Specifically one with freshmen/one-and-dones as the core or the driving force. He's had a few other teams with a lot of talent like that in this era and didn't get to the Final Four, let alone win the title.\n\nMy point is that it's hard to say he should win more when there aren't a lot of examples of others doing more or less with the same thing. But I think it's fair to point out what happened with all of Duke's talent this year, and compare it to UK last year and in our NIT year (where we lost our star frosh to injury). Also Michigan St. had a top 5 recruiting class this year, I think, and a couple really good players who could be first-rounders but who are coming back - didn't make the Final Four despite having a HOF coach.\n\nSo look no further than all of the elite/HOF coaches who will, when pressed, admit there's no way in Hell they'd want to have to rebuild every year and coach up a new team every year. Rick has said as much, as has Roy, Self, K, Izzo, etc. Hate him as much as most of us do, K's now seeing it's no picnic, and he's the greatest coach of his generation. And while no one else is getting quite as many top one-and-dones, we can easily point to specific years when Arizona, UCLA, UNC, Duke, Kansas and other teams than Kentucky had multiple super-frosh or multiple first-rounders and did not win the title. And 3 of them have HOF coaches. If he ever gets a title, Miller will wind up HOF too. If the team with the most talent won every year, it'd be UK and Duke trading titles every year. The fact that it isn't that way should tell you it's not just about having a lot of talent. That's not to say Cal is a bad coach, because other coaches lose with a lot of talent. But again, few coaches are able to get so much year after year out of new teams, talent or not. \n\nAll that said, Cal should have 2 more titles at UK with the way he had teams playing in March and with anchor players like KAT or Wall. A few bad calls hurt, but mostly those losses are on Cal being too stubborn and sticking with guys on the floor when he should've gone to his bench. Still won't say it's sad he only has the one title, because the only other coach with multiple titles who's coaching one-and-dones is K, and he's only got 2 titles in the last 10 years during the one-and-done era. (Roy's got 2 titles in that era, but given the flack Cal gets for UMass and Memphis, I'm not gonna give Roy credit for his 2009 (or 2005) seasons.) (Also, forget when you could say one-and-done era started - I think of it as Rose - but UNC's 2005 team might fit that category, plus they had like 7 guys leave off it to pursue a life after Swahili.)", "edited": 1492140965.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only other coach with a similar amount of talent to compare to is K. In the one-and-done era, K has 2 titles. But only 1 of those 2 teams was a one-and-done team, really. Specifically one with freshmen/one-and-dones as the core or the driving force. He&amp;#39;s had a few other teams with a lot of talent like that in this era and didn&amp;#39;t get to the Final Four, let alone win the title.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is that it&amp;#39;s hard to say he should win more when there aren&amp;#39;t a lot of examples of others doing more or less with the same thing. But I think it&amp;#39;s fair to point out what happened with all of Duke&amp;#39;s talent this year, and compare it to UK last year and in our NIT year (where we lost our star frosh to injury). Also Michigan St. had a top 5 recruiting class this year, I think, and a couple really good players who could be first-rounders but who are coming back - didn&amp;#39;t make the Final Four despite having a HOF coach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So look no further than all of the elite/HOF coaches who will, when pressed, admit there&amp;#39;s no way in Hell they&amp;#39;d want to have to rebuild every year and coach up a new team every year. Rick has said as much, as has Roy, Self, K, Izzo, etc. Hate him as much as most of us do, K&amp;#39;s now seeing it&amp;#39;s no picnic, and he&amp;#39;s the greatest coach of his generation. And while no one else is getting quite as many top one-and-dones, we can easily point to specific years when Arizona, UCLA, UNC, Duke, Kansas and other teams than Kentucky had multiple super-frosh or multiple first-rounders and did not win the title. And 3 of them have HOF coaches. If he ever gets a title, Miller will wind up HOF too. If the team with the most talent won every year, it&amp;#39;d be UK and Duke trading titles every year. The fact that it isn&amp;#39;t that way should tell you it&amp;#39;s not just about having a lot of talent. That&amp;#39;s not to say Cal is a bad coach, because other coaches lose with a lot of talent. But again, few coaches are able to get so much year after year out of new teams, talent or not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that said, Cal should have 2 more titles at UK with the way he had teams playing in March and with anchor players like KAT or Wall. A few bad calls hurt, but mostly those losses are on Cal being too stubborn and sticking with guys on the floor when he should&amp;#39;ve gone to his bench. Still won&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s sad he only has the one title, because the only other coach with multiple titles who&amp;#39;s coaching one-and-dones is K, and he&amp;#39;s only got 2 titles in the last 10 years during the one-and-done era. (Roy&amp;#39;s got 2 titles in that era, but given the flack Cal gets for UMass and Memphis, I&amp;#39;m not gonna give Roy credit for his 2009 (or 2005) seasons.)
