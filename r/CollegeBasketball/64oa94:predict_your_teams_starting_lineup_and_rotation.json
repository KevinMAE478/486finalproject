If he does come back, he will almost certainly be a major factor off the bench, with Kevin Keatts hopefully utilizing his floor-spacing ability to a much better degree than Mark Gottfried did. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CollegeBasketball", "name": "t1_dg3s3xw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491909599.0, "created_utc": 1491880799.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rj3j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oa94", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rj3j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oa94", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rj3j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oa94", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4gepo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dutch_touch1", "parent_id": "t1_dg4fup6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CollegeBasketball", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah I'm extremely surprised nobody has mentioned him yet.

He's likely coming in right below the first round in the draft, yet coming back to school for a fourth year carries obvious risk for both his draft stock and his reputation. History shows that returning to school tends to do more damage than good-- returning for his junior year knocked him out of realistic first round contention, and while Justin Jackson showed how one can play one's way back into the first round this season, that's the exception, not the rule. He's finishing his degree this year-- does he really want to come back for another year of free scrutiny? How confident is he that nothing bad could *possibly* happen next season?    \n  \n- I feel fairly good about Duval at this juncture, but if Grayson comes back, that's a lot of mouths to feed outside in terms of minutes. Do we think K goes with three guys under 6'5 in the lineup the majority of the time? I think K will start Duval regardless-- he's the no-brainer best PG on the roster, and he'd have the highest defensive potential of anyone on the outside-- but a crowded backcourt might make Duval think for a second or two before deciding.  \n  \n- I don't think Kevin Knox is coming. I think he'll choose between UNC and Missouri. Him waiting another two weeks only confirms this imo, because a Grayson return wouldn't impact his minutes whatsoever-- he knows what K wants out of a wing, and K's wings always play a heavy role. If he wanted that role on this team, I think he'd have committed by now. I suspect he's either waiting for Jackson or waiting to see where Mizzou's other pieces fall into place. I wouldn't be surprised if K and Co. make a full-court press on Jordan Tucker in the coming weeks. Unsure if that would work, but not many wing options left on the incoming recruit side of the spectrum.  \n  \n- I'd ruled out Bamba weeks ago. I suspect that if Duval went elsewhere, he'd rule out Duke entirely-- he had great chemistry with Duval and Carter at the McD's AA game-- but I'm sure all of the uncertainty with Cal's bigs, especially Bam *not* signing with an agent, will keep Duke alive for the moment. Never thought I'd say that a Bamba signing would be *more* likely than a Knox signing, but I sort of feel that way now. We may easily end up with neither.   \n  \n- If we end up with neither Knox nor Bamba, that raises a *ton* of rotation questions. K would've liked to have the option to go fast and small with Carter at the 5, but without a wing that can shoot, that changes things. Can DeLaurier improve his shot enough? He's got obvious elite athleticism and defensive potential and would be K's first choice to fill that wing slot, but if he can't shoot, say, 34-35% from the arc, I suspect he won't play consistently unless his defense is off the charts. Would K dare to play *four* guys under 6'6 at once? I bet he would, but if we think Duke has struggled defensively the last few years, this would definitely exacerbate those problems. Maybe Jack White would play, but he'd also struggle defensively unless many of the taller, longer, and more athletic 4s in the conference. So does K just stick to a two-big lineup, a la Thomas and Zoubek, and play Carter with Bolden and Vrank? This would be my suspicion, but it runs counter to everything K has *tried* to push offensively-- lots of 3s and transition ball-- the last few years.   \n   \nHold my hand to the fire, I suspect we'd see:  \nPG: Duval  \nSG: Jackson  \nSF: ...

O'Connell   \n  \nRealistically, the bench ends at DeLaurier, with White and O'Connell working on their development for the season.

Maybe Jack White would play, but he&amp;#39;d also struggle defensively unless many of the taller, longer, and more athletic 4s in the conference. So does K just stick to a two-big lineup, a la Thomas and Zoubek, and play Carter with Bolden and Vrank? This would be my suspicion, but it runs counter to everything K has &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; to push offensively-- lots of 3s and transition ball-- the last few years.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hold my hand to the fire, I suspect we&amp;#39;d see:&lt;br/&gt;\nPG: Duval&lt;br/&gt;\nSG: Jackson&lt;br/&gt;\nSF: ... Allen&lt;br/&gt;\nPF: Carter&lt;br/&gt;\nC: Bolden  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bench, in order of my confidence that they&amp;#39;ll contribute to minutes:&lt;br/&gt;\n6. Trent&lt;br/&gt;\n7. Vrank&lt;br/&gt;\n8. DeLaurier&lt;br/&gt;\n9. White&lt;br/&gt;\n10. O&amp;#39;Connell   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Realistically, the bench ends at DeLaurier, with White and O&amp;#39;Connell working on their development for the season. If Grayson Allen leaves too, then bump Trent into the starting lineup as the third guard and move everyone on the bench up a slot. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CollegeBasketball", "name": "t1_dg4j0ew", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491957941.0, "created_utc": 1491929141.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rj3j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oa94", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rj3j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oa94", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rj3j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oa94", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rj3j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oa94", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rj3j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oa94", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rj3j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oa94", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rj3j", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64oa94", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4mb7j", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "VacationAwayFromWork", "parent_id": "t1_dg4m42p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CollegeBasketball", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think Wilkes is the better version of Smith and will give you what you're looking for in the above.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Wilkes is the better version of Smith and will give you what you&amp;#39;re looking for in the above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CollegeBasketball", "name": "t1_dg4mb7j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491961536.0, "created_utc": 1491932736.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4m42p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iltded", "parent_id": "t1_dg4hvtn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CollegeBasketball", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I like Smith because he offers versatility on defense, and looks as if he has the speed and size to guard the Trier type players, which we totally lacked last year.
