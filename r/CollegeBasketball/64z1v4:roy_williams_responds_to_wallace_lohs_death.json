Athletes are something like 4% of the student population, so anything more than a point or two above that would be \"disproportionate.\"  \n\nFurther, the whole disproportionate thing is absolutely one of the things where you can't judge Carolina without equally judging nearly every other college - including Duke. \"Clustering\" is another word for it, and a USA Today report a decade ago found that it was prevalent at nearly every school they looked at (Duke is private and hides their data, so don't think they were fully included). Duke was criticized for the clustering of their basketball players in the Sociology degree in the early 2000s though, and even today you'll find clustering at every school - i.e. \"Disproportionate\" athlete enrollments. You can't maintain intellectual honesty and judge on that alone - even given that athletes were 40+%, that's not far off from the clustering thresholds (25-33% minimum). \n\nIn term of the classes being \"fraudulent,\" you might be interested to note that the actual \"fraud\" was committed by the professor. He got paid for \"lecture\" classes that he didn't actually teach or participate in. That was the fraud. \n\nNote, that is not the same as the classes being \"fake.\" They weren't. They were real independent study courses that required real papers to be written and turned in. No student received a grade without turning in the required papers. They were just classes that existed in imagination only. \n\nNow, to be clear, saying they were real is not saying they were wholly legitimate or that they weren't irregular - they clearly weren't legitimate, and they clearly were irregular. \n\nHowever, let's be honest about what made them illegitimate. It wasn't that they were independent study (i.e. \"Paper classes\"). It wasn't that they were easy and required minimal work. It wasn't that a lot of athletes and greeks participated (clearly correlated with being easy).  They were illegitimate for two reasons:\n\n\n1.) Some were listed as lectures when they were in fact independent study. (Again, fraud by the professor but little impact for the students who mostly didn't know)\n\n\n2.) they were run and graded by the admin rather than the professor (again, fraud by the professor). \n\n\nFor both of these, the students didn't really have much visibility or awareness. Further, even if they knew Crowder was doing the grading, that likely wouldn't raise a red flag for any student, reality is that TAs do most of the grading for most classes at universities (I graded many papers myself when I was in grad school and working as a TA).  \n\nSo yes, the students knew that these classes were easy, had a reputation for high grades, and required minimal work. And many athletes (and many more non-athletes) keyed on that information to take advantage of these easy classes. \n\nIs any of that actually a sin (or an NCAA violation)? Are there not easy classes at every university that students line up to take for an \"easy A\"? Don't athletes at every school cluster in easy classes (ahem, Duke sociology degree)? Does the NCAA really have jurisdiction to decide if a class is \"too easy\"? \n\nRegarding McCants, can you let me know when he is to be believed and when he isn't? How do you know when he's telling the truth, and about what? If you believe him on this, why not the claims about getting $300M from the NCAA? Futher, all that aside, why do you choose to believe the one McCants (a proven liar) and ignore the dozen other guys from that team that contradict him, including a half dozen that actually agreed to be interviewed for the Wainstein report?

Athletes are something like 4% of the student population, so anything more than a point or two above that would be &amp;quot;disproportionate.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further, the whole disproportionate thing is absolutely one of the things where you can&amp;#39;t judge Carolina without equally judging nearly every other college - including Duke. &amp;quot;Clustering&amp;quot; is another word for it, and a USA Today report a decade ago found that it was prevalent at nearly every school they looked at (Duke is private and hides their data, so don&amp;#39;t think they were fully included). Duke was criticized for the clustering of their basketball players in the Sociology degree in the early 2000s though, and even today you&amp;#39;ll find clustering at every school - i.e. &amp;quot;Disproportionate&amp;quot; athlete enrollments. You can&amp;#39;t maintain intellectual honesty and judge on that alone - even given that athletes were 40+%, that&amp;#39;s not far off from the clustering thresholds (25-33% minimum). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In term of the classes being &amp;quot;fraudulent,&amp;quot; you might be interested to note that the actual &amp;quot;fraud&amp;quot; was committed by the professor. He got paid for &amp;quot;lecture&amp;quot; classes that he didn&amp;#39;t actually teach or participate in. That was the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note, that is not the same as the classes being &amp;quot;fake.&amp;quot; They weren&amp;#39;t. They were real independent study courses that required real papers to be written and turned in. No student received a grade without turning in the required papers. They were just classes that existed in imagination only. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, to be clear, saying they were real is not saying they were wholly legitimate or that they weren&amp;#39;t irregular - they clearly weren&amp;#39;t legitimate, and they clearly were irregular. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, let&amp;#39;s be honest about what made them illegitimate. It wasn&amp;#39;t that they were independent study (i.e. &amp;quot;Paper classes&amp;quot;). It wasn&amp;#39;t that they were easy and required minimal work. It wasn&amp;#39;t that a lot of athletes and greeks participated (clearly correlated with being easy).  They were illegitimate for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) Some were listed as lectures when they were in fact independent study. (Again, fraud by the professor but little impact for the students who mostly didn&amp;#39;t know)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) they were run and graded by the admin rather than the professor (again, fraud by the professor). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For both of these, the students didn&amp;#39;t really have much visibility or awareness. Further, even if they knew Crowder was doing the grading, that likely wouldn&amp;#39;t raise a red flag for any student, reality is that TAs do most of the grading for most classes at universities (I graded many papers myself when I was in grad school and working as a TA).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yes, the students knew that these classes were easy, had a reputation for high grades, and required minimal work. And many athletes (and many more non-athletes) keyed on that information to take advantage of these easy classes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is any of that actually a sin (or an NCAA violation)? Are there not easy classes at every university that students line up to take for an &amp;quot;easy A&amp;quot;? Don&amp;#39;t athletes at every school cluster in easy classes (ahem, Duke sociology degree)? Does the NCAA really have jurisdiction to decide if a class is &amp;quot;too easy&amp;quot;? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding McCants, can you let me know when he is to be believed and when he isn&amp;#39;t? How do you know when he&amp;#39;s telling the truth, and about what? If you believe him on this, why not the claims about getting $300M from the NCAA? Futher, all that aside, why do you choose to believe the one McCants (a proven liar) and ignore the dozen other guys from that team that contradict him, including a half dozen that actually agreed to be interviewed for the Wainstein report? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CollegeBasketball", "name": "t1_dg8fuku", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492156285.0, "created_utc": 1492127485.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg881wr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RushLimbaughIsFat", "parent_id": "t1_dg81in1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CollegeBasketball", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; one example from the piece you quoted - of those 3100 students, most were non-athletes (doesn't exactly fit the \"impermissible benefits for athletes\" narrative)\n\nThe majority of students are non-athletes.
