Scored in double figures every single game besides one (9 points vs. Florida). Has good size for a point guard, but only averaged 1.3 assists a game (possibly due to the rest of the roster being devoid of talent). Shot over 42% from 3 as well. If he continues to build on his consistency he could be a mid-late 1st round pick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Nick Ward/Michigan State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This guy averaged nearly 14 PPG and 1.5 BPG in only 19 minutes a game. Also played well in both tournament games (19/7 vs. Miami). He was the 3rd highest ranked player in his recruiting class but he has proven to have NBA potential. If he were 2 inches taller that would help but he is essentially a 6&amp;#39;8 PF who can&amp;#39;t shoot from mid-3 point range. That being said he has talent and a bigger role next season could mean more spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Kyle Guy/Virginia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consistency was an issue this past season, but shooting 49% from 3 is incredible. Is essentially a SG trapped in a PG&amp;#39;s body though. That being said if he can stay consistent next season he could turn into an NBA prospect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Shamorie Ponds/St. John&amp;#39;s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walked in and was the number 1 scoring option from the get go. Surrounded by a bad team, Ponds still showed he could ball. 17 PPG, 4 RPG, 3 APG, 2 SPG. Also led the team to a victory over #13 Butler in January. Hopefully he gets help next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Tyus Battle/Syracuse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Streaky throughout the season but scored in double digits his last 6 games, including 18 vs. #10 Duke. Stuck between being a PG and a SG, I think he should choose being a SG if he wants to make it to the NBA, and if he can be more consistent next year that is a reasonable goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 Bruce Brown/Miami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scoring 30 to beat North Carolina shows that this guy has some definite talent. Like most of the players who will be on this list, consistency is the key if they want NBA looks. Can be a solid NBA role player/late 1st round pick for 2018 if he improves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 Tony Bradley/UNC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This guy right here is probably who I would say has the most NBA potential out of anyone on this list. If he returns I think he will be a lottery pick (IMO if he went this year he could even sneak in the 1st round). Should be a full time starter next year, and in a less talented draft than this year he could take advantage. Would like to see him utilized more on offense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Andrew Jones/Texas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has declared for the draft but it would probably be a smart decision to come back. I do see him being a potential late 1st round pick, and he was consistent with his scoring, but if he can cut down on the turnovers and lead Texas to a better record he could go as high as the late lottery next year. Jarrett Allen returning wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt either but his ceiling is much higher and I think he would be smart to stay in the draft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 Frank Jackson/Duke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shooting guard trapped in a point guard&amp;#39;s body, but if he played the whole season like he did in November we are talking about a lottery pick. If he comes back to Duke next year and has a bigger role with good consistency he has a higher ceiling than most if not all of the players on this list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Marques Bolden/Duke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His size and potential is too good to ignore, and he made a very smart decision to come back. Played well in the preseason game but was nonexistent other than that. An expanded role will allow him to show his potential, but he has a lottery ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Dewan Huell/Miami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Loads of potential but needs to show that potential, and his minutes were decreased in the rotation as the season went on. He was a 5 star prospect though, needs to put on weight to reach his potential.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 Kameron McGusty/Oklahoma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will be the number 1 scoring option next season. Solid college player, don&amp;#39;t see pro potential right now but there is nothing wrong with being a great college player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 Ike Anibogu/UCLA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No offensive game to speak of but scouts are intrigued by his defensive potential. Could be a mid-late 1st round pick with an expanded role next season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 De&amp;#39;Ron Davis/Indiana&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a new coach at the helm in Archie Miller, Davis will likely see an expanded role. Has good NBA size, but did not play up to his potential freshman year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 Seventh Woods/North Carolina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His freshman year was worse than expected but he did get a national title ring out of it. With Nate Britt leaving this high school highlight reel will probably get more minutes next season. He basically makes this list based off of his high school fame though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. Amir Coffey/Minnesota&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2nd leading scorer on a 5 seed is not a bad freshman year. Looks like he made a smart decision to stay home, and continued improvement next year could lead to NBA looks. I think he could sneak in the first round next year if things go well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17 Tony Carr/Penn State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the most prized recruits in Penn State history. Was by far the best player on this team, averages of 13 PPG, 4 APG, 4 RPG. His court vision is NBA ready right now, but he shot horribly percentage wise. If he gets a more consistent jump shot and Penn State improves more he could get NBA looks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 Payton Pritchard/Oregon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a starter for a final 4 team as a freshman is impressive. Will be a very solid 4 year player and you can never have enough of those in college.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19 Braxton Key/Alabama&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solid player, who plays well vs. good teams (20+ vs. Kentucky and Florida). With a nice recruiting class coming in Alabama is a NCAA tournament threat next season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 Robert Williams/Texas A&amp;amp;M&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only ranked 60th on 247, Williams came out of nowhere to become a projected lottery pick for 2017. He has decided to come back another season which is huge for the Aggies. Is a projected lottery pick for 2018 currently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21 Anthony Cowan/Maryland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Melo Trimble leaving, right now the reigns will be handed over to Cowan. Averaged 10+ ppg on the season and next season will show if he can successfully lead the Terripans at PG.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22 Kevin Huerter/Maryland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second part of the Maryland renaissance, Huerter has great size for a SG. Hit 7 3&amp;#39;s vs. Nebraska and scored 19 in the tournament game. Huerter could become a legitimate NBA prospect with his size if he becomes more consistent next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23 Justin Jackson/Maryland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final piece of the sophomore puzzle, Jackson is the best player out of the 3 Terripans listed and has a good shot shooting over 43% from the 3 point land. Could be a lottery pick next season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 Matthew Moyer/Syracuse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Technically not a sophomore, will be a redshirt freshman after sitting out a season due to a foot injury. His potential is intriguing, and he has good size for his position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25 Jaylen Fisher/TCU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had a solid first season under new head coach Jamie Dixon. Has good vision for a point guard and quickness. Missed NIT tournament due to injury. Will likely see an even more expanded role next season&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26 Markus Howard/Marquette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watch out for him next year. Shot a ridiculous 55% from 3 and over 50% overall as a 5&amp;#39;11 PG. Doesn&amp;#39;t have NBA size but has a lot of heart to immediately become the best player on the team as a freshman. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27 Charlie Moore/Cal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guard from Chicago who put up 38 in his 2nd game ever. Has a solid skillset but needs to improve shooting consistency. Averaged 12.2 PPG and 3.5 APG. Will be under a new head coach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28 Tyler Cook/Iowa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shot a perfect 15/15 in the NIT. 2nd leading scorer on the team behind Peter Jok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29 Alterique Gilbert/UCONN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was a consensus top 40 player, but injured in 3rd game for the season. Makes the list due to his hype before the season, he&amp;#39;ll get a chance to prove himself next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 Taurean Thompson/Syracuse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shot over 54% from the field as a big man with 9 ppg. With Tyler Lydon leaving he will get more than 18 minutes a game next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31 Wenyen Gabriel/Kentucky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might not get improved minutes, a lot depends on if they get Bamba or not. After a 23 point game in early February only had 19 total the rest of the season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32 Myles Powell/Seton Hall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Started at PG for a team that made the NCAA Tourney. Seton Hall has their top 4 scorers returning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33 Sam Hauser/Marquette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deadly 3 point shooter who is expected to be a starter next season. 8.8 PPG and over 42% from 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34 Bryce Aiken/Harvard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting PG as a freshman who knows how to score. Did shoot under 40% from the field but this is the type of player Harvard usually doesn&amp;#39;t get (top 100 recruit) and he is only getting better. 14.5 PPG.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35 Rui Hachimura/Gonzaga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Played limited minutes but has size and some scouts are already calling him a potential lottery pick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35 Jaquori McLaughlin/Oregon State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A top 100 player who had a solid year for a bad Oregon State team that never recovered after the Tres Trinkle injury.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 Lamar Peters/Missisippi State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put up 25/7 against Kentucky. Showed promise to be a solid college player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37 Chris Lewis/Harvard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Makes a great duo with Aiken. 7.7 PPG and 4.9 RPG.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38 Yoeli Childs/BYU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9.3 PPG and 8.2 RPG with over 1 BPG.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;39 Dylan Frye/Bowling Green&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go watch his mixtape on youtube. PG with 9 PPG and over 40% from 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40 Carsen Edwards/Purdue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over 10 PPG for a Purdue team that made the sweet 16. Will be a great college player going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;41 Killian Tillie/Gonzaga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of potential like Rui mentioned earlier and could become a lottery pick with improved minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42 Kristian Doolittle/Oklahoma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Played great at the end of the season and Oklahoma low key has some good players going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;43 Seth Towns/Harvard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 3rd Harvard player to appear on this list, and this team will be very dangerous next year. 12.5 PPG&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;44 De&amp;#39;Anthony Melton/USC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great size for a PG and had a solid sweet 16 game vs. Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45 Skylar Mays/LSU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solid year as a freshman PG, him and Blakeney in the backcourt next year could be trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;46 Kobe Paras/Creighton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t play much but gets on here for his high school fame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;47 Xavier Sneed/Kansas State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had a solid freshman year with over 7 ppg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48 Kamar Baldwin/Butler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over 10 PPG and showed the consistency to be a solid player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;49 Christian Vital/UCONN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Played strong near the end of the year scoring 19 in his last game vs. Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50 Devon Daniels/Utah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shot over 40% from the field and 3 averaging 10 ppg.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm looking through the 2016 recruiting class and I wanted to give some attention to freshmen who played well but were overshadowed by the likes of the NBA prospects (Ball, Jackson, etc). \n\nThese are sophomores to watch out for next year (this is not in order btw):\n\n\n1 **Mustapha Heron/Auburn**\n\nHe was at the low end of the 5 star prospects but Heron proved his case last year.
