I think I will do as someone else suggested here and just go in there and try to dodge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I just beat him :D &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is what I did: stayed close to him and used diagonal forward dodge to keep avoiding his hits and getting a couple of shots in, when his arm came up I shot him to interrupt and did a visceral attack then healed and dodged right away. I missed a few chances to do a visceral attack and fired way more shots than I needed but my focus was always to try to interrupt his big attack. Once he started the transform in to the third stage I played the music box, ran behind and did a changed R2 attack followed by a visceral attack and threw a Molotov and he died. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was a tough fight, so quick. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bloodborne", "name": "t1_dgdb6io", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492450208.0, "created_utc": 1492421408.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_31k9i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rgkz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgddfxt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThePaSch", "parent_id": "t3_65rgkz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bloodborne", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dodge forward, *into* his attacks.
