When bosses have to be defeatable using pure magic, instead of melee, the enemy design has to compensate, they cant be as aggressive or else magic becomes unusable. Thats why so many dark souls bosses and enemies just stand or pace around mindlessly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The singleplayer would end up suffering from them chasing the Souls &amp;quot;variety&amp;quot; (its not even that good variety), rather than playing to their strengths and improving on what makes Bloodborne unique. Mostly this might benefit the online but i dont think souls online has what used to amke it special, now its just boring ass fight clubs and arena battles that I couldnt care less about.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bloodborne", "name": "t1_dg6zzry", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492079236.0, "created_utc": 1492050436.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_31k9i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zeu3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg837m3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hog_wife", "parent_id": "t1_dg6fbwm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bloodborne", "controversiality": 0, "body": "i have to agree with papermiceB in that BB's similarity in builds allows for tighter gameplay. also, subjective, but the game wouldn't have been nearly as fun for me if it was designed around slower builds like DeS, DS1 &amp; DS2 were. i'm definitely biased here but i always go for no armor, 2handed CMW dagger builds in almost every souls game so BB fit me perfectly in that regard.\n\ni also really liked the animations for BB but yea, a bit more variety in animations would have been nice if they still felt \"practical\".\n\nACV is on the psn store for like 20 CAD and you should be able to pick up AC4a for cheap at a used game store (not sure if it's available digitally). i love AC so i would encourage you to try it out before the reboot comes out, especially if you like games with high mechanical skill caps and customization", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i have to agree with papermiceB in that BB&amp;#39;s similarity in builds allows for tighter gameplay. also, subjective, but the game wouldn&amp;#39;t have been nearly as fun for me if it was designed around slower builds like DeS, DS1 &amp;amp; DS2 were. i&amp;#39;m definitely biased here but i always go for no armor, 2handed CMW dagger builds in almost every souls game so BB fit me perfectly in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i also really liked the animations for BB but yea, a bit more variety in animations would have been nice if they still felt &amp;quot;practical&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ACV is on the psn store for like 20 CAD and you should be able to pick up AC4a for cheap at a used game store (not sure if it&amp;#39;s available digitally). i love AC so i would encourage you to try it out before the reboot comes out, especially if you like games with high mechanical skill caps and customization&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bloodborne", "name": "t1_dg837m3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492140848.0, "created_utc": 1492112048.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6fbwm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "s_nice79", "parent_id": "t1_dg698xa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bloodborne", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;i think bloodborne's core mechanics are all pretty good although i wouldn't mind if there was a bit more fine tuning to animations to make everything a bit more fluid. \n\nI feel like animations look great i just want a little more variety of animations.\nLol like the moveset for rifle spear in spear mode is just \n*stab... stab stab... stab.
