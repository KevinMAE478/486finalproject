However, with the way chalice dungeons work, you can literally put the main game on hold after Rom so you could go build up. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bloodborne", "name": "t1_dgcpu0e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492412374.0, "created_utc": 1492383574.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_31k9i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pfir", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_31k9i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pfir", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcx0z3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SonicFlash01", "parent_id": "t1_dgcwqh6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bloodborne", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Cainhurst is a bloodtinge area; unless you spec for bloodtinge Cainhurst weaponry won't have much appeal.
