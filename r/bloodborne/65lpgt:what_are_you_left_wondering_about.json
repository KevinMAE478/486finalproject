And why do Pthumerians suddenly appear?\n\n* The Mensis Ritual was designed to resurrect/restore Mergo.  Old Pthumeria fell around the time that Queen Yharnam gave birth to the stillborn Mergo.  In the time between then and now Mergo has only sort-of existed in a place that is no place.  As for Pthumerians, their civilization collapsed and most of them died, but some of them linger.  They've been in the catacombs beneath Yharnam and are emerging because they're drawn by Mergo's re-awakening.\n\n&gt; Who/what is \"the one\" that is being reborn with The One Reborn?\n\n* The One Reborn is never explained.  It could be a bunch of things.  Maybe it is an attempt to stitch together a form for Mergo which is a bit foolish as Mergo never had a physical form.  Maybe it is a Pthumerian thing, or a Loran thing.  To be honest, I haven't given it a lot of thought.\n\n&gt; What was the deleted dialogue from the Doll in the \"true\" ending?\n\n* I don't know there was deleted dialogue.\n\n&gt; How exactly did Mergo die, and what exactly is the Wet Nurse in terms of Lovecraftian canon/lore?\n\n* Mergo and the Wet Nurse's exact natures are largely up to interpretation.  Mine is this:  In the time between Pthumeria and now, Mergo existed in a kind of no-place.  Not dead, but not really alive.  The Mensis ritual pulled it from that place-that-is-not-a-place but it was still small and weak.  The Wet Nurse was there to nurture and protect Mergo until it could exist on its own and the Nightmare of Mensis gave Mergo a place to be.  Killing Micolash destabilized the nightmare.  Driving off the Wet Nurse removed the thing sustaining Mergo.  It could not return to that no-place on its own, it could not stay where it was, and it could not sustain itself.  Mergo died in a manner we might compare to starvation, suffocation, and dehydration.\n\n&gt; What are true respective origins of Ashen Blood, Corruption, Vermin and the Old Blood?\n\n* There are no definite answers.  Old Blood refers, in broad strokes, to the blood of Great Ones.  So it could be any Great One.  In the context of the healing church, it would most likely mean Ebrietas or Oedon, though how one acquires the blood of an entity that has no physical form is a damn good question.\n\n* By corruption I believe you are referring to vileblood corruption.  If that is in error, please correct me.  We know that Laurence was not the only Byrgenwerth scholar to betray Master Willem and take knowledge of the old blood to other places.  We don't have definitive knowledge on when Cainhurst got access to that sort of knowledge, but we can surmise that it came from another Byrgenwerth scholar.\n\n* Vermin and Ashen Blood are both rooted in the Great Ones.  Both, also, from misuse of their power or misinterpretation of intent.  Vermin are transformative, though not in a manner we'd really like.  Ashen Blood is said to have triggered the cause of the beastly scourge, which is another verysion of transformation and no more welcome than vermin.\n\n&gt; Is the Doll actually an avatar for Formless Oedon? Or is it a different Great One (possibly Mother Kos...)?\n\n* The nature of the doll is unknown.  I seriously doubt that it is an avatar for a Great One.  It might be animated through the power of a Great One, but it does not speak for one.  We can see this in that every effort to communicate with Great Ones on any level is frought with difficulty, and threatened by miscommunication.  Our talks with the doll are clear, it speaks of grand philosophical issues, but doesn't do so in particularly roundabout manners.  The doll is, in short, far too human to represent a Great One.  I think the most likely explanation for its power is its location.  It exists as a reflection of the doll Gehrman created in the real hunter's workshop, carried over to the dream which is maintained by the Moon Presence.  In an indirect sort of manner, the Moon Presence is the one giving the doll the ability to be alive, but the humans are the ones giving it the desire to do so.\n\n&gt; What happened to Gehrman's mortal remains? Did he become a beast? Maybe even the Moon Presence?\n\n* Gehrman's bones are somewhere in Yharnam.  Perhaps consumed by a beast, or crushed by debris.  His remains aren't a beast and he didn't become the Moon Presence.  He's the anchor for the Moon Presence to hang its reality on and the access point for it to reach into the world.\n\n&gt; What are the Messengers exactly, and how does this interconnect with the Mensis Brain?\n\n* The messengers are entities that inhabit at least one of the other-places the Great Ones do.  For simplicity's sake, I'll call it the dream.  They aren't human, and they aren't Great One.  They barely see us, and cannot even grasp the existence of the Great Ones.  They are to us as we are to the Great Ones, which is a reason to really appreciate them.  They want to please us, help us, and be helped by us but we cannot really communicate and all too often our interactions are tragic (Winter Lanterns, ewww).  The Brain of Mensis isn't directly connected with the Messengers, and the body we see isn't that creature's original.  We know that the school of Mensis found the Brain somewhere in the nightmare but little more, just that it was lined with evil eyes and was rotted.  My theory is that the brain they found, and the one we encounter, is a wretched trapped thing.  The nightmare it was found in was not of its own making, was not its home.  It did not wish to be there and the body it was inhabiting was a terrible thing cobbled together from whatever things it could find, those things happened to include messengers, the poor dears.\n\nI'm happy to address any other questions you have if you liked or found any of these answers helpful.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all my understandings and theories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What is the actual point of the Mensis Ritual other than the vague &amp;quot;beckon the moon&amp;quot; intents?

It did not wish to be there and the body it was inhabiting was a terrible thing cobbled together from whatever things it could find, those things happened to include messengers, the poor dears.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m happy to address any other questions you have if you liked or found any of these answers helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bloodborne", "name": "t1_dgbu5p0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492358527.0, "created_utc": 1492329727.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_31k9i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lpgt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_31k9i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lpgt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_31k9i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lpgt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_31k9i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lpgt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_31k9i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lpgt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbmxmk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Scorchedknight95", "parent_id": "t1_dgblhy1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bloodborne", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Agreed", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agreed&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bloodborne", "name": "t1_dgbmxmk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492343108.0, "created_utc": 1492314308.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgblhy1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Metroidrocks", "parent_id": "t1_dgbku7v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bloodborne", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Having the title \"First Hunter\" wouldn't make any sense if you're just the latest in the line of Gehrman's.

I feel like the Souls series' penchant for recycling or recurring elements from one game to the next was compressed in *Bloodborne* and turned into a story feature that's never really discussed, like how Annalise echoes Yharnam in trying to birth a Child of Blood. The fact that Yharnam (the city) is cursed, and that Kos placed a curse of blood on Byrgenwerth, and that Yharnam's troubles all seem linked to blood-drunkenness, forms this maddening connection. \"Just as the Old Hunters slaughtered the inhabitants of the Fishing Hamlet, so do moon-scented hunters slaughter the inhabitants of Yharnam.\" Both inhabitants are transformed, the villagers into fish-people and Yharnamites into beasts, and both are hunted. The villagers were hunted at the bequest of humans, though, while Yharnamites are hunted by those working for a Great One.\n\nPart of it comes from thinking of the Hunter's Nightmare as the Orphan's curse, as the Orphan is the final enemy of it and his death is what \"cleanses\" the Nightmare, removing the distorted moon in the sky, causing the rain in the Hamlet to cease, and clearing the sky throughout the whole Nightmare. If the Hunter's Nightmare is the Orphan's curse, Kos's curse of blood has to be more expansive as she's the mother and the more developed in her powers/understanding of the cosmos.\n\nFinally, Micolash heavily implies the moon and Kos are the same thing, with the moon being the object of fascination by the School of Mensis but Micolash being obsessed with Kos. All this stuff fits together, but the connections are just gossamer thin without going into detail about cinematic visual language and literary themes.\n\nI suppose my other biggest question is what Ebrietas is doing.
