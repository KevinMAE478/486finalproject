I wanted to know why Yharnam was called Yharnam or why Gherman was called Gherman or what, if at all, the names of various Great Ones meant. In any other game, I don&amp;#39;t think this would matter. But this is a From Software game so the devil is in the details. Now this, as of posting, is not comprehensive or definitive. But I hope that eventually it will be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m only going to list out proper nouns of places, people, groups, and weapons. In doing this, I also found a lot of names that I didn&amp;#39;t think meant anything worthwhile, but I&amp;#39;m going to include them anyway for anyone who may have some insight I don&amp;#39;t. If you want any clarification or counter a point, feel free to chime in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used the work of others in many of these names so I defer to &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/54pfnc/loreall_spoilers_meaning_of_all_names_in/\"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/40zpr4/boss_names_in_japanese/\"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://meradorm.tumblr.com/post/148250543635/bloodborne-name-etymology\"&gt;this tumblr post&lt;/a&gt; for a lot of names. I also used &lt;a href=\"https://www.gamefaqs.com/ps4/805577-bloodborne/faqs/71777\"&gt;this GameFAQ article&lt;/a&gt; for a side by side of English and Japanese to try and get a more authentic sound for certain names. For the place names, a lot of them came from &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_generic_forms_in_place_names_in_the_United_Kingdom_and_Ireland\"&gt;this Wikipedia article.&lt;/a&gt; For the name origins, I used &lt;a href=\"http://www.behindthename.com/\"&gt;Behind the Name.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLACES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Yharnam  - This one bothered me most. I couldn&amp;#39;t find any really satisfying or conclusive in any other guide so I really dug into it. I looked at the Katakana in the above mentioned guide and tried to recreate how it sounded in Japanese. The way it&amp;#39;s written is &amp;quot;\u30e4\u30fc\u30ca\u30e0&amp;quot; which sounds out something like &amp;quot;Yahnamu.&amp;quot; I combed Wiktionary for similar sounds and I found the Arabic word &amp;quot;\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0645&amp;quot;. That is pronounced &amp;quot;yan\u0101mu&amp;quot; and is a form of the verb &amp;quot;to sleep.&amp;quot; This is a real stretch in understanding, going from Japanese to English to Arabic, but I think this may be the source of the name.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Yahar&amp;#39;gul - When I figured out Yharnam, something clicked in my brain and I remembered that the word &amp;quot;ghoul&amp;quot; is from an Arabic creature that steals away kids. It also was a nickname for graverobbers. The Arabic &amp;quot;\u063a\u064f\u0648\u0644&amp;quot; (\u1e21\u016bl) is from the same source and means &amp;quot;taking away, snatching, grabbing.&amp;quot; Now, the Katakana for Yahar&amp;#39;gul (\u30e4\u30cf\u30b0\u30eb) is different from Yharnam (\u30e4\u30fc\u30ca\u30e0), but I think that it may mean something like &amp;quot;dream stealing.&amp;quot; Definitely makes sense considering that you get there by getting killed by a Snatcher.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cainhurst - I think that this name is partly a pun. The Cain part is most likely an allusion to Cain and Abel since the Vilebloods stole blood from Byrgenwerth. Cain even means acquire in Hebrew. However, &amp;quot;cain&amp;quot; is Welsh means fine, intricate, lovely which fits the regal and elegant nature of the Vilebloods. The &amp;quot;-hurst&amp;quot; part is very common in place names and means a wooded hill in Old English.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Byrgenwerth - This one is extremely straight forward. &amp;quot;Berg&amp;quot; means hill in place names, though more likely it comes from &amp;quot;burgh&amp;quot; which means fortified enclosure. &amp;quot;Worth&amp;quot; redundantly means enclosure as well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hypogean Gaol - Also very straightforward. &amp;quot;Hypogean&amp;quot; means underground, subterranian and gaol is an archaic spelling of jail.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hemwick Charnel Lane - &amp;quot;Hem&amp;quot; in Dutch place names means homestead, &amp;quot;wick&amp;quot; is likely a Germanic mutation of the Latin &amp;quot;vicus&amp;quot; meaning villiage, and &amp;quot;charnel&amp;quot; is an adjective referring to death and decay.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hintertomb - &amp;quot;behind the tomb.&amp;quot; Fitting for one of the earlier dungeons.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ihyll - This one took a while. I actually figured it out by stumbling across the meaning of Irithyll in Dark Souls 3. &amp;quot;Ithil&amp;quot; in Elvish means moon. Always the moon.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pthumeru - This one bothers me to no end. The &amp;quot;pth&amp;quot; is very Lovecraftian and was definitely added to nod to the Father of Cosmic Horror. But when looking at the Katakana of it, I had a thought. What if it&amp;#39;s a fusion of English and Japanese? It&amp;#39;s spelled out as &amp;quot;\u30c8\u30a5\u30e1\u30eb&amp;quot; which sounds like &amp;quot;toumeru.&amp;quot; Perhaps it&amp;#39;s meant to sound like tomb as the English word and &amp;quot;eru&amp;quot; which sounds like the verb for &amp;quot;to acquire&amp;quot; and the verb &amp;quot;to carve.&amp;quot; This isn&amp;#39;t a concrete answer, but it makes the most sense out of all the answers I could think up.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Loran &amp;amp; Izs - These I still don&amp;#39;t have an answer for. Loran is &amp;quot;\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3&amp;quot; and sounds like &amp;quot;rohran&amp;quot; which could sound like quite a few different things. Izs is &amp;quot;\u30a4\u30ba&amp;quot; and sounds like &amp;quot;isu&amp;quot; which is like the Japanese word for &amp;quot;chair,&amp;quot; but that doesn&amp;#39;t make much sense to me. Loran might have meaning behind it, but I&amp;#39;m fairly certain that Izs is just made to be difficult to pronounce and little more.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ITEMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Chikage - Literally &amp;quot;a thousand views&amp;quot; in Japanese, but sounds like &amp;quot;blood shadow.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rakuyo - Japanese for &amp;quot;falling leaf.&amp;quot; Take that meaning as you please.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rosemarinus - The Latin name for Rosemary, a bush that is used in both medicine and perfumery. This definitely alludes to the use of censers and perfumes to ward off the disease. When broken down though, the word means &amp;quot;dew of the sea.&amp;quot; Yet another mention of deep water.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Evelyn - The name is rooted in the name Avila which may mean &amp;quot;desired.&amp;quot; There was also a Saint Teresa of Avila who is the patron saint of sickness. The spelling of &amp;quot;Eve&amp;quot; makes me think it&amp;#39;s related to Eve and the Original Sin.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GROUPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Old Oto Workshop - Another mystery to me. &amp;quot;Oto&amp;quot; might be related to the name Otto, which means &amp;quot;wealth, fortune&amp;quot; which might make sense if they were one of the first workshops to delve into the Chalices.&amp;quot;Oto&amp;quot; sounds like the Japanese word for &amp;quot;sound&amp;quot; and is a form of the Latin word for &amp;quot;owl.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The School of Mensis - This one has been explained to no end, but I&amp;#39;ll mention it again. &amp;quot;Mensis&amp;quot; is the Latin word for month which ties it both to the monthly cycle of the moon and the monthly cycle of menstruation (mensis being the root of the word menstruation.) This ties it to concepts of blood, the moon, and bearing children. However, it sounds like &amp;quot;mens, mentis&amp;quot; too which is the Latin word for mind. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREAT ONES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Amygdala - The amygdala is a part of the brain and the Latin word for &amp;quot;almond tree.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ebrietas - Latin for drunkenness. Considering she&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;left-behind Great One&amp;quot; it seems to imply that Great Ones are created by imbibing in blood. Just a thought.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mergo - One of my favorites. In Latin, it means &amp;quot;I drown, sink, flood, inundate, swallow.&amp;quot; However, when referring to heavenly bodies such as stars it means &amp;quot;I go down.&amp;quot; In metaphorical speech, it means &amp;quot;I hide, conceal, suppress.&amp;quot; A wide and profound collection of meanings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flora - This is the name the Doll prays to in a rare dialogue. Flora in Ancient Rome was the goddess of flowers, but the word also means to blossom or metaphorically to be in the prime. I haven&amp;#39;t found any concrete evidence but I think it was also used in reference to a girl&amp;#39;s first period as a &amp;quot;blossoming into womanhood.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kos/Kosm - This one I don&amp;#39;t have a very solid answer to. Cos in Latin means &amp;quot;whetstone.&amp;quot; It sounds similar to the Japanese word kosu which means &amp;quot;to cross, to exceed,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;to filter,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to beat a drum.&amp;quot; None of these answers are terribly convincing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Oedon - I made a &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/4gf0c6/oedon_and_odin/\"&gt;different thread&lt;/a&gt; that talked about Oedon potentially being related to Odin. It&amp;#39;s convincing enough to me, but that&amp;#39;s just one opinion.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rom - This one I have no idea on. The translations indicate that it may also be &amp;quot;Roma&amp;quot; which is the Latin name of Rome and the deity personifying her, but I can&amp;#39;t tell what significance there is in this. Considering that both Roma and Rom are described as female, I\u2019m inclined to believe that there is a tie there, though that may be a coincidence.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NPCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Saint Adeline &amp;amp; Adella the Nun - Both of these characters are tied to the Healing Church and both have names rooted in the Germanic Adela which means &amp;quot;noble.&amp;quot; There are also Saints named Adella and Adeline, but they don&amp;#39;t seem terribly important.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Alfred - A Germanic name meaning &amp;quot;elf council.&amp;quot; Potentially referencing Saint Alfred the Great who defended England against Viking invasion, vastly improved the English society, and was generally considered to be a merciful and level headed man. Pretty stark difference to Alfred in the game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vicar Amelia - The name Amelia is Germanic and is possibly from the root amal, meaning &amp;quot;work.&amp;quot; Saint Amelia is a fairly well known saint who governs those struggling to remain faithful and healing injuries. Legend has it she was perused by a young Charlemagne who she rebuffed to become a nun. In a heated argument he accidentally broke her arm, which was miraculously healed. Her healing ability and lamenting on the frailties of men in game makes me think there might be some relation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods - This name is comprised of two names so let&amp;#39;s break it down. The &amp;quot;lise&amp;quot; portion of her name comes from Elizabeth and means &amp;quot;my god is abundance.&amp;quot; Anna comes from Hannah meaning &amp;quot;grace, favor&amp;quot; in Hebrew and appears in the Bible twice. Anna is a prophetess who recognizes Jesus as the messiah and Hannah is a wife of the king Elkanah. Hannah&amp;#39;s narrative is very similar to Annalise&amp;#39;s actually. The Biblical Hannah was one of two wives of Elkannah and was favored by the King, but could not bear a child (it&amp;#39;s described that &amp;quot;the Lord had closed her womb&amp;quot;). Elkanah&amp;#39;s other wife Peninnah had already borne several children and Hannah wanted to serve and please her king so she prayed and was blessed by the High Priest. She then became pregnant and bore a child. It&amp;#39;s a bit of a leap, I admit, but with the parallels between Hannah and Annalise, Elkanah and most likely Oedon, and Peninnah and Yharnam, it does make some sense. Oedon and Yharnam created the child Mergo, and Annalise wants to bear another child, most likely with Oedon considering how similar she is to Queen Yharnam. Take it as you will.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Defector Antal - Antal is a Hungarian variant of Anthony which has unknown origins. There are multiple Saint Anthonys in Christian traditions. Saint Anthony the Great helped establish the practice of monasticism, wandered into the wilderness to fast and contemplate where he was tempted by supernatural forces, and is a patron saint of diseases. Saint Anthony of Kiev, also called Anthony of the Caves, brought monasticism to Rus. Saint Anthony of Padua is the patron saint of lost things and people. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Archibald - A Germanic name made of the terms for &amp;quot;genuine&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bold.&amp;quot; I couldn&amp;#39;t find any Saints named Archibald.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Arianna, Woman of Pleasure - Variant of the name Ariadne meaning &amp;quot;most holy&amp;quot; in Greek. She was the daughter of King Minos in Greek mythology and helped Theseus escape the Labyrinth of the Minotaur. When he rebuffed her love, some stories say she became the wife of Dionysus. Her name being connected to a woman bearing a monstrous and mythical child and marriage to a god of wine and drunken debauchery is noteworthy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Brador the Church Assassin - I first thought this name was related to the Norse god Baldr in some way but I think it&amp;#39;s more likely tied to the Arabic name Badr which means &amp;quot;full moon.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Runesmith Caryll - A variant spelling of Carol which is from the name Charles, meaning warrior or man. Possibly used because it&amp;#39;s a homonym of the word carol, as in song.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mensis Scholar Damian - Damian comes from the Greek word &amp;quot;to tame.&amp;quot; There&amp;#39;s a Saint Damian and Cosmas who are the patron saints of physicians and surgeons.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Djura - A tricky one. It might be a Slavic variant of the name George, which means &amp;quot;farmer, earthworker.&amp;quot; The Ukranian work dzhura means page or messenger as well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dores the Graveguard - Dores is a variant of Dolores, which means &amp;quot;sorrow.&amp;quot; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Eileen the Crow - Eileen comes from either Avila meaning &amp;quot;desired&amp;quot; or Helen meaning &amp;quot;torch.&amp;quot;  Saint Helena was the mother of Emperor Constantine and the patron saint of converts. There&amp;#39;s a Saint Teresa of Avila who&amp;#39;s the patron saint of those needing divine grace, but that&amp;#39;s a stretch even by my standards.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Father Gascoigne - Meaning &amp;quot;from Gascony.&amp;quot; Interestingly, the term Gascon is a obsolete term for a braggart or bully. I definitely felt bullied when I met him.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gherman, the First Hunter - A variant form of Germanus which is Latin for &amp;quot;sibling, genuine, and real.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=pMyem0a_o3sC&amp;amp;pg=PA63&amp;amp;lpg=PA63&amp;amp;dq=gherman+bulgarian+doll&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=PgQ_EtyVZs&amp;amp;sig=Hb8BpPc9kL9jYn3Zn2PlIICWe1M&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9m8mo1prTAhXjiVQKHUiaDDMQ6AEIQTAJ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=gherman%20bulgarian%20doll&amp;amp;f=false\"&gt;This book&lt;/a&gt; notes a Bulgarian ritual called Gherman which involves burying a doll as a way to destroy the undead. Very odd.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gilbert - Germanic for &amp;quot;bright pledge.&amp;quot; Considering he gives you a flamethrower, it&amp;#39;s a very bright pledge indeed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Simple Gratia - Gratia is Latin for &amp;quot;grace.&amp;quot; Partly a pun I think, tying the word grace to a brick with fingerholes you use to bash in the skulls of werewolves, but the idea of divine grace is that humans can act as divine conduits to sanctify evil things and bestow strength. Pretty fitting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tomb Prospector Gremia - I think this name might be a reference to the Latin word gremium which means &amp;quot;lap, busom, or womb.&amp;quot; She in particular isn&amp;#39;t tied to bearing children, but it fits the motif of the game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Henryk and Henriet - Both these names derive from Henry which means &amp;quot;ruler of home.&amp;quot; There is a Saint Henry, who was the Holy Roman Emperor who tied himself closely to the Catholic Church.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Iosefka &amp;amp; Beastclaw Jozef - These names are forms of Joseph which is Hebrew for &amp;quot;God will provide&amp;quot; or more literally &amp;quot;he will add.&amp;quot; Famously the name of Jesus&amp;#39; step-father who is the patron saint of travelers, immigrants, fathers, and unborn children. Joseph of Arimathea is the man who buried Jesus&amp;#39; body after his death and is the patron saint of gravediggers. From cradle to tomb.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Irreverent Izzy - A lot of possibilities with this. It might come from Isidore which means &amp;quot;gift of Isis,&amp;quot; Isis being the Egyptian goddess of marriage, nature, death, and health. It might also come from Elizabeth meaning &amp;quot;my god is abundance.&amp;quot; It might also come from Israel which means &amp;quot;God contended.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Laurence the First Vicar - The name Laurence means &amp;quot;from Laurentum&amp;quot; and may have ties to the word laurels. There are multiple Saint Laurence&amp;#39;s, first amongst them Saint Lawrence of Rome who, when ordered to hand over the Church&amp;#39;s riches to the Roman Emperor, led the poor and sick that the Church cared for before him (he&amp;#39;s also the patron saint of comedians due to the legend that while he was being roasted alive over gridirons he was asked to be turned over because he was &amp;quot;done&amp;quot;). There&amp;#39;s also a Saint Laurence of Brindisi who lead an army to victory against the Ottoman empire armed only with a crucifix.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Martyr Logarius - A tricky one. The suffix -arius in Latin is used to make adjectives from nouns, but is also used to indicate the agent of a thing. For instance, argentum is Latin for &amp;quot;silver,&amp;quot; but argentarius means &amp;quot;banker,&amp;quot; or more literally, &amp;quot;silver dealer.&amp;quot; The log- part of his name is probably then from logos which means &amp;quot;words, witticism,&amp;quot; making his name &amp;quot;dealer of words.&amp;quot; If you take the Old English loga meaning &amp;quot;liar&amp;quot; though, his name becomes &amp;quot;user of liars.&amp;quot; Perhaps he lied to Alfred about exactly why he stayed at Cainhurst or about defeating Annalise. Just a postulation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ludwig the Holy Blade - A very straightforward name. Comprised of Germanic words meaning &amp;quot;famous&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;battle,war.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lady Maria - Maria comes directly from Mary which means &amp;quot;wished for child&amp;quot; (I&amp;#39;m not sure if that is an action, like someone who wished for a child, or a descriptor of the child, like this is the wished-for child.) Saint Mary of Nazareth is famously the mother of Jesus and patron saint of blood donors, crusaders, enlightenment, fishermen, lamp makers, mothers, ribbon makers, travelers, and virgins. Add that to the fact that she guards the Orphan of Kos, a divine child, only strengthens this tie. Also Saint Mary Magdalene was the whore who famously accompanied Jesus and is the patron saint of perfumery and penitent sinners. Perhaps Lady Maria is penitent for her role in the death of Kos?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Madaras Twins - Madaras is a Hungarian name for a fowler. May also be related to Madara, the Latvian name for the madder plant which is used for red dyes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Micolash Host of the Nightmare - Most likely a variant form of Nicholas which means &amp;quot;victor of the people.&amp;quot; Saint Nicholas is arguably the most famous saint ever and is the patron saint of children. Children like Mergo like Christmas too I guess.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prospector Olek - Olek is a variant of Alexander which means &amp;quot;defender of men.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Darkbeast Paarl - This one still stumps me. Paarl is a town name which is related to the Dutch word for &amp;quot;pearl,&amp;quot; but that doesn&amp;#39;t make much sense to me. The only one that makes even remote sense is that it comes from an obsolete meaning of parle meaning &amp;quot;a nasty encounter.&amp;quot; Cause it was definitely nasty for me.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Queen Killer - Yeah, yeah, not much origin digging needed here. I bring it up because I think it&amp;#39;s important on a few things. Since, as mentioned, the Executioners attacked Castle Cainhurst with the intent of destroying impurities, I think it&amp;#39;s safe to assume that none of them knew that Annalise was immortal. And so I think it&amp;#39;s safe to assume that they learned this by &amp;quot;trial and error&amp;quot; as it were. I think Queen Killer, who was only known as Wheel Hunter before the Old Hunters DLC, was the one who tried and failed to destroy Annalise. I also find it interesting that his summon is outside the boss room for Yharnam Pthumerian Queen, yet another immortal queen.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Simon the Harrowed - Hebrew for &amp;quot;he has heard.&amp;quot; Possibly literal in that he knows about the secret of the Hunter&amp;#39;s Nightmare. Saint Simon the Zealot is associated with fish.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Valtr - Variant of Walter meaning &amp;quot;ruler of an army.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Viola, Gascoigne&amp;#39;s Wife - Viola is a variant of Violet. Violets were used in a Roman festival called Rosalia, where the Romans would commemorate the dead. A little stretch, but oh well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Old Hunter Vitus - Latin for &amp;quot;life.&amp;quot; Can&amp;#39;t find anything more profound than that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Madman Wallar - Waller is a name that can mean &amp;quot;well or spring,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;a builder of walls,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;one with pleasant temperament.&amp;quot; Pleasant for a madman I guess.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provost Willem - A combination of the Germanic words for &amp;quot;will, desire&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;helm, protection.&amp;quot; He does have a weird helmet, but that&amp;#39;s not much.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Old Hunter Yamamura - A Japanese name for &amp;quot;mountain village.&amp;quot; Dunno if that means anything.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I got. If I forgot any names, just let me know. And again, if there are any parts that don&amp;#39;t make sense or you want more explanation, just let me know. I know Latin pretty well and Japanese barely at all, so feel free to come to your own translations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I've a soft spot in my heart for etymology and name origins so I was pretty frustrated when I couldn't find a comprehensive name guide on the internet anywhere.

I couldn't find any really satisfying or conclusive in any other guide so I really dug into it. I looked at the Katakana in the above mentioned guide and tried to recreate how it sounded in Japanese. The way it's written is \"\u30e4\u30fc\u30ca\u30e0\" which sounds out something like \"Yahnamu.\" I combed Wiktionary for similar sounds and I found the Arabic word \"\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0645\". That is pronounced \"yan\u0101mu\" and is a form of the verb \"to sleep.\" This is a real stretch in understanding, going from Japanese to English to Arabic, but I think this may be the source of the name.\n* Yahar'gul - When I figured out Yharnam, something clicked in my brain and I remembered that the word \"ghoul\" is from an Arabic creature that steals away kids. It also was a nickname for graverobbers. The Arabic \"\u063a\u064f\u0648\u0644\" (\u1e21\u016bl) is from the same source and means \"taking away, snatching, grabbing.\" Now, the Katakana for Yahar'gul (\u30e4\u30cf\u30b0\u30eb) is different from Yharnam (\u30e4\u30fc\u30ca\u30e0), but I think that it may mean something like \"dream stealing.\" Definitely makes sense considering that you get there by getting killed by a Snatcher.\n* Cainhurst - I think that this name is partly a pun. The Cain part is most likely an allusion to Cain and Abel since the Vilebloods stole blood from Byrgenwerth. Cain even means acquire in Hebrew. However, \"cain\" is Welsh means fine, intricate, lovely which fits the regal and elegant nature of the Vilebloods. The \"-hurst\" part is very common in place names and means a wooded hill in Old English.\n* Byrgenwerth - This one is extremely straight forward. \"Berg\" means hill in place names, though more likely it comes from \"burgh\" which means fortified enclosure. \"Worth\" redundantly means enclosure as well.\n* Hypogean Gaol - Also very straightforward. \"Hypogean\" means underground, subterranian and gaol is an archaic spelling of jail.\n* Hemwick Charnel Lane - \"Hem\" in Dutch place names means homestead, \"wick\" is likely a Germanic mutation of the Latin \"vicus\" meaning villiage, and \"charnel\" is an adjective referring to death and decay.\n* Hintertomb - \"behind the tomb.\" Fitting for one of the earlier dungeons.\n* Ihyll - This one took a while. I actually figured it out by stumbling across the meaning of Irithyll in Dark Souls 3. \"Ithil\" in Elvish means moon. Always the moon.\n* Pthumeru - This one bothers me to no end. The \"pth\" is very Lovecraftian and was definitely added to nod to the Father of Cosmic Horror. But when looking at the Katakana of it, I had a thought. What if it's a fusion of English and Japanese? It's spelled out as \"\u30c8\u30a5\u30e1\u30eb\" which sounds like \"toumeru.\" Perhaps it's meant to sound like tomb as the English word and \"eru\" which sounds like the verb for \"to acquire\" and the verb \"to carve.\" This isn't a concrete answer, but it makes the most sense out of all the answers I could think up.\n* Loran &amp; Izs - These I still don't have an answer for. Loran is \"\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\" and sounds like \"rohran\" which could sound like quite a few different things. Izs is \"\u30a4\u30ba\" and sounds like \"isu\" which is like the Japanese word for \"chair,\" but that doesn't make much sense to me. Loran might have meaning behind it, but I'm fairly certain that Izs is just made to be difficult to pronounce and little more.\n\n**ITEMS**\n\n* Chikage - Literally \"a thousand views\" in Japanese, but sounds like \"blood shadow.\"\n* Rakuyo - Japanese for \"falling leaf.\" Take that meaning as you please.\n* Rosemarinus - The Latin name for Rosemary, a bush that is used in both medicine and perfumery. This definitely alludes to the use of censers and perfumes to ward off the disease. When broken down though, the word means \"dew of the sea.\" Yet another mention of deep water.\n* Evelyn - The name is rooted in the name Avila which may mean \"desired.\" There was also a Saint Teresa of Avila who is the patron saint of sickness. The spelling of \"Eve\" makes me think it's related to Eve and the Original Sin.\n\n**GROUPS**\n\n* Old Oto Workshop - Another mystery to me. \"Oto\" might be related to the name Otto, which means \"wealth, fortune\" which might make sense if they were one of the first workshops to delve into the Chalices.\"Oto\" sounds like the Japanese word for \"sound\" and is a form of the Latin word for \"owl.\"\n* The School of Mensis - This one has been explained to no end, but I'll mention it again. \"Mensis\" is the Latin word for month which ties it both to the monthly cycle of the moon and the monthly cycle of menstruation (mensis being the root of the word menstruation.) This ties it to concepts of blood, the moon, and bearing children. However, it sounds like \"mens, mentis\" too which is the Latin word for mind. \n\n**GREAT ONES**\n\n* Amygdala - The amygdala is a part of the brain and the Latin word for \"almond tree.\"\n* Ebrietas - Latin for drunkenness. Considering she's a \"left-behind Great One\" it seems to imply that Great Ones are created by imbibing in blood. Just a thought.\n* Mergo - One of my favorites. In Latin, it means \"I drown, sink, flood, inundate, swallow.\" However, when referring to heavenly bodies such as stars it means \"I go down.\" In metaphorical speech, it means \"I hide, conceal, suppress.\" A wide and profound collection of meanings.\n* Flora - This is the name the Doll prays to in a rare dialogue. Flora in Ancient Rome was the goddess of flowers, but the word also means to blossom or metaphorically to be in the prime. I haven't found any concrete evidence but I think it was also used in reference to a girl's first period as a \"blossoming into womanhood.\"\n* Kos/Kosm - This one I don't have a very solid answer to. Cos in Latin means \"whetstone.\" It sounds similar to the Japanese word kosu which means \"to cross, to exceed,\" \"to filter,\" and \"to beat a drum.\" None of these answers are terribly convincing.\n* Oedon - I made a [different thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/4gf0c6/oedon_and_odin/) that talked about Oedon potentially being related to Odin. It's convincing enough to me, but that's just one opinion.\n* Rom - This one I have no idea on. The translations indicate that it may also be \"Roma\" which is the Latin name of Rome and the deity personifying her, but I can't tell what significance there is in this. Considering that both Roma and Rom are described as female, I\u2019m inclined to believe that there is a tie there, though that may be a coincidence.\n\n**NPCS**\n\n* Saint Adeline &amp; Adella the Nun - Both of these characters are tied to the Healing Church and both have names rooted in the Germanic Adela which means \"noble.\" There are also Saints named Adella and Adeline, but they don't seem terribly important.\n* Alfred - A Germanic name meaning \"elf council.\" Potentially referencing Saint Alfred the Great who defended England against Viking invasion, vastly improved the English society, and was generally considered to be a merciful and level headed man. Pretty stark difference to Alfred in the game.\n* Vicar Amelia - The name Amelia is Germanic and is possibly from the root amal, meaning \"work.\" Saint Amelia is a fairly well known saint who governs those struggling to remain faithful and healing injuries. Legend has it she was perused by a young Charlemagne who she rebuffed to become a nun. In a heated argument he accidentally broke her arm, which was miraculously healed. Her healing ability and lamenting on the frailties of men in game makes me think there might be some relation.\n* Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods - This name is comprised of two names so let's break it down. The \"lise\" portion of her name comes from Elizabeth and means \"my god is abundance.\" Anna comes from Hannah meaning \"grace, favor\" in Hebrew and appears in the Bible twice. Anna is a prophetess who recognizes Jesus as the messiah and Hannah is a wife of the king Elkanah. Hannah's narrative is very similar to Annalise's actually. The Biblical Hannah was one of two wives of Elkannah and was favored by the King, but could not bear a child (it's described that \"the Lord had closed her womb\"). Elkanah's other wife Peninnah had already borne several children and Hannah wanted to serve and please her king so she prayed and was blessed by the High Priest. She then became pregnant and bore a child. It's a bit of a leap, I admit, but with the parallels between Hannah and Annalise, Elkanah and most likely Oedon, and Peninnah and Yharnam, it does make some sense. Oedon and Yharnam created the child Mergo, and Annalise wants to bear another child, most likely with Oedon considering how similar she is to Queen Yharnam. Take it as you will.\n* Defector Antal - Antal is a Hungarian variant of Anthony which has unknown origins. There are multiple Saint Anthonys in Christian traditions. Saint Anthony the Great helped establish the practice of monasticism, wandered into the wilderness to fast and contemplate where he was tempted by supernatural forces, and is a patron saint of diseases. Saint Anthony of Kiev, also called Anthony of the Caves, brought monasticism to Rus. Saint Anthony of Padua is the patron saint of lost things and people. \n* Archibald - A Germanic name made of the terms for \"genuine\" and \"bold.\" I couldn't find any Saints named Archibald.\n* Arianna, Woman of Pleasure - Variant of the name Ariadne meaning \"most holy\" in Greek. She was the daughter of King Minos in Greek mythology and helped Theseus escape the Labyrinth of the Minotaur. When he rebuffed her love, some stories say she became the wife of Dionysus. Her name being connected to a woman bearing a monstrous and mythical child and marriage to a god of wine and drunken debauchery is noteworthy.\n* Brador the Church Assassin - I first thought this name was related to the Norse god Baldr in some way but I think it's more likely tied to the Arabic name Badr which means \"full moon.\"\n* Runesmith Caryll - A variant spelling of Carol which is from the name Charles, meaning warrior or man. Possibly used because it's a homonym of the word carol, as in song.\n* Mensis Scholar Damian - Damian comes from the Greek word \"to tame.\" There's a Saint Damian and Cosmas who are the patron saints of physicians and surgeons.\n* Djura - A tricky one. It might be a Slavic variant of the name George, which means \"farmer, earthworker.\" The Ukranian work dzhura means page or messenger as well.\n* Dores the Graveguard - Dores is a variant of Dolores, which means \"sorrow.\" \n* Eileen the Crow - Eileen comes from either Avila meaning \"desired\" or Helen meaning \"torch.\"  Saint Helena was the mother of Emperor Constantine and the patron saint of converts. There's a Saint Teresa of Avila who's the patron saint of those needing divine grace, but that's a stretch even by my standards.\n* Father Gascoigne - Meaning \"from Gascony.\" Interestingly, the term Gascon is a obsolete term for a braggart or bully. I definitely felt bullied when I met him.\n* Gherman, the First Hunter - A variant form of Germanus which is Latin for \"sibling, genuine, and real.\" [This book](https://books.google.com/books?id=pMyem0a_o3sC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=gherman+bulgarian+doll&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PgQ_EtyVZs&amp;sig=Hb8BpPc9kL9jYn3Zn2PlIICWe1M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9m8mo1prTAhXjiVQKHUiaDDMQ6AEIQTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=gherman%20bulgarian%20doll&amp;f=false) notes a Bulgarian ritual called Gherman which involves burying a doll as a way to destroy the undead. Very odd.\n* Gilbert - Germanic for \"bright pledge.\" Considering he gives you a flamethrower, it's a very bright pledge indeed.\n* Simple Gratia - Gratia is Latin for \"grace.\" Partly a pun I think, tying the word grace to a brick with fingerholes you use to bash in the skulls of werewolves, but the idea of divine grace is that humans can act as divine conduits to sanctify evil things and bestow strength. Pretty fitting.\n* Tomb Prospector Gremia - I think this name might be a reference to the Latin word gremium which means \"lap, busom, or womb.\" She in particular isn't tied to bearing children, but it fits the motif of the game.\n* Henryk and Henriet - Both these names derive from Henry which means \"ruler of home.\" There is a Saint Henry, who was the Holy Roman Emperor who tied himself closely to the Catholic Church.\n* Iosefka &amp; Beastclaw Jozef - These names are forms of Joseph which is Hebrew for \"God will provide\" or more literally \"he will add.\" Famously the name of Jesus' step-father who is the patron saint of travelers, immigrants, fathers, and unborn children. Joseph of Arimathea is the man who buried Jesus' body after his death and is the patron saint of gravediggers. From cradle to tomb.\n* Irreverent Izzy - A lot of possibilities with this. It might come from Isidore which means \"gift of Isis,\" Isis being the Egyptian goddess of marriage, nature, death, and health. It might also come from Elizabeth meaning \"my god is abundance.\" It might also come from Israel which means \"God contended.\"\n* Laurence the First Vicar - The name Laurence means \"from Laurentum\" and may have ties to the word laurels. There are multiple Saint Laurence's, first amongst them Saint Lawrence of Rome who, when ordered to hand over the Church's riches to the Roman Emperor, led the poor and sick that the Church cared for before him (he's also the patron saint of comedians due to the legend that while he was being roasted alive over gridirons he was asked to be turned over because he was \"done\"). There's also a Saint Laurence of Brindisi who lead an army to victory against the Ottoman empire armed only with a crucifix.\n* Martyr Logarius - A tricky one. The suffix -arius in Latin is used to make adjectives from nouns, but is also used to indicate the agent of a thing. For instance, argentum is Latin for \"silver,\" but argentarius means \"banker,\" or more literally, \"silver dealer.\" The log- part of his name is probably then from logos which means \"words, witticism,\" making his name \"dealer of words.\" If you take the Old English loga meaning \"liar\" though, his name becomes \"user of liars.\" Perhaps he lied to Alfred about exactly why he stayed at Cainhurst or about defeating Annalise. Just a postulation.\n* Ludwig the Holy Blade - A very straightforward name. Comprised of Germanic words meaning \"famous\" and \"battle,war.\"\n* Lady Maria - Maria comes directly from Mary which means \"wished for child\" (I'm not sure if that is an action, like someone who wished for a child, or a descriptor of the child, like this is the wished-for child.) Saint Mary of Nazareth is famously the mother of Jesus and patron saint of blood donors, crusaders, enlightenment, fishermen, lamp makers, mothers, ribbon makers, travelers, and virgins. Add that to the fact that she guards the Orphan of Kos, a divine child, only strengthens this tie. Also Saint Mary Magdalene was the whore who famously accompanied Jesus and is the patron saint of perfumery and penitent sinners. Perhaps Lady Maria is penitent for her role in the death of Kos?\n* The Madaras Twins - Madaras is a Hungarian name for a fowler. May also be related to Madara, the Latvian name for the madder plant which is used for red dyes.\n* Micolash Host of the Nightmare - Most likely a variant form of Nicholas which means \"victor of the people.\" Saint Nicholas is arguably the most famous saint ever and is the patron saint of children. Children like Mergo like Christmas too I guess.\n* Prospector Olek - Olek is a variant of Alexander which means \"defender of men.\"\n* Darkbeast Paarl - This one still stumps me. Paarl is a town name which is related to the Dutch word for \"pearl,\" but that doesn't make much sense to me. The only one that makes even remote sense is that it comes from an obsolete meaning of parle meaning \"a nasty encounter.\" Cause it was definitely nasty for me.\n* Queen Killer - Yeah, yeah, not much origin digging needed here. I bring it up because I think it's important on a few things. Since, as mentioned, the Executioners attacked Castle Cainhurst with the intent of destroying impurities, I think it's safe to assume that none of them knew that Annalise was immortal. And so I think it's safe to assume that they learned this by \"trial and error\" as it were. I think Queen Killer, who was only known as Wheel Hunter before the Old Hunters DLC, was the one who tried and failed to destroy Annalise. I also find it interesting that his summon is outside the boss room for Yharnam Pthumerian Queen, yet another immortal queen.\n* Simon the Harrowed - Hebrew for \"he has heard.\" Possibly literal in that he knows about the secret of the Hunter's Nightmare. Saint Simon the Zealot is associated with fish.\n* Valtr - Variant of Walter meaning \"ruler of an army.\"\n* Viola, Gascoigne's Wife - Viola is a variant of Violet. Violets were used in a Roman festival called Rosalia, where the Romans would commemorate the dead. A little stretch, but oh well.\n* Old Hunter Vitus - Latin for \"life.\" Can't find anything more profound than that.\n* Madman Wallar - Waller is a name that can mean \"well or spring,\" \"a builder of walls,\" or \"one with pleasant temperament.\" Pleasant for a madman I guess.\n* Provost Willem - A combination of the Germanic words for \"will, desire\" and \"helm, protection.\" He does have a weird helmet, but that's not much.\n* Old Hunter Yamamura - A Japanese name for \"mountain village.\" Dunno if that means anything.\n\nThat's all I got. If I forgot any names, just let me know. And again, if there are any parts that don't make sense or you want more explanation, just let me know. I know Latin pretty well and Japanese barely at all, so feel free to come to your own translations.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null,
