By that time (if you don't love th9 wars) start planning to th10. Storages/drills of th8 are just to small, so they already have a \"penalty\" going on (they not showing up for th10s just makes life easier). you have more offensive capabilities on th10 and an extra drill. It feels like a loot penalty doesn't exist if you do collector raids. If you do storage raids, loot penalty is the least of your problems, since storage raiding is a self imposed penalty already.\n- rush to th11, right? Nope.
