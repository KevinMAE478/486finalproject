He is joining the team from his home in the USA northeast, and he\u2019s definitely excited to be going!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APEX (Why So Golem?) - th11 (109k, 45/45/20) - &lt;a href=\"/u/ApexTheGod\"&gt;/u/ApexTheGod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone who enjoyed the last Reddit v Forums scrim or who is looking forward to this one needs to give thanks to Apex Predator!  He prefers not to post publically but is very active doing administration for Reddit events.  For this scrim, he is working hard behind the scenes from the Reddit side with rosters and organization to make sure this war all comes together.  His experience for planning scrims is well honed in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAllianceClans/wiki/members\"&gt;Reddit Alliance Clans&lt;/a&gt; (RAC) where he served as the Lead Scrim Planner for a majority of their clan alliance scrims.

He plays in competitive matches on a regular basis in Potluck, arranged wars, and within the &lt;a href=\"https://www.championswarleague.com\"&gt;Champions War League&lt;/a&gt; as WSG? Was in CWL Lite in Season 1 and is now in CWL Rising in Season 2 where he helps coordinate the matches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In \u201creal life\u201d away from the game, Apex is in the US Navy, is a husband, and is a father to three beautiful boys.  He spends his off time hunting, fishing, building hot rods, and coaching basketball and American football. He also used to be an amatuer MMA fighter.  He travels a lot for work and is really looking forward to seeing Finland too, since that\u2019s a place he\u2019s never been!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His favorite places so far have been \u201ceither Mecca for the eye opening experience, any third world country to humble me and remind me to be grateful, Thailand for the kickboxing experience in my youth, or Australia because it was just a great place.\u201d  Although it\u2019s likely Supercell will keep him and the others very busy, if he gets a chance, he\u2019d like to \u201clearn about Sami culture, Kuppaus, see the suomenlinna, and the Temppeliauko Kilisesi church and find some chill locals to hang out all night with.\u201d  Supercell, are you listening?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, he\u2019s very excited for the event.  Already he\u2019s finding that Supercell really knows how to roll out the red carpet and he\u2019s still wondering if it\u2019s all some kind of elaborate joke.  But, as the live stream will show: It\u2019s real!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Jong Un (Reddit Zen) - th10 (86k, 40/40) - &lt;a href=\"/u/jeeeeefff\"&gt;/u/jeeeeefff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kim Jong Un is another &lt;a href=\"/r/ClashofClans\"&gt;/r/ClashofClans&lt;/a&gt; regular and participant in many of the game forums.

Reddit Zen is one of the RCS Clans competing in the RCS War Tournament, making it to the Elite Eight, and KJU has been doing most of the arranging for his clan in that.  Lately, he is also breaking into CWL on alternate accounts with &lt;a href=\"http://enigmacoc.com\"&gt;Code Enigma&lt;/a&gt;, and his main focus in the game is on improving 10v10 skills.  He\u2019s very pleased to have pulled off a couple of three star 10v10s in his tournament wars, and of course hopes to during the Livestream as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;KJU is well known by many in the RCS as being a strong participant and helping as a war general in many of their events including mixed scrims and potlucks.  He participated in the last Reddit v Forums war and is hoping the forums show up with their \u201cI love Tormund\u201d shirts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He does cheat on clash with DOTA2, and also spends time programming and working with information security.  KJU was the last addition to the team, so had to make plans in a hurry, but his boss is going to have to be okay with it because he\u2019s thrilled to be offered the chance.

They\u2019ve had over 75 clans at a time competing, and she is one of the main moderators helping it run smooth, in addition to submitting our subreddit\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/5s1t5b/war_cocpotluck_a_recurring_community_event/\"&gt;Community Spotlight&lt;/a&gt; on the topic for February.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coming to the event from her home in Cape Town South Africa, Leane is a strong townhall 9 and Leader of the very strong clan Reddit Viper, also an RCS clan, which has competed both in the Season 1 Midseason CWL and now in Season 2 CWL Rising tournaments.  As a member of the Reddit Clan System, they also are competing in the RCS War Tournament as one of the top seeded teams.  Together with their feeder Viper Pit, Vipers came onto the war scene strong last year after the swerved their focus toward becoming competitive and now are well known, thanks to Leane and her dedicated Co-Leaders.  Viper has also put teams into the Clash Cup and are on the lookout for other events in the community to join.  Leane herself is always looking for the next way to sharpen the fangs of her Vipers and spends most weekends guiding their wars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leane has also been a member of &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/clashbabes?lang=en\"&gt;Clash Babes&lt;/a&gt;, the all girls war clashing community, and herself often subs into events, including joining the first Reddit vs. Forums war and other various scrims throughout Clash of Clans.  As she surely had not nearly enough to do she has just recently added \u201c&lt;a href=\"https://goo.gl/NwSvJa\"&gt;Clash Cup&lt;/a&gt; Coordinator\u201d to her resume...now you can find her there, too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A long term townhall 9, war is the main focus of her gaming, but is the people that make her keep coming back and logging in.  \u201cMy clan and the friends I\u2019ve made.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She started playing in March 2014, and Reddit Viper was her first real clan.  She found it as a townhall 5 in April of 2014 and has been there ever since, rising to become it\u2019s leader well before they entered the competitive scene.  She found them, ironically enough, on the forums and didn\u2019t know reddit existed until she was sent to find the RCS password!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has no idea what to expect in Finland, but is looking forward to the trip!  Like almost anyone invited to a live stream, she finds the idea of attacking on live stream terrifying...but at least she\u2019ll openly admit it!

He\u2019s been one of the key moderators in spiffying the sub up!  And of course, he has been instrumental in putting together these Reddit v. Forum wars from the Reddit side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will often see him moderating posts, but also posting Community Spotlight posts, commenting in the &lt;a href=\"/r/ClashofClans\"&gt;/r/ClashofClans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://discord.gg/Clashofclans\"&gt;discord&lt;/a&gt; and putting together things for the sub like the contests and AMAs of this past month.  He\u2019s been looking hard at how to improve traffic to the sub and has worked at implementing ideas on how to do so.  He was one of the several moderators behind the subreddit\u2019s new look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, many will also know Goatman_12 from other parts of clash.  He is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAllianceClans\"&gt;Reddit Alliance Clans&lt;/a&gt; (RAC) since early 2016 after the Alliance reorganized and has been leading them strongly, growing both their numbers and the profiles of his clans.  He has been one of the factors behind all the events the Alliance does and is involved in and helped to induct many of their clans.  He has a love of organizing and gathering others to accomplish tasks that\u2019s served his Alliance well and definitely is contributing to the Reddit v. Forums scrims as well.  He enjoys talking to people and at one time or another has been found in almost every large chat in the Clash of Clans community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His primary goals in the game and the community at large are help others have fun playing the game and to form visions of what might be and work about implementing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He started in Reddit Frost, then ended up with leadership of Reddit Frostbyte which broke off from the RCS and joined the RAC.  He has has two townhall 9 accounts (both named Goatman_12), one of which learned to war in Reddit Mu and now resides in Reddit Alchemy, joining them as they were finishing CWL Season 1 and now warring with them in CWL Invite Season 2.  Alchemy also participates in a number of other events in the Community and Goatman often joins in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While in Finland, he\u2019s eager to participate in the event and meet the players, but he\u2019s also hoping to be able to just walk around the area a bit and enjoy being there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goatman is a hardworking faithful husband and father of four from St Louis, Missouri.  He got his passport just to attend this event.  It\u2019ll be a whole new experience, and he is looking forward to it.

He enjoys talking to people and at one time or another has been found in almost every large chat in the Clash of Clans community.\n\nHis primary goals in the game and the community at large are help others have fun playing the game and to form visions of what might be and work about implementing them.\n\nHe started in Reddit Frost, then ended up with leadership of Reddit Frostbyte which broke off from the RCS and joined the RAC.  He has has two townhall 9 accounts (both named Goatman_12), one of which learned to war in Reddit Mu and now resides in Reddit Alchemy, joining them as they were finishing CWL Season 1 and now warring with them in CWL Invite Season 2.  Alchemy also participates in a number of other events in the Community and Goatman often joins in.\n\nWhile in Finland, he\u2019s eager to participate in the event and meet the players, but he\u2019s also hoping to be able to just walk around the area a bit and enjoy being there.\n\nGoatman is a hardworking faithful husband and father of four from St Louis, Missouri.  He got his passport just to attend this event.  It\u2019ll be a whole new experience, and he is looking forward to it.  His kids will be watching!\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Five Redditors in Finland this week!
