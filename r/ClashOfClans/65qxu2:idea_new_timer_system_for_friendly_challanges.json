The fact of the matter is that every base has to adhere to certain structures. The strongest defense towers will *always* be protected. Trash buildings will *always* be put in front of defenses... etc etc.\nOriginal base building is good, but you can only be so original before you end up with just a stupid and easily destroyed base\n\nAnd in the end, if you only want to move a couple walls and challenge, or switch out two defenses, there's no reason to *not* have the 24hr cap set to 75% base movement.

And if you then factor in that more than one person might be doing it, there could be 8 different bases. Or 16 or 32 different bases that they could engineer into passable facsimiles of the base that needs to be destroyed. I think that if it&amp;#39;s easy to do, you&amp;#39;d be surprised how many people will do it.\nAlso, while I agree that original bases are good. The fact of the matter is that every base has to adhere to certain structures. The strongest defense towers will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be protected. Trash buildings will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be put in front of defenses... etc etc.\nOriginal base building is good, but you can only be so original before you end up with just a stupid and easily destroyed base&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in the end, if you only want to move a couple walls and challenge, or switch out two defenses, there&amp;#39;s no reason to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have the 24hr cap set to 75% base movement. It&amp;#39;s not an unreasonable amount, and it would barely even affect the people who would want it for legitimate reasons&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: to be clear, I&amp;#39;m not saying that all bases are the same or similar. I&amp;#39;m saying that across 4 different variations of bases, you&amp;#39;d be able to have enough variety that there would be very few base designs that don&amp;#39;t share things with one of the designs you have preset&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ClashOfClans", "name": "t1_dgdcjzn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492454741.0, "created_utc": 1492425941.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdc43g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bomonty18", "parent_id": "t1_dgd959g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ClashOfClans", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Interesting point.

Well done. Though I have think that there should be a maximum number of moves you can make before you get a 24hr cooldown.
