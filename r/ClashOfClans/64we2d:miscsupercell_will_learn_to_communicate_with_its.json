In the past SC would invite top YouTubers to their HQ and allow them to give out bits of info to their subscribers. They even leaked out Clan Wars prior to it's launch. Anyone remember the photo of Daddy standing next to a chalk board with the Clan Wars icon behind him? All of this created excitement in the community and gave players thinking of quitting a reason to hang around.\n\nNow, the forums have been abandoned to mods, many of whom have little idea of what is happening than the average long term player does. The forums now just seem filled with sock puppet posts such as, \"Best Troop in CoC?\" or quickly deleted - or moved - serious complaint posts.\n\nSomeone did post the time between prior updates and this, by far, has been the longest. I get that they want to get the update correct and that it may take them more time than they planned, but is it so impossible to just literally say that via their various social media outlets?

In the past SC would invite top YouTubers to their HQ and allow them to give out bits of info to their subscribers. They even leaked out Clan Wars prior to it&amp;#39;s launch. Anyone remember the photo of Daddy standing next to a chalk board with the Clan Wars icon behind him? All of this created excitement in the community and gave players thinking of quitting a reason to hang around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, the forums have been abandoned to mods, many of whom have little idea of what is happening than the average long term player does.
