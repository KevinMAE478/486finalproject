As farming is a true passion of mine, I have taken the liberty of composing a guide for farming dark elixir as efficiently as possible. We all know there are strategies using very powerful troops to effectively 3 star bases, but as farming is all about the efficiency, I like to use cheaper troops that will increase net profits and reduce cooking times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this guide, I will explain how to identify bases, how to locate the loot and know how much is where, troop behavior, funneling as well as specific dark elixir farming strategies for the top four town hall levels individually. I will also include an in-depth goblin/goblin knife section. The strategies explained will be using lower tier troops, including but not limited to barbarians, archers, goblins and giants. I will try to include screenshots and videos wherever possible for more detailed illustrations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Targets and loot location&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When farming, it is imperative that you\u2019re able to quickly identify what type of base you have in front of you and where the loot is located, since you are only given 30 seconds to either hit \u201cNext\u201d or start attacking the base. Obviously the first thing you want to look at is the available loot in the top left corner, but the number itself will not tell you whether to attack the base (unless it is very low then of course you hit \u201cnext\u201d). You want to be able to locate &lt;strong&gt;exactly where&lt;/strong&gt; the loot is hiding and how much of it is there. It may sound difficult at first, but knowing how it works and what numbers to keep in mind, this will soon come naturally. \nThe most important number to learn is your \u201cTown Hall Specific &lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt; Capacity\u201d (THSSC) for available loot. This number is the maximum amount you can find in the storages (the town hall is part of the storage, it will have to be destroyed as well to get the full amount). The dark elixir THSSC\u2019s are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;TH8:  2,000&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;TH9:  2,500&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;TH10: 3,000&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;TH11: 3,500&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is assuming the target has upgraded his dark elixir storage, and that you aren\u2019t looking at a target below your own town hall level wherein a &lt;strong&gt;penalty&lt;/strong&gt; will be added to the equation. &lt;a href=\"http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki/Raids\"&gt;The specific penalties are shown in this page if you scroll down to the table labeled \u201cTown Hall Levels\u2014Loot Multiplier\u201d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb is that if the target\u2019s dark elixir storage appears to be at least half full, you can expect to find the entire THSSC amount in the storage and town hall. The exception here is TH8 where the level of storage has a great impact on how full the storage must appear to be, in order to carry the entire THSSC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;Target Groups&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to divide &lt;strong&gt;high loot targets&lt;/strong&gt; into 3 different groups; &lt;strong&gt;Active bases&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Inactive bases&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Hybrids&lt;/strong&gt;. Being able to distinguish between the 3 different scenarios will help you determine whether to attack a base, and if you do, where and how to attack it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active bases&lt;/strong&gt; are recognized by an available loot amount very close to the THSSC and the dark elixir storage will appear to be at least half full, showing that almost all the available loot is indeed in the storage and the town hall. These bases will carry very little dark elixir in the drills. They are called active bases because the owner is actively collecting loot from the production buildings leaving them rather empty. Examples: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/hqswkqx.png\"&gt;TH8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/mluVM7E.png\"&gt;TH9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/KLEGPij.jpg\"&gt;TH10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/fPM4aI6.png\"&gt;TH11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inactive bases&lt;/strong&gt; are characterized by a high amount of loot of all three types and the gold/elixir amounts are often almost identical. Their storages will appear to be completely empty. Typically, these bases are without a trophy league shield and have many tombstones around the base. They are called inactive bases because the owner hasn\u2019t been online for a very long time and their bases have been victims of many attacks, thus having empty storages. However, their collectors will continue to produce resources and provide good available loot. Examples: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/KuJe7Dm.png\"&gt;TH8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/X6kKp5N.png\"&gt;TH9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/jScqg4A.jpg\"&gt;TH10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/iLzIiBJ.png\"&gt;TH11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrids&lt;/strong&gt; (or semi-inactive bases) are essentially bases that carry a lot of loot inside the storages as well as in the collectors. To identify these bases one must look at the available loot as well as the dark elixir storage and compare it to the THSSC. If for example you are looking at a TH9, and the available loot is 4,300 and the dark elixir storage is at least half full, you will immediately know that the THSSC amount of 2,500 will be in the storage/town hall, and the two dark drills will have 900 each. Another example on the same town hall could be if the available loot is 2800 and the dark elixir storage shows very little dark elixir, this would mean that there is a relatively small amount, maybe around 1,000 dark elixir in the storage, and the rest is all in the drills. Being able to identify Hybrids and how much of the loot is where, will help you avoid sending an entire army to the core only to realize that a huge portion of the loot is actually in the collectors. Examples: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/zCz54WR.png\"&gt;TH8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/D5M3QTg.png\"&gt;TH9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/1ckbs2g.jpg\"&gt;TH10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/IrdHuyT.png\"&gt;TH11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have made no mention of the Clan Castle, because if it is carrying any dark elixir it will in general be a relatively small amount. But keep in mind that this building contains the treasury and can potentially carry some dark elixir too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Goblins and Goblin Knife&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I go into specific town hall strategies I want to give the goblins a section of their own as they are an important part of this guide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;What is a Goblin Knife?&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The strategy called Goblin Knife is basically an attack where you use a massive number of goblins to cut right into the core of a base to take out the dark elixir storage and the town hall. Targets you look for in these types of attacks are Active bases and Hybrids where the dark elixir storage and town hall are relatively close to each other. While there are a vast variety of army compositions and strategies, I\u2019m going to be very bold here and say that the majority of them aren\u2019t utilizing the goblin\u2019s powers very well. To unleash the true and awesome potential of the goblin one must first understand how the goblin\u2019s world works. Learn to see the bases through his eyes, and appreciate his unbelievable damage output towards resource buildings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;Goblin Behavior&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goblin\u2019s world is simple, he is a greedy fellow that has his eyes set for resource buildings. And like any other troops that have favorite targets he will ignore every other type of buildings and enemy troops so long there is a single resource building left on the map. When he is deployed, he will run to the closest resource building still standing and then from there onwards to the next closest resource building. In order to become a master of goblins you simply have to become a goblin yourself. Learn to look at a base through his greedy eyes, where are the resource buildings, what\u2019s the distance between them, which one is closest, where is the next closest building. Again, this may sound difficult but it is very easy once you realize how it works. It is also essential when planning a Goblin Knife attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;Goblin Damage Output&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are no troops in the game that come even remotely close to the \u201cdamage per second/housing space\u201d of a goblin. Let\u2019s compare the TH9 level 6 goblin with the level 6 wizard having them attack a resource building. The level 6 wizard does 185 damage per second, but as he takes up 4 housing space we must divide his damage by 4, 185/4\u224846 dps/HS. While the level 6 goblin has a breathtaking 84 dps/HS. Let\u2019s keep this information in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;Planning the Path&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now let\u2019s get back to the strategy itself. To send the goblins towards the core of a base, a path must be created, with respects to the goblin behavior. To help create the path you will almost always have to perform a &lt;strong&gt;resource building&lt;/strong&gt; funnel. If you aren\u2019t familiar with the concept of a funnel, &lt;em&gt;Powerbang Gaming&lt;/em&gt; does a great job explaining it in &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7q-_6drHQI\"&gt;This Video&lt;/a&gt;. The resource building funnel does the same thing as a regular funnel, but only removing resource buildings. Hence, the only troops affected by the resource building funnel are goblins. Which is exactly what you want, because they are the ones you want to send to the core. The second thing you need, to help create the path, is a way to bypass walls. Here you can either use wall breakers, jump spells or earthquake spells. Personally, I prefer jump spells over the other two and the reason is very simple, jump spells are more reliable than wall breakers precision-wise and earthquake spells cost dark elixir. The third and &lt;strong&gt;very important&lt;/strong&gt; tool used to create a goblin path are walls left intact. Remember, you want your goblins to head for the core and get the town hall and dark elixir storage, they can\u2019t afford visiting too many compartments and clearing all kinds of storages on their way to the core. &lt;strong&gt;Only open wall sections that are absolutely necessary in order to create a path to the core&lt;/strong&gt;. I can\u2019t stress this enough. Though there is one exception. When a closed compartment containing resource buildings is very close to the intended deployment area, after deploying around half of your goblins and the \u201cbread crumbs trail\u201d (resource buildings path towards the core) is getting further and further away, the last goblins might decide to break the walls and go for closer resource buildings. There are ways to avoid this which I will explain further in the town hall specific strategies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;Funneling&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you have figured out a path from an intended deployment area to the core of a base, you start your attack with an outside resource building funnel. This means, you start from the deployment location \u201cfacing\u201d the core and looking on your right and left hand side outside the outer wall for resource buildings. Clear all resource buildings on both sides of your entry in a distance equivalent to at least the length from your deployment area to the core. &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/s7hfnBM.jpg\"&gt;In this screenshot example&lt;/a&gt; you see the 4 resource buildings on both sides of the entry point that has to be destroyed prior to the attack. The yellow lines indicate the approximate distance that requires your attention. The 3 resource buildings right in front of the deployment area are on the path to the core, so they don\u2019t have to be removed beforehand.  Troops used to make this outside funnel is entirely up to you. Traditional goblin knives typically use a combination of barch and/or wizards with some giants to tank, to get the job done. But here is the interesting part, a few goblins will destroy these buildings in the blink of an eye without the need of tanks, remember their dps/HS is extremely high on resource buildings. A short burst of goblins in front of each of these resource buildings will be like magic. And you\u2019ll end up completing the funnel with a significantly smaller housing space consumed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;Main Attack&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the funnel is complete it\u2019s time to open the path towards the core, using wall breakers and/or jump spells and/or earthquake spells. Keeping in mind you avoid opening unnecessary compartments containing resource buildings. Begin by deploying a few giants (can be kept in the clan castle), they will serve as tanks for a short while, distracting defenses and maybe getting rid of an occasional giant bomb. Shortly after, you deploy all your goblins. If the path is done right, the goblins will travel from on resource building to the next and eventually reach and destroy the core. The deployment timings and style differs slightly from town hall to town hall, and will be explained further in the town hall specific strategies. Bring a rage spell for the core to help secure a total core wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;Army Composition&lt;/h6&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One last thing I want to include in the Goblin Knife section is the army composition. Like I mentioned before, there is a copious amount of different army compositions to this strategy, and while I will not tell you exactly how to compose your army I can explain some of the pros and cons with different variations. In the more traditional setup you will see a regular funnel being done at the entry point, this will include a rather large number of giants to tank the entire area outside, while wizards and/or barch are deployed behind them to create the funnel. This team will effectively create a regular funnel and in doing so, they will most likely funnel a great portion of themselves into the desired path, which will help the goblins survive the journey to the core. However, since your objective is to send the &lt;strong&gt;goblins&lt;/strong&gt; to the core, the outside must be cleared of resource buildings in a rather large area, and there is no telling whether the regular funnel will achieve this since they will target &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; buildings. This can sometimes result in many goblins not being properly funneled into the core.\nI prefer to use a slightly different approach in what I call the Goblin Knife 2.0. It uses an army composition almost entirely made of goblins, only a few giants which I keep in my clan castle for that first part of the main attack to distract defenses and help rid the area of giant bombs. I know I can easily create the desired resource building funnel using very few goblins, and once that is done I have a very large number of goblins left at my disposal to secure a wrecked core. The advantage here is in the number of goblins and their overwhelming power. The power of quantity helps in disarming many threats such as giant bombs, wizard towers, mortars and enemy clan castle troops. The disadvantage of this army composition is that it requires you to have a firm grasp of the concept of goblin pathing. If you aren\u2019t too comfortable with creating a path then you would probably be safer using a traditional army composition until you have had enough practice with pathing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Town Hall 8&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At town hall 8 you will have a plentitude of &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/KuJe7Dm.png\"&gt;inactive bases&lt;/a&gt;, it would be a shame not to take advantage of this. And what better way to farm inactive bases than using the ever so faithful &lt;strong&gt;Barch&lt;/strong&gt; army composition. There are many different strategies to this army composition but I like to keep it very simple. I use around 1/3 barbarians and 2/3 archers (65/135ish). With these troops, you\u2019ll sometimes be able to pick off all collectors using only a few archers, losing trophies but netting extremely high profits very fast. But since the majority of inactive bases have their collectors outside, there are ways in which you deploy your barch army to reach 50% destruction while destroying all collectors around the perimeter. I explain this deployment style in &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V9jWbuMDjE\"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. This strategy will help you farm extreme amounts of gold and elixir, and usually a rather adequate amount of dark elixir too. Later in the same video I go on to show a way to snipe the town hall and dark elixir storage using clan castle troops. This strategy uses the same army composition and can be performed whenever you come across an &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/hqswkqx.png\"&gt;active base&lt;/a&gt; with close to the dark elixir THSSC. It uses the barch to create a massive V formation funnel that will help direct the clan castle troops towards the core, keeping them alive using heal spells. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is also entirely possible to perform a Goblin Knife at town hall 8. Only here you don\u2019t have any jump spells so you will be forced to use wall breakers and earthquake spells, which means you will have a small dark elixir cost to include in your net profit calculations. &lt;em&gt;Clash Attacks with Jo&lt;/em&gt; shows you how it\u2019s done in &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HENvLULjeZA\"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. He uses a regular funnel made up of a wall of giants with wizards behind them to clear the outer perimeter. The path to the core is created using earthquake spells and wall breakers. It is a powerful attack strategy as you can see he even uses it to attack town hall 9s. Don\u2019t let the dark elixir cost of this army composition scare you, the cost of the 3 earthquake spells you will use (4th being in the clan castle) is 375 or 420 dark elixir depending on what level it is, but you will look for active bases with around 2,000 dark elixir so the net profits are still very solid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Town Hall 9&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you reach town hall 9 you will immediately notice a decrease in &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/X6kKp5N.png\"&gt;inactive bases&lt;/a&gt;, but don\u2019t worry, they are still there and will be even when you reach town hall 11. As always, where there are inactive bases there is room for &lt;strong&gt;barching&lt;/strong&gt;. You can use the same strategy and army composition ratio as described in the town hall 8 section, but you will have to upgrade your barch troops and your army camps. Which is not a bad way to start off your town hall 9 journey as barching will help you quickly farm up in gold and elixir. As for dark elixir, the barching will still only achieve an \u201cadequate\u201d amount at best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore, to truly explore the extreme dark elixir farming of town hall 9 you will have to turn your attention to the goblins and jump spells. Goblins should be upgraded to level 6 in order to survive a blast from the mortars. The town hall 9 mortars will do 55 damage per hit, and the level 5 goblins only have 52 hit points as opposed to the level 6 that have 68 hit points. Surviving that one hit makes all the difference in the world, so be sure to upgrade them before trying this out. Jump spells should also be upgraded to level 2 which will make them last for 40 seconds instead of 20. An experienced gob knifer can probably make do with 20 seconds but rushing attacks like these is very risky. The Goblin Knife strategy is an attack of patience and precision, it should never be rushed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you all know town hall 9 stages what appears to be an endless dark elixir grind, having to deal with 20 Barbarian King levels as well as 30 Archer Queen levels, in addition to all the laboratory troop upgrades. If you don\u2019t want your town hall 9 experience to be a never ending story, it is crucial you find a way to farm dark elixir for back to back hero upgrades, and even better if you\u2019re able to upgrade both of them simultaneously &lt;em&gt;(Some may ask, what about war? My answer; this is a farming guide. And you can always take a break)&lt;/em&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfQmxgrZedA\"&gt;The Goblin Knife 2.0 strategy&lt;/a&gt; is designed to work without the use of heroes. With it you\u2019ll be able to upgrade your heroes nonstop all the way to 30/30 if you so desire. The video is a tutorial where I show several replays and explain step by step how to plan and execute the attacks. In the video, I only show attacks on &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/mluVM7E.png\"&gt;active bases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/D5M3QTg.png\"&gt;hybrids&lt;/a&gt; as they are the bases where you want to attack the core. But one of the perks with having an army composed solely of goblins is that whenever you come across &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZjFRSpz.png\"&gt;inactive bases&lt;/a&gt;, emptying them of all their loot is an easy task. Simply deploy your goblins at the collectors around the perimeter of the base and they will make short work of them. Doing this usually don\u2019t even require you to use the entire army as they effectively cut through all the collectors with impressive speed, and you won\u2019t mess up your queued-up army for the next attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don\u2019t mind using your heroes and don\u2019t want back to back upgrades, there are other ways to perform the Goblin Knife too, using a more traditional army composition with a regular funnel. &lt;em&gt;Clash with Ash&lt;/em&gt; posted a &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg-FkDDXUsQ&amp;amp;t\"&gt;video of his strategy&lt;/a&gt; which was originally inspired by &lt;em&gt;Clash Attacks with Jo&lt;/em&gt;. He uses a slightly different funnel with a baby dragon on one side and archers with tanking giants on the other side to funnel his troops into the core. He brings a fair number of giants to tank for the main party and instead of a rage spell he carries 2 heal spells to keep the entire army alive. As level 6 goblins can\u2019t be one shot by mortars or wizard towers, the heal spells will effectively keep them alive for more than enough time to complete their mission. \n&lt;em&gt;Clashing Duke&lt;/em&gt; also shares &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrWMYFgh8jg&amp;amp;t=\"&gt;a few replays&lt;/a&gt; from a clanmate that is &lt;strong&gt;TH9&lt;/strong&gt;. He creates his funnel with a wide spread of archers on both sides of the entry point. This is also a very effective strategy and it is capable of high destruction percentage which will often provide that second star and better bonus loot, much thanks to the heroes. He even goes up against town hall 10s with great success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Town Hall 10&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At town hall 10, there are two noticeable differences concerning the barching of &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/jScqg4A.jpg\"&gt;inactive bases&lt;/a&gt;. First thing is that finding them will be even rarer than before, and the second difference, which partially makes up for their rarity, is that a town hall 10 inactive target will have 3 dark elixir drills filled with loot instead of 2. If you want to barch inactive bases it is still a viable farming strategy but you will have to upgrade your barch troops and the army camps in order to have a shot at the 50% 1stars. The deployment style described in the town hall 8 section works for town hall 10 just as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Town hall 10 introduces the most challenging task the Goblin Knife will ever face, the multiple target inferno towers. However, while they are capable of melting away goblins like no other defense building, don\u2019t for a second think they stand a chance against a well-planned Goblin Knife attack. Again, the first thing you want to do is upgrade your goblins to level 7, as the level 6 goblins with 68 hit points will not stand a hit from the town hall 10 mortar that now hits for 70 damage per shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best way to deal with the inferno towers is to increase the number of giants used and make sure they are funneled into the goblin path. They will help in tanking the infernal beams giving the goblins plenty of time to destroy the core. &lt;em&gt;TG Clash Of Clans Tactics&lt;/em&gt; does an absolutely fantastic job in &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnG9cL2QzyU\"&gt;this TH10 goblin knife video&lt;/a&gt; showing some very impressive attacks done on both town hall 10 and town hall 11 targets. Later in the video he goes to the drawing board with some of the bases, explaining goblin pathing which helps understanding how to plan the attacks. He also describes the use of keeping certain walls intact to help direct your goblins the way you want. At 12:26 he shows a certain way of pathing goblins to make them self-funnel into the core, which is a concept I often use at TH11 with great success, though with some minor differences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Town Hall 11&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Congratulations on reaching town hall 11, the Goblin Knife paradise! At this level, there is no longer any point in preparing an army exclusively for &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/iLzIiBJ.png\"&gt;inactive bases&lt;/a&gt;, simply because they are too few. Going for a goblin knife army means you\u2019ll be able to deal with inactive bases anyway, should they appear in front of you when searching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might ask yourself, how could town hall 11 be anything but a land of terror for your goblins, having more defense buildings, maxed inferno towers, eagle artillery, mortars that will one hit goblins no matter if the goblins are maxed and many more substantial threats.\nThe answer is the Grand Warden, and his two abilities. The Grand Warden emits an aura around himself indicating the radius of his abilities, that together will make your Goblin Knife virtually unstoppable. The &lt;strong&gt;Life Aura&lt;/strong&gt; is a passive ability that the Grand Warden has even from level 1, and it increases in strength by each new level unlike all other hero abilities which increases every 5 levels. The Life Aura grants a health boost for all troops within its radius, by increasing their hit points. It is a percental increase that starts at 20% at level 1 and reaches 50% at max level 20. Though it has a maximum increase of HP at each level to prevent high health troops from reaching an obscure amount of hit points. What\u2019s interesting here is that at higher levels this aura can help the level 7 goblins (74 hit points) survive a blast from the maxed town hall 11 mortars that will hit for 100 damage per shot.\nHowever, what will truly make the difference here is the &lt;strong&gt;Eternal Tome&lt;/strong&gt; ability which unlocks at Grand Warden level 5. Upon activation, the Eternal Tome will momentarily make everyone inside his aura including himself, completely invulnerable. The ability length starts at 3.5 seconds on Grand Warden level 5 and reaches 5 seconds when maxed. This may sound like a very short period of time, what difference will it make? Well, the critical moment when the Goblin Knife is subject to the most damage is when they reach and destroy the core. With a rage spell this is usually done in less than 2 seconds, which means even the first level of Eternal Tome will be sufficient to keep the entire army alive through this mayhem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySb1yV03fQE\"&gt;TH11 Goblin Knife 2.0&lt;/a&gt; is the only strategy I will recommend for efficient dark elixir farming at town hall 11. Once you master this strategy you will be able to hit rushed and maxed town hall 11s alike. The defending strength of a target will no longer matter. The only thing that matters is the available dark elixir loot, and of course that the town hall and dark elixir storage are reasonable close and not on opposite sides of the base. In this video tutorial, I show 5 completely different scenarios beginning with a rather easy target and advancing in difficulty until I finally explain how to engage a maxed town hall 11 ring base. This strategy is also designed to work completely without the use of heroes, to enable a back to back simultaneous upgrade. &lt;strong&gt;One thing I didn\u2019t mention&lt;/strong&gt; in the tutorial, is why I sometimes use more than 1 jump spell on the same wall layer, which at a first glance could seem like a waste. The reason for this is to promote a goblin self-funnel, by directing the goblins at the resource buildings I want them to destroy first to ensure a path leading to the core. This is usually only relevant when attacking ring bases, which is a challenge in itself and not how you want to start your Goblin Knife practice.  &lt;em&gt;TG Clash Of Clans Tactics&lt;/em&gt; actually explains this concept &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnG9cL2QzyU&amp;amp;t=700s\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and it would have worked had he opened the outer wall with two jump spells. He would then be able to aim his goblins at the storages first leaving the two collectors in the middle forming a pathway to the core.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This concludes my Goblin Knife and dark elixir farming guide. This was by no means an attempt to create the &amp;quot;ultimate&amp;quot; farming guide, but rather an enthusiastic effort to help shed some light on the recurrent questions about the goblin knives and how to efficiently farm using weaker and cheaper troops. Hopefully you have learned something new that might help you on your journey to max your heroes and dark elixir troops. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would like to invite anyone that reads this guide to please correct me if there are any irregularities, after all I am just a humble clasher urging to share. I wanted to keep the guide &lt;em&gt;reasonably&lt;/em&gt; concise, with efficiency in mind, focusing on a few well-tested and quality strategies that I know works, rather than stockpiling a large number of strategies that I can\u2019t endorse. I have tried to be as objective as possible, including videos from other clashers where I can and describing other strategies and army compositions than my own. Furthermore, I hope I have used a tolerably correct English language for everyone to understand, Google has been my faithful companion in this mission. If you have read this far then I thank you for reading and wish you great luck in your dark elixir farming!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "# Goblin Knife / Dark Elixir farming guide TH8-TH11\n\n\nDark elixir farming and Goblin Knives are two frequently appearing subjects in this sub and frankly the entire Clash of Clans community. As farming is a true passion of mine, I have taken the liberty of composing a guide for farming dark elixir as efficiently as possible. We all know there are strategies using very powerful troops to effectively 3 star bases, but as farming is all about the efficiency, I like to use cheaper troops that will increase net profits and reduce cooking times.\n\nIn this guide, I will explain how to identify bases, how to locate the loot and know how much is where, troop behavior, funneling as well as specific dark elixir farming strategies for the top four town hall levels individually. I will also include an in-depth goblin/goblin knife section. The strategies explained will be using lower tier troops, including but not limited to barbarians, archers, goblins and giants. I will try to include screenshots and videos wherever possible for more detailed illustrations. \n\n### Targets and loot location ###\nWhen farming, it is imperative that you\u2019re able to quickly identify what type of base you have in front of you and where the loot is located, since you are only given 30 seconds to either hit \u201cNext\u201d or start attacking the base. Obviously the first thing you want to look at is the available loot in the top left corner, but the number itself will not tell you whether to attack the base (unless it is very low then of course you hit \u201cnext\u201d). You want to be able to locate **exactly where** the loot is hiding and how much of it is there. It may sound difficult at first, but knowing how it works and what numbers to keep in mind, this will soon come naturally. \nThe most important number to learn is your \u201cTown Hall Specific **Storage** Capacity\u201d (THSSC) for available loot. This number is the maximum amount you can find in the storages (the town hall is part of the storage, it will have to be destroyed as well to get the full amount). The dark elixir THSSC\u2019s are as follows:\n\n* TH8:\t2,000\n* TH9:\t2,500\n* TH10:\t3,000\n* TH11:\t3,500\n\nThis is assuming the target has upgraded his dark elixir storage, and that you aren\u2019t looking at a target below your own town hall level wherein a **penalty** will be added to the equation. [The specific penalties are shown in this page if you scroll down to the table labeled \u201cTown Hall Levels\u2014Loot Multiplier\u201d](http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki/Raids)\n\nA good rule of thumb is that if the target\u2019s dark elixir storage appears to be at least half full, you can expect to find the entire THSSC amount in the storage and town hall. The exception here is TH8 where the level of storage has a great impact on how full the storage must appear to be, in order to carry the entire THSSC.\n\n###### Target Groups\nI like to divide **high loot targets** into 3 different groups; **Active bases**, **Inactive bases** and **Hybrids**. Being able to distinguish between the 3 different scenarios will help you determine whether to attack a base, and if you do, where and how to attack it. \n\n**Active bases** are recognized by an available loot amount very close to the THSSC and the dark elixir storage will appear to be at least half full, showing that almost all the available loot is indeed in the storage and the town hall. These bases will carry very little dark elixir in the drills. They are called active bases because the owner is actively collecting loot from the production buildings leaving them rather empty. Examples: [TH8](http://i.imgur.com/hqswkqx.png), [TH9](http://i.imgur.com/mluVM7E.png), [TH10](http://i.imgur.com/KLEGPij.jpg) and [TH11](http://i.imgur.com/fPM4aI6.png)\n\n**Inactive bases** are characterized by a high amount of loot of all three types and the gold/elixir amounts are often almost identical. Their storages will appear to be completely empty. Typically, these bases are without a trophy league shield and have many tombstones around the base. They are called inactive bases because the owner hasn\u2019t been online for a very long time and their bases have been victims of many attacks, thus having empty storages. However, their collectors will continue to produce resources and provide good available loot. Examples: [TH8](http://i.imgur.com/KuJe7Dm.png), [TH9](http://i.imgur.com/X6kKp5N.png), [TH10](http://i.imgur.com/jScqg4A.jpg) and [TH11](http://i.imgur.com/iLzIiBJ.png)\n\n**Hybrids** (or semi-inactive bases) are essentially bases that carry a lot of loot inside the storages as well as in the collectors. To identify these bases one must look at the available loot as well as the dark elixir storage and compare it to the THSSC. If for example you are looking at a TH9, and the available loot is 4,300 and the dark elixir storage is at least half full, you will immediately know that the THSSC amount of 2,500 will be in the storage/town hall, and the two dark drills will have 900 each. Another example on the same town hall could be if the available loot is 2800 and the dark elixir storage shows very little dark elixir, this would mean that there is a relatively small amount, maybe around 1,000 dark elixir in the storage, and the rest is all in the drills. Being able to identify Hybrids and how much of the loot is where, will help you avoid sending an entire army to the core only to realize that a huge portion of the loot is actually in the collectors. Examples: [TH8](http://i.imgur.com/zCz54WR.png), [TH9](http://i.imgur.com/D5M3QTg.png), [TH10](http://i.imgur.com/1ckbs2g.jpg) and [TH11](http://i.imgur.com/IrdHuyT.png)\n\nI have made no mention of the Clan Castle, because if it is carrying any dark elixir it will in general be a relatively small amount. But keep in mind that this building contains the treasury and can potentially carry some dark elixir too.\n\n### Goblins and Goblin Knife\nBefore I go into specific town hall strategies I want to give the goblins a section of their own as they are an important part of this guide.\n\n###### What is a Goblin Knife?\nThe strategy called Goblin Knife is basically an attack where you use a massive number of goblins to cut right into the core of a base to take out the dark elixir storage and the town hall. Targets you look for in these types of attacks are Active bases and Hybrids where the dark elixir storage and town hall are relatively close to each other. While there are a vast variety of army compositions and strategies, I\u2019m going to be very bold here and say that the majority of them aren\u2019t utilizing the goblin\u2019s powers very well. To unleash the true and awesome potential of the goblin one must first understand how the goblin\u2019s world works. Learn to see the bases through his eyes, and appreciate his unbelievable damage output towards resource buildings.\n\n###### Goblin Behavior\nThe goblin\u2019s world is simple, he is a greedy fellow that has his eyes set for resource buildings. And like any other troops that have favorite targets he will ignore every other type of buildings and enemy troops so long there is a single resource building left on the map. When he is deployed, he will run to the closest resource building still standing and then from there onwards to the next closest resource building. In order to become a master of goblins you simply have to become a goblin yourself. Learn to look at a base through his greedy eyes, where are the resource buildings, what\u2019s the distance between them, which one is closest, where is the next closest building. Again, this may sound difficult but it is very easy once you realize how it works. It is also essential when planning a Goblin Knife attack.\n\n###### Goblin Damage Output\nThere are no troops in the game that come even remotely close to the \u201cdamage per second/housing space\u201d of a goblin. Let\u2019s compare the TH9 level 6 goblin with the level 6 wizard having them attack a resource building. The level 6 wizard does 185 damage per second, but as he takes up 4 housing space we must divide his damage by 4, 185/4\u224846 dps/HS. While the level 6 goblin has a breathtaking 84 dps/HS. Let\u2019s keep this information in mind.\n\n###### Planning the Path\nNow let\u2019s get back to the strategy itself. To send the goblins towards the core of a base, a path must be created, with respects to the goblin behavior. To help create the path you will almost always have to perform a **resource building** funnel. If you aren\u2019t familiar with the concept of a funnel, *Powerbang Gaming* does a great job explaining it in [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7q-_6drHQI). The resource building funnel does the same thing as a regular funnel, but only removing resource buildings. Hence, the only troops affected by the resource building funnel are goblins. Which is exactly what you want, because they are the ones you want to send to the core. The second thing you need, to help create the path, is a way to bypass walls. Here you can either use wall breakers, jump spells or earthquake spells. Personally, I prefer jump spells over the other two and the reason is very simple, jump spells are more reliable than wall breakers precision-wise and earthquake spells cost dark elixir. The third and **very important** tool used to create a goblin path are walls left intact. Remember, you want your goblins to head for the core and get the town hall and dark elixir storage, they can\u2019t afford visiting too many compartments and clearing all kinds of storages on their way to the core. **Only open wall sections that are absolutely necessary in order to create a path to the core**. I can\u2019t stress this enough. Though there is one exception. When a closed compartment containing resource buildings is very close to the intended deployment area, after deploying around half of your goblins and the \u201cbread crumbs trail\u201d (resource buildings path towards the core) is getting further and further away, the last goblins might decide to break the walls and go for closer resource buildings. There are ways to avoid this which I will explain further in the town hall specific strategies.\n\n###### Funneling\nWhen you have figured out a path from an intended deployment area to the core of a base, you start your attack with an outside resource building funnel. This means, you start from the deployment location \u201cfacing\u201d the core and looking on your right and left hand side outside the outer wall for resource buildings. Clear all resource buildings on both sides of your entry in a distance equivalent to at least the length from your deployment area to the core. [In this screenshot example](http://i.imgur.com/s7hfnBM.jpg) you see the 4 resource buildings on both sides of the entry point that has to be destroyed prior to the attack. The yellow lines indicate the approximate distance that requires your attention. The 3 resource buildings right in front of the deployment area are on the path to the core, so they don\u2019t have to be removed beforehand.  Troops used to make this outside funnel is entirely up to you. Traditional goblin knives typically use a combination of barch and/or wizards with some giants to tank, to get the job done. But here is the interesting part, a few goblins will destroy these buildings in the blink of an eye without the need of tanks, remember their dps/HS is extremely high on resource buildings. A short burst of goblins in front of each of these resource buildings will be like magic. And you\u2019ll end up completing the funnel with a significantly smaller housing space consumed. \n\n###### Main Attack\nOnce the funnel is complete it\u2019s time to open the path towards the core, using wall breakers and/or jump spells and/or earthquake spells. Keeping in mind you avoid opening unnecessary compartments containing resource buildings. Begin by deploying a few giants (can be kept in the clan castle), they will serve as tanks for a short while, distracting defenses and maybe getting rid of an occasional giant bomb. Shortly after, you deploy all your goblins. If the path is done right, the goblins will travel from on resource building to the next and eventually reach and destroy the core. The deployment timings and style differs slightly from town hall to town hall, and will be explained further in the town hall specific strategies. Bring a rage spell for the core to help secure a total core wreckage.\n\n###### Army Composition\nOne last thing I want to include in the Goblin Knife section is the army composition. Like I mentioned before, there is a copious amount of different army compositions to this strategy, and while I will not tell you exactly how to compose your army I can explain some of the pros and cons with different variations. In the more traditional setup you will see a regular funnel being done at the entry point, this will include a rather large number of giants to tank the entire area outside, while wizards and/or barch are deployed behind them to create the funnel. This team will effectively create a regular funnel and in doing so, they will most likely funnel a great portion of themselves into the desired path, which will help the goblins survive the journey to the core. However, since your objective is to send the **goblins** to the core, the outside must be cleared of resource buildings in a rather large area, and there is no telling whether the regular funnel will achieve this since they will target **any** buildings. This can sometimes result in many goblins not being properly funneled into the core.\nI prefer to use a slightly different approach in what I call the Goblin Knife 2.0. It uses an army composition almost entirely made of goblins, only a few giants which I keep in my clan castle for that first part of the main attack to distract defenses and help rid the area of giant bombs. I know I can easily create the desired resource building funnel using very few goblins, and once that is done I have a very large number of goblins left at my disposal to secure a wrecked core. The advantage here is in the number of goblins and their overwhelming power. The power of quantity helps in disarming many threats such as giant bombs, wizard towers, mortars and enemy clan castle troops. The disadvantage of this army composition is that it requires you to have a firm grasp of the concept of goblin pathing. If you aren\u2019t too comfortable with creating a path then you would probably be safer using a traditional army composition until you have had enough practice with pathing.\n\n\n### Town Hall 8\n\nAt town hall 8 you will have a plentitude of [inactive bases](http://i.imgur.com/KuJe7Dm.png), it would be a shame not to take advantage of this. And what better way to farm inactive bases than using the ever so faithful **Barch** army composition. There are many different strategies to this army composition but I like to keep it very simple. I use around 1/3 barbarians and 2/3 archers (65/135ish). With these troops, you\u2019ll sometimes be able to pick off all collectors using only a few archers, losing trophies but netting extremely high profits very fast. But since the majority of inactive bases have their collectors outside, there are ways in which you deploy your barch army to reach 50% destruction while destroying all collectors around the perimeter. I explain this deployment style in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V9jWbuMDjE). This strategy will help you farm extreme amounts of gold and elixir, and usually a rather adequate amount of dark elixir too. Later in the same video I go on to show a way to snipe the town hall and dark elixir storage using clan castle troops. This strategy uses the same army composition and can be performed whenever you come across an [active base](http://i.imgur.com/hqswkqx.png) with close to the dark elixir THSSC. It uses the barch to create a massive V formation funnel that will help direct the clan castle troops towards the core, keeping them alive using heal spells. \n\nIt is also entirely possible to perform a Goblin Knife at town hall 8. Only here you don\u2019t have any jump spells so you will be forced to use wall breakers and earthquake spells, which means you will have a small dark elixir cost to include in your net profit calculations. *Clash Attacks with Jo* shows you how it\u2019s done in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HENvLULjeZA). He uses a regular funnel made up of a wall of giants with wizards behind them to clear the outer perimeter. The path to the core is created using earthquake spells and wall breakers. It is a powerful attack strategy as you can see he even uses it to attack town hall 9s. Don\u2019t let the dark elixir cost of this army composition scare you, the cost of the 3 earthquake spells you will use (4th being in the clan castle) is 375 or 420 dark elixir depending on what level it is, but you will look for active bases with around 2,000 dark elixir so the net profits are still very solid.\n\n\n### Town Hall 9\n\nOnce you reach town hall 9 you will immediately notice a decrease in [inactive bases](http://i.imgur.com/X6kKp5N.png), but don\u2019t worry, they are still there and will be even when you reach town hall 11. As always, where there are inactive bases there is room for **barching**. You can use the same strategy and army composition ratio as described in the town hall 8 section, but you will have to upgrade your barch troops and your army camps. Which is not a bad way to start off your town hall 9 journey as barching will help you quickly farm up in gold and elixir. As for dark elixir, the barching will still only achieve an \u201cadequate\u201d amount at best.\n\nTherefore, to truly explore the extreme dark elixir farming of town hall 9 you will have to turn your attention to the goblins and jump spells. Goblins should be upgraded to level 6 in order to survive a blast from the mortars. The town hall 9 mortars will do 55 damage per hit, and the level 5 goblins only have 52 hit points as opposed to the level 6 that have 68 hit points. Surviving that one hit makes all the difference in the world, so be sure to upgrade them before trying this out. Jump spells should also be upgraded to level 2 which will make them last for 40 seconds instead of 20. An experienced gob knifer can probably make do with 20 seconds but rushing attacks like these is very risky. The Goblin Knife strategy is an attack of patience and precision, it should never be rushed. \n\nAs you all know town hall 9 stages what appears to be an endless dark elixir grind, having to deal with 20 Barbarian King levels as well as 30 Archer Queen levels, in addition to all the laboratory troop upgrades. If you don\u2019t want your town hall 9 experience to be a never ending story, it is crucial you find a way to farm dark elixir for back to back hero upgrades, and even better if you\u2019re able to upgrade both of them simultaneously *(Some may ask, what about war? My answer; this is a farming guide. And you can always take a break)*.\n[The Goblin Knife 2.0 strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfQmxgrZedA) is designed to work without the use of heroes. With it you\u2019ll be able to upgrade your heroes nonstop all the way to 30/30 if you so desire. The video is a tutorial where I show several replays and explain step by step how to plan and execute the attacks. In the video, I only show attacks on [active bases](http://i.imgur.com/mluVM7E.png) and [hybrids](http://i.imgur.com/D5M3QTg.png) as they are the bases where you want to attack the core. But one of the perks with having an army composed solely of goblins is that whenever you come across [inactive bases](http://i.imgur.com/ZjFRSpz.png), emptying them of all their loot is an easy task. Simply deploy your goblins at the collectors around the perimeter of the base and they will make short work of them. Doing this usually don\u2019t even require you to use the entire army as they effectively cut through all the collectors with impressive speed, and you won\u2019t mess up your queued-up army for the next attack.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind using your heroes and don\u2019t want back to back upgrades, there are other ways to perform the Goblin Knife too, using a more traditional army composition with a regular funnel. *Clash with Ash* posted a [video of his strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg-FkDDXUsQ&amp;t) which was originally inspired by *Clash Attacks with Jo*. He uses a slightly different funnel with a baby dragon on one side and archers with tanking giants on the other side to funnel his troops into the core. He brings a fair number of giants to tank for the main party and instead of a rage spell he carries 2 heal spells to keep the entire army alive. As level 6 goblins can\u2019t be one shot by mortars or wizard towers, the heal spells will effectively keep them alive for more than enough time to complete their mission. \n*Clashing Duke* also shares [a few replays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrWMYFgh8jg&amp;t=) from a clanmate that is **TH9**. He creates his funnel with a wide spread of archers on both sides of the entry point. This is also a very effective strategy and it is capable of high destruction percentage which will often provide that second star and better bonus loot, much thanks to the heroes. He even goes up against town hall 10s with great success.\n\n\n### Town Hall 10\n\nAt town hall 10, there are two noticeable differences concerning the barching of [inactive bases](http://i.imgur.com/jScqg4A.jpg). First thing is that finding them will be even rarer than before, and the second difference, which partially makes up for their rarity, is that a town hall 10 inactive target will have 3 dark elixir drills filled with loot instead of 2. If you want to barch inactive bases it is still a viable farming strategy but you will have to upgrade your barch troops and the army camps in order to have a shot at the 50% 1stars. The deployment style described in the town hall 8 section works for town hall 10 just as well.\n\nTown hall 10 introduces the most challenging task the Goblin Knife will ever face, the multiple target inferno towers. However, while they are capable of melting away goblins like no other defense building, don\u2019t for a second think they stand a chance against a well-planned Goblin Knife attack. Again, the first thing you want to do is upgrade your goblins to level 7, as the level 6 goblins with 68 hit points will not stand a hit from the town hall 10 mortar that now hits for 70 damage per shot.\n\nThe best way to deal with the inferno towers is to increase the number of giants used and make sure they are funneled into the goblin path. They will help in tanking the infernal beams giving the goblins plenty of time to destroy the core. *TG Clash Of Clans Tactics* does an absolutely fantastic job in [this TH10 goblin knife video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnG9cL2QzyU) showing some very impressive attacks done on both town hall 10 and town hall 11 targets. Later in the video he goes to the drawing board with some of the bases, explaining goblin pathing which helps understanding how to plan the attacks. He also describes the use of keeping certain walls intact to help direct your goblins the way you want. At 12:26 he shows a certain way of pathing goblins to make them self-funnel into the core, which is a concept I often use at TH11 with great success, though with some minor differences.\n\n\n### Town Hall 11\n\nCongratulations on reaching town hall 11, the Goblin Knife paradise! At this level, there is no longer any point in preparing an army exclusively for [inactive bases](http://i.imgur.com/iLzIiBJ.png), simply because they are too few. Going for a goblin knife army means you\u2019ll be able to deal with inactive bases anyway, should they appear in front of you when searching.\n\nYou might ask yourself, how could town hall 11 be anything but a land of terror for your goblins, having more defense buildings, maxed inferno towers, eagle artillery, mortars that will one hit goblins no matter if the goblins are maxed and many more substantial threats.\nThe answer is the Grand Warden, and his two abilities. The Grand Warden emits an aura around himself indicating the radius of his abilities, that together will make your Goblin Knife virtually unstoppable. The **Life Aura** is a passive ability that the Grand Warden has even from level 1, and it increases in strength by each new level unlike all other hero abilities which increases every 5 levels. The Life Aura grants a health boost for all troops within its radius, by increasing their hit points. It is a percental increase that starts at 20% at level 1 and reaches 50% at max level 20. Though it has a maximum increase of HP at each level to prevent high health troops from reaching an obscure amount of hit points. What\u2019s interesting here is that at higher levels this aura can help the level 7 goblins (74 hit points) survive a blast from the maxed town hall 11 mortars that will hit for 100 damage per shot.\nHowever, what will truly make the difference here is the **Eternal Tome** ability which unlocks at Grand Warden level 5. Upon activation, the Eternal Tome will momentarily make everyone inside his aura including himself, completely invulnerable. The ability length starts at 3.5 seconds on Grand Warden level 5 and reaches 5 seconds when maxed. This may sound like a very short period of time, what difference will it make? Well, the critical moment when the Goblin Knife is subject to the most damage is when they reach and destroy the core. With a rage spell this is usually done in less than 2 seconds, which means even the first level of Eternal Tome will be sufficient to keep the entire army alive through this mayhem.\n\nThe [TH11 Goblin Knife 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySb1yV03fQE) is the only strategy I will recommend for efficient dark elixir farming at town hall 11. Once you master this strategy you will be able to hit rushed and maxed town hall 11s alike. The defending strength of a target will no longer matter. The only thing that matters is the available dark elixir loot, and of course that the town hall and dark elixir storage are reasonable close and not on opposite sides of the base. In this video tutorial, I show 5 completely different scenarios beginning with a rather easy target and advancing in difficulty until I finally explain how to engage a maxed town hall 11 ring base. This strategy is also designed to work completely without the use of heroes, to enable a back to back simultaneous upgrade. **One thing I didn\u2019t mention** in the tutorial, is why I sometimes use more than 1 jump spell on the same wall layer, which at a first glance could seem like a waste. The reason for this is to promote a goblin self-funnel, by directing the goblins at the resource buildings I want them to destroy first to ensure a path leading to the core. This is usually only relevant when attacking ring bases, which is a challenge in itself and not how you want to start your Goblin Knife practice.  *TG Clash Of Clans Tactics* actually explains this concept [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnG9cL2QzyU&amp;t=700s), and it would have worked had he opened the outer wall with two jump spells. He would then be able to aim his goblins at the storages first leaving the two collectors in the middle forming a pathway to the core.\n\n\n\nThis concludes my Goblin Knife and dark elixir farming guide. This was by no means an attempt to create the \"ultimate\" farming guide, but rather an enthusiastic effort to help shed some light on the recurrent questions about the goblin knives and how to efficiently farm using weaker and cheaper troops. Hopefully you have learned something new that might help you on your journey to max your heroes and dark elixir troops. \n\n*****\n\nFinally, I would like to invite anyone that reads this guide to please correct me if there are any irregularities, after all I am just a humble clasher urging to share. I wanted to keep the guide *reasonably* concise, with efficiency in mind, focusing on a few well-tested and quality strategies that I know works, rather than stockpiling a large number of strategies that I can\u2019t endorse.
