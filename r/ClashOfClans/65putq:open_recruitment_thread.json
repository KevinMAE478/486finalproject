Since our inception, we have enjoyed enormous success. Our current war record (as of April 16th, 2017) stands at 257 wins, 57 losses and 3 draws, with at least 13 perfect wars. We have 100% participation in almost every war, are very organized, and have a strong sense of team unity within our clan.\n\nOver the last couple of years, our clan has evolved from a laidback clan of active players to a more competitive clan, full of active members eager to improve their attacks and hungry for more war victories. This evolution has become necessary as the game itself has evolved, and we have succeeded in both maintaining our status as a fair play war clan while still enjoying a winning war record. We war three times a week, with war prep on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. \n\nWe encourage the use of new armies and strategies in war, and have a BAND chat dedicated specifically to sharing war strats and videos. Anyone opting in for war will be expected to use both attacks in a timely manner.\n\nWe are currently looking for adult, mature and competitive players who would like to clash in an environment where they can farm and war with a bunch of VERY active, like-minded individuals, while learning new strategies and war tactics.\n\nOur requirements are simple:\n\n* You must be an adult, minimum 22 years of age.\n\n* You have a well-developed base.  \n\n* You should have very good mastery of the troops at your TH level, or are in the process of learning them. We like to see diversity in your attacks. \n\n* You are active and social. We are a chatty bunch and would love to get to know you in chat while we're waiting for our next raiding army to cook. \n\n* You understand the importance of getting your war attacks done in a timely manner, and opting out of war when you will be unable to do so. If you are a lower TH level, we will expect you to do your first war attack within the first two hours of war, and your second within the first 1/2 of the war. This helps us plan second attacks and cleanup efforts. \n\n* You have a great sense of humor. That's important with our group. And check your ego at the door. You love to donate. Our donation requirement is simple--1000 troops donated in one season (one month). \n\n* You also love to learn. Whether it's from us or YouTube videos, you must have a willingness to up your game by constantly learning new techniques, or just mastering your favorites.  \n\n* We use BAND, a free messenger app, to communicate outside of the game. BAND is an essential part of our success during war. If you do not have BAND, you will be asked to download it.
