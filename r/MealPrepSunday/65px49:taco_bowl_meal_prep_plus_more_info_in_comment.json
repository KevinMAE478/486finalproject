This is my second week of meal prep thanks to inspiration from this sub. I lurked for a few weeks and have taken the plunge. For the first week i did savory ground turkey patties and veggies plus a set of prepped salads. It went great! Sorry i didnt post... wasnt ready yet. Anywho...\n\nCurrently the prep is for myself and my SO. Focusing on lunch and dinner Monday thru Friday. So total meals is 20. Only made 8 as we have some leftover meatloaf for monday dinner or lunch and the other 10 preps are salads (https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/65q3xe/basic_salad_prep_w_info_in_comments/)\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 lbs ground turkey (lean)\n\n2 cans of beans (pinto and black)\n\n1 cup of quinoa (pre cook measurement)\n\n1 package of taco seasoning\n\n1 giant onion\n\n1 green pepper (wish i went with 2)\n\n2 jalepenos\n\n4 green onion stalks\n\n1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro\n\n1 avacado\n\n1 fat tomato\n\nSqueeze tube of sour cream (for use right before consumption)\n\nLime juice\n\nSpicy salsa\n\n\nI can post all the different cooking instructions if anyone is interested.\n\nNotes: \n\navacado and tomato are separate so they wont get mushy during reheat.\n\nSqueeze tube of sour cream for same reasons. I find these tubes last a long time and also are easy for transport.\n\nCilantro and green onion stalks i keep in mason jars with water on the counter. Helps them last longer and not get wilty.\n\nBasically its ground turkey w/green onion, beans, sauteed veggies, cilantro quinoa w/lime juice, and avacoado and tomato in separate lil container to add post reheat.\n\nHindsight changes: for 10 meals i would have just done 3 lbs of turkey, definitely another green pepper, another small onion, another 1/2 cup quinoa, another avocado to spread around.\n\nThanks for checking out my post!
