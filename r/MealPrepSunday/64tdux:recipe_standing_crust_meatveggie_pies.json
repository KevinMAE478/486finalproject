Bring the dough together and knead for about 10 minutes. The texture will resemble that of \u201cPlay-Doh.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roll your dough portions into balls and flatten into disks about 1\u2033\nthick, then wrap them in a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and allow to\ncool and rest for at least 3 \u2013 4 hours or even overnight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When forming the crust, begin by dredging each portion of dough\nin flour. Roll out the 2 smaller pieces to about 1/8\u2033 thick. These\nare your lids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a bottle, jar, or drinking glass about 2-1/2\u2033 to 3\u2033 in diameter and place it in the middle of each of the larger dough disks and press down. Be careful to avoid pressing all the way through the dough. The bottom should be no less than 1/8\u2033 thick.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the palms of your hands, squeeze and pull the dough up the sides of the form, rotating the form and pressing the dough as you work. The walls should be about 2-1/2\u2033 to 3\u2033 tall, and 1/4\u2033 thick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gently remove your form. Adjust the wall thickness by gently squeezing the dough. Any cracks in the dough can be repaired by brushing a little water in between the two halves of the crack and squeezing them together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From this step you can add anything you want for the filling, but for this case I&amp;#39;ll explain a simple pork pie I made. You might want to adjust the amounts to make different numbers of pies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-$6.75 worth of the cheapest pork I could find for the price, this amount for me made 8 pies approximately. You can ask the butcher to cut the pork into stew sized or pie sized pieces for hopefully no extra charge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-2 minced carrots&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-quarter of an onion, minced&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-A couple of minced potatoes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-1 1/2 tablespoon of salt and pepper to taste&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-2 teaspoons approximately of nutmeg, maybe some rosemary, and some thyme. Adding more will give it more flavor, depending on what you have with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-optional gelatin packets&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 350.\nMix all the ingredients, and pack them into the crust shells. Then moisten the edges of the lids and the top of the shells with the egg wash.  Put the lid on, and seal shut by pinching together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, cut a small square in the top of each lid, about an inch wide. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pop the pies into the oven for about an hour, until the pies are a deep golden brown. The tips might be a bit too brown, but this is ok. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want some more thickness to the pie, boil a gelatin packet with some bullion. When you take them out hot, pour the gelatin mixture into the top through the little cut out square. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you have fun making these pies!
