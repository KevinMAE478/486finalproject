I&amp;#39;m not here for fuckin Darren Aronofsky or Sophia Coppola or something. I&amp;#39;m here for zombies getting their heads sliced in half and antagonists getting chopped into little cubes by lasers and motorcycles being chased by giant mutant pterodactyls and monster butcher people twice the size of normal humans trying to kill people with spikey sledgehammers too heavy for a normal person to lift. And we don&amp;#39;t usually get that type of stuff with a female protagonist - there are moments when it seems like something bad might happen to Alice, but you always know she&amp;#39;s gonna decapitate the person doing it or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really like &amp;#39;em for when I want to turn my brain off and get stoked. I find myself going back to them and watching them over and over again more often than something like the Babadook, which I love too, but which also is also harrowing and emotionally exhausting in a way that the Resident Evil movies aren&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "horror", "name": "t1_dg9fmqr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492219021.0, "created_utc": 1492190221.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9x", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cwrm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9gbtk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wolfhoof", "parent_id": "t3_65cwrm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/horror", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Borderline experimental.
