Great acting, amazing soundtrack, superb use of practical effects. I mean, they really don\u2019t make movies like this anymore. Such a treat from beginning to end, I want the people responsible to make a Silent Hill film. They would knock it out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Devil\u2019s Candy (8/10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The type of film that boroughs under your skin and makes you wonder how insane people can be in the comfort of their own homes. Everything from the acting to the restrain used in showing gore and violence really make this film stand out. This film will be remembered fondly by genre buffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lesson (7/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movie starts off pretty slow, but once the teacher gets his hold on the students, things really ramp up in both gore and violence. The film made me wince a few times, and I rarely let horror films affect me like that. A solid addition to the genre.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon- (8/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another film that really digs deep under the skin and that I find hard to shake off. It\u2019s such a simple premise, but everything is done with such craft, it made watching the film that much more entertaining. That creepy soundtrack with the use of violins really ramps up the unsettling nature of the film. Not for everyone, but I enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pet (9/10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A popcorn horror film, this film is the type of movie you watch with morbid fascination. What will the characters do? What will she try and get away with? Such a disturbing and satisfying film. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Monster (9/10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This movie really did it for me. The characterization, the cinematography, the acting; everything was so well done. I really liked how understated the monster was , and how it really played into the dynamic between the mother and daughter. One of my favorite films of the bunch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seoul Station (8/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After watching the King of Pigs (the director\u2019s film prior to this one), I was anticipating his next project, and I was not disappointed. If you are a fan of animation, South Korean films, or Zombie movies, you will find something to love in this film. The animation style is an acquired taste, but I think it did a great job in creating a believable world. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The World of Kanako (9/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the most disturbing films I have ever seen, each revelation about the titular character just made my stomach turn. How can such a beautiful girl be so morally corrupt and deranged? It\u2019s like a character study of a psychopath. If you are easily disturbed, avoid this film. It certainly isn\u2019t for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FirstBorn (8/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this film. The characters were so likeable (especially the primary couple and their adorable daughter), and it juts does such a great job of telling a simple story. It doesn\u2019t overextend itself in any way, and it just does so many things right. Such an entertaining movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chocolate Strawberry Vanilla (8/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another disturbing film that left me shattered and depressed (my favorite type of horror movie). Everything is just horrific, and the things this man endures just makes me feel so sorry for him. The end was really a culmination of everything he has to put up with, and was done with such tact. I look forward to future films from this director.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Bell (9/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Resembles the original SAW if it took place in a High School. The special effects and gore effects were really well done, and some of the deaths really were nausea inducing. The acting was great and the story really did not let up for a minute. A wild ride from beginning to end. More people should see this film.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE WORST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sam Was Here (aka Nemesis) (4/10) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movie had everything going for it, and then it ended. Great acting, great atmosphere, great soundtrack. Gore and violence was also nicely done. But then, it ends. All of the questions left unanswered, and is too ambiguous for it\u2019s own good. Might appeal to those who enjoy art house films that are more style of substance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get Out (3/10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was sucked into the hype and I could not have been more disappointed by a film. The was expecting some transcendent experience and all I got was anti-white jokes and some poorly done \u201chorror\u201d. It was unfunny, the premise was asinine and offensive, and just did not resonate with me at all. Even the premise was sophomoric and poorly realized. A total and utter failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raised by Wolves (2/10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I think of awful movies that add no redeemable value to the genre, I think of movies like this. Found-footage can be really effective when used by talented and capable people (Wer, REC, Exists to name a few), but when it is used simply because you lack the budget to make a full-fledged film, it shows in every facet of the production. A really turd in every way possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The House on Willow Street (4/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such an original premise for a film, and it was squandered with overacting, underacting, and some really cheap looking SFX. The special effects were decent, but it just does not do what I was expecting with such a novel set-up. A shame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Johnny Frank Garret\u2019s Last Word (3/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, a great premise squandered by some bad acting, a simple script, and a definite lack of any real horrific elements. The movie wasn\u2019t scary, and in fact, worked more as a Lifetime movie than a traditional horror film. Avoid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Girl With All The Gifts (5/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another film that had all of the elements that would have made it a classic, and it squanders it by attempting to appeal to too many people. This movie should have been marketed at adults, but instead, ended up being more a young adult film. I don\u2019t even know why it received an R-rating. Such a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;XX (too varied to give a definite score)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The quality of this film was all over the place, with some segments being gems while others falling flat on their face. I guess the novelty of this movie is that it was a directorial team comprised of women, but really, if men had directed this, would anyone have cared? Just not done to the quality of most other anthologies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Havenhurst (4/10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good premise, awful execution. The acting and set pieces were top notch, but nothing of real interest goes on throughout the film. I think someone was inspired by Silent Hill in this one, as well, with that Pyramid Head style antagonist and the house that hides secrets. It really is a mixed bag, with the bad parts overtaking the good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bornless Ones (5/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wants to be Evil Dead SO BAD, but just ends up being the McDonald\u2019s version of the better film. The special effects really are exceptional, but the acting and script woefully mar the experience. Every actor delivered their lines like high school actors. Such a squandered opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don\u2019t Hang Up (3/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is Scream on a budget. The acting is decent, but the actual events that transpire are watered down and cater to a very young crowd. Adults will likely not find anything redeemable in this film. Will be easily forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arbor Demon (3/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exactly what about this film was \u201chorror\u201d? Some people in a tent screaming instead of actually doing anything? Such a poorly made film. I struggled to care, and I barely remember what went on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don\u2019t Knock Twice (4/10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Started off interesting, with a fun premise, but then fizzled into your average tween \u201cscary movie\u201d. Nothing truly scary goes on, with loud noises and jump scares being used liberally. Not a memorable film.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blair Witch (0)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What a travesty. I really had high hopes for this movie, but what we got was a horror film by committee that did not get anything right. The characters were annoying, the film was too damn dark most of the time, and everything that happens happens off screen. What is the point of a movie being found-footage if no one is actually filming what is going on? What a joke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Disappointments Room (2/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love Kate Beckinsale, but even she couldn\u2019t save this movie. It is competent enough, with some good visuals used throughout, but it just doesn\u2019t do anything new or even interesting. There were some elements that were definitely out of place and gave me a glimmer of hope, but in the end, I was left utterly disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sisters of the Plague (0)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh man, where do I begin with this one? Terrible acting, ambiguous and dull premise, sophomoric script, horrendous cinematography. Nothing about this movie works, and looks more like a vanity project than a legitimate film. I was not impressed in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wolf House (2/10)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absolute bottom of the barrel. I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. The characters were annoying but they had a great chemistry, and everything looked like it was going to turn out all right. But then the \u201cwerewolf\u201d showed up and absolutely ruined everything. The head was all right, but the body looked like a grade school papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 project. I literally laughed for the remainder of the film. Is this what people pass off as film making these days?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moth (0)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the worst films I have ever seen, it did nothing to contribute anything of value to any genre. It was a failed vanity project, this I am convinced of, and the lead actor being insufferable and unintelligible half the time. Nothing really goes on in the film, and it \u2018s more about the actors than the supposed \u201cMothman\u201d.
