I have come to think that much of its 'classic' status has come from it being the first big horror movie that people 5-10 years younger than myself saw on DVD than my theater-going peers found it to be - it certainly benefited a lot from the 1990s not really having its own Horror franchise - and it is *so* deeply 90s - and was the moment the decade finally emerged from the long shadow of the great Horror of the 1980s to have its own thing (even if that thing was trying to stick Reservoir Dogs-like self-awareness into everything). \n\nHistorically, it definitely changed the look and style of mainstream horror after that for the next decade (Paranormal Activity and Insidious marking the modern mainstream trends that would replace it aesthetically). Honestly, it wasn't until I started reading this sub, which has a somewhat younger demographic than my peers, that I became aware it had a reputation as more than just an okay horror film with a bunch of recognizable 90s TV B-listers (and a nice comeback film for Craven from the lull after ANOES).

I was already deep into the weird corners of VHS horror by that point, though, and I thought it was a bit too slick for my tastes, and only really liked the great, tense opening scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t recall the reveal of the killers being anything particularly surprising - it&amp;#39;s really just a violent Scooby Doo unmasking, right? - and I don&amp;#39;t recall Drew Barrymore&amp;#39;s death being that much of a shock - she was still &amp;#39;that girl from E.T.,&amp;#39;  for the most part, trying to get back into big movies after the mixed public reception of &lt;a href=\"http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1758774.1444760991!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/gallery_1200/drew-barrymore-1995.jpg\"&gt;her Playboy issue&lt;/a&gt;, so it was only a hint of stunt casting (the mainstream return of &lt;a href=\"http://www.star2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/happy-days-770x470.jpg\"&gt;Henry Winkler&lt;/a&gt; seemed more interesting to me). I have come to think that much of its &amp;#39;classic&amp;#39; status has come from it being the first big horror movie that people 5-10 years younger than myself saw on DVD than my theater-going peers found it to be - it certainly benefited a lot from the 1990s not really having its own Horror franchise - and it is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; deeply 90s - and was the moment the decade finally emerged from the long shadow of the great Horror of the 1980s to have its own thing (even if that thing was trying to stick Reservoir Dogs-like self-awareness into everything). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Historically, it definitely changed the look and style of mainstream horror after that for the next decade (Paranormal Activity and Insidious marking the modern mainstream trends that would replace it aesthetically).
