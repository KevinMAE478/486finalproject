These guys already have minor cabin fever and you can tell they're getting sick of each other and have been there long enough. This was the last thing they needed. \n\n**2.** The score. Ennio Morricone made an excellent foreboding tone throughout the entire movie, similar to the score in *The Shining*, where it was ominous and hopeless throughout and very monotone. It matched the setting and atmosphere perfectly.\n\n**3.** The characters. These guys weren't idiot teenagers trying to get laid at a summer camp. They were all some of the best in their fields and doing very important research, because only a select few are allowed to go to Antarctica for a country to do research and not as tourists. They were smart and figured things out quickly, but had an adversary that would've killed the usual \"dumb teens\" in less than a night. \n\n**4.** Suspense with horror. Not only was there suspense and tension throughout the film, but they were blended in with scenes of genuine gruesome horror. It was graphic when it had to be, and shit your pants scary as well, when it had to be. The suspense was just icing on the cake. \n\n**5.** Special Effects. The FX in this movie. I don't even have to say anything else. To this day, it still scares the hell out of people seeing it for the first time. \n\n**6.** The open ending. I love the fact that this has kind of an open ending and we don't know what will happen next. There could've been a sequel, but the mystery of what happens is just as good as anything else. \n\nThose are the main points to me that make this the greatest horror movie of all time.
