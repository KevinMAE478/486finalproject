Didn&amp;#39;t say they were bad, just that three on OP&amp;#39;s list were better.  But totally, yeah, the reason I included movies like &lt;em&gt;Exeter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Last Shift&lt;/em&gt; on my original list is that they don&amp;#39;t have any jumpscares, and that&amp;#39;s all I like. Aside from the widely acknowledged classics (&lt;em&gt;Shining&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;American Werewolf&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt;, etc.), my favorites on Netflix include &lt;em&gt;Starry Eyes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Evolution&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;They Look Like People&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Late Phases&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cold in July&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Faults&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "horror", "name": "t1_dgbv1i8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492361380.0, "created_utc": 1492332580.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbpc6r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NOLAHorror", "parent_id": "t1_dgbgs0k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/horror", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wow, you must have terrible taste if you think most of those were bad.
