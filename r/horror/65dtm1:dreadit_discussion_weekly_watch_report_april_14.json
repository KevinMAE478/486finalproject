Pretty girls in bikinis and underwear, a slight bit of nudity, and some first class special fx from Tom Savini, and a very young Kevin Bacon as a camp counselor.

Covering his deformed face with a pillow case with a hole in it (Like 1976\u2019s The Town That Dreaded Sundown) Jason cleverly stalks and brutally kills the young men and women, who mostly run around in bathing suits or underwear. The nudity was taken up a notch in this entry. Steve Miner takes over the directing (his first) and producing duties. He would go on to do House, Warlock and Lake Placid, to name a few. \n\n**Friday the 13th Part 3 3D (1982)** Well, it was 3D in the theaters, at least. Some young adults take a road trip to a cabin on the lake and, well, it\u2019s Jason\u2019s lake. Most of them meet their bloody end at the hands of the mighty killer, who now dons a hockey mask, which would arguably become the most iconic horror face of all time. A three person biker gang that were giving our protagonists a hard time also meet their doom, to add to the cast of victims that includes pretty girls, jerk boyfriends and clownish nerds.

The one thing it left me wondering was why this was nc-17, it really didn't do anything that the saw/hostel series didn't and those got an R.

Frontiers felt like if the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Martyrs had sex to make a near perfect nc-17 baby. I was blown away by how good this movie was. If a slasher is defined by its kills, this one was a fresh axe to the neck and buzzsaw to the chest! The one thing it left me wondering was why this was nc-17, it really didn&amp;#39;t do anything that the saw/hostel series didn&amp;#39;t and those got an R. It was probably due to that achilles cut, nasty shit right there, though my personal theory was it&amp;#39;s political message pissed off some of the people (idiots) on the MPAA. Anyway, this was def. a 9.5/10 for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;last but far from worst, I also finally got around to watching the original 1974 &lt;strong&gt;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow, for a movie from the 70&amp;#39;s that was freaking intense! That dinner scene was really well done, and that 10+ minute chase right after that great scare was epic. It really deserves it&amp;#39;s classic status. My only problem was the scenes in the van felt really low quality compared to the rest of the movie, but still def. a 9/10&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "horror", "name": "t1_dga0ed8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492244977.0, "created_utc": 1492216177.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
