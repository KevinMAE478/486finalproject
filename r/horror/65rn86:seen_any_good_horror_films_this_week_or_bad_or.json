Story was kinda lacking though and kinda fizzled out for me. But I'd definitely recommend it\n\n**The Boy:** finally got around to this one. It wasn't terrible albeit pretty run of the mill. Any horror fan could probably piece together parts of the twist. \n\n**Fear, Inc:** randomly watched this one based on reading what was a pretty cool premise. Never really took full advantage of it, but it did get pretty wild. All in all I enjoyed the ridiculousness of some of the things that happened.  \n\n**First Born:** random watch on Netflix. Pretty average movie. There were some cool ideas that really went nowhere and instead became totally predictable. I'd only recommend it if you're absolutely bored with nothing to do.\n\n**The Ruins:** an older one based around some deadly ancient ruins. Has a good cast (love me some Jena Malone) and a decent story. Kind of a slow build but things do get pretty interesting. I liked the concept and some of the stuff that happens might make some people squirm.\n\n**You Are Not Alone:** this one was a rewatch as it just got added to Amazon Prime. I definitely suggest checking this one out though. It's a POV movie about a girl who heads back home for Fourth of July weekend, amidst a killing spree. It's definitely a slow burn but once things get moving there's just nonstop intensity. The POV really makes it for me because everything just feels so immersive and realistic.
