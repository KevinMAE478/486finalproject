I would like to get more evidence of this besides just guessing. I did take a look at the logs as best as I could and didnt see any issues with WCCP either. Any thoughts or places I should be looking? I&amp;#39;m going to give a call to TAC over the weekend but if anyone can point me to a decent guide on the WSA would be much appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Does anyone have any good reference guides to troubleshoot Ironport WSA?
