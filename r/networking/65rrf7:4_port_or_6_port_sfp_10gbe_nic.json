Then, you can use MPO to LC cassettes to breakout the strands, and use LC Duplex patch cables to make all the host-to-host individual 10Gbps connections. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would give each of your storage devices 8x10Gbps interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You would want 2 of &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.com/products/57342.html\"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; and one of &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.com/products/51607.html\"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, you put 1 of the dual-port QSFP NICs in each storage server; then you put 2 40GBase-SR4 transceivers into it; Then you put 2 MPO cables into the 2 transceivers; Then you connect the pair of MPO cables to one of the Cassettes to break out the 16 strands (8 of the strands in the Cassettes will be unused). Then you mount the cassettes in the cassette tray. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, you have 8x LC-Duplex interfaces to each server, and you can treat them as 10GBase-SR using multimode duplex cabling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want, you can hire me for some consulting hours to give you a more detailed design. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "networking", "name": "t1_dgdc2nz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492453220.0, "created_utc": 1492424420.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkaf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rrf7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkaf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rrf7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkaf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rrf7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkaf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rrf7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcwpbn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "flamingxmonkey", "parent_id": "t1_dgcv0k1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/networking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Small Tree _are_ Intel NICs; they have a different vendor ID flashed to the card such that they can be detected and whitelisted by the Mac OS drivers that the company manufactures.
