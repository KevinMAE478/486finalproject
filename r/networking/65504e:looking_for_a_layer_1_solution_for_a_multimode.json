Signal goes in, signal goes out boosted, no matter what protocol is used by the event recorder. They are widely available and it&amp;#39;s a well known technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something like this : &lt;a href=\"http://www.fs.com/products/17601.html\"&gt;Single Channel EDFA&lt;/a&gt;, that can be controlled via RS-232 or RS-485 so it might even be possible to integrate to your monitoring solution.
