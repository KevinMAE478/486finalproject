The lowest common denominator. That&amp;#39;s what really made gigabit so very universal. Those of us in the field might prefer the Intel chipsets, but Realtek, Broadcom, and third party chipset manufacturers had a hell of a lot more to do with gigabit coming down in price. Unfortunately, that last group no longer exists. Though perhaps Mediatek or someone else will provide extra drive beyond 1gbps. There&amp;#39;s also the chance Qualcomm could get in the game. They&amp;#39;ve managed to sell a lot of the premium gamer crowd on &amp;quot;high performance&amp;quot; gigabit chips with their Killer brand. I&amp;#39;ve had a couple coworkers that really should have known better, but were somehow convinced that gamer-grade network cards would somehow significantly improve gaming performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing practically nothing about the electrical engineering concepts, I figure the current access points capable of 2.5gbps are using some clever wizardry to re-purpose their chipsets&amp;#39; existing SGM-II interfaces. Thus why all the implementations are either full 10gb cards or limited to 2.5. Give it a couple years for silicon lead time, and perhaps we&amp;#39;ll see 5gb nics. Or perhaps not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "networking", "name": "t1_dgd0m38", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492427017.0, "created_utc": 1492398217.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkaf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65spp5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdc417", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "phessler", "parent_id": "t3_65spp5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/networking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "OpenBSD added support for 2.5/5Gbps to the ix(4) driver in time for 6.1, but I believe that was blindly done since the committer doesn't have hardware.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenBSD added support for 2.5/5Gbps to the ix(4) driver in time for 6.1, but I believe that was blindly done since the committer doesn&amp;#39;t have hardware.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "networking", "name": "t1_dgdc417", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492453342.0, "created_utc": 1492424542.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkaf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65spp5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkaf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65spp5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdxi4s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dbuzz111", "parent_id": "t1_dgdhej4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/networking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you very much for that link.
