L2tp/ipsec&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Atm i have everything installed, meaning that the PPTP port is forwarded to the server and l2TP is getting accepted by the router.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only problem i have right now is that i believe (i cannot test this for sure) he also throws the L2TP VPN connection to the server.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without this setup, i can throw everything to server. works fine.\nthrowing everything to router works fine too. only problem is splitting the protocols.\nCould any of you have any idea&amp;#39;s about this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
