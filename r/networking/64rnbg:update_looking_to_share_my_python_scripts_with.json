They ARE designed to not run any config commands on a network device unintentionally.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You may find some functions or pieces of my code elsewhere on the web.  I do not have any professional programming experience, and I tend to look up how to do a specific function and write it for my environment.  However once in a while, I\u2019ll find a specific function that\u2019s written extremely well (such as on StackOverflow or other blogs), and I\u2019ll use that in its entirety.  I\u2019ll attempt to credit anything of the sorts as I post them, but its been a while on some of them so I may miss some.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My intention is not to release these as viable for any production environment.

If it requires a file for input, it dictates what should be in the file and the type of formatting and layout of its contents&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Output expected, whether it&amp;#39;s to a file or on screen only.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I try to comment nearly every line in my script with at least &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to help explain what its for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any other specific questions on a script or a part of it, feel free to reply here, PM me, contact me through the blog feedback page, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I get started with scripting?  I&amp;#39;ve never written a single script in my life!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, that was me 2-3 years ago.  Here&amp;#39;s a high-level breakdown of how I got started (I should make this a blog post later):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Get an idea of what you want to accomplish with the script.  For me, my first script was to locate a client device on the network (device-lookup.py)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Next, figure out the exact steps you would take, as a human administrator, to accomplish said task.  For me, in this example:\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Obtain IP or MAC address of client I&amp;#39;m locating&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Log into a central core switch which houses the client MAC address tables&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Look up the client and find what port its on&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Find what&amp;#39;s connected to that port upstream&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Log into that device and search the MAC address table again&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 3-5 until I found the port with the client&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; From here, you&amp;#39;ll break it down into smaller, more specific steps.  For example, line 1 can be via user input, but line 2 is where the fun begins:\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To log into a switch, you need its IP address&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Once you have an IP, you need to connect via SSH&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You need a way to send commands to the switch and execute them&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You need a way to receive the output (results) of that command&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If what are looking for is somewhere in that output, but there&amp;#39;s other stuff in the output you don&amp;#39;t need, you need to parse out the irrelevant output&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You need to disconnect your SSH session and/or logout safely&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#39;ll see each of the above substeps from above will end up being repeated, both throughout this one script, and possibly any others you write (ex: logging into a device via SSH).  Make that section of code a function, to be reused later&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;COMMENT YOUR CODE!  I forget all the time, especially when starting out, what I did or why I did something&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When I get to anything I want to do, I Google it\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I need to SSH into a switch, but don&amp;#39;t know how&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I want to extract the 3rd word in a full sentence of output&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I want to search through a block of text for a specific word, but since the result is usually towards the end, I want to search in reverse order&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Every bullet point is something I once wanted to do but didn&amp;#39;t know how initially.  I looked it up and found the best way to do it that worked for me.  I then saved that as a function in one of my &amp;#39;lib&amp;#39; files, and can now reference it at any time without worrying about it again.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That sounds like a lot!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re right, it is.  My first script started out only a couple hundred lines or so.  Over time, I added a menu and expanded what I wanted to accomplish.  After it became over 4k lines long, I had to start breaking it apart into individual scripts, for sanity&amp;#39;s sake really.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start small.  Write a basic one that logs into a device and just extracts the running-config to the terminal.  Then try saving it to a file.  Then try finding the hostname of the device, and outputting only that to the screen.  Then save the file as the hostname.  Etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something else I&amp;#39;ll do is write a rough draft of what I want to do, but it&amp;#39;ll be ugly with zero error correction.  In other words, I write a small script that will ONLY work with extremely specific input and output.  From there, I&amp;#39;ll expand it to cover broader options, both from human input, different types of output based on different devices, or possible errors it can encounter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I posted a few days ago at https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/64ctq1/looking_to_share_all_of_my_python_scripts_with/ looking to share some of my scripts with the community and start up a blog.
