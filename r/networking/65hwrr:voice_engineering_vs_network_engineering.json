The sales people will skirt around it and make the deal, the new system goes in and within a week the relationship with the customer sours quite understandably because the new system is less capable than the old.\n\nThe time it's most apparent to me is when I'm hopping around in the web UI of a newer system.  1-2 pages for configuring a phone.

Those protocols gave the benefits of IP in terms of flexibility, moving phones more easily and all that jazz, without losing any of the functionality of the TDM world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Legacy systems have always had control of the telephone terminal on the desk at a very low level.  Painting the display character by character and interpreting keypresses as a hexadecimal code in real time within the server itself.  A lot of the legacy feature set (for Avaya CM and Nortel CS1000 and Mitel MiVoice each have binders of documentation just covering the features, with each platform having 500+ features for us voice techs to pull from to make the weird things customers want happen) is pretty dependent on that level of control and SIP as a &amp;quot;thick client&amp;quot; protocol doesn&amp;#39;t easily lend itself to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things like an executive having a key that makes a buzzer tone play at their admin assistants deskphone, strobe lights or red/yellow/green traffic signals in call centers, nurse call systems triggering automatic calls to a group of people when a code blue button is pressed and that kind of oddball stuff that these customers aren&amp;#39;t going to accept that their old system could do, but a new one cannot.  The sales people will skirt around it and make the deal, the new system goes in and within a week the relationship with the customer sours quite understandably because the new system is less capable than the old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The time it&amp;#39;s most apparent to me is when I&amp;#39;m hopping around in the web UI of a newer system.  1-2 pages for configuring a phone.  To replicate the amount of flexibility I have in how that phone behaves on say a Nortel CS1000, it would take 20+ pages of web based config to allow the number of options I have in my spiral bound book full of Class Of Service codes that I could punch in on the terminal of the old PBX.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "networking", "name": "t1_dgc1arn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492378908.0, "created_utc": 1492350108.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbkmps", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dimicha", "parent_id": "t1_dgakbmq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/networking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's not completely true. \n\nWe have designed and implemented a hosted PBX solution out of Broadworks which does all of these things.\n\nIt purely comes down to how much a company values the voice component of their market. \n\nFrom a Voice Engineers perspective, the end user shouldn't be able to tell the difference between a TDM based service or a SIP service. \n\nIf anything a SIP based service should have more features.\n\nIt sounds like what you have experienced is either Telcos in your area are trying to provide a hosted PBX service with not thrills (completely pointless, could be cheaper?) or they expect people who are not familiar with SIP to set up this solution and maintain it. \n The other alternative is what you're really coming across is Voice Engineers from a TDM based world clinging on to TDM concepts.
