Will router interface statistics show you that as well?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With SD-WAN, you still can get just the interface statistics (be that uptime, errors, etc), but you can get a lot more - like the uptime/packet loss/jitter of the VPN tunnel between your 2 locations. And while you may not be able to directly hold your ISP accountable (because in some cases it may be the issue upstream from them), in general your visibility should be a lot higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do think, however, that you are taking a wrong approach to it. SD-WAN is not there to help you beat up on ISP when they don&amp;#39;t meet SLAs (it can help, but it&amp;#39;s not its purpose). SD-WAN is there to help you build the network that doesn&amp;#39;t particularly care whether the ISP meets their SLA or not, as you have other means of achieving resilience. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "networking", "name": "t1_dgdhvui", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492465770.0, "created_utc": 1492436970.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkaf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v6wq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdoeux", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nuttycomputer", "parent_id": "t3_65v6wq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/networking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; One of my biggest concerns is how to hold the SP accountable for meeting an SLA for broadband links.\n\nForget holding someone accountable I struggled just trying to get a formal SLA on a cable link.
