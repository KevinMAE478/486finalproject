Because statistically speaking, at any point in time, there will be just so many positions available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And nobody&amp;#39;s talking about money (or I&amp;#39;m not anyway) - I&amp;#39;m genuinely talking about the delivery of quality work that has less to do with &amp;quot;what I want to do&amp;quot; and more with &amp;quot;what is genuinely good for the customer/team/infrastructure&amp;quot; and having colleagues/managers/project leaders with similar goals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, working in any industry has a lot to do with human nature. Sometimes it happens that good people get together and build something great. But that is (by no statistic nor any hearsay) not the majority of cases. Thus finding a method to cope with this (hobbies, early job rejection for less desirable places, zen meditation or whatnot) is likelier to push you in a better place with yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "networking", "name": "t1_dg5vpzd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492033820.0, "created_utc": 1492005020.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkaf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wqxz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6d2zg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cheeze_It", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ufeb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/networking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Heh, I make it about the money. \n\nIt makes the conversations easier.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heh, I make it about the money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes the conversations easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "networking", "name": "t1_dg6d2zg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492052507.0, "created_utc": 1492023707.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ufeb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "c00ker", "parent_id": "t1_dg5shqa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/networking", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have many colleagues where this is simply not the case.
