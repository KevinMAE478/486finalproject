Perhaps a decent firewall?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could also make use of two routers &lt;del&gt;(or one router with two VRFs)&lt;/del&gt;(VRF is not going to be available on home routers), each having its own outside connection, and create two VLANs on the switch (needs to be a managed or smart switch, but not necessarily one of high-grade). How it would work would be that users on the LAN get assigned to VLAN(s) 10, and the devices that must be reached via port-forwarding would be assigned to VLAN 20. VLAN 10 only goes through Router 1, and VLAN 20 only goes through Router 2. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a device from the LAN wants to reach the device in question, it uses the outside IP address, which once it gets to Router 1, is sent out to the internet. The ISP will eventually route it back to Router 2, which forwards it to the correct host. This is still a crappy setup, but it would work.
