Is it wrong to just not want to do something because you don't want to? At the very least he plans to keep working on it and possibly dedicate to it from an earlier statement he made. You ever done something half way and realize, \"oh damn I am really not enjoying this anymore, I should take a break and come back to it later\". Togashi is obviously isn't happy when he's making it, so isn't it fair that someone who's worked his ass off his entire life get to have that break? \n\nThe dude is sick as well whether it's serious or not. You wouldn't work full time in a stressful job with a guy pressing a hacksaw onto your back would you? No, of course not. It's painful and makes the job even more stressful. \n\nYes, Togashi has an obligation to finish it, but not at the cost of his own well-being and happiness. God no. I'm not going to enjoy a manga when I know full well the person who made it has whips on his back and is crying out hardships he didn't put upon himself. He deserves to decide whether or not to continue going through these challenges. Because he already did them! They had him working like a dog because WSJ wasn't do so well back then. Why do you think the publisher lets him slack off? \n\nI know it's a bit annoying that he refuses to work with other people, but that's because he believes that HxH wouldn't be HxH if it wasn't done by him. If done by someone else, it wouldn't be the same masterpiece it is now. Though even I, myself, wish that he'd get some form of help to get it out faster.  \n\nTo put it all together, Togashi has the right to be lazy. He deserves it. Who cares about obligations when he's already worked so hard to fulfill them before. When I insulted you about not having merit, I meant \"what makes you better than him to say that he doesn't deserve the right to slack off a bit?\" Have you or anyone else done what he's done but kept at it without slacking off for too long? And even if there are people who's done more than him, does that really still take away the fact that he has worked hard during his life? \n\nAnd to be clear, you are right, I do slouch on my chair and make comments to have people agree with me. I have a dream that I don't work hard enough on, and I didn't have the right myself to criticize what your life is like. I'm sorry about that.  The argument I'm making now though is more about questioning whether or not it is valid to criticize Togashi for his haituses on HxH. I don't think fans do, maybe other people in his craft, but fans are just ordinary people who wants entertainment. I wouldn't walk up to Togashi and tell him \"You're slacking off too much. People want to read Hunter x Hunter.\" as he's limping on his crane from the hacksaw stuck in his back. I can't see the right in that. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry if I got aggressive with my comment and making assumptions with your life(been frustrated today), but I can&amp;#39;t see any right in calling Togashi lazy when he&amp;#39;s worked hard his entire life like all mangaka. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, he&amp;#39;s been taking it a back more and decided to put HxH to the side for long periods of time, but is there really anything wrong with that? Is it wrong to just not want to do something because you don&amp;#39;t want to? At the very least he plans to keep working on it and possibly dedicate to it from an earlier statement he made. You ever done something half way and realize, &amp;quot;oh damn I am really not enjoying this anymore, I should take a break and come back to it later&amp;quot;. Togashi is obviously isn&amp;#39;t happy when he&amp;#39;s making it, so isn&amp;#39;t it fair that someone who&amp;#39;s worked his ass off his entire life get to have that break? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dude is sick as well whether it&amp;#39;s serious or not. You wouldn&amp;#39;t work full time in a stressful job with a guy pressing a hacksaw onto your back would you? No, of course not. It&amp;#39;s painful and makes the job even more stressful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Togashi has an obligation to finish it, but not at the cost of his own well-being and happiness. God no. I&amp;#39;m not going to enjoy a manga when I know full well the person who made it has whips on his back and is crying out hardships he didn&amp;#39;t put upon himself. He deserves to decide whether or not to continue going through these challenges. Because he already did them! They had him working like a dog because WSJ wasn&amp;#39;t do so well back then. Why do you think the publisher lets him slack off? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s a bit annoying that he refuses to work with other people, but that&amp;#39;s because he believes that HxH wouldn&amp;#39;t be HxH if it wasn&amp;#39;t done by him. If done by someone else, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be the same masterpiece it is now. Though even I, myself, wish that he&amp;#39;d get some form of help to get it out faster.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To put it all together, Togashi has the right to be lazy. He deserves it. Who cares about obligations when he&amp;#39;s already worked so hard to fulfill them before. When I insulted you about not having merit, I meant &amp;quot;what makes you better than him to say that he doesn&amp;#39;t deserve the right to slack off a bit?&amp;quot; Have you or anyone else done what he&amp;#39;s done but kept at it without slacking off for too long? And even if there are people who&amp;#39;s done more than him, does that really still take away the fact that he has worked hard during his life? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to be clear, you are right, I do slouch on my chair and make comments to have people agree with me. I have a dream that I don&amp;#39;t work hard enough on, and I didn&amp;#39;t have the right myself to criticize what your life is like. I&amp;#39;m sorry about that.  The argument I&amp;#39;m making now though is more about questioning whether or not it is valid to criticize Togashi for his haituses on HxH. I don&amp;#39;t think fans do, maybe other people in his craft, but fans are just ordinary people who wants entertainment. I wouldn&amp;#39;t walk up to Togashi and tell him &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re slacking off too much. People want to read Hunter x Hunter.&amp;quot; as he&amp;#39;s limping on his crane from the hacksaw stuck in his back.
