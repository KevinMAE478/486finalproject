Although in tandem with whatever the pen is maybe it will be something. So it won&amp;#39;t be a get out of jail free card since it at least ties into other things? Eh, too convoluted, I don&amp;#39;t know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the deus ex would be the person who sent the &amp;quot;Promise&amp;quot; morse code, taking advantage of the situation (which he/she found out via the alarm, assuming he infiltrated the premises).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "manga", "name": "t1_dg9o2c1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492229051.0, "created_utc": 1492200251.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9nkqr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "darkingz", "parent_id": "t1_dg9mw0w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/manga", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hmmm, i did not consider that.
