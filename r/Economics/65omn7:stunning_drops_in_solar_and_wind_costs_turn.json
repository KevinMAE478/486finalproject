Yes, there is a market, and you can see the prices float up and down:\n\nhttp://www.ieso.ca/power-data\n\nHowever, Ontario's effective prices aren't really market driven. At a high level, Ontario's electricity prices on the wholesale level can be broken down into 3 components, Market price, Global Adjustment, and Uplift. According to the latest breakdown, of a wholesale price of $104.93/MWh, $22.73 was the market price, $79.53 was the global adjustment, and $2.64 was the uplift. The actual \"market\" part of the price is only 20% of the total.\n\nSource (table 1-1): http://www.ontarioenergyboard.ca/oeb/_Documents/MSP/MSP_Report_May2015-Oct2015_20161117.pdf \n\nUplift is easy to understand, it is the costs associated with running the grid. These include Operating Reserve, Blackstart Capacity, Congestion Management, etc. Overall Uplift is a tiny portion of the overall wholesale price.\n\nThe next component of the price is the market price, usually referred to as the MCP (Market clearing price - 5 minute price) or HOEP (Hourly Ontario Energy Price - hourly average of MCP). The market price of electricity is set by balancing bids and offers. You can find more information here:\n\nhttp://www.ieso.ca/learn/electricity-pricing/how-the-wholesale-electricity-price-is-determined\n\nNow the final, and largest component of your electricity price is something known as the Global Adjustment. The Global Adjustment is essentially contract payouts. The majority of generation in Ontario is contract driven, and therefore receives a global adjustment payout.\n\nThink about it like this: if you run a solar farm, you will sign a contract known as a feed in tariff. If you're contracted price is say, $100/MWh, it means that you will always be paid $100/MWh. So if the market price is $10, you will receive $90. And in theory if the market price is $110, you have to pay back $10. All nuclear, wind, and solar generation has a contract like that, while hydro and gas have other forms of contracts.\n\nTherefore at the end of the month, the IESO (ontario's market operator) will owe a bunch of generators contracted money (and some generators will have to pay the IESO). This money that the IESO has to pay out is the GA pool. \n\nJudging by how much GA people in Ontario are paying, you can make a case that there are a lot of bad contracts in Ontario. These are long term contracts, and therefore the market cannot correct them. \n\nAnother reason why ontario residential prices are so high since 2011 is the introduction of something called the ICI. The GA pool is not evenly distributed between every single consumer. Instead, the ICI distributes GA by: \"Under ICI, these consumers are charged Global Adjustment on the basis of their share of the total system demand during the highest five peak hours of the year\"\n\nSource: https://news.ontario.ca/mei/en/2016/09/ontarios-industrial-conservation-initiative-ici.html\n\nSo essentially this means that class A customers (industrial customers who are directly connected to the grid) can reduce consumption during the top 5 peak hours, while class B customers like distributors (companies like Toronto Hydro that buy wholesale power to resell to small consumers) cannot. Therefore per MWh the large industrial consumers are paying less GA.\n\nHere's a hypothetical example: Imagine the GA pool is $100 million. During this month, class A customers consumed 50% of the total MWh, with class B consuming the other 50%. However, during the top 5 peak consumption hours, the class A customers reduced their consumption to only 10%, with class B consuming 90%. This means that when the GA pool is allocated, the class A customers have to only pay $10 million for their 50% of power consumed, while class B has to pay $90 million for their 50%.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to explain it like this (I speak for myself as a random shithead on &lt;a href=\"/r/economics\"&gt;r/economics&lt;/a&gt;, not for my employers or for anyone else in the electricity industry):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ontario&amp;#39;s electricity price isn&amp;#39;t really market driven.

In most real time wholesale electricity markets, generators submit bids to generate. These bids are in a competitive market the lowest amount a generator is willing to generate power for (must run generators would bid negative prices, wind and solar bid 0, hydro and gas bid whatever the water/gas cost is, etc). Loads either signal that they are willing to consume at any price (your local distributor is willing to buy at any price), or submit bids for consumption (we will consume X MW if the price is below $Y/MWh, usually industrial consumers).

There's a universal called the \"cost curve\". If you plot the unit cost of something this tends to fall with the logarithm of the cumulative amount that has been produced. It has worked for computers and aluminium billets, ocean freight and bad loan losses in retail banking. It also works for solar power. [Here is the cost curve 1980-2013](https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/69699/area14mp/image-20150122-29860-1g2b5lk.jpg). \n\nYou will note two things from this. First, the wild Chinese overcapacity has dropped the price of solar panels below the cost curve estimate. This has happened in other industries - for example, iron production - and costs tend to stay static until cumulative output catches eventually up with the cost curve. You cannot extrapolate the current cost gradient, although you can expect increased take up, and thus production, due to current low prices. \n\nThe second lesson is that this is a log-log plot. Dropping the cost by a factor of ten took an increase in production of a hundred times. Going to a terawatt will drop solar costs by only a small number, 1.05 to 1.04, on eyeball.

The cost of drilling a gas well and hitching a dedicated CCGT generator to it is lower than the equivalent solar + battery array, and whilst people make much of the fact that solar is then free and gas is not, in fact the cost of gas is entirely notional.
