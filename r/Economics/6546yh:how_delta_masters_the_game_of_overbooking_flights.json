However, the cap does allow them to bump someone unilaterally with only the cap to pay in compensation.  My point is there should be no cap and they should have to keep raising their number until someone bites.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read the story that you linked, each time they were bumped, they only received the cap (or less) for each ticket.  The title is misleading as it suggests someone got $11k for a single bumping. \n In fact, the $11k was really an average of $1222 since there were 3 people getting bumped 3 times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, another thing I find objectionable is that the cap is the lower of 4x or $1350, not the greater of the two.  That means if I happen to score cheap tickets the airline has a free call option to sell more tickets at just 4x what I paid.  There are certainly times when I might decide a flight is too expensive and decide not to go for less than 4x the asking price but once I book a hotel, a car, and take off work; to say my damages are just 4x the price of the ticket is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Economics", "name": "t1_dg9sfjw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492234428.0, "created_utc": 1492205628.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9rdsc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "geezerman", "parent_id": "t1_dg8w5s6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Economics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; I know most people that I talk to hate that airlines are allowed to overbook\n\nThough they *do* like not having their fares increased, by not having to cover the cost of empty seats of flyers who don't show up.\n\n&gt; I contend that the problem is that the price they have to pay is capped.

And they usually end up happy and/or content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When dealing with problems in the service industry the goal, at least to me, is to make the customer happy and/or content.  Said a different way the goal is to prevent the customer from being unhappy.  Overbooking (and similar practices) is a problem that can make people very unhappy, as we saw earlier this week.  But by giving the customer the &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; to make a &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; about their future it gives the customers a feeling that they are in control.  By removing the powerlessness feeling that is associated with mistakes we now removes the unhappiness from the customer, and sometimes at a cost that is less to the company than they have budgeted.  This is a win all around, in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Economics", "name": "t1_dg7z2m2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492136386.0, "created_utc": 1492107586.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6546yh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6546yh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6546yh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8bsvk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Masterbrew", "parent_id": "t1_dg8adm8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Economics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You don't see the information problem?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t see the information problem?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Economics", "name": "t1_dg8bsvk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492150905.0, "created_utc": 1492122105.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8adm8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "neodiogenes", "parent_id": "t1_dg82qq4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Economics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's funny how people complain before fully exploring their options.
