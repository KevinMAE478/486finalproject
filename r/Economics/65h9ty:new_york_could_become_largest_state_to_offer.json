A financial transaction tax is a reckless regulation that would put an unnecessary burden on investors. This will certainly raise the cost of investments and the transfer of capital to businesses and also limit the flexibility of investors in reducing losses. This proposed tax would hurt all trading operations as it reduces the efficiency of the market for investors, ironically hurting the massive endowments that many US universities depend on too. Also, many firms would just route transactions to overseas markets. So I highly doubt that it'll gain much revenue. Also, this tax burden would effect small investors too through higher pension costs and insurance fund costs that invest in Wall Street. That simply isn't a sound policy idea as it'll drive participants out of the US marketplace and damage our capital markets.
