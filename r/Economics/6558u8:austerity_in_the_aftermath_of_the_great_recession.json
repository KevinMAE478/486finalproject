If your problem is faulty domestic industry -usually deu to state interference - then pouring on money is not a stimulant. If you have a fiscal deficit - if taxes are lower than state income - you can solve that temporarily with debt, but only if you solve the reasons why you have that problem: collect taxes better or spend less. If your banks are shot and also you have a fiscal deficit, then you as the state have very constrained options: hence the PIIGs. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Economics", "name": "t1_dgdarzw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492448807.0, "created_utc": 1492420007.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb5b9u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "louieanderson", "parent_id": "t1_dg7l869", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Economics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; \"Sorry, there's no money\".
