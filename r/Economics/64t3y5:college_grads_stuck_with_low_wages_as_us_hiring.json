The quality gap between colleges is massive and if the resources some no name college provides are sub par, you&amp;#39;re better off doing vocational classes instead of getting some random humanities degree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s also the massive problem of students not knowing how to take advantage of the resources they&amp;#39;re paying for. Even at good schools tons of students just don&amp;#39;t understand that you need to do more than just attend class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My school was great and everyone I know who tried hard, interacted with the college community and had a direction succeeded in their careers. The people who didn&amp;#39;t do well we&amp;#39;re people that didn&amp;#39;t decide on a degree until late, and didn&amp;#39;t really know what career they wanted to pursue, and didn&amp;#39;t do much outside of going to classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Economics", "name": "t1_dg5mrou", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492013703.0, "created_utc": 1491984903.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t3y5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t3y5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ke0n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Meat-brah", "parent_id": "t1_dg5hnua", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Economics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "GT", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GT&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Economics", "name": "t1_dg5ke0n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492007174.0, "created_utc": 1491978374.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t3y5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5sa42", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BetterMeThanYou", "parent_id": "t1_dg5hnua", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Economics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Penn, Michigan, Washington, to name a few more.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penn, Michigan, Washington, to name a few more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Economics", "name": "t1_dg5sa42", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492028560.0, "created_utc": 1491999760.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t3y5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1s", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t3y5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6m9hx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jihad_Shark", "parent_id": "t1_dg6k47x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Economics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Brown is 56 and Dartmouth is 73.
