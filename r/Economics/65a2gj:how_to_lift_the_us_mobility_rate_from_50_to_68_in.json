The IGE measures by percentage the decrease (or possibly increase) in income disparity between different families from the parents income to the children's income when they grow up. Pew sums it up nicely, \"The IGE measures the strength of the relationship between the income of parents and that of\nchildren. It is not, strictly speaking, a measure of economic mobility, but it is often used as such because it refers to the persistence in economic standing across generations. If one compares, for example, children from families making $50,000 per year with those from families making 20 percent more ($60,000 per year), the IGE tells us how much of that 20 percent difference is preserved when the children become adults with incomes of their own.\" You can see, then, how rising inequality is already baked into the IGE. Because there isn't perfect relative mobility rates, the rich still tend to stay mostly rich while the poor still tend to stay mostly poor. The rising inequality makes the intergenerational comparisons of the gap worse than in countries with much less inequality. Because the great gatsby curve uses the IGE, it would be obvious that countries with rising income inequalities would have poorer IGE results. Researchers have begun to shift to statistics that measure relative mobility rates at much purer levels. Chetty and many other economists now use the Spearman rank correlation (Korak mainly uses IGC in his paper but includes Spearman results). Spearman is similar to the IGE in the sense that it measures the persistence of a gap between the richest and poorest kids in adulthood. But instead of using income, it uses ranks. For example (I'm using simple numbers), if a child is in the 0th percentile of the nation for income, and another child is on the 100th percentile, and then in adulthood the poor child is in the 40th while the rich child in the 60th, Spearman rank correlation would output a number of 20. The gap between the rich child and the poor child (initially at 100) has fallen to 20. Here, rising income inequality is not already baked into this statistic. When measuring relative mobility rates with better statistics such as Spearman, there really is no correlation between income inequality and relative mobility rates. \n\nYour point regarding absolute mobility rates, upon further clarification, is obvious. If real income doesn't grow for the median and we measure absolute mobility with real income for the median, then we should find that absolute mobility rates are constant and 0 for that median. Chetty's argument is not that the way we increase or decrease absolute mobility rates for the median is with wage growth (I think everyone on this planet would agree with that), it's that a better distribution of income would increase absolute mobility rates more than pursuing only higher aggregate wage growth (you still obviously need some wage growth). I disagree with some of the underlying assumptions he makes which leads me to disagree with him that his paper demonstrates that higher income inequality leads to a reduction in absolute mobility rates.
