The error only trickles down when you make a function that takes in different inverse cumulative distribution functions for standard normal deviation that build on false assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As with anything, you can apply fancy (beautiful) mathematics the whole day, but if the assumptions are wrong or disingenuously put together (in this case forcing financial returns to be normal distributions. I mean, if you patch enough distributions together everything becomes a normal distribution. So hah, here normal distributed financial returns to work with! Top it off with disingenuous correlations and voil\u00e0, you have toxic instruments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who gained the most out of these &amp;quot;brilliant&amp;quot; creations? The people whose life savings were the butt in which to put risk?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about Hume. Kant credits him to have woken him up from the &amp;quot;dogmatic sleep&amp;quot;. How so? Hume just didn&amp;#39;t assume that if an apple falls 10 000 times on the ground it has to fall the 10 001st time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A HIGH DEFAULT CORRELATION EVENT IN HOUSING, the fact that it went south, was the fault of people stuck in dogmatic sleep who were not able to do their job. But first and foremost, it was the fault of people knowing what they were doing. Big banks that knew very, very well that they could get bailed out no matter what the risk they took.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The economy grew because the interests were way too low for way too long, but what Greenspan did is another topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again: Banks are crucial for civilization. San Francisco exists because of an Italian Banker. The industrial revolution happened right after England decided to treat debt in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have some decency and don&amp;#39;t get upset about the FED patrolling you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: lol, I&amp;#39;ve seen your edit only now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Economics", "name": "t1_dg8fnci", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492156006.0, "created_utc": 1492127206.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8dtdz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg8d9tw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Economics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Economics", "name": "t1_dg8dtdz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492153575.0, "created_utc": 1492124775.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8d9tw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jimmy_Prussia", "parent_id": "t1_dg8csi0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Economics", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Of course large banks were not alone in polluting the world, lots of accomplices.\n\nBut don't forget who created Collateralized Debt Obligations, credit default swaps and subprime mortgage backed securities.\n\nWho has more responsibility, someone who has aids, doesn't know it and has continuously sex or someone who has aids, knows it and has continuously sex?\n\nGiven the cardinal role banks have in our society it infuriates me how reckless and irresponsible they act and/or acted.
