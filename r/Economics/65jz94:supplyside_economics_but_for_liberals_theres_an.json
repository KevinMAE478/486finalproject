You can't measure the success of a retail store with the same standards as other industries. Wal-Mart frequently outperforms its competitors.\n\nSort of.

[WalMart's revenues actually dropped from 2015 to 2016 by about $3 billion.](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/wmt/financials) [Amazon, on the other hand, has been growing explosively.](http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/56abe654c08a80431d8bb4ef-1200-900/20160129_amazon_bi.png)\n\nWalMart is constantly refocusing itself to avoid being made obsolete.\n\n&gt; 3) As for your IQ/conscientiousness comment. First, IQ isn't nearly the indicator people like to pretend it is. There are substantial studies on the subject.\n\nYeah, and they agree with me.\n\nIQ is very important. In fact, it is the most important psychometric factor we've measured. It has a strong positive correlation with basically every positive life outcome, and the idea that it measures intelligence is [very well accepted within the scientific community.](http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997mainstream.pdf) The \"controversy\" over it is no different from the \"controversy\" over global warming, I'm afraid - some people really don't like that IQ is a thing for political reasons, so get super angry about it.\n\n&gt; Second is that correlation does not equal causation. You've assumed that higher intelligence and the like lead to more successful outcomes. But the causation could be the other way - that being more successful leads to higher IQ and conscientiousness.\n\nHigher IQ and conscientiousness are predictive of income. If you look at people, and measure their IQs at age 18, it predicts their lifelong income pretty well. That is a strong indication that it causative of higher earning. Indeed, the route of causation is pretty well known.\n\nIndeed, there's actually no known way to really positively influence IQ. You can't make people smarter. It is mostly genetic - it has a heritability in adulthood of about .75 (1 being the highest possible) and is difficult to influence much. Severe malnutrition, abuse, and brain damage can lower IQ, but there's no known way to raise it.\n\nConscientiousness is thought to be less genetically moderated.\n\n&gt; Furthermore, I simply reject your assertion that higher IQs lead to higher earnings.\n\nBeing smarter does not *necessarily* mean you earn more income, but on average, smarter people earn more than dumber ones. [The coefficient of correlation is somewhere in the range of .35 to .5,](http://humanvarieties.org/2016/01/31/iq-and-permanent-income-sizing-up-the-iq-paradox/) suggesting about a quarter of variation in income can be attributed to variation in IQ.\n\n&gt; But as I've never come across such studies myself - and have come across many that suggest the causal relationship goes the other way, I'm calling it a myth.\n\nIt isn't a myth at all. It is impossible for the causal link to be the other way around because IQ in adulthood doesn't change much, and things like SAT scores predict future income. Indeed, [this holds true even at the extreme top end of things - even in the top 1%, being in the top 25% of the top 1% is better than being in the bottom 25% of the top 1%.](http://www.businessinsider.com/this-chart-proves-just-how-much-sat-scores-predict-future-success-2012-5) That's test scores I'm talking about, not income.\n\nYou can't claim causality is reversed there - the test scores come first, before earnings.\n\n&gt; As for your \"work less\" point...it simply ignores some pretty obvious realities of low skill work. These companies simply do not approve overtime.\n\nYeah... why would they?\n\nAlso, most people who make lots of money aren't paid by the hour and don't make overtime pay. My parents are salaried. That's true of a lot of high-income earners. Working more doesn't give you any direct financial benefit, as noted by the article I linked to.\n\nBut indirectly, it appears to pay off anyway.\n\nIt's just how it works on the top end. Salaried employees are expected to do their work, which is theoretically 40ish hours but is often closer to 50. I speak from experience on that front.\n\nSome companies are working towards regularizing 40 hour work weeks, though, to try and mitigate some burnout issues. This is especially true at some software companies, as too much overtime there tends to create more problems than it solves due to generating extra errors in code due to fatigue.\n\n&gt; Fast food, retail, etc will all much prefer having 10 employees working 20hr weeks to 5 employees working 40hr weeks.\n\nIt is complicated. Dealing with more people is more expensive - more training, more people to juggle, ect. - but it also gives you more backup. Unfortunately, some of it is also regulatory - you have to give certain benefits to full-time employees that you don't have to give to part-time employees. The goal is to improve the lot of life of people, and it does that - if you're full time. But it also has the negative incentive of encouraging people to hire fewer full-time workers and more part-time workers.\n\nAlas, there's not a great way around this apart from changing the law - and even then, you have to figure out how much you should be giving part-time employees in terms of benefits.\n\n&gt; 4) I noticed your last point. I was recently promoted to hourly management at the highest in store level. It's a clear step towards salaried. I've already made my intentions clear and had the necessary conversations with market-level management. At this point, it's about getting this experience down and a very likely move up into a salaried position after that. It's a pretty clear trajectory.\n\nAwesome!

But it also has the negative incentive of encouraging people to hire fewer full-time workers and more part-time workers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alas, there&amp;#39;s not a great way around this apart from changing the law - and even then, you have to figure out how much you should be giving part-time employees in terms of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4) I noticed your last point.

The idea of value-added work is literally the only way to pay people. If you aren't adding value, why on earth would anyone pay you to do something for them?\n\nThe amount you're paid more or less correlates with the amount of value your work generates. If your work generates less value than your salary, you won't get hired at all/you'll be laid off.\n\nObviously this isn't a trivial thing to calculate at all times (what is the value added of a janitor, for instance? They clearly add value, but how much value do they add?) but overall, pay is generally proportional to how much value you add. This is pretty clear if you ever actually do anything on the employer end of things - having been involved in hiring decisions before, seeing how much (or little) value was added by employees was informative and kind of depressing. Realizing that most people (who thought they were being taken advantage of via shitty wages) were actually only barely worth employing at all was pretty sobering.\n\n&gt; If we could go back to assembly line jobs for $30/hr, many would be happy to choose that over Walmart jobs, even if it would be more inefficient.\n\n&gt; So the question is, why has automation hurt the average worker rather than enabling them?\n\nThe reality is that wages were never generally $30/hour for assembly line jobs; they were massively lower than that. In 1950, for instance, people made about $1.08 wages + benefits per hour working union steel jobs, and that was complained about by the businesses at the time.\n\nHowever, some people really were paid pretty high wages in the 1980s and 1990s for very low-level jobs. And this exception is instructive.\n\n[Today, autoworker compensation (wages + benefits) is $58/hour at GM, $57 at Ford, and $48 at Fiat Chrysler.](http://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2015/03/23/uaw-ford-gm-chrysler-labor-cost-car-contract-talks-bargaining-convention/70335462/)\n\nBut here's the thing people don't tell you: it was high autoworker pay due to the unions that fucked up the American automobile industry. Because the automakers overpaid their employees, the result was that their vehicles would either have to cost too much money or they had to cut corners on the quality of the car to keep costs low. The result was foreign automakers dramatically undercutting American ones in terms of price or being able to deliver better performance and reliability, while still paying their employees reasonable wages.\n\nThe cause of this was a monopoly. But not a corporate monopoly, but a UNION monopoly. By having a monopoly on labor, they eliminated competition for wages. The union was then able to overcharge auto manufacturers for their cost of labor because the choices were to pay exorbitantly high prices or not have workers at all.\n\nMonopolies are bad for exactly this reason. And the result was that consumers suffered, until we were able to purchase foreign-made cars that were better than the American ones.\n\nThen, when the automakers started crumbling and people lost their jobs because people could buy cars that weren't shit from Japan or Germany, the people who lost their jobs whined about it and complained they couldn't get jobs that paid as well.\n\nBut the cause of the job losses was the same as the cause of them being overpaid - they were using an abusive monopoly to jack up prices on consumers. Once the monopoly was broken, their extortion was no longer viable, and they either had to adapt or perish.\n\nIf you've wondered why there has been a big backlash against unions in the US, this is actually precisely why - the unions, by creating monopolies, fucked people over. But in the end, it became possible to undercut the union monopolies, which benefitted everyone but the union members who had been fucking over the general public. And it ultimately ended up costing a shit ton of American jobs in the long term, as people shifted their business away from the places where the monopolies held sway. Other areas which were less friendly towards unions - particularly the South - welcomed decent-paying jobs (because making cars DOES pay decently, as cars are high-value items, and your pay is commensurate with the amount of value you contribute) and were happy to put laws in place which undercut the power of the unions in order to attract those jobs to their communities.\n\nThat's not to say that unions are inherently evil - they're not. But unions aren't inherently good, either. Whether they are good or bad depends on their actions, as well as the nature of their monopoly - the UAW monopoly is much more problematic than the SAG monopoly because SAG is easier to bypass and has less control. Thus, SAG's ability to abuse its monopoly is much smaller than the UAW's ability to do so, which generally results in the SAG reaching much more reasonable accommodations - their monopoly is much less secure.\n\nThis is something a lot of people don't like to talk about, but you have to remember, that high pay didn't come out of the pockets of corporations, but the pockets of consumers. They were fucking everyone else in the US over (well, everyone who bought a car) to line their own pockets, as ultimately, *all* prices are paid by consumers. They have to be - where else is the money coming from?\n\nWhen someone demands higher pay, they're ultimately saying that we, the consumer, needs to pay them more - which means that they're saying that they deserve more of our money than they get. They deserve to make us poorer so they can be richer.\n\nThat's how it works.\n\nAutomation, conversely, makes everyone richer by reducing the amount of labor necessary to produce goods and services. By doing this, they greatly lower the costs of goods and services.\n\nRemember, a 24\" black and white Admiral TV cost $179 in 1959. That's not $179 \"adjusted for inflation\". It straight up cost $179.\n\nToday, you can buy a 24\" full color 1080p HD TV for about that off of Amazon.\n\nThat's the power of automation. We pay fewer people more money to make TVs today than we did in the past.\n\nThe result is that we have a lot more TVs, and a lot fewer jobs making TVs.\n\nThis is good for society, because it means that labor can now go and do other things. Back in the 1950s, for instance, houses were much smaller and almost no one had AC. Today, houses are much larger (indeed, they've grown by over 1000 square feet since the 1970s alone) and even most poor people have AC.\n\nAutomation makes it so fewer people can produce more goods. This lowers the price of goods relative to wages, meaning that people are a lot richer - if you have ten people building cars, you're much better off if you have one person building cars, one person building ACs, one person building TVs, ect. and getting as many cars as you were before, plus all those other things. It leads to a greater level of wealth in your society, and everyone ends up much better off because goods are much cheaper.\n\nPeople were poor in the 1950s by modern standards. We consider such a lifestyle utterly unacceptable today.\n\nAutomation gives us a lot more and better stuff.

Walmart only exists because the cost of labor is so low, partly due to the availability of welfare programs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can say workers aren&amp;#39;t valuable, but that misses the point.  It&amp;#39;s not the workers that are a problem, it is the lack of opportunity.  If we could go back to assembly line jobs for $30/hr, many would be happy to choose that over Walmart jobs, even if it would be more inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the question is, why has automation hurt the average worker rather than enabling them?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Economics", "name": "t1_dgd4o71", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492433491.0, "created_utc": 1492404691.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcp5f8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TitaniumDragon", "parent_id": "t1_dgc0it3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Economics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; 1) I didn't say that I expected them to pay well (though keep in mind they pay far better than both Publix and Target - I'm extremely familiar with both).

They can't raise their prices much, otherwise, what's the point of even *going* to WalMart over other places? If they raise their staff wages, they need to get that money from somewhere - and they are taking some profit losses. But some of that is also coming from reduced staffing.\n\nRetailers all too often are running on the razor's edge because they are extremely replaceable and interchangeable. They've only got one real axis to compete on anymore, and that's price, because people simply don't care enough about service to pay much for it. And given WalMart's primary demographic is the poorer end of the spectrum, a lot of people can't really afford to pay much more - they're very sensitive to price increases.\n\nIf people keep spending money while your store is understaffed, then clearly whatever it was that was being done that isn't being done now wasn't actually necessary. You were simply having people do something that wasn't important.\n\nBut sometimes understaffing is simply a result of trying to put off the inevitable necessity to hire more people or fold, because you literally can't get the work done and the stuff that isn't getting done is actually important and can't be deferred forever.\n\n&gt; And anyone who wants to pretend that they got anywhere from nothing but persistence/productivity/skill/etc is lying to themselves. There are always a lot of circumstance at play beyond our control.

There's a saying - success is like getting pregnant. Everyone congratulates you, but no one knows how many times you were fucked.\n\nIt isn't about luck. It's about persistence. It's about constantly seeking to better yourself and your circumstances. Many people don't do this. In fact, people are moving less often than they did historically - which is a problem, because as it turns out, moving is strongly predictive of getting a better job and a better income. Fewer people are willing to seek out new jobs in distant places to make more money, which limits their upward mobility - if you are totally dependent on the local job market, then whether or not you find a better position is dependent on whether one opens up locally. But if you look across, say, the US, there's a bigger chance of finding something better. But that requires moving if you get it, which is big and scary and a lot of work.\n\nA lot of people aren't willing to do this. You talk about your job sucking - how much time do you spend looking for a better one? You seem to have decided that there is nothing better. What incentive does WalMart have to not keep fucking you if you have no other options?\n\nMy parents were constantly doing low-level browsing for new jobs, even when they were happy with their jobs.

But it is one of the reasons why some people are consistently successful while others aren't.\n\nIf you believe that this sort of thing doesn't pay off, you're less likely to do it - and thus, less likely to advance. In fact, there's a correlation between a positive mindset and success, and it isn't just that successful people are more positive - it is also that people with a more positive, proactive outlook are more likely to succeed.\n\nThis makes sense if you think about it - if you believe that your behavior can be changed in order to make yourself more successful, you're more likely to change your behavior and thus make yourself more successful.\n\n&gt;  The idea that the poor are only poor because they're lazy or stupid is a myth.\n\nOnly?

I've seen a couple literally beg. I kind of, sort of get vacation. I accrue paid time off, but the big cost of my steady 40 hours is that I can't actually take a day off. If I call out, its going to get ugly. I'm in the middle of some big medical things right now, and I'm looking at as much as $5500 this year in expenses for that. That's approximately 25% of my income from 2016 (100% of which was working full time for Walmart). And that number is the out-of-pocket max for my Walmart insurance.

My first promotion at Walmart came literally because this one person thought \"she's smart, she likes to read books in the break room, let's put her in this position\". Would they have done it if I was a slacker or unreliable? No. But were there others who were reliable and hardworking *and* had more time and track record with the company? Yes.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear. I work at Walmart. I&amp;#39;ve done very well at Walmart. Walmart is better than other companies I have worked for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the low wages and poor work conditions/demands is still something worth criticizing. Especially considering that Walmart is the largest private employer in the country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day, I get asked to do 12 hours of work in an 8 hour shift. Keep in mind that I have enjoyed the best jobs in a Walmart store - the ones that allow you to work mostly independently and away from customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know how many days off I get in a year? 1. Christmas Day. I have to be there every other day of the year that I&amp;#39;m scheduled. I&amp;#39;m lucky that I have one of a small handful of full time positions at my store - there are department managers, salaried management and 3 other positions. The rest? Begging for hours. I&amp;#39;ve seen a couple literally beg. I kind of, sort of get vacation. I accrue paid time off, but the big cost of my steady 40 hours is that I can&amp;#39;t actually take a day off. If I call out, its going to get ugly. I&amp;#39;m in the middle of some big medical things right now, and I&amp;#39;m looking at as much as $5500 this year in expenses for that. That&amp;#39;s approximately 25% of my income from 2016 (100% of which was working full time for Walmart). And that number is the out-of-pocket max for my Walmart insurance. It doesn&amp;#39;t take into account wages lost from having to take time off work. Nor does it take into account how said time off might impact my future with the company. And you have to understand - I&amp;#39;m in one of the cushy Walmart jobs. If you aren&amp;#39;t a manager, its one of only 3 full time positions in my store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, things could be worse. I could still be working for Target. Much worse, I could still be working fast food. But the truth is that it isn&amp;#39;t simply hard work that got me where I am. My mother worked hard her entire life without getting as far as I have.
