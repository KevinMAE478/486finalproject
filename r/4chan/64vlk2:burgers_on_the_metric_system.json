As I said, measurements are arbitrary, so this is just an issue of people getting used to such measurements, and if we want a better system, we&amp;#39;ll have to come up with a way to be &amp;quot;backwards compatible,&amp;quot; to easily switch between standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best benefit I see to the imperial system is having base 2 almost everywhere, and often base 3 (basically base 6). This makes multiplication and division among whole numbers much easier. Need to cut a foot into halves? Thirds? Fourths? Sixths? No need to use fractions of an inch. Base ten only allows halves and fifths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "4chan", "name": "t1_dg62byl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492041449.0, "created_utc": 1492012649.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6090k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hamsterboy56", "parent_id": "t1_dg5wwv0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/4chan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What are the benefits of the imperial system again?
