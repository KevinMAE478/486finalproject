The fines for not doing so are pretty steep as they&amp;#39;re the same fines they use for other aircraft. Think thousands to tens of thousands. FAR should have some info on this, but it is steep. Doing so for commercial purposes requires a commercial pilots license. They&amp;#39;re pretty serious about all this. It isn&amp;#39;t as much a case of &amp;quot;how will they stop you&amp;quot; as much as &amp;quot;can you afford it if they do.&amp;quot; They know they won&amp;#39;t stop everyone, but they want to make it so costly for the people they do stop that people are extremely deterred. It&amp;#39;s all a numbers game. They get a few people and destroy their lives so much that no one else wants to be the one in 10,000 that may actually get caught.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spez: looks like, when they banned drones near the Superbowl this year, the flight restrictions were enforced by NORAD.
