I responded with specific events, at the time it was the &amp;quot;Muslim ban&amp;quot; shit. I pointed out that it wasn&amp;#39;t a Muslim ban, it was a ban from terrorist states. No reply. I asked him about the rigged election and wiki leaks. No reply. At this point I&amp;#39;m getting desperate, because this guy was like my closest friend. I ask if he wants to talk about it over the phone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His response was a wall of text about everything he didn&amp;#39;t like about me. It was massive. Insults, bringing up years old things we talked about, hate. Nothing about trump. I asked if he really didn&amp;#39;t want to be friends, and that I thought we&amp;#39;d be friends for life. No reply for an entire day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally he told me to grow up and apologize to him. I finally told him to just fuck off. I&amp;#39;m basically friendless and alone, but fuck me if I&amp;#39;m not going to have some kind of self respect. It hurts. It&amp;#39;s random, and mindless. I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "The_Donald", "name": "t1_dgarrjo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492299229.0, "created_utc": 1492270429.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ippc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgangxs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "leonboss1218", "parent_id": "t3_65ippc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/The_Donald", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can't be unfriended if I don't have a Facebook", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t be unfriended if I don&amp;#39;t have a Facebook&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "The_Donald", "name": "t1_dgangxs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492292468.0, "created_utc": 1492263668.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ippc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ippc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ippc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgas34g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ashishduhh1", "parent_id": "t1_dgaoj3n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/The_Donald", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Liberals think bring pro-Trump is the equivalent of throwing hate speech at them.
