At the time of this footage, Mr. Trump and his staff did not yet know that they would actually get a last minute miracle win for the highest position in the land, and they rightly thought, like all of us, that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton would surely win the Presidency, due to her obvious advantages over Trump of having greater experience, knowledge and wisdom, as well as popularity. While rumors had been reported, neither Trump, nor Hillary, nor the general public were aware that the Russian government had secretly hacked the election against Mrs. Clinton in order to give Trump the seemingly impossible win. Our sources confirm to CNN that in their expert opinion an investigation is needed to discover the possibility that Trump is unstable, and might well make an another attempt on his son's life, in which case his son Barron needs to be immediately removed from the household and placed in protective care until it can be determined without a possible doubt that he is safe from his Father. Our experts tell us \"In situations like these, where there is a parent whose behavior cannot be predicted 100%, there is a mandate to get that child as far away from that possibly dangerous household as fast as you can, into the care and safety of dedicated child care professionals who know whats best for the child and his family....and given the high levels of stress Barron must be under due to the toxic environment of growing up in his Father's White House Administration which, by all accounts, is in shambles, and apparently under several other investigations for wrongdoing, it becomes imperative that the child be removed, and at the very least a thorough investigation by CPS should be launched.\" CNN has reached out to Washington, D.C.  authorities about the allegations but they were unable to respond at the time of this report.

At the time of this footage, Mr. Trump and his staff did not yet know that they would actually get a last minute miracle win for the highest position in the land, and they rightly thought, like all of us, that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton would surely win the Presidency, due to her obvious advantages over Trump of having greater experience, knowledge and wisdom, as well as popularity. While rumors had been reported, neither Trump, nor Hillary, nor the general public were aware that the Russian government had secretly hacked the election against Mrs. Clinton in order to give Trump the seemingly impossible win. Our sources confirm to CNN that in their expert opinion an investigation is needed to discover the possibility that Trump is unstable, and might well make an another attempt on his son&amp;#39;s life, in which case his son Barron needs to be immediately removed from the household and placed in protective care until it can be determined without a possible doubt that he is safe from his Father. Our experts tell us &amp;quot;In situations like these, where there is a parent whose behavior cannot be predicted 100%, there is a mandate to get that child as far away from that possibly dangerous household as fast as you can, into the care and safety of dedicated child care professionals who know whats best for the child and his family....and given the high levels of stress Barron must be under due to the toxic environment of growing up in his Father&amp;#39;s White House Administration which, by all accounts, is in shambles, and apparently under several other investigations for wrongdoing, it becomes imperative that the child be removed, and at the very least a thorough investigation by CPS should be launched.&amp;quot; CNN has reached out to Washington, D.C.  authorities about the allegations but they were unable to respond at the time of this report. We will keep on this and continue to keep you updated with any new reports.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "The_Donald", "name": "t1_dg5amjb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491990805.0, "created_utc": 1491962005.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64u07o", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ezu0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DankAntimatter", "parent_id": "t3_64u07o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/The_Donald", "controversiality": 0, "body": "B-but Huffpo told me that Barron and Melania are being abused by Donald REEEEEEEEEEEE\n\nI almost threw up typing that.
