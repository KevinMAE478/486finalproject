It used to be that transsexuality was a clinically recognized condition that had clear methods of treatment.

It used to be that with classic transsexuality, we were simply transitioning from one sex to the other and we were perfectly fine with the gender binary.  The gender theorist non-binary post-modernist crowd wants to deconstruct the entire concept of biological sex and gender to become an entirely subjective social construct.

Most of us just wanted to live our lives quietly and not annoy anyone.  Personally, I didn't use the women's restroom until I knew that I was being gendered as female 100% when out in public.  I didn't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable.  Also, at that point, I would've really bothered men if I were to used the men's room -- they tend not to like when they see a woman walk into their safe space.\n\nI do agree that people are very concerned about the treatment of trans kids, but I honestly think that's mostly because the average layperson is simply uniformed about how things actually work within the medical community who are treating these kids.

That's mostly just a hyperbolic strawman argument that's designed to shock people.\n\nI know a guy whose 14-or-15 year old kid is female-to-male.

Lack of data and sample size is something that really plagues all kinds of research questions we have about the trans community.
