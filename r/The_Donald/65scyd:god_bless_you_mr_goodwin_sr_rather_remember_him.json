Or maybe even some guys at the VFW might be able to help with referrals?  I know the VA has a crisis line, and you&amp;#39;re supposed to be able to chat with someone online, too... &lt;a href=\"https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/?utm_source=bing&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_term=veteran%20support&amp;amp;utm_content=veteranshelp&amp;amp;utm_campaign=veterancrisis\"&gt;https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/?utm_source=bing&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_term=veteran%20support&amp;amp;utm_content=veteranshelp&amp;amp;utm_campaign=veterancrisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have a friend who needed some therapy for depression years ago. At the time, her husband was having health issues and they were on welfare because he wasn&amp;#39;t able to work, and she had just given birth. In desperation, she contacted the local mental health department in her city, and she was able to receive help at a very reduced rate because it was based on income level. (It was like $5 a session.) She told me she actually received very good care, and at the time, she wasn&amp;#39;t expecting much. So I think it depends on who you get. It doesn&amp;#39;t hurt to try. And I always tell people to not be afraid to shop around until you find someone you can feel comfortable with.

The lefties, the righties, every fvcking body blames it on not having enough money. So they tax us more and more and more. The inner city schools are not getting any better. The majority of their high school graduates still can't pass basic math and English placement exams for community college or college. \n\nThe problem is that the problem isn't the money. The problem is other stuff that would make you fall asleep if I start talking about it. I will if you want but it literally puts people to sleep. I could write a book on it.\n\nAnyway, what happens to all the money they suck out of us for public schools? Well, most of it is wasted. The superintendents are given perks like limousines with full-time chauffeurs (not kidding--Baltimore City Schools, Alonso). They have huge central administration staffs full of unnecessary fluff positions. Textbooks are constantly \"updated\" unnecessarily. Frankly, they'd all be better off using the textbooks from the 1950's. Updating them has not improved the content, rather if you read on this it is the contrary. Collegiate and professional level stadium football field lighting for the football team! How ridiculous is that? Why are my tax dollars paying for that? I am paying to give kids who can barely read or do arithmetic stadium football lighting? Why? Worthless professional development consultants are paid unreal amounts of money to teach nothing of use to teachers. These consultants invariably are hired through nepotism and cronyism.\n\nI could go on and on about the waste of taxpayer money. \n\nSo on to the topic of mental health. Improving the mental health system in this libtard society would never mean that bad seeds would be locked up or otherwise removed from society. Nope, our country full of moronic cucks believes in rehabilitation. Instead, you the taxpayer would get further drained of your money and all that money would be used to pay for a bunch of cuck whiners to get free therapy where they could sit on a couch and cry about how they were bullied, their mommy was mean to them, their daddy touched them in their uhoh spot, their hardships of being transgender, how they feel depressed because Trump is in office, and on and on and on. \n\nIn the meantime, you wouldn't have a fvcking penny to go to the doctor if you had a cavity or a torn ligament in your knee. But the government would drive you into poverty so a bunch of jobless people could have lots and lots of medical care, housing, food, schooling, and now therapy at your expense. \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There won&amp;#39;t be any such thing as making the mental health system better anymore than they have succeeded at making our schools better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they say they want to make it better, what they mean is they want us to give them more and more of our tax dollars which they will totally squander in totally meaningless, worthless, and purposeless ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, the inner city public schools are a fvcking wreck. The lefties, the righties, every fvcking body blames it on not having enough money. So they tax us more and more and more. The inner city schools are not getting any better. The majority of their high school graduates still can&amp;#39;t pass basic math and English placement exams for community college or college. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the problem isn&amp;#39;t the money. The problem is other stuff that would make you fall asleep if I start talking about it. I will if you want but it literally puts people to sleep. I could write a book on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what happens to all the money they suck out of us for public schools? Well, most of it is wasted. The superintendents are given perks like limousines with full-time chauffeurs (not kidding--Baltimore City Schools, Alonso). They have huge central administration staffs full of unnecessary fluff positions. Textbooks are constantly &amp;quot;updated&amp;quot; unnecessarily. Frankly, they&amp;#39;d all be better off using the textbooks from the 1950&amp;#39;s. Updating them has not improved the content, rather if you read on this it is the contrary. Collegiate and professional level stadium football field lighting for the football team! How ridiculous is that? Why are my tax dollars paying for that? I am paying to give kids who can barely read or do arithmetic stadium football lighting? Why? Worthless professional development consultants are paid unreal amounts of money to teach nothing of use to teachers. These consultants invariably are hired through nepotism and cronyism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on about the waste of taxpayer money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So on to the topic of mental health.
