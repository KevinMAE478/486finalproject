He spent $1 billion dollars and just played golf and sat on beaches the entire fucking time. Trump has, between holes, potentially gotten the leader of China on board with nuclear disarmament for North Korea, bombed Syria (note: wasn't terribly excited about it, glad Trump has said we're not going in), and other things.\n\nAnd the left doesn't understand any of this. \"DRUMPF PLAYING GOLF MORE THAN OBAMA LOLOLOL\" Yeah, you stupid fuck.
