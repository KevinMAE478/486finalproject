You start with .22LR and slowly work your way up to more manly cardridges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: TO stop those correcting me; bruising your shoulder from 5.56mm, for as far as I can see, is something that happens with very inexperienced shooters that A) position the gun incorrectly on their upper arm, and B) Hold it in place with excessive tension, because they are scared bitches, basically. Once the recoil hit, it causes the gun to be lodged free from the upper arm and causes the shooter to slam himself in the collarbone because he put so much pressure in keeping the stock in place. Basically, the cuck is such a cuck that he wounded himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "The_Donald", "name": "t1_dg7e008", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492108739.0, "created_utc": 1492079939.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2151}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654n3x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654n3x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654n3x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654n3x", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7sedc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 26, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Felidae_Silverwing", "parent_id": "t1_dg7m6f3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/The_Donald", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Cucks can't handle testosterone ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cucks can&amp;#39;t handle testosterone &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "The_Donald", "name": "t1_dg7sedc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492129284.0, "created_utc": 1492100484.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7m6f3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 42, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AndrewRyan13", "parent_id": "t1_dg7jked", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/The_Donald", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He was exposed to too much, too quickly.
