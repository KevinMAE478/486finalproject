She strong armed her way into that, and remember Obama is on paper saying that Libya was his biggest regret whereas Hillary is on tape bragging about her role in that. Not radical to say that letting her strong arm her way into Sec of State is his true biggest regret in hindsight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They bought off DNC chair Tim Kaine by promising him the VP role in 16 if he stepped down. They replaced him with DWS whose sole responsibility was to ensure a Clinton presidency years before the 2016 election had even begun. Think about that; if a rigging infrastructure like this had been in place in 2008, the &amp;#39;magic&amp;#39; of Obama never would have happened, and as we saw they were able to crush the choice of the &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;/strong&gt; of the democrat party in Bernie Sanders. Clinton&amp;#39;s loss is one of the most deserved losses in U.S history, yet some people are so embarrassingly stupid that they think it has to do with things like racism and misogyny and whatever other bullshit her campaign of negative identity politics tried to sell. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "The_Donald", "name": "t1_dg969ec", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492207905.0, "created_utc": 1492179105.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 709}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65br4h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65br4h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65br4h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65br4h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65br4h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9b6or", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ericdimwit", "parent_id": "t1_dg99vcu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/The_Donald", "controversiality": 0, "body": "#roy cohn#", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;roy cohn&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "The_Donald", "name": "t1_dg9b6or", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492214029.0, "created_utc": 1492185229.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg99vcu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 75, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mr_Tony_Stark", "parent_id": "t1_dg95t38", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/The_Donald", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How can one man be so based?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can one man be so based?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "The_Donald", "name": "t1_dg99vcu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492212491.0, "created_utc": 1492183691.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 75}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg95t38", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 142, "report_reasons": null, "author": "important_message", "parent_id": "t1_dg95ecm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/The_Donald", "controversiality": 0, "body": "https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/411247268763676673?lang=en", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/411247268763676673?lang=en\"&gt;https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/411247268763676673?lang=en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "The_Donald", "name": "t1_dg95t38", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492207261.0, "created_utc": 1492178461.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 142}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_38unr", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65br4h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg98ahy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "drunkjake", "parent_id": "t1_dg95ecm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/The_Donald", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Got any more info on the how?
