In the end, the programs that actually matter are getting *more funds* while overall tax burden goes down.\n\nEdit: as an example, one of his biggest cuts is the massive CDGB. Here's what the House Financial Services Committee [said in 2013](http://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=348879) after an investigation:\n\n&gt;CDBG funds often end up being used for parks, pools, street signs, and community centers, diverting dollars from those communities with the greatest need, particularly housing\n\nGee, I wonder if some people are just upset they won't be getting government subsidized pools and don't actually care about helping the poor.\n\nNotice how they always hide their worst acts behind the shield of \"protecting the poor\" or \"protecting the minorities.\" Just like any criticism about Obamacare being a massive payday for insurance companies is met with \"BUT YOU HATE POOR PEOPLE!\"\n\n[Here](https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/hud/community-development) are some of the projects the HUD(The H is supposed to stand for Housing, you know) CDGB is being used for while we have cities full of homeless:\n\n* $588,000 for a marina in Alexandria, Lousiana\n* $245,000 for the expansion of an art museum in Allentown, Pennsylvania\n* $147,000 for a canopy walk at the Atlanta Botanical Gardens in Georgia\n* $196,000 for expanding the Calvin Coolidge State historic site in Vermont\n* $294,000 for a community recreational facility in New Haven, Connecticut\n* $196,000 for the construction of an auditorium in Casper, Wyoming\n* $441,000 to replace a county exposition center in Umatilla, Oregon\n* $98,000 for the Pearl Fincher Museum of Fine Arts in Spring, Texas\n* $245,000 for renovations to awnings at a historical market in Roanoke, Virginia\n* $294,000 for the development of an educational program at the Houston Zoo in Texas\n\nSo\u2026 Who are these programs actually helping?\n\n[Just take a guess.](http://i.magaimg.net/img/d6w.png)\n\nedit2: And for the record, I am decidedly *not* a conservative and like programs that directly help the needy. I believe programs like Welfare to Work are great when implemented properly. At the same time, this isn't monopoly money, people actually worked for it. We're taking *real*(be quiet, libertarians) money from people who can barely afford to pay taxes(middle class) and then misusing it by not even helping the people who need help.
