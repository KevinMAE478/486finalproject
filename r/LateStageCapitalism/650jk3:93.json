The alternative to the proletariat is the bourgeoisie, which refers to anyone who does not have to work to survive. People who either do not work, because \"their money works for them\", people who rarely or barely work. In the extended sense it includes anyone who owns means of production but still must work to survive (petite bourgeoisie).\n\nCapitalism and socialism are a dichotomy in our post-industrial-revolution world.

Like other forms of democracy, it could be manifest in various ways - it could involve everyone voting on every little detail, but more than likely it would involve everyone voting only on major decisions, and minor decisions being made by people either elected into office or hired by those elected. Consider modern parliamentary governments, but without all the corruption (because no one can offer them much without having amassed capital).\n\nCapitalism is the opposite of that, when ownership is owned by a small or singular authority. State capitalism is when that authority is the state, and other forms involve oligarchical control. But in any case, the workers do not have control, beyond perhaps ability to argue over their employment, and the pipe-dream of being able to invest in the company enough to have a say.\n\nSo a basic test of whether a country is capitalist or socialist is simply whether or not the employees have control of the industry. In the case of China, not even remotely.\n\nState Capitalism is often thought of as communism, because of its history in the USSR. The USSR was a Communist State, meaning they were a state that supported and wished to eventually achieve Communism. However, they were simply working towards that goal but never achieved it. They enacted a policy of state capitalism, meaning the state owned and controlled the the means of production, and workers must sell their labor to it without any control over it.\n\nCommunism is considered the inevitable end-result of any society that manages to achieve socialism. It is a society where social class has been eliminated, in which the state is no longer necessary and has been reduced into a non-state entity (a democratic government without threat of force) or eliminated completely, and lastly, the concept of money is considered antiquated and no longer used.\n\nIt's not hard to see how the USSR had not achieved any of that.

However, for at least the majority of its history the Communist party still existed and wished to achieve communism.\n\nTo make it clear why they couldn't just \"become communist\", you would have to read up on what Marx believed the progression into it would be like. But in very simple terms, the progression most socialists believe in is as such:\n\n1. An industrial revolution will happen. Because of the concept of a persons owning their own personal property, naturally the means of production will be considered the property of whoever builds or buys it. Thus, they will hire people to operate their machinery, and so on. This is capitalism, leaving feudalism.\n\n2. As industry and automation continue to improve, eventually we will be left with fewer and fewer jobs, which due to the structure of our society will mean millions starving and homeless. Thus, social welfare will be established to maintain society.\n\n3. Over time the safteynet will have to grow to accommodate more job losses, which will mean an increase in taxation. Eventually a significant population of people will be without employment and have to be paid for almost entirely by the government, or will suffer.\n\n4. As that number increases, we will reach a breaking point, where one of two things will happen:  \n 1. What socialists believe and certainly hope for is either a government led reform (unlikely) or a revolution, where we seize the means of production and control to benefit all. This is socialism, leaving capitalism.\n 2. The billions of poor people in the world will die, leaving the rich the only ones in control.

Thus, they will hire people to operate their machinery, and so on. This is capitalism, leaving feudalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As industry and automation continue to improve, eventually we will be left with fewer and fewer jobs, which due to the structure of our society will mean millions starving and homeless. Thus, social welfare will be established to maintain society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time the safteynet will have to grow to accommodate more job losses, which will mean an increase in taxation. Eventually a significant population of people will be without employment and have to be paid for almost entirely by the government, or will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As that number increases, we will reach a breaking point, where one of two things will happen:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What socialists believe and certainly hope for is either a government led reform (unlikely) or a revolution, where we seize the means of production and control to benefit all. This is socialism, leaving capitalism.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The billions of poor people in the world will die, leaving the rich the only ones in control. This will almost certainly be socialism, as the rich would have to let their own family suffer to maintain capitalism.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "name": "t1_dg7gl6n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492114624.0, "created_utc": 1492085824.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg76uzk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "derpDDS", "parent_id": "t1_dg75wy6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LateStageCapitalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I mean, I was asking you specifically.
