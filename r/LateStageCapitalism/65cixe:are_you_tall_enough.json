This resulted in the death of many and a prolonged war in the pacific. This war ended several years after the war in Europe which the Nazi's were responsible for. The Japanese had been acting as assholes for a long time before that, being imperialistic swines(understatement, look up \"Unit 731\" for further reading) and all that. The Atomic bombing of Hiroshima happened on August 6 1945(This is all agreed upon fact) and prompted the Japanese to surrender, without the bombs being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the war would have raged on until the US invaded the Japanese home islands which would've resulted in an even larger amount of deaths. But is this true?\n\nQuite a few sources, among them Admiral \ufeffWilliam Leahy, Truman's Cheif of staff, claimed that the Japanese were prepared to surrender before the bombs were dropped, and would such a surrender have been considered, 150.000 to 350.000 lives would've been saved(unsure if this count includes the decades of suffering due to fallout).\n\nBut the argument is that the showcase of the new weapon saved even more lives in that it prevented war with the Soviet union by promoting an unstable peace in Europe due to the threat of the bomb on the Soviet union, until they themselves developed the bomb which in turn prompted M.A.D(Mutual Assured Destruction) which saved a whole bunch of more lives by preventing nuclear war. \n\nBut your argument would then be; We are largely rational people, the display of the weapon on a test site, such as the Trinity test, would suffice to create the same result, regarding Soviet aggression in Europe, making the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki completely unnecessary. And even more, if the US were largely socialistic, war with the Soviet Union would be unimaginable since both Superpowers would've been acting towards a common goal: the end of poverty and human suffering through insufficient social security.\n\nDid I understand you correctly?

This resulted in the death of many and a prolonged war in the pacific. This war ended several years after the war in Europe which the Nazi&amp;#39;s were responsible for. The Japanese had been acting as assholes for a long time before that, being imperialistic swines(understatement, look up &amp;quot;Unit 731&amp;quot; for further reading) and all that. The Atomic bombing of Hiroshima happened on August 6 1945(This is all agreed upon fact) and prompted the Japanese to surrender, without the bombs being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the war would have raged on until the US invaded the Japanese home islands which would&amp;#39;ve resulted in an even larger amount of deaths. But is this true?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quite a few sources, among them Admiral \ufeffWilliam Leahy, Truman&amp;#39;s Cheif of staff, claimed that the Japanese were prepared to surrender before the bombs were dropped, and would such a surrender have been considered, 150.000 to 350.000 lives would&amp;#39;ve been saved(unsure if this count includes the decades of suffering due to fallout).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the argument is that the showcase of the new weapon saved even more lives in that it prevented war with the Soviet union by promoting an unstable peace in Europe due to the threat of the bomb on the Soviet union, until they themselves developed the bomb which in turn prompted M.A.D(Mutual Assured Destruction) which saved a whole bunch of more lives by preventing nuclear war. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But your argument would then be; We are largely rational people, the display of the weapon on a test site, such as the Trinity test, would suffice to create the same result, regarding Soviet aggression in Europe, making the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki completely unnecessary. And even more, if the US were largely socialistic, war with the Soviet Union would be unimaginable since both Superpowers would&amp;#39;ve been acting towards a common goal: the end of poverty and human suffering through insufficient social security.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I understand you correctly? If so, I wholeheartedly agree. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "name": "t1_dg9yndc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492242648.0, "created_utc": 1492213848.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_39qgx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cixe", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_39qgx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cixe", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_39qgx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cixe", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9tl71", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeepStateNine", "parent_id": "t1_dg9hvjy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LateStageCapitalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks, comrade. :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, comrade. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "name": "t1_dg9tl71", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492235917.0, "created_utc": 1492207117.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9hvjy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Faar2much", "parent_id": "t1_dg9htvp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LateStageCapitalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "done", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;done&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "name": "t1_dg9hvjy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492221624.0, "created_utc": 1492192824.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9htvp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg9htvi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LateStageCapitalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "name": "t1_dg9htvp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492221570.0, "created_utc": 1492192770.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9htvi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Faar2much", "parent_id": "t3_65cixe", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LateStageCapitalism", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Slightly off topic, but people always bring up the argument that if hiroshima weren't bombed, there would be more loss of life resulting from future wars. \n\nWhich is an odd argument, because if we were rational in the first place, we would not be in a scenario where we would have to choose between two horrendous possibilities.
