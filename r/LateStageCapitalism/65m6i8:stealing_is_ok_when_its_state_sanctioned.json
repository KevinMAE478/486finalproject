There are plenty of functional opiate users, and strictly physiologically speaking heroin is probably one of the safest drugs we know about. Literally the only adverse effect from opiates is constipation (well... and addiction). On top of that, you can overdose on alcohol, and you can overdose on heroin, but only one of them can you take a nasal spray and completely reverse the overdose (Narcan). The fact of the matter is that every heroin addict that dies of an overdose is killed by the state and not the drug.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "name": "t1_dgc31sf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492381842.0, "created_utc": 1492353042.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_39qgx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m6i8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbzv7i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Delduath", "parent_id": "t1_dgby5l8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LateStageCapitalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Pure heroin is very different from street heroin.
