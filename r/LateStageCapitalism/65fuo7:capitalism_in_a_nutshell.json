The vast majority of workers are in no position to receive much of a wage-increase at all, regardless of the work they put in.

The vast, vast majority of people aren't lazy. Our hardest workers are people working two or three jobs and raising their family, yet still needing public assistance. This idea that people on public assistance are lazy is completely unfounded.\n\nBut these people don't work hard because of some false notion that they can make themselves rich.
