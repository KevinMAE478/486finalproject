It&amp;#39;s not a secret cabal. It&amp;#39;s simply a necessity for the maintenance of hierarchy. In capitalism especially, it is fundamentally necessary to continually expand. This is due to the tendency of the rate of profit to decline, necessitating action in order to maintain profit, whether that action is an attack on working conditions; expansion into a foreign sphere (see: colonialism, empire); or war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Capitalism was a gradual formation, which came together over many hundreds of years starting in around the mid 15th century (though in truth the roots can be seen as far back as the 9th). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet emerging hierarchy can be seen as far back as the Late Neolithic period, where we start to see evidence for the positive &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; of resources. In these situations, the creation and then disposal of perfectly serviceable goods can be seen just as Orwell describes in the above quote.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "name": "t1_dg5r6o9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492026388.0, "created_utc": 1491997588.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_39qgx", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tksc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5qqia", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "eaterofclouds", "parent_id": "t1_dg5kbx1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LateStageCapitalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And voil\u00e0, mass poverty was justified by 200 lines of Python code!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And voil\u00e0, mass poverty was justified by 200 lines of Python code!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "name": "t1_dg5qqia", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492025403.0, "created_utc": 1491996603.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5kbx1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg5cl9e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LateStageCapitalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LateStageCapitalism", "name": "t1_dg5kbx1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492007032.0, "created_utc": 1491978232.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5cl9e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 34, "report_reasons": null, "author": "effervescentstardust", "parent_id": "t1_dg51bf4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LateStageCapitalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world.
