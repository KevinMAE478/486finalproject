War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. &lt;strong&gt;Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War, it will be seen, not only accomplishes the necessary destruction, but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way.&lt;/strong&gt; In principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. But this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;George Orwell, &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=\"http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2016/Costs%20of%20War%20through%202016%20FINAL%20final%20v2.pdf\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; paper, we&amp;#39;ve spent nearly $5T on the war in Afghanistan, with basically nothing to show for it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That bomb the U.S dropped in Afghanistan today?  $16M alone.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there are the Tomahawk missiles fired earlier which cost about $60-70M in a single night.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet somehow we don&amp;#39;t have enough money for universal health care.
