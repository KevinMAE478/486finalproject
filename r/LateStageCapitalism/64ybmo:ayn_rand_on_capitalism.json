I don't blame anyone for not reading Atlas Shrugged; it's over 1,400 pages, that's a commitment. Within the first two pages, however, Rand describes a bus expertly steering around city streets and for some reason this is comforting to one of the main characters. This passage seems random at first but this is the first allusion to one of the lynchpin themes of her novel: hardwork is the only value that is self-evident. Anyone can say they're honest or caring but only hardwork can be demonstrated. I don't mean 'hardwork' in the way Republicans use the term as a dog whistle to describe whatever fashion of 'white' they mean at that moment. Rand praised hardwork regardless of the industry. She paralleled industrial excellence with a sandwich maker's expert care in crafting a worthy meal using similarly lofty rhetoric in describing the two. She did not care what you do, just that you do it well.\n\nFurthermore, Rand did not object to altruism. This point could not be further misunderstood from the numerous comments I've read and discussions I've been a part of regarding Atlas Shrugged. In Galt's Speech, she states that altruism must come from the heart and without expectation from the giver or reciever. The giver should not expect gratitude or indebtedness from the reciever. In turn, a beggar, for example, should not expect a rich person to help them simply because they're rich. Taxation is necessary, Rand admitted, but she did not believe people should be forced into being altruistic. This is why people like Paul Ryan flock to Ayn Rand; they fallaciously conflate taxation with altruism. \n\nRand adheres to the orginal tenets of capitalist thought; among many that you know, she also wrote of the little-discussed tenet that was supposed to be the cornerstone of capitalism - fair pay. Even Adam Smith knew that his economic treatise was flawed if people did not employ morality and ethics to their business dealings. Empathy was supposed to be a feature of capitalism, not an afterthought... If you've read this far, congrats, this is where I say Rand was silly.\n\nFor me, this is where Rand's ideas on economic theory fall apart. She was too much of an idealist. She believed that capitalisn could work if it depended upon people's inherent good nature. She saw crony capitalism as being traditional capitalism's undoing and the catalyst for its eventual descent through socialism and into communism. \n\nThat's all I have to say about the main themes of Atlas Shrugged; this section is on Rand's writing itself. There is no question that Rand is not the best writer out there; her characters can be one dimensional, the dialogue can often be stilted and jarring, monologues seem to arise without prompt and can become exceedingly lengthy despite beginning as a dialogue. However, I still view Atlas Shrugged as a masterpiece even though I disagree with the overarching theme and can't help but notice its numerous flaws. I think art becomes a masterpiece because of the summation of its parts; not in spite of its flaws but because of them as well. The Illiad has some books that are boring and distract from Achilles; The Godfather (film) has some weird transitions and Sonny is one dimensional; Jimi Hendrix never played a flawless song and would often riff if he felt like it. \n\nAt risk of sounding like a capitalist lap dog, I recommend Atlas Shrugged. If you keep an open mind, have the time, and are willing to dissect it for the myriad of themes included within; I think you can derive value from its many messages. For instance Rand would agree, wholeheartedly, that religion is the opiate of the masses. Any person (especially a Republican) who praises Ayn Rand and holds religion in high esteem is a hypocrite or a liar. \n\n/sermon\n\nEdit: Slur and unfair assessment on Paul Ryan", "edited": 1492202967.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look... a lot of the hate Ayn Rand gets on this sub (and elsewhere) comes from misguided or misunderstood summations of her novels&amp;#39; ideas and themes.
