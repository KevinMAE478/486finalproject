In fact, the more people rush to them the more wages will fall - especially wherever there's low union density.\n\nAs someone who has a trade, I am pretty fed up with people  riding their high horse about how sensible it is to go into trades instead of something at university.  The fact of the matter is that it's just about impossible at present to wisely invest your time and money as regards earnings 2, 4, or 10 years down the road.

You act like blue collar jobs are higher somehow than any other type of job.  They&amp;#39;re not exempt from what liberals like to call the law of supply and demand. They guarantee higher wages only contingently. In fact, the more people rush to them the more wages will fall - especially wherever there&amp;#39;s low union density.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As someone who has a trade, I am pretty fed up with people  riding their high horse about how sensible it is to go into trades instead of something at university.  The fact of the matter is that it&amp;#39;s just about impossible at present to wisely invest your time and money as regards earnings 2, 4, or 10 years down the road.  Remember when law school was considered a lock for future employment and earnings? How many MBAs are broke and working shit jobs now? It seems like they&amp;#39;ve had the smug wiped right out of them, by and large. It can happen to tradespeople. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, if you look at Alberta, Canada in the last few years, it already has happened. Look at &lt;a href=\"http://www.calgarysun.com/2016/12/02/calgarys-unemployment-rate-has-inched-higher-103-are-now-jobless\"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from just four months ago, for example.  In November 2016, Alberta&amp;#39;s economy swapped out 20, 600 jobs in construction and manufacturing for 31 200 service-sector jobs mainly in &amp;quot;finance, insurance and real estate, as well as information, culture, and recreation&amp;quot;. I bet at least a few tradespeople who used to be all smug about their job security and earnings are laughing on the other side of their faces right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re telling me there&amp;#39;s none of this in the States?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re not making a bundle based on your personal virtue alone, so there&amp;#39;s no need to get so shirty, comrade. Most people put in an honest day&amp;#39;s work every single day, which is more than capital deserves.
