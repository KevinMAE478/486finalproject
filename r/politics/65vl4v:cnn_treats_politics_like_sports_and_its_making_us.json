It's honestly infuriating to hear them talk a lot of the times. I mean, they won't even concede that just MAYBE its not cool for the Donald to spend millions every weekend flying to his own resort or for the taxpayers to be at minimum paying for 3 residences just for Donald/Melania. The won't concede that just MAYBE the Russian connections through his entire team are just \"slightly odd\". You know, MAYBE its a bad idea for the Donald to give his daughter and son in law jobs at the white house.

Only a few have been willing to even present neutral language towards the presidents behavior and even fewer to actually be critical of him. Nunes is a good example. He was willing to ruin his entire career for basically zero benefit (at least on the surface) just to somehow try to be on team Donald. Despite being on a committee investigating the president he was still unable to even present neutral language on the topic and just supported Donald blindly.

Tons of innocent people have been killed and its not even mentioned. \n\nAnd to hear them basically hyping a war with NK is fucking sickening. Clearly, imo, they should be saying \"If Donald Trump and Co think they can go to war with NK and not come out the other side looking like the worst warmongering idiots in the entire history of the universe they are sadly mistaken.\" Seriously, it would be a huge fucking mistake to think you can flex on NK or even attack them and its gonna work out good.
