If religion uplifts you, then practice all the religion you want. From what you wrote, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem as though you are holding your beliefs for other people to follow, or shoving your guidelines in the faces of those who are not seemingly living the way you do. That means you are being respectful of other human beings around you, and that ultimately makes the world a better place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I myself am not religious in the slightest. I haven&amp;#39;t followed a religion since I was very young. That being said, I find religion to be a beautiful thing. I love learning about it, and I like attending worship services in whichever area I&amp;#39;m in. Heck, I just got back from an Easter Sunday worship with my mom that I asked to go to! Being religious is never the issue. It just boils down to respect. It looks like you have that down fine. If anyone here tries to &amp;quot;lynch&amp;quot; you, as you said, then they are just practicing the extremism that they themselves probably hate. :) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, on mobile, so I&amp;#39;m so sorry if this is a wall of text!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_dgc4uyv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492384567.0, "created_utc": 1492355767.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 124}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ogwp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ogwp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc5yvk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 56, "report_reasons": null, "author": "debacol", "parent_id": "t1_dgc4sy2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And to pay your damn taxes...
