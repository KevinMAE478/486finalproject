Does anybody *really* believes him when he says he's a workaholic? I remind you that he spent years criticizing Obama for playing golf on the job, and now has been playing golf multiple times a week himself. [This is a guy who said if he won the presidency, he'd never see his golf courses again\u2013he'd never want to leave the White House, just stay there and 'work his ass off.'](https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1517029861661832/) Yet he didn't even stay there through his inaugural weekend in Washington, and he seems to leave for Maralago every opportunity that he has. \n\n\nI believe that Trump *never* wanted to be the President. I believe that Trump wanted to WIN an election, and you can tell just listening to him, how very proud he is that he won (and he gets very sore when reminded that he lost the popular vote by millions). \n\n\nTrump is driven by his ego. He's also made devastatingly awful deals that tanked businesses and shuttered massive projects. In short, he didn't have as much money as he liked to boast about, and his ego is too inflated to admit that in any kind of a public setting. \n\n\nFor somebody like the Mercers (and also Russian power), Trump is unbelievably easy to manipulate. You stroke the ego, dangle the carrot, and make your ideas sound like his ideas. He doesn't really have ideas or ideology - that's why he keeps flipping on his major campaign points (NATO being relevant, China manipulating the dollar, attacking Assad, moving on from health care, abandoning tax reform, etc etc etc). So if you can make your idea feel like something that came from his own head, and just keep stroking his ego, you can get very far. This is especially true if you actually have the kind of money Trump likes to boast about, because deep down Trump thinks he can 'fake it until you make it' and talk big on his money and business/political prowess until something turns around for him. If he actually had the kind of money he boasted about and hadn't squandered it through pipe-dreams and other failed projects, he could prove it by releasing his taxes, which we know he is not willing to do.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t take a lot of convincing for me to believe that Trump is really just a dunce in all of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Listen to the man. Does anybody &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; believes him when he says he&amp;#39;s a workaholic? I remind you that he spent years criticizing Obama for playing golf on the job, and now has been playing golf multiple times a week himself. &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1517029861661832/\"&gt;This is a guy who said if he won the presidency, he&amp;#39;d never see his golf courses again\u2013he&amp;#39;d never want to leave the White House, just stay there and &amp;#39;work his ass off.&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; Yet he didn&amp;#39;t even stay there through his inaugural weekend in Washington, and he seems to leave for Maralago every opportunity that he has. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that Trump &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; wanted to be the President. I believe that Trump wanted to WIN an election, and you can tell just listening to him, how very proud he is that he won (and he gets very sore when reminded that he lost the popular vote by millions). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trump is driven by his ego. He&amp;#39;s also made devastatingly awful deals that tanked businesses and shuttered massive projects. In short, he didn&amp;#39;t have as much money as he liked to boast about, and his ego is too inflated to admit that in any kind of a public setting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For somebody like the Mercers (and also Russian power), Trump is unbelievably easy to manipulate. You stroke the ego, dangle the carrot, and make your ideas sound like his ideas. He doesn&amp;#39;t really have ideas or ideology - that&amp;#39;s why he keeps flipping on his major campaign points (NATO being relevant, China manipulating the dollar, attacking Assad, moving on from health care, abandoning tax reform, etc etc etc). So if you can make your idea feel like something that came from his own head, and just keep stroking his ego, you can get very far. This is especially true if you actually have the kind of money Trump likes to boast about, because deep down Trump thinks he can &amp;#39;fake it until you make it&amp;#39; and talk big on his money and business/political prowess until something turns around for him. If he actually had the kind of money he boasted about and hadn&amp;#39;t squandered it through pipe-dreams and other failed projects, he could prove it by releasing his taxes, which we know he is not willing to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_dg7jms6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492119291.0, "created_utc": 1492090491.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg741np", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kdeff", "parent_id": "t1_dg70icc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So, it could be that they're in bed with the Russians, and Trump really is a dunce?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it could be that they&amp;#39;re in bed with the Russians, and Trump really is a dunce?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_dg741np", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492084811.0, "created_utc": 1492056011.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651g9r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7bdx8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pm_me_bellies_789", "parent_id": "t1_dg70icc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Mercer's have also been tied with the Leave campaign in Brexit. \n\nThese people need to be fucking stopped before they effectively destroy western institutions.
