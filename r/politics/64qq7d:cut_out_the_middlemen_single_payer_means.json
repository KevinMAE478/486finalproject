Medicare covers this $84,000 drug but there is &lt;a href=\"http://kff.org/report-section/it-pays-to-shop-variation-in-out-of-pocket-costs-for-medicare-part-d-enrollees-in-2016-findings/\"&gt;high out of pocket cost&lt;/a&gt;.  That&amp;#39;s the type of thing current US single payer plans are to absorb.

But with supplemental insurance, suddenly the federal government can say &amp;quot;we won&amp;#39;t cover hep C drugs&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;we won&amp;#39;t cover prenatal care&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;we won&amp;#39;t cover mental illness unless it involves the potential to harm another human being.&amp;quot;  Those are things we&amp;#39;re trying to avoid.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong.

(joe can&amp;#39;t afford his pills so he cuts them in half or doesn&amp;#39;t take them, joe gets real sick and ends up in the hospital costing far more money)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Universal healthcare in a country as large (population wise) as the USA is not quite as easy as a smaller country.

In fact, it will go a long way to causing more problems if its not coupled with reigning in some of the insanity on the billing side of things.  Big Pharma charging outrageous prices for drugs, hospitals charging outrageous fees for tests, device manufacturers charging an arm and a leg for diagnostic machines of limited benefit, etc.  All of these things will keep costs crazy and getting worse, and would very quickly bankrupt even the most well designed single payer system or lead to rationing of services that would make it wildly unpopular.  That's the rock... the hard place?  Say we do do the right thing and regulate all of that stuff as well... That will start to cut into a rather large number of well paying jobs.  Those jobs would go away... forever... What happens when a large number of well paying jobs disappear?  Recession.  We would eventually recover and be better for it, but the interim time will hurt.  It would likely sink a few political careers as well.\n\nI know this all seems obvious and straight forward, but when you think about it... We had to fight a fucking WAR to finally settle the issue that it might not be the best economic policy for certain groups of people to be allowed to own another group of people.

Got all that?... Good...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, the tough part:  It WILL NOT be a silver bullet that will magically fix every thing wrong with the US healthcare system.  In fact, it will go a long way to causing more problems if its not coupled with reigning in some of the insanity on the billing side of things.  Big Pharma charging outrageous prices for drugs, hospitals charging outrageous fees for tests, device manufacturers charging an arm and a leg for diagnostic machines of limited benefit, etc.  All of these things will keep costs crazy and getting worse, and would very quickly bankrupt even the most well designed single payer system or lead to rationing of services that would make it wildly unpopular.  That&amp;#39;s the rock... the hard place?  Say we do do the right thing and regulate all of that stuff as well... That will start to cut into a rather large number of well paying jobs.  Those jobs would go away... forever... What happens when a large number of well paying jobs disappear?  Recession.  We would eventually recover and be better for it, but the interim time will hurt.  It would likely sink a few political careers as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this all seems obvious and straight forward, but when you think about it...
