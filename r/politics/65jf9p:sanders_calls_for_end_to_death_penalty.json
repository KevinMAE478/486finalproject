Once you have someone in custody, there&amp;#39;s no self defense argument that works anymore unless you intend to release them at some point, and even then, self defense typically hinges on what someone &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; doing, not what they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; do in the future.  Futurecrime still isn&amp;#39;t a thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only three arguments that are intellectually honest are &amp;#39;retribution&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;deterrence&amp;#39;, and &amp;#39;housing cost savings&amp;#39;.  Deterrence and cost savings are both proven to be false, since executions cost much more to be carried out that simple incarceration for most cases and studies have repeatedly shown that capital punishment serves no deterrent effects that can be statistically measured, so the only remaining reason that could be considered valid is retribution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of retribution, the justification for capital punishment is purely emotional, and considering the instances of innocent people being exonerated after execution, that seems like a poor justification given the proven fallibility of our justice system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_dgayq3b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492308831.0, "created_utc": 1492280031.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgatvt6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 21, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kwhitegocubs", "parent_id": "t1_dgatc4r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What are you talking about?
