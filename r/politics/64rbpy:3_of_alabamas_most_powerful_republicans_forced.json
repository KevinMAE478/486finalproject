If these same areas are seen as being well run and great places to live, it challenges the same notion. Moreover, concepts like poverty, poor health, lack of education, and a general fraying of the societal tapestry aren&amp;#39;t seen as problems to be solved, they&amp;#39;re seen as &amp;quot;just the way it is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is that if you&amp;#39;re born poor in inner-city Chicago and born poor in rural Alabama, your life outcomes are statistically likely to be similar. The difference is that your opportunities to escape poverty in Chicago are significantly greater than they are in Alabama, due to social programs, economic opportunity, and a more tolerant and diverse culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, to answer your question: we don&amp;#39;t want the country to resemble Alabama, but people in Alabama don&amp;#39;t want the country to resemble Chicago either.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_dg4pw6g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491965452.0, "created_utc": 1491936652.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 51}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rbpy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg51aum", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RandomMandarin", "parent_id": "t1_dg4goi3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Don't forget, they railroaded Don Siegelman, the former Dem governor of Alabama over bullshit bribery charges (real reason: he was the first major politician to make an enemy of Karl Rove after W. was in the White House, and because they stole the election from him and wanted to make sure he did not mount a comeback).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Siegelman)\n\nAaaaaand fuck President Obama for not pardoning him.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Siegelman\"&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget, they railroaded Don Siegelman, the former Dem governor of Alabama over bullshit bribery charges (real reason: he was the first major politician to make an enemy of Karl Rove after W. was in the White House, and because they stole the election from him and wanted to make sure he did not mount a comeback).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aaaaaand fuck President Obama for not pardoning him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_dg51aum", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491978495.0, "created_utc": 1491949695.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rbpy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg52t2g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "homeostasis3434", "parent_id": "t1_dg4goi3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I grew up in Massachusetts, most of the men in my family/ their friends are pretty staunch republicans.  \n\nLast time I was home I was hammered and we started talking about politics.

A few big ones including the Athenian&amp;#39;s system not being mandatory but volunteer, the population being much smaller thus this system being more practical, many incompetent people were made ineligible to volunteer for the lottery, and most importantly IMO, powerful governments in modern day can literally destroy the entire world or help lead to WW3 very easily if run by particularly incompetent leaders. Donald Trump is at least competent enough to not send a bunch of nukes at the Middle East on the first day on the job but god help us if a bunch of his supporters with low IQs were randomly selected to run our government. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worst you could do back in the day was bring down your own country, now a couple poor decisions can end human existence.
