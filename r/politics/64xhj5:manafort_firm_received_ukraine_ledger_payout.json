A nuclear arsenal rivaled only in raw number by Russia, and a massive intelligence and satellite network. Military bases and installations around the globe. Worldwide hegemonic power projection, ~3.5% of GDP.\n\nRussia's defense spending is now over 5% and growing, and they are engaging in various modernization efforts. They have a massive military and nuclear force compared to just about every other nation aside from the US, but the bulk of it is rusted remnants from the Soviet Union. They have one small aircraft carrier so their navy is comprised of smaller corvettes and subs, they have essentially no allies, and a much smaller population from which to draw manpower on top of an ongoing demographic crisis on the long term. \n\nWorst of all, their economy is in shambles. This is because of two major factors, oil price and sanctions.
