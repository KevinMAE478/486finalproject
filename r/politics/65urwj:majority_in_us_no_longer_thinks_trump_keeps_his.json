The other thing is even if we do realize we\u2019ve been scammed, we often don\u2019t want to let other people know, because we\u2019re embarrassed. One of the con artists that I follow in the book, the mass impostor Ferdinand Demara, was able to operate over and over because nobody reported him. One of his most daring escapades was fooling the Canadian Navy during the Korean War by posing as a surgeon, and the Navy never pressed charges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some red flags that you might be entering a situation where someone is trying to con you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more we want something to be true, the more skeptical we have to be. Let me give you an example. The psychic scam is one of the most common scams out there, and psychics will actually comb through the obituaries for victims, because if you\u2019ve just lost someone you\u2019re much more likely to believe that I can communicate with the dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_dgdk8vy", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469055.0, "created_utc": 1492440255.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgddxv0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 255, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheMovingFinger", "parent_id": "t1_dgdclag", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; endears near-unanimous trust and authority\n\nWhen people have been comprehensively hosed and conned, it\u2019s very hard and painful for them to then realize that they\u2019ve been hosed and conned, so their belief deepens rather than waning.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;endears near-unanimous trust and authority&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When people have been comprehensively hosed and conned, it\u2019s very hard and painful for them to then realize that they\u2019ve been hosed and conned, so their belief deepens rather than waning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_dgddxv0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492458479.0, "created_utc": 1492429679.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 255}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65urwj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65urwj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65urwj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdeeae", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 34, "report_reasons": null, "author": "octopornopus", "parent_id": "t1_dgddyks", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You know, I admit laughing along when he was on local public access TV, ranting about how the DMV was stealing your fingerprints for nefarious reasons.
