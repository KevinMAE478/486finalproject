The book can be downloaded for free [here](http://theauthoritarians.org/options-for-getting-the-book), and I suggest everyone read it to make some sense of what's going on.\n\nAdditionally,  back in July of last year Altemeyer wrote a post on his blog titled [Donald Trump and Authoritarian Followers](http://theauthoritarians.org/donald-trump-and-authoritarian-followers/) which is an interesting read as well. Here's a few excerpts:\n\n&gt;Wanna-be tyrants in a democracy are just comical figures on soapboxes when they have no following. So the real\u2026threat lay coiled in parts of the population itself, it was thought, ready someday to catapult the next Hitler to power with their votes.\n\n&gt;That apprehension was well-founded, it turns out. **Research indicates that a bed rock 20-25% of the adults in North America is highly vulnerable to a demagogue who would incite hatred of various minorities to gain power.** These people are constantly waiting for a tough \u201claw and order,\u201d \u201cman on horseback\u201d who will supposedly solve all our problems through the ruthless application of force. When such a person gains prominence, you can expect the authoritarian followers to mate devotedly with the authoritarian leader, because each gives the other something they desperately want: the feeling of safety for the followers, and the tremendous power of the modern state for the leader.\n\n&gt;**I would not say that all of the people trying to surge Donald Trump into the White House are authoritarian followers. But they almost certainly compose his hard core base.** Where are the rest coming from? Various places, such as white males who fear their status in society is eroding and those who cannot abide a Hillary Clinton presidency. But authoritarianism rises in a population that feels threatened, and many Americans today are anxious about their family\u2019s economic future, not to mention the throbbing fear of terrorist attacks. Many of them are clutching at straws.\n\n&gt;**It\u2019s been noted that if 25% of the American population is always ready to vote for a dictator, that\u2019s half-way to a majority. If the \u201cright\u201d kind of crisis comes along, it could create enough newly panicked citizens to vote a tyrant into office who would overthrow the Constitution, the rule of law, you name it.**\n\nFurther:\n\n&gt;We know a lot about authoritarian followers, but **unfortunately most of what we know indicates it will be almost impossible to change their minds**, especially in a few months. Here are some things established by experiments. See if you recognize any of these behaviors in Trump supporters. Compared with most people:\n\n&gt;**They are highly ethnocentric, highly inclined to see the world as their in-group versus everyone else.** Because they are so committed to their in-group, they are very zealous in its cause. **They will trust their leaders no matter what they say, and distrust whomever the leader says to distrust.**\n\n&gt;**They are highly fearful of a dangerous world.** Their parents taught them, more than parents usually do, that the world is dangerous. They may also be genetically predisposed to experience stronger fear than people skilled at \u201ckeeping their heads while others are losing theirs.\u201d\n\n&gt;**They are highly self-righteous.** They believe they are the \u201cgood people\u201d and this unlocks a lot of hostile impulses against those they consider bad.\n\n&gt;**They are aggressive. Given the chance to attack someone with the approval of an authority, they will lower the boom.**\n\n&gt;**They are highly prejudiced against racial and ethnic minorities, non-heterosexuals, and women in general.**\n\n&gt;**They will support their authorities, and even help them, persecute almost any identifiable group in the country.**\n\n&gt;**Their beliefs are a mass of contradictions.** They have highly compartmentalized minds, in which opposite beliefs live independent lives in separate boxes. As a result, their thinking is full of double-standards.\n\n&gt;**They reason poorly.** If they like the conclusion of an argument, they don\u2019t pay much attention to whether the evidence is valid or the argument is consistent. **They especially have trouble realizing a conclusion is invalid.**\n\n&gt;**They are highly dogmatic.** Because they have mainly gotten their beliefs from the authorities in their lives, rather than think things out for themselves, they have no real defense when facts or events indicate they are wrong. So they just dig in their heels and refuse to change.\n\n&gt;**They are very dependent on social reinforcement of their beliefs. They think they are right because almost everyone they know and listen to tells them they are.** That happens because they screen out sources that will suggest that they are wrong.\n\n&gt;**Because they severely limit their exposure to different people and ideas, they vastly overestimate the extent to which other people agree with them. And thinking they are \u201cthe moral majority\u201d supports their attacks on the \u201cevil minorities\u201d they see in the country.**\n\n&gt;**They believe strongly in group cohesiveness, and being loyal. They are highly energized when surrounded by a crowd of fellow-believers because it makes them feel powerful and supports their belief that \u201call the good people\u201d agree with them.**\n\n&gt;**They are easily duped by manipulators who pretend to espouse their causes when all the con-artists really want is personal gain.**\n\n&gt;They are largely blind to themselves. They have little self-understanding and insight into why they think and do what they do.
