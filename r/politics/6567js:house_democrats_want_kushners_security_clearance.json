Hillary was never the source of any of the classified information; it was people stripping out information from headers and emailing them to her. Her problem was that the server existed outside of state.gov servers, but even if it was WITHIN state.gov, it still would have been the same problem since that network is not cleared for that type of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most likely a private who inadvertently caused some classified information to go to a non-classified network would get an NJP (administrative punishment, article 15), as long as they did not attempt to cover up what had happened or obstruct justice in any way. (This is where a lot of the military prosecutions have gone awry: Once the serviceman realizes what they did by accident, they try to destroy evidence and this gets them in more trouble than the initial problem, falling specifically under the obstruction laws).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is in line with what Comey said in his FBI press release: In general, this sort of matter would have been subject to administrative sanctions, not legal action.
