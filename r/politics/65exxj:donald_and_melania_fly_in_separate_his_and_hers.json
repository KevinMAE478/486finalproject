Historians almost all agree that he was an honest man and not personally corrupt in any way.  His &lt;em&gt;administration&lt;/em&gt; was very, very corrupt, certainly: but Grant himself wasn&amp;#39;t.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem was that he was both &lt;em&gt;trusting&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;loyal&lt;/em&gt;.  As a result, all kinds of crooks weaseled their way into his administration (there&amp;#39;s Grant going trusting people he shouldn&amp;#39;t have) and, when the press began to expose those weasels Grant would stand by his people (there&amp;#39;s the misplaced loyalty).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grant continued to trust the wrong people &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; he left office and got swindled out of all his money.  He spent the last months of his life writing his memoirs - knowing all the while that  he was dying of cancer - and hoping the book would be enough of a success to provide for his wife and daughter.  He died just 5 days after finishing his memoirs, which proved to be a both a critical and financial success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was a very interesting guy and his life had some tremendous ups and downs to it, but he was personally very honorable and no sort of crook or cheat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_dgai3fq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492278834.0, "created_utc": 1492250034.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 35}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga73wl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 23, "report_reasons": null, "author": "frankdotto", "parent_id": "t1_dg9q0fk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Presidents have benefitted from the presidency before- see Grant in the 1870s, but that doesn't make this any less terrible", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presidents have benefitted from the presidency before- see Grant in the 1870s, but that doesn&amp;#39;t make this any less terrible&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_dga73wl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492254362.0, "created_utc": 1492225562.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9q0fk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1436, "report_reasons": null, "author": "trump_peed_on_me", "parent_id": "t3_65exxj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "When Obama and Michelle took a vacation, they weren't pocketing tax payer money in the process.
