With almost half the votes counted, Thompson is still clinging to a 165 vote lead. And of the 328 precincts not yet reporting, 209 are in blue counties. I still expect Estes to win but this is very impressive. This could have been (still might be) a win for Democrats, the DNC will look foolish for not getting behind Thompson sooner.\n\nEdit 2: Estes* pulling ahead now, but all the new precincts reporting are from deep red areas. 286 precincts left to report and still 209 are from blue counties. Also compare results to the presidential election [here](http://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president/kansas/). Trump beat Clinton by 38 points in Cowley County, but with all precincts reporting Estes only beat Thompson by 13 points in Cowley.\n\nEdit 3: Estes is about 2400 votes ahead now, but there are still a lot of votes to come in from Sedgwick county. If Thompson holds his 12 point lead there and the votes coming in from the other red counties stay more or less consistent with the Presidential election results, Thompson still has an outside shot to win this.\n\nEdit 4: Well, a chunk of precincts just reported from Sedgwick and Thompson's lead dropped from 12 points to 8. The more precincts that report, the more it seems to drop. It was probably skewed by early voting and mail-in ballots in the Wichita area, which is a college town. Almost all of the red counties are finished reporting, but I don't see Thompson being able to make a comeback at this point. Also Sedgwick is the only blue county now after a few more precincts reported from Harvey and turned it red.\n\nEdit 5: All precincts are reporting now except for Sedgwick county and 9 other precincts from red counties. ~~If Thompson holds his 8 point lead~~ (he didn't) and ~~my math is right~~ (it wasn't), ~~he still has a snowball's chance in hell of winning~~ (he doesn't).\n\nEdit 6: Only Sedgwick County left to report now, but Thompson still trails by 6,000 and I think at best he could only make up 1500-2000 votes in Sedgwick County when it's all said and done.\n\nEdit 7: It's over. Looks like Estes will win by between ~~5 and 6 points~~ (just kidding it was 8, Sedgwick almost went red when the last precincts reported).
