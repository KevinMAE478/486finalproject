A decade ago, Duke Energy had more than 60 percent of its power generation in coal; today that number is closer to 30 percent. That is an enormous shift, considering that companies like this are huge, and thus have a significant impact on our nation's energy mix. Moreover, Duke and others are planning to continue this shift away from coal and toward gas and renewables.\n\nUltimately, it's hard to fight economics.  Natural gas really changed the direction of US energy.  Solar isn't far behind.  It seems obvious to emulate the direction the private sector is already pursuing. \n\nThe one point that's not made about coal vs natural gas is the sensitivity to location.
