Hell, evangelicals just voted for a thrice married adulterer who had a son out of wedlock, &amp;quot;small government&amp;quot; conservatives just voted for a man who wants to spend fifty billion dollars building a wall along our southern border, fiscal conservatives voted for a man whose tax policy (before he scrapped it earlier this week) was expected to add trillions of dollars to the debt and deficit.  Republicans are only voting for the (R) these days, in their eyes it&amp;#39;s a brand of pride, when really it should be a scarlet letter.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Since this comment is getting some attention, I figured I might throw in one possible explanation for why the Republican polling has changed by more than sixty points, while the Democratic polling has only changed by one.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://news.wgbh.org/2017/03/15/politics-government/major-new-study-shows-political-polarization-mainly-right-wing\"&gt;A Major New Study Shows That Political Polarization Is Mainly A Right-Wing Phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A major new study of social-media sharing patterns shows that political polarization is more common among conservatives than liberals \u2014 and that the exaggerations and falsehoods emanating from right-wing media outlets such as Breitbart News have infected mainstream discourse.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What they found was that Hillary Clinton supporters shared stories from across a relatively broad political spectrum, including center-right sources such as The Wall Street Journal, mainstream news organizations like the Times and the Post, and partisan liberal sites like The Huffington Post and The Daily Beast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Donald Trump supporters clustered around Breitbart \u2014 headed until recently by Stephen Bannon, the hard-right nationalist now ensconced in the White House \u2014 and a few like-minded websites such as The Daily Caller, Alex Jones&amp;#39; Infowars, and The Gateway Pundit. Even Fox News was dropped from the favored circle back when it was attacking Trump during the primaries, and only re-entered the fold once it had made its peace with the future president.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Republicans tend to share news from those sources that reinforce their existing worldviews, Democrats tend to share news from a wider variety of sources, which is to say that the Republican bubble &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t just a bubble, it&amp;#39;s a feedback loop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_dg9h5la", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492220786.0, "created_utc": 1492191986.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3749}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dqh8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dqh8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dqh8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dqh8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dqh8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dqh8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dqh8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9j55f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "philly47", "parent_id": "t1_dg9ixxw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, it was a process.
