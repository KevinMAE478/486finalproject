He&amp;#39;s shocked to find himself in the stronghold of a widespread &amp;quot;invisible&amp;quot; network, organized into cells much like Ivenwald, and populated by elite, politically ambitious fundamentalists; Sharlet is present when a leader tells a dozen men living there, &amp;quot;You guys are here to learn how to rule the world.&amp;quot; As it turns out, the Family was established in 1935 to oppose FDR&amp;#39;s New Deal and the spread of trade unions; since then, it has organized well-attended weekly prayer meetings for members of Congress and annual National Prayer Breakfasts attended by every president since Eisenhower. Further, the Family&amp;#39;s international reach (&amp;quot;almost impossible to overstate&amp;quot;) has &amp;quot;forged relationships between the U.S. government and some of the most oppressive regimes in the world.&amp;quot; In the years since his first encounter, Sharlet has done extensive research, and his thorough account of the Family&amp;#39;s life and times is a chilling expose. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NPR&amp;#39;s Terry Gross did an interview with Jeff Sharlet, author of &lt;em&gt;The Family&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=120746516\"&gt;The Secret Political Reach of &amp;#39;The Family&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://truth-out.org/archive/component/k2/item/93642-the-family--who-really-is-behind-this-secret-organization?Itemid=228article\"&gt;This article from Truthout&lt;/a&gt; goes into The Family&amp;#39;s (aka &amp;quot;The Fellowship&amp;quot;) activities, including their influence in Uganda:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most vivid is Sharlet&amp;#39;s focus on the Fellowship&amp;#39;s activities in Uganda, where, in 2009, a bill was introduced into the Ugandan Parliament that would condemn to death individuals convicted of &amp;quot;aggravated homosexuality,&amp;quot; which includes &amp;quot;simply sex, more than once,&amp;quot; and three years in prison &amp;quot;for failure to report a homosexual within twenty-four hours of learning of his or her crime.&amp;quot;\nSharlet draws links between the Family and evangelical church leaders and politicians championing the bill in Uganda (including David Bahati, who introduced the legislation into Parliament); the Family has donated millions of dollars to Uganda for &amp;quot;leadership development&amp;quot; - more, writes Sharlet, than it has invested in any other foreign country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "politics", "name": "t1_dg9i9fq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492222081.0, "created_utc": 1492193281.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9c4ri", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "johnhummel", "parent_id": "t1_dg970cj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Partly profit.\n\nAnd partly read the book \"The Family\", which is about the christian fundamentalists who believe that God gives power to people to use it.
