Ive done just that a couple hundred times at this point. Youve obviously never heard of metrics, especially given this next set of denial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s ok. Believe what you will. But answer me this. How many times have you complained when you were happy with a product? How many times have you bothered to comment when you were satisfied.? Gaurunteed it&amp;#39;s not often, if at all&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s simply the way things are. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its simply &lt;em&gt;100% irrelevant to what metrics say&lt;/em&gt;. Notice I didnt say anything about forum/reddit posts beyond &amp;quot;I know what I&amp;#39;ve read&amp;quot;? Thats because you look at metrics first, which is what I did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Metrics say people have stopped playing, and/or are quitting extremely quickly. &lt;strong&gt;After&lt;/strong&gt; seeing that, you read look at what people are saying. Bad metrics + bad comments = bad product. Plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And as far as data. I use it daily. Ive seen it fail daily almost as often as it&amp;#39;s right.  The reason?   Human beings aren&amp;#39;t rational.  No other way to put it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So because the metrics disagree with your hopeful fanboy dreams, you blame humans for being irrational? Its a 2 week dataset dude. 2 days ago those numbers were higher, at 17 and 4. Not much better, but it points to the trend forming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The denial of fanboys in this sub is worse than any other sub I&amp;#39;ve bothered to look at. Its ridiculous. You cannot argue with data.

Maybe because I'm not at \"end game\" status I don't have the hatred that I've been seeing around here as of late. These are my feelings about the patch thus far:\n\n1. They improved a lot of the issues the menus, station services, etc, that had horrible load times for the Xbox. Before the patch I would press the menu (start) button and wait anywhere from from 2 seconds to 2 minutes waiting for the menu. I'm so thankful for that.\n\n2. Holo-Me: I'm not just a body anymore. I have face with details and I can feed my galactic narcissism with constant pics and videos. Really cool. \n\n3. New ships. That's cool for the people that want them, but personally I find tourism boring and gets tedious quick. \n\n4. Changes in exploration payouts. This is neat. I will have to admit that I'm not the most dedicated explorer, most times I'll charge my adv-dis scanner and high wake after getting that info. Nice to know that I'll be getting more than my usual 400 or so credits. \n\n5. Multi Crew- I'll be honest here, I never really saw that point. While it would be fun to jump into my friend's fighter and blow stuff up from anywhere in the galaxy, I would just rather have my ship with me. So while a lot of people are screaming about this, it doesn't bother me because it was something that I probably wasn't going to use anyway. \n\n6. For people crying about how they bought a season pass and they demand perfection. I bought it too, and it wasn't for multicrew, it was for planetary landing. When I bought the season pass I had no idea multicrew was even going to be a thing. I wanted to land of planets in rover and do stuff; I get to do that, I'm happy. All this other stuff is just a bonus for me. \n\n7. For the people making a big stink about how they're leaving and never playing this game again: just go.

Maybe because I&amp;#39;m not at &amp;quot;end game&amp;quot; status I don&amp;#39;t have the hatred that I&amp;#39;ve been seeing around here as of late. These are my feelings about the patch thus far:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They improved a lot of the issues the menus, station services, etc, that had horrible load times for the Xbox. Before the patch I would press the menu (start) button and wait anywhere from from 2 seconds to 2 minutes waiting for the menu. I&amp;#39;m so thankful for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holo-Me: I&amp;#39;m not just a body anymore. I have face with details and I can feed my galactic narcissism with constant pics and videos. Really cool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New ships. That&amp;#39;s cool for the people that want them, but personally I find tourism boring and gets tedious quick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in exploration payouts. This is neat. I will have to admit that I&amp;#39;m not the most dedicated explorer, most times I&amp;#39;ll charge my adv-dis scanner and high wake after getting that info. Nice to know that I&amp;#39;ll be getting more than my usual 400 or so credits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi Crew- I&amp;#39;ll be honest here, I never really saw that point. While it would be fun to jump into my friend&amp;#39;s fighter and blow stuff up from anywhere in the galaxy, I would just rather have my ship with me. So while a lot of people are screaming about this, it doesn&amp;#39;t bother me because it was something that I probably wasn&amp;#39;t going to use anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people crying about how they bought a season pass and they demand perfection. I bought it too, and it wasn&amp;#39;t for multicrew, it was for planetary landing. When I bought the season pass I had no idea multicrew was even going to be a thing. I wanted to land of planets in rover and do stuff; I get to do that, I&amp;#39;m happy.
