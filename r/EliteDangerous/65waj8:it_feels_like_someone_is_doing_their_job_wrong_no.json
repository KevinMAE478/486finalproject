Even just day to day playing of the game can be rough, having to wait an additional 4 seconds every time you boot up your FSD &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s been fully charged, how long is takes for you to get to a station without overshooting...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me the only way a game can have this number of annoying and dull gameplay mechanics is if the developers have never played it the way the players play it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "name": "t1_dge369l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492490534.0, "created_utc": 1492461734.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65waj8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeamwu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chan_soikutsu", "parent_id": "t3_65waj8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EliteDangerous", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is the worst patch i have ever seen.

But in the last year, or more like since the horizons release, I feel like I'm in a positon where I have to write this here even tough my career goal is in the same area. I don't want to be offensive or anything, but this completely irks me and I simply can't understand what I'm going to say here, so maybe I will get some enlightment here.\n\nWhat is actually happening in your development process, Frontier? I simply can't follow what takes so much time with what you actually create. But lets go through it!\n\n1. **Easier things first: Galnet is empty.** I recently had to visualize some thesis about how to engage your community to co-create content with you. It seems like you completely missed every potential for that, seeing as how most of Galnet right now are summarizations of different stuff. You care about lore? Well, there's not much anymore. This was different once. And, to top it off, you have to go through all that summarization which won't interest you in the slightest if you are keen on lore. Why is the state so barren? Where is a simple writer to write out snippets of a pre-determined story? Where are incentives for user-creations? It feels like such a missed opportunity.\n2. **Powerplay + Engineering: There's enough criticism out there.** From the endless grindfest\u00b2 of Powerplay to the PvP-Balance gap of Engineered/Unengineered and need to do grindfest material gathering. The latter was patched to be made easier, but its still concerning on how the first iteration even came about. But, as said, not going into depth here. Powerplay was a missed opportunity and Engineering feels like forcing horizon(planet)-content.\n3. **Holo-Me.** Finally! We have our character creator! It's well done and the transitions are nice, cudos to the programmers/artists/sound-designers. But now, after waiting half a year... microtransactions! Not a single available tattoo? Completely basic suits? I don't care you want to earn money with microtransactions, but to bring out such a anticipated feature with, in the end, half baked customization, feels awkward. It's a nice character creator, but it feels like theres not much, especially due to face limitation. I know, we don't see the character anyways, but if we already have a face-concentration, why are there so few options available? Like mentioned, no tatoos, no... future piercings, whatever the heck you can want. Again, it feels somewhat barebones and too limited. Why do I have to pay for some black ink in my face? Why are there just simple color variations of the most basic outfit? You really couldn't offer at least some *simple* alternatives? It feels... well, like a missed opportunity?\n4. **Multi-Crew.** Yay, a friend can fly around with me! And... shoot some stuff with cannons. I really don't know what I expected. It's somewhat fun, but in the end... its... well... a missed opportunity for something more.\n5. **Planets.** The current iterations we have. The great driving around on planets with some bases. So you obviously have a procedural generation for the planets. Who basically all look the same as they are moons. And don't feel different... as they are moons. It's fine. I accept that. But again, everything feels absolutely the same. There's no difference from Moon A to B in terms of gameplay except some materials you actually scope (and the ruins-events). Missions on moons feel barebones too. Why aren't, at least in the bubble near populated systems, some generated human bases with turrets and protective fliers? Or anything at all. To not make it barebones. Because again, it feels... like a missed opportunity.\n6. **Ship Customization.** Well, I literally can't do anything without buying anything out of the store with additional money. Theres not even anything ingame to obtain to customize my ship. What is this? Why, just why, aren't there some goals? Your playerbase is big. There aren't only grinders who try this game out. You have to hook people to want some progression other than money(and thus ships). Its like the most basic concept one can think of. What happened here? Its, again, a missed opportunity and makes it feel even more cash-shoppy.\n7. **Background-Simulation.** What is actually happening here? In the terms of \"what does it actually do\" ?. What is your code doing? We obviously don't have something persistent thats interacting with the players at all. We have some number tweeking with wares and minor faction influences and their spreading. Different people will have their own reasons to join powerplay and help minor factions, mainly due to roleplay reasons. That's cool, at least. But the Background-Simulation really feels to fall flat and to serve no real purpose concerning wares and trade. \nBut Minor Factions! I can have my own? AWESOME. Except for people who have to wait over 3 months to have it inserted. I simply can NOT comprehend how the insertion can last this long. I'm still waiting and I have no problems doing so, but others clearly want them integrated. So, you obviously have lists every time of, lets say, 30 new minor factions of players. You can't tell me that you can't take one guy after checking availability to simply insert them into the game for the next update. There has to be some interface in your code for this. There must be. I can't believe that you are writing code snippets for every insertion. Where is the automated system after accepting and checking? (Or even accepting and checking too). \n8. **3rd-party Tools.** Half of the time when trading I have to check on another website OUTSIDE the game where I can get something. Why? Its some g time in the future where everything is connected in some way(see Galnet) - But there is no ingame function to actually check that stuff? This seems like the first thing stations would want to publish to sell goods and get more traffic. Not to mention resource-route determination. Why do I have to switch OUT of the game to get stuff done efficiently? You clearly want me to loose every immersion possible, right? Failed opportunity.\n9. I had something here, but I don't remember because the forum deleted half of my post after submitting and I'm loosing my steam. Passengers, Pirate Interdactions, you name it. But it was something different. Anyways, I wanted to get at the following...\n\nSomething is clearly wrong. And I mean clearly! I don't know what part in your team screws up though. Something has to. All the time since horizons release and it basically still feels like the absolute same game for me. Some small additions, but nothing big. Everything underwhelming, awkward or too obstruse to not be worth the effort. Why? Is management forcing bad decisions about the team? Are your game designers strictly bad because the different game modules all seem so barebones? Are they maybe limited by upper management and thus can't create creatively?\nObviously you are doing bug fixing. And adding content. But its so slow! Its so barebones! It's so underwhelming! I feel disappointed after every patch. This is a feeling your customer should not have. And I simply don't know what you are doing that its ending up like this. Some problem area I think has to be identified. Hell, at the current rate I even suspect that most developers are at Planet Safari and Planet Coasters and this game is being done on the side for some money upkeep and future possibilities. What the hell has gone wrong that I am thinking of this possibility?\n\nAs I said, I didn't want to come off as offensive. But I also want to know what others feel about this issue.\n\nI will be going to bed so I won't comment immediately, but thanks for reading!\n\nFly safe! o7", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy pasta for the firewalled, cos the OP is lazy :P&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to start this off with saying that I like the game and find it playable enough to have fun and I definitely got my money worth out of it.

But lets go through it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier things first: Galnet is empty.&lt;/strong&gt; I recently had to visualize some thesis about how to engage your community to co-create content with you. It seems like you completely missed every potential for that, seeing as how most of Galnet right now are summarizations of different stuff. You care about lore? Well, there&amp;#39;s not much anymore. This was different once. And, to top it off, you have to go through all that summarization which won&amp;#39;t interest you in the slightest if you are keen on lore. Why is the state so barren? Where is a simple writer to write out snippets of a pre-determined story? Where are incentives for user-creations? It feels like such a missed opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powerplay + Engineering: There&amp;#39;s enough criticism out there.&lt;/strong&gt; From the endless grindfest\u00b2 of Powerplay to the PvP-Balance gap of Engineered/Unengineered and need to do grindfest material gathering. The latter was patched to be made easier, but its still concerning on how the first iteration even came about. But, as said, not going into depth here. Powerplay was a missed opportunity and Engineering feels like forcing horizon(planet)-content.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holo-Me.&lt;/strong&gt; Finally! We have our character creator! It&amp;#39;s well done and the transitions are nice, cudos to the programmers/artists/sound-designers. But now, after waiting half a year... microtransactions! Not a single available tattoo? Completely basic suits? I don&amp;#39;t care you want to earn money with microtransactions, but to bring out such a anticipated feature with, in the end, half baked customization, feels awkward. It&amp;#39;s a nice character creator, but it feels like theres not much, especially due to face limitation. I know, we don&amp;#39;t see the character anyways, but if we already have a face-concentration, why are there so few options available? Like mentioned, no tatoos, no... future piercings, whatever the heck you can want. Again, it feels somewhat barebones and too limited. Why do I have to pay for some black ink in my face? Why are there just simple color variations of the most basic outfit? You really couldn&amp;#39;t offer at least some &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; alternatives? It feels... well, like a missed opportunity?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Crew.&lt;/strong&gt; Yay, a friend can fly around with me! And... shoot some stuff with cannons. I really don&amp;#39;t know what I expected. It&amp;#39;s somewhat fun, but in the end... its... well... a missed opportunity for something more.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planets.&lt;/strong&gt; The current iterations we have. The great driving around on planets with some bases. So you obviously have a procedural generation for the planets. Who basically all look the same as they are moons. And don&amp;#39;t feel different... as they are moons. It&amp;#39;s fine. I accept that. But again, everything feels absolutely the same. There&amp;#39;s no difference from Moon A to B in terms of gameplay except some materials you actually scope (and the ruins-events). Missions on moons feel barebones too. Why aren&amp;#39;t, at least in the bubble near populated systems, some generated human bases with turrets and protective fliers? Or anything at all. To not make it barebones. Because again, it feels... like a missed opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship Customization.&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I literally can&amp;#39;t do anything without buying anything out of the store with additional money. Theres not even anything ingame to obtain to customize my ship. What is this? Why, just why, aren&amp;#39;t there some goals? Your playerbase is big. There aren&amp;#39;t only grinders who try this game out. You have to hook people to want some progression other than money(and thus ships). Its like the most basic concept one can think of. What happened here? Its, again, a missed opportunity and makes it feel even more cash-shoppy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background-Simulation.&lt;/strong&gt; What is actually happening here? In the terms of &amp;quot;what does it actually do&amp;quot; ?. What is your code doing? We obviously don&amp;#39;t have something persistent thats interacting with the players at all. We have some number tweeking with wares and minor faction influences and their spreading. Different people will have their own reasons to join powerplay and help minor factions, mainly due to roleplay reasons. That&amp;#39;s cool, at least. But the Background-Simulation really feels to fall flat and to serve no real purpose concerning wares and trade. \nBut Minor Factions! I can have my own? AWESOME. Except for people who have to wait over 3 months to have it inserted. I simply can NOT comprehend how the insertion can last this long. I&amp;#39;m still waiting and I have no problems doing so, but others clearly want them integrated. So, you obviously have lists every time of, lets say, 30 new minor factions of players. You can&amp;#39;t tell me that you can&amp;#39;t take one guy after checking availability to simply insert them into the game for the next update. There has to be some interface in your code for this. There must be. I can&amp;#39;t believe that you are writing code snippets for every insertion. Where is the automated system after accepting and checking? (Or even accepting and checking too). &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd-party Tools.&lt;/strong&gt; Half of the time when trading I have to check on another website OUTSIDE the game where I can get something. Why? Its some g time in the future where everything is connected in some way(see Galnet) - But there is no ingame function to actually check that stuff? This seems like the first thing stations would want to publish to sell goods and get more traffic. Not to mention resource-route determination. Why do I have to switch OUT of the game to get stuff done efficiently? You clearly want me to loose every immersion possible, right? Failed opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I had something here, but I don&amp;#39;t remember because the forum deleted half of my post after submitting and I&amp;#39;m loosing my steam. Passengers, Pirate Interdactions, you name it. But it was something different. Anyways, I wanted to get at the following...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something is clearly wrong. And I mean clearly! I don&amp;#39;t know what part in your team screws up though. Something has to. All the time since horizons release and it basically still feels like the absolute same game for me. Some small additions, but nothing big. Everything underwhelming, awkward or too obstruse to not be worth the effort. Why? Is management forcing bad decisions about the team? Are your game designers strictly bad because the different game modules all seem so barebones? Are they maybe limited by upper management and thus can&amp;#39;t create creatively?\nObviously you are doing bug fixing. And adding content. But its so slow! Its so barebones! It&amp;#39;s so underwhelming! I feel disappointed after every patch. This is a feeling your customer should not have. And I simply don&amp;#39;t know what you are doing that its ending up like this. Some problem area I think has to be identified. Hell, at the current rate I even suspect that most developers are at Planet Safari and Planet Coasters and this game is being done on the side for some money upkeep and future possibilities. What the hell has gone wrong that I am thinking of this possibility?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, I didn&amp;#39;t want to come off as offensive. But I also want to know what others feel about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will be going to bed so I won&amp;#39;t comment immediately, but thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fly safe! o7&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "name": "t1_dgdv2ix", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492481403.0, "created_utc": 1492452603.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65waj8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65waj8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65waj8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65waj8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgek0d3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Soopyyy", "parent_id": "t1_dgefc13", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EliteDangerous", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It was pretty blatant this time!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was pretty blatant this time!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "name": "t1_dgek0d3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492511407.0, "created_utc": 1492482607.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgefc13", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bigskill80", "parent_id": "t1_dgeenwq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EliteDangerous", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Because they lock and censor everything is negative....", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they lock and censor everything is negative....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "name": "t1_dgefc13", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492505761.0, "created_utc": 1492476961.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeenwq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "couchcaptain", "parent_id": "t1_dgeeb60", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EliteDangerous", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't see a reason why the thread has to be locked.

They could do sooooo much more with this (and implement a REAL crime and punishment system for players, with bounty hunting tools to track players that commit crimes. The more crime they commit, the easier it is to track them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pirating is bounty hunting in reverse but worse because the rewards are far less. There is no incentive to be a pirate other than that you want to be either an asshole murder-hobo, or you want to &amp;quot;role-play&amp;quot;. There are ZERO repercussions for either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the factions are lifeless. I have played this game for almost 800 hours, and most of that time, I have been factionless. Why? Because I could care less about them. It is more of an annoyance to be allied with someone due to the constant scripted, pointless interdictions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The core functionality and features of the game need depth. It&amp;#39;s 100% clear that the dev team is instructed to add paid DLC first, then flesh out/refine them at some other point.

No more of the player base getting pissed because they bought horizon&amp;#39;s thinking X was going to happen and instead get Y and are now pissed at frontier because of it. You are going to see more microtransactions. More cosmetics. You are going to see them get more candid, hopefully, more transparent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Star Citizen just released their dev productions schedule for the rest of the year...It was received 80/20 positively with some people upset that their one thing wasn&amp;#39;t getting worked on...However, it cleared up the doom and gloom, and I think Elite should follow in that just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "name": "t1_dgdozu7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492474675.0, "created_utc": 1492445875.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65waj8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65waj8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeutvd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Soopyyy", "parent_id": "t1_dgeu8ua", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EliteDangerous", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nailed it.

Read about the engineers, amazing NPCs who can make your ship jump further, fly faster, fire more, not overheat as much, have stronger shields! Great!
