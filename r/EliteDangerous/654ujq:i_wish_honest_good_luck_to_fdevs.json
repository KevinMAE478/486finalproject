That was 3 steps backward. Maybe even 4. I loathe them and everything they stand for. The Engineers broke this game in so very many ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Guardians added a lot. Fighters. Hyperdictions. Ram Tah missions. new mission system, the tip offs, more storyline embedded in the gameplay and some more stuff I can&amp;#39;t remember now. and yes, bugs. That is one of the two constants in FDEV universe. the other is/are spelling errors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This last update is in my view, is mostly.. no, not mostly.. It&amp;#39;s only polish. And bugs. and spelling errors. even before the game was really live (for &amp;quot;death people&amp;quot; in the newsletter)  TBH the engineers update was way, WAY worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now the fun part: every big feature of 2.3 was requested by players. We wanted to name our ships. check. We wanted to see our commander: check, We wanted to have a better external camera: check. We wanted multicrew: check.\n(replace &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;The community&amp;quot;.  I just wanted to name my ship and be done with it.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "name": "t1_dg7mvur", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123313.0, "created_utc": 1492094513.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7jl7d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Soopyyy", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ihvm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EliteDangerous", "controversiality": 0, "body": "its not 95% good though.
