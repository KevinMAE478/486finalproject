If the light becomes brighter, your eyes will see it as brighter. In the end, visually the same. Regardless of the source getting brighter, or your eyes letting more light in, the end result doesn&amp;#39;t change: you can see, it isn&amp;#39;t dark.

I like projected grid-lines. Think about how, when you approach massive objects (planets) in supercruise, the blue rings indicate to you how close you are and how quickly you&amp;#39;re approaching. Projected grid lines on the dark surface would perform the same task, becoming tighter grids as you got closer. Think of the grids in the Galaxy map, and how zooming in and out makes them scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "name": "t1_dgc29to", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492380614.0, "created_utc": 1492351814.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ozzn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ozzn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcgdgb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ShangT", "parent_id": "t1_dgcfnn6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EliteDangerous", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Have you seen my latest video?
