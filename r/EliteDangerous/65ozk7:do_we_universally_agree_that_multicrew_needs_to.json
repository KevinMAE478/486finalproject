Sounds like a lot, but when ships cost 10s of millions or hundreds of millions...well, it just seems to far away for my tastes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know, &amp;quot;Well commander, you just have to earn the ships, you just can&amp;#39;t have them for free&amp;quot; is a common response.  I get that. I really do. And agree to a point. But within my playtime, earning a ship like an Anaconda would take 5 or 6 months, and then half as much for a single rebuy. That&amp;#39;s too much time for too little reward for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: That&amp;#39;s what ED boils down to for me. It&amp;#39;s a good game that just needs too much of my time to feel rewarding. I want to play a game, not work a second job. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "name": "t1_dgc9v9a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492391264.0, "created_utc": 1492362464.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 34}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc7exi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Allah__Ragbar", "parent_id": "t1_dgc6bte", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EliteDangerous", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Funnily enough, the mechanics introduced in the latest expansion have made WoW grindier than ever before", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, the mechanics introduced in the latest expansion have made WoW grindier than ever before&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "name": "t1_dgc7exi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492388057.0, "created_utc": 1492359257.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc6bte", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 23, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KaneHart", "parent_id": "t1_dgc13zn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EliteDangerous", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah idk what is going on with these devs. Even WoW of all MMORPG's adapted and learned people were not into long grinds like they use to.
