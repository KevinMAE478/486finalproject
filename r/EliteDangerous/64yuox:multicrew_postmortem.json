This is supposed to be a multiplayer game, and they introduce a multiplayer mode, and then promptly announce that it is very possible they will abandon it entirely. This should probably be considered a core gameplay mechanic in the scope of the game they are trying to make, but they seem perfectly okay with the idea of it becoming vestigial and ignored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will still play because the things I otherwise enjoy about the game are there but...
