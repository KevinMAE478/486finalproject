It's better press at the very least to keep experimental stuff like this on a Beta server rather release it live and face the shame of having to take it down not long after.    \n\nWhen I realised how long the Beta was going to be, I was really happy. Frontier can finally release a relatively bug free update. Having spent a month or more (please correct me if I'm wrong) in Beta form, every possible glitch or bug would be found, any issues that arose would be fixed. So what do we get in return? Well, not long before its release we hear that payouts are getting nerfed to shit regardless of your rank and that the Anaconda's bridge looks quite frankly terrible. Not good. At this point we haven't even learnt of just how many glitches are actually in the Beta that have been reported and not fixed. Along comes 2.3 and it's covered in bugs that actually make it unplayable. \n\nFrontier, what are you doing. \n\nThe Beta has been used as hype up time rather than time to actually fix any glitches, which isn't the main purpose of a Beta by a long shot. Do you not quickly quality test the game before it's actually launched live to everyone? Why not have someone(s) quickly play test the game for say an hour before actually going live to everyone just to ensure that the game is actually playable for the most part.

It&amp;#39;s better press at the very least to keep experimental stuff like this on a Beta server rather release it live and face the shame of having to take it down not long after.    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I realised how long the Beta was going to be, I was really happy. Frontier can finally release a relatively bug free update. Having spent a month or more (please correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong) in Beta form, every possible glitch or bug would be found, any issues that arose would be fixed. So what do we get in return? Well, not long before its release we hear that payouts are getting nerfed to shit regardless of your rank and that the Anaconda&amp;#39;s bridge looks quite frankly terrible. Not good. At this point we haven&amp;#39;t even learnt of just how many glitches are actually in the Beta that have been reported and not fixed. Along comes 2.3 and it&amp;#39;s covered in bugs that actually make it unplayable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frontier, what are you doing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Beta has been used as hype up time rather than time to actually fix any glitches, which isn&amp;#39;t the main purpose of a Beta by a long shot.

Without a monthly subscription model, they're desperate to find other ways to finance the staff needed to maintain and update the game. It sucks, but that's the reality. Programmers make good money, they're expensive, and game developers have to have a way to pay them. That's just real world economics. If you sell a million copies of a game for $50, that's maybe $40 million after giving Steam its cut. If you have 30 programmers making $150,000/year, that's $4.5 million per year in costs just on staff. Then add office operating costs, server costs, and all the rest, and you're at $6 million/year easily. And that's with no profit for the company at all. At that cost, you can afford to operate for 6 years and then you're out of cash.\n\nI've been extremely critical of FD's updates this year.

I&amp;#39;ve spent a lot of time to basically get nothing. In GTA V/online, I played through the single player content (about 80% complete), and did a lot in online both on my own and with my friends. It was fun. It didn&amp;#39;t cost 6mil to get a car that I just liked or to get mods for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In both games the payouts are pretty similar (between 5,000-30,000 for basic missions) but what you can spend that money on is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more expensive in Elite, even if you find a system that has 500k-2mil delivery/combat missions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both games are grindy, they difference is that GTA has varied content, things you can do either on your own or with friends/randoms, and is &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;. There is still a lot in GTA I haven&amp;#39;t done and want to do with my friends. We&amp;#39;re planning on doing all heists with 0 deaths, getting better at jet combat, ect... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Elite...For a game that is based in the entire galaxy I can understand it being sparse on content. But &lt;strong&gt;come on&lt;/strong&gt;, there is only so many times I can hunt for systems on my own to try to find something cool to do, then go to the internet to find something to do, and find out the way I found to make credits so I can afford anything above a class D module for my 100+mil ship has been nerfed...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my rant for the situation. I&amp;#39;ve been on the hope-it-gets-better train for awhile, but at this point I&amp;#39;ll probably only get on to do combat with a friend to tide me over until Star Citizen gets released in 30 years. For the time I&amp;#39;ve spent I have had a ton more fun in GTA than Elite. As one of my friends told me once &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;If you have to watch a show or movie while playing a video game, is the video game really fun to begin with?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "name": "t1_dg6249k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492041219.0, "created_utc": 1492012419.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x74c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg665w4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "StabbyCat", "parent_id": "t3_64x74c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EliteDangerous", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd really like them to start fleshing out what's here rather that spending a lot of time adding features that don't contribute to the core gameplay. \n\nDon't try to be Star Citizen, be more Elite!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d really like them to start fleshing out what&amp;#39;s here rather that spending a lot of time adding features that don&amp;#39;t contribute to the core gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t try to be Star Citizen, be more Elite!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EliteDangerous", "name": "t1_dg665w4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492045468.0, "created_utc": 1492016668.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vi60", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x74c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg68zud", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Handlebarrr", "parent_id": "t3_64x74c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EliteDangerous", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dropped into MC as a fighter last nite.
