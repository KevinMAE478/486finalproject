And the shitstorm of in game \"protests\" that ensued.  Gotta give it to CCP though, updating the Jita Monument to a destroyed monument with (IIRC) a little description was a pretty awesome move. Not many studios would ever do that sort of thing. I remember joining in on shooting at that monument. It was just a rainbow of lasers!\n\nI remember the run up to Incarna a bit too. At first, early in the development cycle, it seemed really exciting. Even I got caught up in it all for a brief while. \"Oh shit, space legs! This will be *awesome*!\" There was some mention of a space Bar where you could gamble, maybe get some missions and such. It seemed sorta cool, nothing of too much substance, but CCP tends to release info in chunks as development goes on. They flesh things out.\n\nBut then the release date closed in, and not much else was revealed about what was going to be *in* Incarna. Except clothes. Which was kinda nice, but nothing of note. Eventually I started wondering \"Well it looks nice 'n all, but what is there to *do*? I can't imagine a bit of poker in the space bar would be very captivating or meaningful to gameplay. From what you've shown, the only places active enough to grab a somewhat lively number of players would be the major trade hubs. Places like Jita 4-4, Hek, Amarr, maybe Dodixie. Everywhere else will be a ghost town...\" I wasn't close to being the only one thinking this. But most people I saw on the forums **vehemently defended** the coming expansion.\n\nAnd then the expansion hit.\n\nNothing but the captains quarters. *Not even the little space bar to play poker in*. Just you. Alone. In a small room with an admittedly amazing \"balcony\" that lets you view your spaceship in all its glory. But nothing of substance. Nothing to *do*. It was impressive for a few minutes and then just forgotten. Well. Perhaps not forgotten, since the protests happened... Protests large enough to end up on real news channels and beat CCP into changing tactics.\n\nI'm pretty sure there was also people that couldn't get the game to run anymore. The strain of running Captains Quarters while docked ALL THE TIME was too much for their potato rigs. They couldn't do very much about that because CCP removed the old hangar at first. Again to CCPs credit, they did put it back somewhat quickly though. They didn't have to do that.\n\nSome might say that they needed to upgrade their rigs.

And the shitstorm of in game &amp;quot;protests&amp;quot; that ensued.  Gotta give it to CCP though, updating the Jita Monument to a destroyed monument with (IIRC) a little description was a pretty awesome move. Not many studios would ever do that sort of thing. I remember joining in on shooting at that monument. It was just a rainbow of lasers!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember the run up to Incarna a bit too. At first, early in the development cycle, it seemed really exciting. Even I got caught up in it all for a brief while. &amp;quot;Oh shit, space legs! This will be &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot; There was some mention of a space Bar where you could gamble, maybe get some missions and such. It seemed sorta cool, nothing of too much substance, but CCP tends to release info in chunks as development goes on. They flesh things out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then the release date closed in, and not much else was revealed about what was going to be &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; Incarna. Except clothes. Which was kinda nice, but nothing of note. Eventually I started wondering &amp;quot;Well it looks nice &amp;#39;n all, but what is there to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;? I can&amp;#39;t imagine a bit of poker in the space bar would be very captivating or meaningful to gameplay. From what you&amp;#39;ve shown, the only places active enough to grab a somewhat lively number of players would be the major trade hubs. Places like Jita 4-4, Hek, Amarr, maybe Dodixie. Everywhere else will be a ghost town...&amp;quot; I wasn&amp;#39;t close to being the only one thinking this. But most people I saw on the forums &lt;strong&gt;vehemently defended&lt;/strong&gt; the coming expansion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then the expansion hit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing but the captains quarters. &lt;em&gt;Not even the little space bar to play poker in&lt;/em&gt;. Just you. Alone. In a small room with an admittedly amazing &amp;quot;balcony&amp;quot; that lets you view your spaceship in all its glory. But nothing of substance. Nothing to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. It was impressive for a few minutes and then just forgotten. Well. Perhaps not forgotten, since the protests happened... Protests large enough to end up on real news channels and beat CCP into changing tactics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure there was also people that couldn&amp;#39;t get the game to run anymore. The strain of running Captains Quarters while docked ALL THE TIME was too much for their potato rigs. They couldn&amp;#39;t do very much about that because CCP removed the old hangar at first.
