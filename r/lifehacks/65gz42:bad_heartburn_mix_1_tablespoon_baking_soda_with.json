I can&amp;#39;t digest fodmaps properly so when I eat too many of them it makes me more gassy, those gases then build up and cause me to burp more which loosens my sphincter (the one in your stomach) and makes it easier for acid and acid vapour to come up, particularly when you&amp;#39;re sleeping. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cutting down on those foods made it a lot better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chocolate relaxes your stomach opening so it causes reflux and also don&amp;#39;t drink while you eat. Have a half hour break between eating and drinking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, of you have consistently runny/irritated nose it could actually be reflux irritating your nasal system.
