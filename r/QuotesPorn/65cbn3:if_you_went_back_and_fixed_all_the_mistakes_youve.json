If someone has a bad heart then you don't want them flying a plane because of the risk of a spontaneous heart attack. A 10 year trip on an expensive government shuttle is going to be an expensive waste of government money.\n\nThe film focuses on the invalids and how they are relegated to menial service jobs ignoring the fact that if you have schizophrenia or other significant genetic disability then you are already largely stuck in horrible jobs or welfare. It also ignores how invalids will become increasingly less common as the genetic optimization becomes more commonplace and how much society will be improved when we can prevent genetic mental disorders and physical disfigurements.\n\nNo explanation is given for Vincent's motivation and desire for visiting space.
