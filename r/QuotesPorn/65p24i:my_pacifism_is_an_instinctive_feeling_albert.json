That doesn't mean he is a pacifist either though. You're making this a black and white discussion, when it's much more complex. And, second, just because he wrote the letters, does not make him solely responsible for the deaths in Japan. In fact, if that's your argument, then Szilard is still more responsible because he took initiative to start the project, and call on Einstein's fame to get it passed. I don't even agree with that argument, because it's a much more multifaceted issue, that came down to who made the decision to drop the bomb, when it could have potentially not been dropped. And, finally, I'm not uncomfortable with acknowledging Einstein's involvement. Im confident in his involvement.

I never called him a pacifist, regardless of the post, and you went the other extreme and accused him as the sole person accountable, because of his involvement in the letters. Which is an extreme position. Whether or not he was a pacifist is not the point. He wasn&amp;#39;t the only person involved in the Manhattan Project, and just because he helped write letters doesn&amp;#39;t make him someone who isn&amp;#39;t a pacifist. You keep saying he isn&amp;#39;t, and then saying that his &amp;quot;direct involvement&amp;quot; (which historically, it&amp;#39;s not) makes him not a pacifist, but he never worked on the project. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean he is a pacifist either though. You&amp;#39;re making this a black and white discussion, when it&amp;#39;s much more complex. And, second, just because he wrote the letters, does not make him solely responsible for the deaths in Japan. In fact, if that&amp;#39;s your argument, then Szilard is still more responsible because he took initiative to start the project, and call on Einstein&amp;#39;s fame to get it passed. I don&amp;#39;t even agree with that argument, because it&amp;#39;s a much more multifaceted issue, that came down to who made the decision to drop the bomb, when it could have potentially not been dropped. And, finally, I&amp;#39;m not uncomfortable with acknowledging Einstein&amp;#39;s involvement. Im confident in his involvement. You&amp;#39;re very bad at arguing, and are trying to dig yourself out of this whole without acknowledging you were wrong. You not only created a straw man by accusing me of one, but are trying to shift the discussion, and are actually wrong in your assessment of Einstein.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "QuotesPorn", "name": "t1_dgcevfg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492397932.0, "created_utc": 1492369132.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgce83x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iamkuato", "parent_id": "t1_dgcddzt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/QuotesPorn", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Re-read the title of this post.
