Granblue has shit tons of content, tens of hours of story, maybe more(atleast leveling and gearing for the latter levels making it more).\n\nThe character designs are amazing and there are really many different styles of characters. The artstyle is great and it stays the same, unlike in many games where the style jumps all over the place. All of the characters have their unique personality and voiced \"campaigns\" for every 2nd highest and top tier characters. Also the main campaign is fully voiced(Japanese). Also the story is very interesting, I love the character interactions and the overall plot. Also the lore is deep and intriguing. \n\nI have a pretty good team, and a few decent teams and I haven't spent any money on the game. You can get far without using any money, it will just take some luck and lots of grinding, even though even with money you have to grind a lot. \n\nAlso the gameplay is pretty much like any JRPG, just it doesn't have any super combos or follow up attacks. Every character has a few skills, and you have a summons that boost your stats. Many of the top tier characters have very specific ways to play, like for example one of my favourite characters deals elemental damage based on the enemy's weakness, if you keep switching her stances every cooldown. \n\nAlso really often they keep releasing comics about the characters and you just can't read them and be in a bad mood. They are so light hearted and funny, I keep laughing outloud when I read them. \n\nI really recommend the game, but be prepared for grinding and salt when you don't get your husbandos/waifus :o\n\nNinja edit: Oh and you have to jump through some hoops to get the game, you have to download QooApp and download the game from there, because it's not released in the west, but it has been translated..
