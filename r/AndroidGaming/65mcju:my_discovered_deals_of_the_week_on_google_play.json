You play the Nameless Hero appointed by a kidnapped King to have him from an evil duke.  What makes this game stand out among the others are a procedurally generated game (No two games will be the same), and a global timer that you must face before the evil duke kills the king.

I&amp;#39;m not sure how many levels there are, but I can personally attest that there are at least 59 levels.

Though it is a more passive type of puzzler, the ambience and the soundtrack makes for a very soothing experience.
