That will tell you everything you need to know. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Blep", "name": "t1_dg8wlnk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492184769.0, "created_utc": 1492155969.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_306sc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658x0d", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaa831", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Anarch157a", "parent_id": "t1_dg8qumi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Blep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Do not move the box with the kittens unless the mom is in there with them, otherwise she won't recognize them in the new location and will hiss at them.
