For the record I am not religious at all. Nothing in my post is religious other than a reference to it being a Catholic Holiday. But people based on the reference alone, have decided I am &amp;quot;religious&amp;quot;, a &amp;quot;conservative religious nutjob&amp;quot; etc. That my reference about being concerned about health is BS and it thinly veiled religious post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think people should be allowed to buy alcohol 24/7. I think abortion should be on demand(within reason), no wait time for divorce etc. I am ultra-liberal, likely significantly more than the people calling me &amp;quot;religious&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point was if you so preoccupied with where you will buy drink today and it terrible you can&amp;#39;t buy drink, what will you do etc. Maybe you should ask yourself, do I have a problem and is my relationship with alcohol unhealthy? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I made one made one reference to Good Friday being a religious holiday, which it is and immediately I am a &amp;quot;conservative religious nutjob&amp;quot;... WTF? Everyone on this subreddit needs to stop jumping to conclusions &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FYI literally not even a week ago I stated this about Good Friday : &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;am delighted. I don&amp;#39;t really care about the fact I can&amp;#39;t buy drink on two days a year. I just sick of the moaning coming up to every Easter about &amp;#39;This has no place in modern Ireland&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;I thought that the Catholic Church has no say in Ireland etc etc&amp;#39;.&lt;/strong&gt;\nI can&amp;#39;t wait for people to realise how anti-climatic it is to be able to buy drink 364 days a year, rather than 363 days a year...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/645j5e/good_friday_alcohol_sales_ban_to_be_abolished/dfzrp2l/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/645j5e/good_friday_alcohol_sales_ban_to_be_abolished/dfzrp2l/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For everyone who was more triggered than a SJW at a LGBTQI+ event for someone assuming someone&amp;#39;s gender, I have zero issue with people drinking on Good Friday.

They either think bible thumping religious Catholics are still in the majority or else they think you can just erase all of the vestiges of the past overnight if the majority wants you to. It doesn't work like that. Ireland used to be a poor country with a postcolonial inferiority complex. Resentment of the British meant that people held onto Catholicism and supported the Church as a means of retaining their identity and bought into their horseshit no questions asked. The Church then took advantage of that and convinced our hapless leaders to adopt all sorts of silly laws and regulations. Then, magically, at the end of the 80s the majority viewpoint started to move away from the Church. By the 2000s its real power had all but evaporated. But unfortunately you can't erase 60 years of legislation overnight. Not in a society of laws. Each one has to be debated, investigated and then removed --in many cases by referendum because of the requirements of the constitution. So it takes time, effort and money. The government is literally just a bunch of fucking eejits who are trying to keep their jobs by making sure they don't piss off the majority, their bases (which for the two biggest parties are in the countryside) or their interest groups. That's all there is to it. When it becomes politically damaging they get off their asses. But most politicians get questions about the health service or the welfare system or crime in their clinics, not the separation of church and state. Most people just don't ponder this stuff beyond writing a snarky \"feckin' church!\" comment on The Journal. So it doesn't get prioritized. In the past two decades we've gone from being a country where you literally couldn't get a divorce to a country where you can walk into the passport office and say \"hey, I was born a man but I've always really been a woman on the inside\" and they'll say \"grand, your new passport will be with you in 5-7 working days.\" You're living somewhere that's generally moving in the right direction. Progress takes time and a LOT of our peers seem to be abandoning a lot of the progress they made decades before us right now. So keep up the fight but don't just blithely point out the ridiculousness of the situation on a forum. The vast majority of Irish people already know it's ridiculous.

", "edited": 1492139400.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a fundamental misunderstanding in how a lot of Irish people view Ireland. They either think bible thumping religious Catholics are still in the majority or else they think you can just erase all of the vestiges of the past overnight if the majority wants you to. It doesn&amp;#39;t work like that. Ireland used to be a poor country with a postcolonial inferiority complex. Resentment of the British meant that people held onto Catholicism and supported the Church as a means of retaining their identity and bought into their horseshit no questions asked. The Church then took advantage of that and convinced our hapless leaders to adopt all sorts of silly laws and regulations. Then, magically, at the end of the 80s the majority viewpoint started to move away from the Church. By the 2000s its real power had all but evaporated. But unfortunately you can&amp;#39;t erase 60 years of legislation overnight. Not in a society of laws. Each one has to be debated, investigated and then removed --in many cases by referendum because of the requirements of the constitution. So it takes time, effort and money. The government is literally just a bunch of fucking eejits who are trying to keep their jobs by making sure they don&amp;#39;t piss off the majority, their bases (which for the two biggest parties are in the countryside) or their interest groups. That&amp;#39;s all there is to it. When it becomes politically damaging they get off their asses. But most politicians get questions about the health service or the welfare system or crime in their clinics, not the separation of church and state. Most people just don&amp;#39;t ponder this stuff beyond writing a snarky &amp;quot;feckin&amp;#39; church!&amp;quot; comment on The Journal. So it doesn&amp;#39;t get prioritized. In the past two decades we&amp;#39;ve gone from being a country where you literally couldn&amp;#39;t get a divorce to a country where you can walk into the passport office and say &amp;quot;hey, I was born a man but I&amp;#39;ve always really been a woman on the inside&amp;quot; and they&amp;#39;ll say &amp;quot;grand, your new passport will be with you in 5-7 working days.&amp;quot; You&amp;#39;re living somewhere that&amp;#39;s generally moving in the right direction.
