IIRC the Y-chomosome data linking Ireland to Spain is widely misinterpreted, the dna is of common origin (Central Europe moving west) not originating in Spain and spreading to Ireland. This is based on a y-chromosome group M222. There is a small percentage of your-chromosomes and mtDNA in Ireland dating from pre-agricultural people in Ireland that is shared with Morocco/Spain/Sardinia/Malta but also shows up in other marginal areas in Northern europe and seems to be a Europe wide substrate from when the population density was much lower pre-agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the cultural and trade links as far as Morocco are definitely there going back to the pre-bronze age but he genetic evidence is quite lacking as Morocco isn&amp;#39;t well studied.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ireland", "name": "t1_dg8a9qt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492148939.0, "created_utc": 1492120139.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7h3pw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Amckinstry", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ax2j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ireland", "controversiality": 0, "body": "For details of \"Moroccan\" slaves in Ireland, see\nhttp://www.caitlingreen.org/2015/09/a-great-host-of-captives.html\nand:\nhttps://books.google.ie/books?id=oe_JpPohuQgC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=blue+men+slave+morocco+ireland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C8NjQ_55jK&amp;sig=5B6jhrR7fEDu-lQDIMaw63_pjpA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd89DsuaHTAhVpLMAKHUbKDh8Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=blue%20men%20slave%20morocco%20ireland&amp;f=false\n\nI'd heard of it originally via Bob Quinns \"Atlantic Irish\" documentary / opinion series:\nhttps://ansionnachfionn.com/2016/06/07/the-atlantic-irish-and-celts/\nBasically, the idea that the Irish were not \"Celts\" but migrants up the Atlantic after the Ice age (probably from N Spain, as born out by genetics).
