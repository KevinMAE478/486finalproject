I think the \"many different centras (heh)\" approach can work. The problem is that a lot of housing isn't developed, or not developed the right way. Among the biggest problems is the idiotic one-size-fits-all mentality whereby developers and decision-makers ONLY think in terms of families, where you don't get to a decent standard of living and affordability unless it's for five people under one roof. Even with the homeless, they only ever talk about homeless families. But that's only the tip of the iceberg. If planning doesn't really cater to the needs of limited-means single tenants, then everyone at every age will be forced together somehow, and that just won't always work. So then you get a vicious circle of flatshare attrition, wrecked flats, and much less than 100% occupancy. That doesn't just waste housing capacity, it wastes people too. With proper planning, legislation and development, including social housing that takes into account the needs of the actual individual, you wouldn't get that kind of waste and wasted capacity. And that has to do with price levels too. If it takes two full-time in-their-prime workers to afford a mortgage, that's too many. If an average-income single person can never afford to buy their own flat, that's extortionate. There's almost a tacit assumption that individual persons don't need their own home. Think about that. Think about what it means. And height restrictions or no height restrictions, DCC themselves have to develop and provide an appropriate amount of social housing. If DCC can't afford that at Dublin property prices, then there's something rotten in the state of Denm-, sorry, Dublin. And that's something that can be addressed politically. It just requires DCC and others to grow a backbone and be prepared to piss off rich (domestic and international) profiteers.\n\nWhat things could be like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbC5j4pG9w\nNote that it's all political decisions that made this possible in Tokyo. Why not make similar decisions in Dublin? \n\nPS: Note that while there's some high-rise in the Tokyo mix, a lot of it isn't.

The problems with that I've described above.", "edited": 1492234477.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think the height restrictions in and of themselves are the problem. I think the &amp;quot;many different centras (heh)&amp;quot; approach can work. The problem is that a lot of housing isn&amp;#39;t developed, or not developed the right way. Among the biggest problems is the idiotic one-size-fits-all mentality whereby developers and decision-makers ONLY think in terms of families, where you don&amp;#39;t get to a decent standard of living and affordability unless it&amp;#39;s for five people under one roof. Even with the homeless, they only ever talk about homeless families. But that&amp;#39;s only the tip of the iceberg. If planning doesn&amp;#39;t really cater to the needs of limited-means single tenants, then everyone at every age will be forced together somehow, and that just won&amp;#39;t always work. So then you get a vicious circle of flatshare attrition, wrecked flats, and much less than 100% occupancy. That doesn&amp;#39;t just waste housing capacity, it wastes people too. With proper planning, legislation and development, including social housing that takes into account the needs of the actual individual, you wouldn&amp;#39;t get that kind of waste and wasted capacity. And that has to do with price levels too. If it takes two full-time in-their-prime workers to afford a mortgage, that&amp;#39;s too many. If an average-income single person can never afford to buy their own flat, that&amp;#39;s extortionate. There&amp;#39;s almost a tacit assumption that individual persons don&amp;#39;t need their own home. Think about that. Think about what it means. And height restrictions or no height restrictions, DCC themselves have to develop and provide an appropriate amount of social housing. If DCC can&amp;#39;t afford that at Dublin property prices, then there&amp;#39;s something rotten in the state of Denm-, sorry, Dublin. And that&amp;#39;s something that can be addressed politically. It just requires DCC and others to grow a backbone and be prepared to piss off rich (domestic and international) profiteers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What things could be like: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbC5j4pG9w\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbC5j4pG9w&lt;/a&gt;\nNote that it&amp;#39;s all political decisions that made this possible in Tokyo. Why not make similar decisions in Dublin? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: Note that while there&amp;#39;s some high-rise in the Tokyo mix, a lot of it isn&amp;#39;t. The phrase that really stuck with me from that video is the &amp;quot;go big or no home&amp;quot; (from Vancouver, used for comparison). Go big or no home is exactly what only planning for families instead of individuals gives you. The problems with that I&amp;#39;ve described above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ireland", "name": "t1_dg9ttzv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492236233.0, "created_utc": 1492207433.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65esj2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgan36s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Totallynotapanda", "parent_id": "t1_dg9ntml", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ireland", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Minister Coveney recently put in legislation that allows large planning developments to completely avoid councils and go straight to An Bord Pleanala, so hopefully they'll have a bit of cop on and allow some high-rise developments.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minister Coveney recently put in legislation that allows large planning developments to completely avoid councils and go straight to An Bord Pleanala, so hopefully they&amp;#39;ll have a bit of cop on and allow some high-rise developments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ireland", "name": "t1_dgan36s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492291758.0, "created_utc": 1492262958.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65esj2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65esj2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65esj2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65esj2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65esj2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65esj2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65esj2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65esj2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgam9c4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CaisLaochach", "parent_id": "t1_dgaljnp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ireland", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah.
