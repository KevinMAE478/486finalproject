It was during a five year period of my life where I was working in a job I hated and a glass of wine seemed like a little luxurious thing to do at the end of the day, then it developed in to a habit and grew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say I had a problem with drink rather than being an alcoholic. I went off drink for a couple of years but I&amp;#39;ve been back drinking now for quite a few years but &amp;#39;normal&amp;#39; drinking i.e. a couple of glasses of wine with dinner once in a while and I&amp;#39;m totally happy stopping at that. Personally I developed bad habits and needed to figure out how to relax and enjoy life without alcohol before I could have healthy relationship with alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Definitely go and get some support for your drinking. It&amp;#39;s amazing how much better life can be without drink. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ireland", "name": "t1_dgbxbfa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492369174.0, "created_utc": 1492340374.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kbra", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbxy3x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "collectiveindividual", "parent_id": "t3_65kbra", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ireland", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My uncle was an alcoholic.
