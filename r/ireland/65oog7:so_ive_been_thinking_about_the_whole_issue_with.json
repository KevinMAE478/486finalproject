I&amp;#39;ve spent more time with Bengalis and Jamaicans than &amp;#39;English&amp;#39; people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it would be a great shame if people started gatekeeping what it means to be &amp;#39;Irish&amp;#39;. I make no claim to be &amp;#39;as Irish&amp;#39; as you, but nor are you &amp;#39;as Irish&amp;#39; as me, because I speculate you never had your nan&amp;#39;s window put through because of it or her door kicked down by the police because of it or family friends fitted up and thrown in nick because of it, and the only defence you had was an attempt at a threadbare pride in it. &amp;#39;Irishness&amp;#39; is broad enough for two interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aware I&amp;#39;ve written a lot and a lot of it isn&amp;#39;t even on the statement you made, but my point is this - you can be annoyed at the rubbishing of that good faith but you shouldn&amp;#39;t start gatekeeping it, deciding it should be two g-parents instead of one, writing up little exams to decide who has the brains as well as the blood. I&amp;#39;ve got cousins who wouldn&amp;#39;t pass that exam and they went through everything I wrote above and so all that would divide me and them, pass and fail, is education, and that&amp;#39;s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can all do as you please, but for me, it looks like a slippery slope that ends with Ireland being just another country like any other. Perhaps there&amp;#39;s a want for that, normalisation, and that&amp;#39;s your right, but what has made the Republic unique is that there&amp;#39;s been an idea that Irishness is more than just what&amp;#39;s within the state&amp;#39;s borders, because of NI and because of the diaspora. You&amp;#39;re losing more than you&amp;#39;ll gain because of principle over good faith.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the length of this but it&amp;#39;s an issue I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about for a while, long before Brexit, and I&amp;#39;m aware it&amp;#39;s a little broader than OP&amp;#39;s statement but the issue has further-reaching issues than OP&amp;#39;s statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ireland", "name": "t1_dgclzda", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492407191.0, "created_utc": 1492378391.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oog7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oog7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oog7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oog7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc62hf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "raspberry_smoothie", "parent_id": "t1_dgc5qtl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ireland", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fair enough.
