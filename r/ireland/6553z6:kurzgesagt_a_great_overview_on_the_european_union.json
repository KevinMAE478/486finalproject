I used to view Europe as somewhere foreign and far away that didn&amp;#39;t really affect my life (most people I know use &amp;quot;Europe&amp;quot; to refer to mainland Europe).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of traveling around Europe, made a lot of European friends and participated in EU schemes like the European Voluntary Service. We have a lot in common and can benefit much more by working together. The refugee crisis shows the need for a common policy and how we can&amp;#39;t selfishly act alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s given me a much more positive impression of Europe and made me feel European for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ireland", "name": "t1_dg7jlzn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492119262.0, "created_utc": 1492090462.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 67}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6553z6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6553z6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8bs7e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EDI-Thor", "parent_id": "t1_dg7qvy1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ireland", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Brexiteers and anti-EU would probably say the video is biased, but at least the pitfalls of deeper integration was suggested which is what many anti-EU are concerned about.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brexiteers and anti-EU would probably say the video is biased, but at least the pitfalls of deeper integration was suggested which is what many anti-EU are concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ireland", "name": "t1_dg8bs7e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492150882.0, "created_utc": 1492122082.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7qvy1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rinasoir", "parent_id": "t3_6553z6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ireland", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not gonna lie, I absolutely loved that when they did all the fighter jets they put in one of our old de Havilland Vampires.\n\nOverall an educational video that I feel does a decent job of presenting the information.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not gonna lie, I absolutely loved that when they did all the fighter jets they put in one of our old de Havilland Vampires.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall an educational video that I feel does a decent job of presenting the information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ireland", "name": "t1_dg7qvy1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492127678.0, "created_utc": 1492098878.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6553z6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8w1x9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PortonDownSyndrome", "parent_id": "t3_6553z6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ireland", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It would have been nicer if this had contained more information on the actual workings of the EU.\n\nLots of sizzle, very little steak to that video.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would have been nicer if this had contained more information on the actual workings of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lots of sizzle, very little steak to that video.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ireland", "name": "t1_dg8w1x9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492183205.0, "created_utc": 1492154405.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6553z6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhb9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6553z6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7li8b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Saoi_", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ifpm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ireland", "controversiality": 0, "body": "On the maps?
