They don&amp;#39;t give a shit about drivers wages. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their buses, due to timetable decisions made by management won&amp;#39;t get you to work on time. They run an expressway service between Dublin and Limerick that couldn&amp;#39;t possibly get you to work on time. Meanwhile their competitor runs a service that can get you to work on time which allows them to fill two buses regularly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they faced competition from Dublin Coach, their approach was to scrap half their hourly services and convert them to &amp;quot;Direct&amp;quot; routes to compete. However, they didn&amp;#39;t do it properly, and so stopped still in Nenagh and Portlaoise, thereby making the bus take almost as long as the slow bus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their website is a shit show that requires you to enter your name and details a half dozen times to buy a ticket. Which, until a few years ago, you had to have a paper printout of or you wouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed on a bus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are all decisions made by management. Just a small sample. They had far more influence on my not using their service back when I was commuting by bus than how much their drivers were paid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to mention of course that management negotiated the current overtime regime as a method of having an easy fix to raising core pay. They did so without any regard to forecasting or business needs, but because it was the easier agreement to make. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "ireland", "name": "t1_dg65clx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492044631.0, "created_utc": 1492015831.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg64tb8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "polic293", "parent_id": "t1_dg63h4e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ireland", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hold the phone mate \n\n\nThe reason they can't do anything on expressway is because you're paying drivers 60 fucking k \n\n\nThis has nothing to do with management you can't compete when you have those salary numbers you just can't. \n\n\nSo if your answer is pay them more subsidies to cover private wages that are too high to allow for profitable competivness then my answer to you is fuck right off \n\n\nAlso this isn't about basic.
