New infections of HIV could be close to zero within a decade in the first world&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead the HSE wants to spend a fortune on a drug that the &lt;strong&gt;FDA&lt;/strong&gt; stated:  &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The agency\u2019s own staff, however, had given the product a lukewarm review, saying its effectiveness in improving lung function was small.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/business/orkambi-a-new-cystic-fibrosis-drug-wins-fda-approval.html\"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/business/orkambi-a-new-cystic-fibrosis-drug-wins-fda-approval.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The HSE is buying the shitter inferior drug to save a small amount (kinda like the way they cut corners on HIV treatment).
