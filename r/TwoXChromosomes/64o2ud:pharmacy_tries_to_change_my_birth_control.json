Not a huge deal, as this has happened to me multiple times in the past, but I soon realized after further inspection that not only did they switch the brand manufacturer but gave me an entirely different type of pill; the pill I have always gotten has been 21 days active/7 days inactive pills and the pack I was given had 24 days active/4 days inactive.  I get that this might not be a big deal to some people but I have been taking the 21 active/7 inactive pills for 6 years and am quite comfortable with them, and also really appreciate knowing what day I will be getting my period each month.  I didn\u2019t want to deal with the mental and physical stress that switching over to an entirely different regimen of pills might create, especially with not knowing when to expect my period.  I have pretty high anxiety and the routine and familiarity of my current pill regimen give me peace of mind.  I immediately went back into the pharmacy and told the pharmacist tech that there must have been a mistake and that the pills I had been given had a different number of active pills than I had ever taken in the past.  She calls over a pharmacist who is instantly unpleasant with me and starts insisting that the packet of pills I had been given were the same as the ones I had been prescribed.  I tell her no, I\u2019ve never taken pills with 24 active days, my doctor never would have written a prescription for pills with 24 active days, and I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not comfortable taking these.  She immediately raises her voice with me and gets pretty rude, telling me that some sort of computer program that CVS uses linked up the pill I had been prescribed to this pill brand and that they must be the same.  I stand my ground and tell her that her computer program is wrong and that I\u2019m not taking these pills.  She does some clicking around on her computer, huffing and puffing the whole time, looks back at me and says \u201cwell it\u2019s your responsibility to know that these weren\u2019t the same pills, you should have figured that out before you left the store, I can\u2019t return them.\u201d  Excuse me?  I tell her that I had never had the problem of a pharmacy completely switching out the type of pills I had been prescribed before and that regardless I wasn\u2019t going to take them, so we would need to come up with some sort of solution.  After more heavy sighs and rude looks she finally tells a pharmacist tech to return the pills I had been given and refill the prescription for an actual generic of the pills I had been prescribed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I guess my question is, is the pharmacy allowed to give you a completely different type of birth control pill than the one you have been prescribed?  Was I right to put my foot down in this situation or is this pretty common?  I have just been feeling upset about this all day, especially after being treated like I was an idiot by the pharmacist. I don&amp;#39;t think that the 24 day active pills are inferior or less effective than the 21 day active ones, I am just comfortable with what I have been taking and didn&amp;#39;t want to stress myself out over what I thought was blatantly the pharmacy&amp;#39;s error :/ &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi all, I went to CVS today to pick up my birth control prescription and, as pharmacies are wont to do, realized as soon as I got in my car to check the pills that I had been given a different brand than the one that had been prescribed.

This means that it made it through a whole bunch of steps it shouldn&amp;#39;t have without being noticed. This most certainly should not be a common event. A dispensing error like this should be caught before it leaves the pharmacy, but rarely, it does happen. A pharmacy is an extremely busy place with lots of stuff going on behind the scenes, and the staff is human, and we can and will make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, you were absolutely right to put your foot down. That&amp;#39;s a different medication, with a different amount of hormone&amp;#39;s than your body is accustomed to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only other thing I can think of, is that they called for a refill request and were sent the wrong thing, but that&amp;#39;s unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now curious how they handled the return. Did they let you keep a copy of the receipt for the wrong drug they gave you? You should most certainly file a complaint about this issue, as the pharmacist has some behavior that needs to be modified... &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dg3w9t9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491916322.0, "created_utc": 1491887522.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o2ud", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o2ud", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o2ud", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4hl7v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BuffyStark", "parent_id": "t1_dg46dbc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It probably won't be an issue, but you never know and it is better to check.
