Him getting punished for his crime doesn't undo what he did. Sexual assault is hurtful no matter what. \n\nYour statements reminded me of something Mandi Gray, who was raped, said in a public statement after her attacker was convicted: \"I am tired of people talking to me like I won some sort of rape lottery because the legal system did what it is supposed to do.\" She also talked about her continuing feelings of trauma despite the legal victory. So you are not alone. Anyone who tries to discount your suffering just because people believe you is deluded. Here's the link to an article quoting Mandi Gray's statement:\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marvin-zuker-dispels-myth-of-perfect-rape-victim-in-verdict_us_579612f1e4b02d5d5ed22235", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He assaulted you.
