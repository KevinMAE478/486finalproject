Consider that some women are regular and consistent, while others have variable patterns, even \u201cregularly irregular\u201d patterns. Consider that anovulatory cycles and other conditions often lead to menstrual irregularities that fall outside the normal range. Consider that strenuous exercise and other life events can affect menstruation.

Suffice it to say that about half the published papers support the synchronization hypothesis and half don\u2019t; and the half that do have been harshly criticized for their poor design and poor statistical analyses. So we haven\u2019t reached a consensus, but it\u2019s looking more likely that synchronization is a myth.\n\n**Comparative studies on animals have been negative**\n\n&gt; It was originally thought that other primates and other mammals demonstrated menstrual synchrony due to pheromones, but recent studies have shown that it doesn\u2019t occur in chimpanzees, hamsters, mandrills, or golden tamarins.\n\n**The proposed mechanism (human pheromones) has little to no scientific support**\n\n&gt; In humans, pheromones have been postulated and even sold as sexual attractants. But there is little or no peer-reviewed evidence to suggest that any pheromone influences human behavior. No human pheromones have been identified, and the vomeronasal organ that detects pheromones in other mammals is rudimentary and nonfunctional in humans.\n\nThe first comment on the article, by \"Al Morrison\", summarizes it nicely:\n\n&gt; No agreed upon definition of menstrual synchronization + no plausible mechanism + poor research supporting the hypothesis + split research results + no support from comparative research + a tendency to over report synchronization = MYTH", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems to match up with the conclusion of &lt;a href=\"http://sciencebasedmedicine.org/menstrual-synchrony-do-girls-who-go-together-flow-together/\"&gt;this 2011 article&lt;/a&gt;, which is heavily referenced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That article&amp;#39;s major points include:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synchrony Is difficult to define&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Consider that the normal menstrual cycle can vary from 21 to 35 days and can last 2 to 7 days.
