At my highest weight, I was 117kg (257lb) but over the last six months, I\u2019ve gone down to 65kg (143lb). I gained a lot of weight after finishing high school due to antidepressant treatment, emotional over-eating from instable living situations and an opioid addiction I have since kicked. I feel like I\u2019ve been granted a new lease on life and am so proud of myself for what I\u2019ve accomplished thus far. My goal weight is 55kg (120lb) so I\u2019m very close to finishing and it\u2019s amazing to know I\u2019ve come this far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m writing today because I\u2019ve lost the support of my family and friends for this weight loss. Although I\u2019m generally socially isolated, I\u2019m very close with my best friend and my mom. At the beginning, they were encouraging and complimented the effort I was putting in but as I lost more weight, they began to distance themselves from me. Both of these important figures of my life now tell me I\u2019m too light and need to put weight back on which is the opposite of the truth and what I need to be healthy! My BMI is barely in a healthy range and I\u2019m an average size \u2013 AU 10 so I can\u2019t understand why the support has switched. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My best friend has recently started a diet so I\u2019m helping her through that but when I ask for help, she accuses me of having an eating disorder and tells me I need to put more weight back on. My average weight throughout my teens was 75kg (165lb) so I\u2019m thinking maybe others aren\u2019t used to seeing me at a healthy weight and getting worried because I was always big. I was speaking to my mom recently and she told me that I\u2019d always be big and wanting to get to 55kg was \u2018silly and immature\u2019. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My partner thinks it might be jealousy because both my best friend and mom are overweight given that the support stopped gradually as my weight dropped but it hurts for me to think like that. I have supported and encouraged both my mom and best friend through years of yo-yo dieting and was proud of them when they made achievements so I expect the same from them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In essence, I guess I\u2019m writing to ask you what you think might have caused this shift because it\u2019s affecting my friendship with these women.

I really appreciate this even if we\u2019re internet strangers. You\u2019ve truly brightened my day. This was my first Reddit post so to have such an overwhelmingly positive response is incredible! Thank you again. :)\nI\u2019ve gotten PMs about my height and noticed it as a common theme in the comments. I\u2019m 160cm tall so I\u2019m well below average height plus I have a small frame which is why my goal weight is 120lb! This places me at a BMI of 21 which imo is reasonable and healthy. I apologize for not adding this originally. This was my first ever post and I wrote it before my morning coffee haha!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should give further context into the situation and circumstances surrounding me. I have been under the care of a psychiatric team as an outpatient since May 2016 \u2013 I recovered with their help in June after a hospitalization for a drug overdose. At this point in my life, I was 117kg however dropped to 96kg by August. The entire time I was being monitored by my doctor, weighed regularly and even had regular blood work to make sure all was okay. This weight loss was quick but I believe it may be linked to recovering from opioid addiction. When I was high, I\u2019d crave sugar and overeat- this diet and general metabolic suppression caused me to balloon. When these factors were removed, I lost a lot of weight without trying however was and have been supervised. No worries there! I appreciate the concern for my health though. It\u2019s a fair assumption to think I may have an eating disorder but this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met my partner in August 2016 who supported me in adopting a healthier lifestyle and attitude to life. I consider this point to be my \u2018starting weight\u2019 (for clarity: 96kg). Given that I\u2019m so short, my BMI was 37 at this point. I was incredibly unhealthy and suffered from asthma, sleep apnoea, hypertension etc. Since losing the weight, I only need my inhaler when I\u2019m sick, have a healthy blood pressure and have stopped snoring so this is a definitely a positive, healthy thing for me that I\u2019m excited about! It feels like the world has opened up for me and I can do anything I want to now- weight can\u2019t hold me back now. :)\nI also got the time span wrong because this year has gone by so quickly. It feels like yesterday it was New Years but we are in April. Time has melted together for me for awhile so I\u2019m sorry for any misleading details.

Weight loss can be really hard or relatively easy, and which method works best for you really depends on you personally.   \nOverhauling your whole diet to make it healthy (eating different foods, buying different groceries, starting to cook, changing your portion size and so on all at once) is pretty hard for a lot of people. Instead, try to make smaller changes that you can keep up! \n\nYour main goal is to reduce your calories. There are different ways to do that, and of course you can combine those:\n\n* keep eating the same stuff, but less of it. Exercising portion control does that, and if people do a \"diet\" where they don't eat after 6pm or something like that that also basically accomplishes the same thing. This might work if you do a lot of eating out of boredom or because you do huge portions, and eating slower and drinking more water could help feel full faster. \n\n* replace things with more filling options, so that you're full earlier and don't need to eat any more. Many fast food or takeout food options are very calorie dense - they have a lot of calories but don't fill you for long. Similarly, sugar in general doesn't fill you for long but has a lot of calories. Replacing sweet snacks with fruit (more fiber -&gt; can't eat as much), chips with salted nuts, white bread with whole bread, lots of pasta with more veggies and so on all can help. \n\n* cut out the worst things. With some things, we just don't have self control and can't stop eating it... I know I'm terrible particularly with ice cream, if it's there, I'll eat it, very quickly. So I just don't buy it in the first place. Maybe your weakness is sweets, or salty snacks, or cakes or whatever. Also, cutting out sugary drinks (soft drinks, juice, coffee with sugar,...) and replacing it with water helps a lot. Drinking a lot of water also fills up the stomach, so you're not as hungry. \n\nIf I were you I'd try not to make too huge changes that you can't keep up, so that you don't get overwhelmed. I'd go with drinking more water, no sugary drinks; cutting out all the worst snacks, replacing the worst foods with more filling versions of themselves, and generally having an eye on portion size. That way, you can eat mostly the same things, except for the worst offenders. Also, look out for things we think are healthy but that have lots of calories (juice, too much fruit that aren't filling, snacks that are \"healthy\" but high in calories, and smaller stuff that adds up like milk and sugar in coffee, creamy dressing on salad, sides like fries - stuff like that).   \nAdditionally, for many people it helps to track their calories, for example with myfitnesspal. It allows you to, over some time, get a feel of which foods that are low in calories fill you up and taste good, and which ones leave up hungry. You don't have to go super hungry while losing weight, and you font have to give up everything that's tasty either.   \nAlternatively, you could try keeping a food diary, and write down everything you eat and drink over the course of a few days (really being honest with yourself is important). That way, you get a bit of an overview of what your main problem is - constant snacking? Bad foods in general? Huge portions? That can help you see what the first thing you could work on is. \n\nAgain, I hope you don't mind that I'm kind of barraging you with all this unsolicited advice! I'm sure you'll be able to accomplish your goal :) ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t exactly ask for advice, so I hope you don&amp;#39;t mind but I&amp;#39;m thinking maybe this helps you:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to figure out a way that works well for you.

This might work if you do a lot of eating out of boredom or because you do huge portions, and eating slower and drinking more water could help feel full faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;replace things with more filling options, so that you&amp;#39;re full earlier and don&amp;#39;t need to eat any more. Many fast food or takeout food options are very calorie dense - they have a lot of calories but don&amp;#39;t fill you for long. Similarly, sugar in general doesn&amp;#39;t fill you for long but has a lot of calories. Replacing sweet snacks with fruit (more fiber -&amp;gt; can&amp;#39;t eat as much), chips with salted nuts, white bread with whole bread, lots of pasta with more veggies and so on all can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;cut out the worst things. With some things, we just don&amp;#39;t have self control and can&amp;#39;t stop eating it... I know I&amp;#39;m terrible particularly with ice cream, if it&amp;#39;s there, I&amp;#39;ll eat it, very quickly. So I just don&amp;#39;t buy it in the first place. Maybe your weakness is sweets, or salty snacks, or cakes or whatever. Also, cutting out sugary drinks (soft drinks, juice, coffee with sugar,...) and replacing it with water helps a lot. Drinking a lot of water also fills up the stomach, so you&amp;#39;re not as hungry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were you I&amp;#39;d try not to make too huge changes that you can&amp;#39;t keep up, so that you don&amp;#39;t get overwhelmed. I&amp;#39;d go with drinking more water, no sugary drinks; cutting out all the worst snacks, replacing the worst foods with more filling versions of themselves, and generally having an eye on portion size. That way, you can eat mostly the same things, except for the worst offenders. Also, look out for things we think are healthy but that have lots of calories (juice, too much fruit that aren&amp;#39;t filling, snacks that are &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; but high in calories, and smaller stuff that adds up like milk and sugar in coffee, creamy dressing on salad, sides like fries - stuff like that).&lt;br/&gt;\nAdditionally, for many people it helps to track their calories, for example with myfitnesspal. It allows you to, over some time, get a feel of which foods that are low in calories fill you up and taste good, and which ones leave up hungry. You don&amp;#39;t have to go super hungry while losing weight, and you font have to give up everything that&amp;#39;s tasty either.&lt;br/&gt;\nAlternatively, you could try keeping a food diary, and write down everything you eat and drink over the course of a few days (really being honest with yourself is important). That way, you get a bit of an overview of what your main problem is - constant snacking? Bad foods in general? Huge portions? That can help you see what the first thing you could work on is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I hope you don&amp;#39;t mind that I&amp;#39;m kind of barraging you with all this unsolicited advice! I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll be able to accomplish your goal :) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dgd9f49", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492444231.0, "created_utc": 1492415431.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd3nbg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gon11", "parent_id": "t1_dgd2zcl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hey thank you for replying!

But you asked a question, and I'm going to try to answer it objectively.\n\nFirstly. How tall are you? I only ask because body dysmophia is totally a thing.

Doesn't sound unhealthy to me but you didn't include your height. \n\n*Also: what does your diet look like? You didn't mention that either. I have seen obese people drop weight quickly and none of it was healthy. Eating 900 calories a day, exercise to fatigue, only eating junk food. They're your family and friends. If I was eating like this, I would want to be called out.\n\nOn one hand, you might seem smaller than you think. On the other, your family may be genuinely concerned, jealous, or perhaps something you've done has been off-putting to them. I've had friends who changed their diet, lifestyle, whatever and because VERY pushy about it. I'm sure they thought they were doing the right thing by me, but not everyone wants to hear about your lifestyle change all the time. Also they would passive aggressively insult me if I didn't subscribe to what they were doing, whether it be diet or exercise or something else. Maybe some self reflection is needed?\n\nNow, if it really is something that is uncontrollable by you, like jealousy, then there's nothing more you can do. You obviously love your family and friends, and the best situation for you is to stop talking about dieting around them. Stop helping them diet. Stop making dieting a central factor in your relationship with them. It's about you and your journey, if you want to keep losing, and you're at a healthy place to do it, then you should do it. You can work on yourself without making it about them, and that's ok. Sometimes people are going to disagree with you, but you love them and you make concessions for them. If they disagree with it, treat it like politics at family gatherings. Feel differently in quiet, never bring it up, and have a good time together. \n\nI feel like there's some missing info on what you're eating and your stats. Without it, I can't really see anything from their point of view, only yours.\nNow that all the sterile stuff is over, I just wanted to say I am sorry you feel this way and hope I gave some helpful insight.\n\n\n\n\n______calorie count of OP______\nFirst, I want to say I believe OP is saying her highest weight is the weight \"highest\" during her weightloss journey. Im not sure why people keep saying otherwise, it looks clear to me that's what she means. Until she comes back to clarify, I feel this needs to be read.\n\nCalorie intake of OP as analyzed by msvevo:\n\n\"Heavier people lose weight quicker if their caloric deficit is greater.  So, if you have someone who weighs 600 pounds and is a 5'4\" female and not exercising, they need approximately 3450 calories to maintain that weight.  If she suddenly begins to eat the number of calories she needs to maintain an ideal body weight, she'll consume approximately 1300, less than half of what she was eating before.\n\nKeep in mind that a 600 pound woman has many calories they can shed in a day.  A 250 pound woman will maintain at 1860 (assuming 5'4\"), so they only have 560 calories to shed to be eating at their ideal calorie level.\n\nThere are approximately 3500 calories in a pound. If the 600 pound female eats at a caloric deficit of 2150 per day, at the end of the week, she should lose approximately 4.3 pounds.  The 250 pound woman doesn't even consume 2150 calories to *maintain* in a single day, so she has to starve herself (or further burn off the calories) to see the same kind huge losses.  This also means that as she gets closer to her 125 pound goal, her weight loss will slow.\n\nOf course, all of this assumes \"calories in, calories out\" (aka \"CICO\" - where a calorie is a calorie is a calorie), a stellar metabolism, and no water retention (which can be an issue depending on a woman's menstrual cycle or the medication she's ingesting). \n\nDouble check my math here:\n\nOP lost 114 pounds (399,000 calories) in six months.  \n\n6 months x 30 days per month = 180 days\n\n399,000 calories divided by 180 days = 2217 calorie deficit per day.  It's a severe, and technically achievable deficit in our 600 pound woman, but not so much with a 250 pound woman.  This amount of weight loss is really extreme for a 6 month period, and if it were my friend, I would be very concerned.\"\n\n\nFor an average woman, the absolute bare minimum daily average of calories is 1200 a day. Eating 300-600 calories a day is NOT healthy. I love and am all for positive reinforcement. I run my own weight loss support group and everything. This is not the time for blind positivity.

It&amp;#39;ll take wisdom and acceptance for all involved to keep your current circle active, if they are unable to repeat your success.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My advice is to find some similar friends (perhaps a Facebook group) to get and give support regarding weight loss, and pretend weight and weight loss doesn&amp;#39;t matter at all when around family. Your appearance will unfortunately shout from the rooftops, but at least you can try to soften the blow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I imagine you also worry about their health. Know that the best thing you can do for them is serve as a positive example.  Your words should only say that you love them unconditionally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Congratulations on your weight loss!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dgcmeob", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492407749.0, "created_utc": 1492378949.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rgn6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcq2mu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BijouPyramidette", "parent_id": "t3_65rgn6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think your partner is right.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think your partner is right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dgcq2mu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492412706.0, "created_utc": 1492383906.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
