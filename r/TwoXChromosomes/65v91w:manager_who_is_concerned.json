She may disregard it all initially but if you send her with a go phone with your number preprogrammed she may call you one night because she knows there&amp;#39;s a way out and someone who cares enough to help her on the other line. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just my two cents. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dgdqc1q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476165.0, "created_utc": 1492447365.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v91w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdfvxt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "happilyemployed", "parent_id": "t3_65v91w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "http://www.thehotline.org/help/help-for-friends-and-family/", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.thehotline.org/help/help-for-friends-and-family/\"&gt;http://www.thehotline.org/help/help-for-friends-and-family/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dgdfvxt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492462502.0, "created_utc": 1492433702.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v91w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdomrf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "abbeets", "parent_id": "t3_65v91w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Could you invite someone from a shelter or a counsellor to meet with her while she's at work since that wouldn't raise flags for the abuser?
