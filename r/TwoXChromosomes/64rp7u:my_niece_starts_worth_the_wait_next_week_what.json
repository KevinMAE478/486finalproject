However, it is their job, they have to put food on the table, and the school board approved it--grrr! We had loopholes though to sneak in extra info ;)\n\nSecond, there are a couple good things about the program. 1) it forces boys and girls to hear about both sexes bodies 2) at the same time. So no lying can occur, no myths about body functions, and 3) the free questions at the end were the best times. I'd remind my kids they could ask anything and if it was appropriate (not personal, didn't include names or personal stories) then we could answer it. \n\nIf she's a 6th grader, very little sex will be discussed. Usually, body parts and definitions, puberty, nocturnal emissions, and menstruation. Had a parent get quite mad we defined and explained anal sex. Principal got mad. Had to show him it was part of the program and he shut up. This is a great time to ask about masturbation. Unless a recent edition updated that, it's not really discussed for boys or girls. Orgasms are rarely, if it all discussed. It's spoken more clinically with ejaculation and that's it. Questions about these would be great. Most common questions at this age are: how does a tampon work? Can I get a girl pregnant through oral sex? \n\n7th grade was focused on sex, 8th grade was focused on pregnancy, sexual assault, and legal ramifications of having a child. They never say abortion is wrong, but they don't list it as an option either. I found the most guilt-laden material in 8th grade. It was mostly focused on \"boys, your financial life is ruined if you get a girl pregnant.\" Very little emphasis on him losing out on life to help care for a child. The girls are given sole responsibility -- what will people think of you if you have sex, don't be pressured, your life is ruined by pregnancy. I was very liberal in this section and went off script often. A lot of questions at this age involved the watching and use of porn. If that tells you anything. Also sexual abuse, rape, and what happens during pregnancy if you have sex.\n\nI would tell her to ask questions like we discuss here: discuss birth control access and how it's in jeopardy despite helping millions of women needing it and costing us less. If birth control doesn't work (they like to emphasize how it's never 100% so it's like it's no good)... then what do married people use? \n\nSo again, I wouldn't be looking for questions to get the teacher ... because they might agree with her but is required to say \"discuss that with your parents\" to save their own ass. I would be more about asking questions that get the other kids to think. The questions section was where most non-clinical learning happened.\n\nI kinda rambled. Sorry!

A lot of states mandate this kind of &amp;quot;education&amp;quot; even if the person teaching the class would rather give real info.  My high school sex-ed class (in a VERY conservative town in the South) was surprisingly informative because even though the official curriculum was geared toward abstinence the teacher, who was awesome, made sure that we got lots of additional material about contraception and STIs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to &amp;quot;trip up&amp;quot; the teacher, she may want to focus on making sure she and her classmates have accurate info or ways to get it. Just because the curriculum is focused on abstinence, she can still ask questions about contraception, intimate partner violence and mutually respectful relationships.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this is done through her school, she and her parents should make it known to the administration that they would prefer the school resources to be used on high-quality and accurate education rather than religious propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dg4j1pn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491957978.0, "created_utc": 1491929178.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp7u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp7u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp7u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp7u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rp7u", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg57qbi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "era626", "parent_id": "t1_dg4lg5s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Or honestly even the website link on a little card...smaller and less likely to be caught probably ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or honestly even the website link on a little card...smaller and less likely to be caught probably &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dg57qbi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491987045.0, "created_utc": 1491958245.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4lg5s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "katashscar", "parent_id": "t1_dg4io2p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is a great idea, I'll print out some papers for her!
