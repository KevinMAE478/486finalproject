I always respected his skill and talent. And at least at the outset I thought it was reasonable that, as partners, there would be times when one person would earn more and then another time when the other one would. \n\nWhat eroded my respect for him as an *adult* was his inability to cope with challenge. If something was tough or upsetting, he would avoid it at all costs. That meant that everything stress-inducing either fell to me, or else it would go undone. When I recognized the pattern and protested this, I became another thing in his life that was stress-inducing and to be avoided. \n\nI didn't think less of him as a man, specifically--at least not at the start. But I think what was at the root of the problem was that he thought of *himself* as less of a man in our relationship--pretty much in all circumstances. \n\nIf I did something really well or better than him, he felt lesser in comparison. If I was struggling with something challenging and asked him for help, he was afraid to face it, and that activated his shame and he felt lesser. \n\nIt's bullshit to think that a woman \"emasculates\" a man. \"Emasculation\" is all about what's going on inside the guy's own head, about how he regards himself. As with anything else so shameful and painful, the person having that struggle usually blames someone, anyone else. \n\nSince the divorce, he's put on like 100 lbs and got laid off...he's a total mess. Meanwhile, I've lost 50 lbs and am totally killing it at work. It may well be that he's still blaming me for the disaster that is his life, but I don't have to live with it any more. Blessed freedom!

And at least at the outset I thought it was reasonable that, as partners, there would be times when one person would earn more and then another time when the other one would. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What eroded my respect for him as an &lt;em&gt;adult&lt;/em&gt; was his inability to cope with challenge. If something was tough or upsetting, he would avoid it at all costs. That meant that everything stress-inducing either fell to me, or else it would go undone. When I recognized the pattern and protested this, I became another thing in his life that was stress-inducing and to be avoided. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t think less of him as a man, specifically--at least not at the start. But I think what was at the root of the problem was that he thought of &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt; as less of a man in our relationship--pretty much in all circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I did something really well or better than him, he felt lesser in comparison. If I was struggling with something challenging and asked him for help, he was afraid to face it, and that activated his shame and he felt lesser. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s bullshit to think that a woman &amp;quot;emasculates&amp;quot; a man. &amp;quot;Emasculation&amp;quot; is all about what&amp;#39;s going on inside the guy&amp;#39;s own head, about how he regards himself.
