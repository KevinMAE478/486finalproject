I am just curious for people&amp;#39;s input on this as I was really blown away and hurt by this conversation. Basically, this past weekend I had anal sex for the first time ever with a recent fwb of mine. Everything went well and I really enjoyed it. At one point though, he tried to stick his penis back in my vagina (we weren&amp;#39;t using a condom) and I told him to stop, that we shouldn&amp;#39;t do that. He was so confused why, and I told him it&amp;#39;s not good, and he went and washed off... we never talked about that part, until now...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John&lt;/em&gt;: What&amp;#39;s up cutie pie  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt;: Hi :) just trying to make it through the day... how are you doing  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John&lt;/em&gt;: Work work work  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt;: Would you by chance be able to do tonight at your place?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John&lt;/em&gt;: Possibly... just depends on how long my evening appt takes   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt;: I gotcha   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt;: Would love a repeat of last time ;)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John&lt;/em&gt;: Mmmmmm I&amp;#39;d like that  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John&lt;/em&gt;: But it&amp;#39;s tough for me to not go back and forth between ass and pussy.

It&amp;#39;s not a preference, it&amp;#39;s a matter of health. Doing that can cause gross bacterial infections. I&amp;#39;m sorry but I am unwilling to risk it.
