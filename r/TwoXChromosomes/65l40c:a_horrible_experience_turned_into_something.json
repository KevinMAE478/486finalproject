Well, a sophomore of mine (who I have a good relationship with) thought it would be funny to prank me by bringing in some deer teeth from a skull he found )I live in a rural area in Idaho) and sprinkle then on my desk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While on a normal week I probably could have handled the situation, this week I was already high strung and it triggered a panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had panic attacks before, and I know how to best handle them for me- which includes walking away from the situation and keeping moving until I regulate my breathing and calm down. This panic attack also had the added joy of uncontrolled sobbing and another class walking past me in the hallway while I was trying to calm down. Super awkward and embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The happy part:\nMy neighbor teacher walked by, recognized what was going on.
