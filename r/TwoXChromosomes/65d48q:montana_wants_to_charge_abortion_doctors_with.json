I saw this on /r/prochoice a while ago.  Here's a copy from my comment on /r/Montana (an underrated subreddit, I should mention).  This is from a few weeks ago, but I don't think the material in question has changed in that time.\n\nBy the way, I'm an ob/gyn.\n\nhttp://leg.mt.gov/bills/2017/sb0299/SB0282_1.pdf\n\nIt's Senate Bill 282 (SB282), which I couldn't find in any of the articles about it.\n\nI have problems with a lot of the new language, like its tendency to say \"unborn person.\"  But looking past the precedent its choice of words sets, here is what it does:\n\n1. Make abortions illegal after 24 weeks in Montana.  I'm not going to fight Montana on that one.  24 weeks is the federal limit on how early an abortion can be illegal, and Montana wants to be a conservative state.  Take it up with the federal government.\n\n2. Make it so that after 24 weeks a parent and medical team can't decide to withdraw care in the event of a preterm birth.  This one I'm also kind of okay with.  If you came in to labor and delivery and delivered at 32 weeks, you could not ask us to withdraw care.  Our pediatricians would take care of the preterm baby.  No objection.\n\n3. But wait, it also redefines \"viable\" as after 24 weeks, editing out the old definition of \"able to survive outside of the [uterus].\"  That means that it requires doctors to provide futile care for neonates born after 24 weeks with conditions incompatible with life, like renal agenesis.\n\n4. It defines gestational age as the time elapsed since the last menstrual period.  This is a necessary line, because you need to differentiate gestational age from fertilization age, the time elapsed since fertilization.  In the Ideal Woman, this is two weeks.  Because many people have a different time between LMP and ovulation, if our first ultrasound shows a very different size of the embryo or fetus, we redate -- we generate a new date based on the estimated time since fertilization based on size, and then add two weeks because gestational age based on LMPs is standard.\n\n5. It states that, if a pregnant person after viability (which, remember, is now 24 weeks after your last menstrual period, regardless of how your fetus is) has a condition that poses an \"immediate, serious risk of death or irreversible impairment of a major bodily function,\" the doctor *shall* induce delivery or deliver by cesarean.  I can't have a law that says I *shall* do a procedure -- only that I shall *offer* a procedure.\n\n---\n\nFor each of those, you might say, \"well, if it ever went to trial the courts would use common sense.\"  Maybe.  But put yourself in the physician's shoes.  It wouldn't be weird to have a situation that bridged some of these details.  Why should you have this risk on your mind?\n\nThe language of the law seems designed to evoke a botched abortion at 25 weeks resulting in a live-born neonate and a heartless abortionist leaving it to die in a steel pan somewhere.  Except for one D.C. madman, that doesn't happen.  Especially not in Montana, where there are no abortion providers after 24 weeks.\n\n---\n\nSo here's how this law could affect you if you (or your patient) were pregnant:\n\n- Prior to 24 weeks with a regular menstrual/ovulatory cycle: no effect.\n\n- Prior to 24 weeks but your period is irregular: if your dating had to be corrected, this law contains no mechanism to allow for your new dating to be used.\n\n- After 24 weeks with a devastating fetal anomaly: you cannot choose to provide comfort care only.\n\n- After 24 weeks with a health condition and your doctor recommends preterm delivery at this time but you wish to decline preterm delivery due to the risks of extreme prematurity, i.e., you would rather risk death or permanent disability to get your baby one more week of gestation: there's no mechanism here by which a doctor can compel you to submit to induction or cesarean, but your doctor would be at risk of getting sued if something bad happened, because they did not induce you when this law says that they should.\n\n- After 24 weeks, desiring a termination: doesn't matter, Montana doesn't have providers for after 24 weeks anyway.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey!

But I mean ... sigh, it is a big issue when you're trading a viable life for someone's psychological welfare - at that point it has nothing to do with a change in anything else for the mother.\n\nTo boot, past 24 weeks is already federally illegal.\n\nUnwanted pregnancies should never *get* to this point.  This should be a high interest for the state, because letting it get to this point causes a much bigger amount of damage - you're forced at that point to make the decision, instead of just being able to give up a fleshy seed that won't be conscious, viable, important or anything for another few weeks - and to boot, you're risking all of the complications that come with pregnancy, when medicine offers many options for this mother to not have to deal with any of them.
