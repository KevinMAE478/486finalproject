Rape and ethnic cleansing accusations in Myanmar are almost always \"he said, she said\" (ethnic minorities vs. government/soldier).

The woman, who lives next door to my current room and is applying for asylumship in the US, used to work for UN for many years as an admin/logistic person. She (herself being an ethnic minority, Shan) visited Rakkhine and knows the conflicts of interest in NGOs and the complicated situation there. She never faced abuse or anything, but in her application for asylumship, she has to make stuff up.\n\nAll in all, please keep in mind that different levels of self-interest are at play here. The vocal minorities are hoping to get support from the international community and to achieve that, they could also be fabricating stories. The INGOs are also interested in funding and the only way to keep money flowing is sometimes exaggerating the situation there. I'm not defending soldiers or the government btw.\n\nFinally, the whole conflict arose 4-5 years ago when a group of supposedly-Rohingyas raped a local Rakkhine girl and murdered her. That created conflict and it kept going since. The locals (Rakkhines, who are also ethnic minority themselves) believe that what-they-are-calling-themselves-Rohingyas are migrants from Bangladesh. Keep in mind that Bangladesh has 157m people (over populated) and the borders between Myanmar nad Bangladesh is porous at best. Worse, the Rohingyas speaks a [dialect of Chittagong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_language), which is a Bangladeshi language. I'm sure some of them have lived near the border for quite some time, and may have migrated back and forth between Bangladesh and Myanmar.
