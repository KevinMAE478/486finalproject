People make up all kinds of BS excuses to refuse housing to people who aren't bad tenants, and this makes it harder to get away with it. \n\nFor instance, say I'm a landlord showing a property to a gay african american couple, but I'm a racist prick. Now, I know I can't refuse them housing because of their race, since that would be illegal. However, most states still allow people to refuse housing to people because they're gay. Bingo! I just tell them I don't rent to gays, and since that's not illegal, I can get away with it.  \n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it makes more sense since domestic violence victims are a discernible group of people, whereas &amp;#39;people who call the cops&amp;#39; are not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned in another comment, this seems more about closing a loophole, which I think is a good idea.
