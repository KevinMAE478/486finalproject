If he does, then the situation is getting scarily close to slavery. And nobody asked men to take responsibility for women anyway. Heck, the woman in the original article was *trying* to escape from the whole system and look at what happened to her.\n\n&gt; Men are generally the breadwinners, but if a women spends from her own wealth, she makes the decision, as is rightly so.\n\nNo, it's abundantly clear that \"they\" refers to men alone (at least in this translation and all other translations I've seen.) \"They\" is the plural subject pronoun, so it's a placeholder for the subject of the sentence, which is in this case, \"men\" (I can explain why this is, if you want.) So, rewriting your quote with the subject pronoun replaced by the subject:\n\n\"Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what [men] spend [for maintenance] from their wealth.\"\n\nA lot clearer now, right? The thing is, this sentence never was ambiguous. \"They\" has clear usage rules, it's just a lot of people don't know them (another good one is the difference between who and whom.) I know you'll just say that it's an imperfect translation, but this is consistent across pretty much every translation I've seen. Patterns don't lie.\n\nI'll admit I'm lax with grammar, but if we're arguing over an important and carefully translated text, then it becomes important.\n\nI'm not sure why you brought 4:32 up to be honest. I have read a translation of the Quran in it's entirety, and I reread this entire surah before I initially replied to you. I have read before and after.\n\n&gt; There is only ambiguity due to translation where this problem doesn't occur in Arabic\n\nAs I've said earlier, the sentence is actually *relatively* unambiguous (when it comes to pronoun usage, at least.) Whether it's a reflection of what it says in Arabic is another question entirely. However, as I said before, this pattern is repeated in pretty much every other translation I've read, which is a pretty strong indicator that it is an accurate reflection.\n\nEnglish is actually more versatile than what a lot of people give it credit for. You can convey meaning unambiguously in most cases, but the problem is the language is so irregular it's difficult to remember a lot of the subtleties associated with it (speaking of object/subject pronouns, \"it\" actually fills the role of both, which I found interesting.) A lot of the time you'll have to be pretty long winded and speak in an odd way to get your point across clearly too, which a lot of people don't like.\n\n&gt; Whilst women must be obedient to their wives, men must also be righteous to their wives.\n\nI assume you mean \"Whilst women must be obedient to their husbands\", no? I don't picture as the type to support same sex marriage.\n\nBack to the point, what you said doesn't jive with me at all. What if a husband gave his wife a \"righteous\" command, but she didn't want to do it? I don't think any one person should be in the business of commanding someone else to do *anything.* (before you bring up the police, a police officer isn't acting as an individual, but rather as a representative of the government.) We'll have to disagree here.\n\n&gt; I completely disagree, Islam is not responsible for the abuses that humans make others suffer. They are the one's who have twisted its meaning\n\nRight, well, the Quran told these men in the article that they are the guardian of the woman. I don't think it's particularly twisty for them to come to the conclusion that as a guardian, they should force this woman to go back to Saudi Arabia because it's in her best interest (which I have no doubt that they genuinely believe.)\n\n&gt; Jews\n\n...okay\n\nI think I'll skip ahead.\n\n&gt; Where in the Qu'ran does it state you can forcibly remove women against their will?\n\nMaybe the part where it says that women should be devoutly obedient. She was disobedient, so they made her obey. You think they were being unrighteous so their authority is null and void, but it seems like they (and the Saudi government, judging by their lack of action) seem to disagree with you.\n\n&gt; You took one quote, completely ignored it's meaning, making your own fabricated presumptions than saying that is what it justifies.\n\n...not really. The quote is abundantly clear that women should obey men (you say the men have to be righteous - but *exactly* what actions are \"righteous\" is up for debate. I can guess at their justification - probably something along the lines of protecting her from sinning because Australia is filled with debauchery (which is true, I've been there :P))\n\n&gt; You did do what I asked, but poorly at that may I say.\n\nI disagree. I think I found a quote from the Quran that could reasonably be used to justify their behaviour.\n\n&gt; However I must thank you for being far more amicable than me\n\nNo problem.\n\n&gt; You may not expect obedience, but it is desired between you two is it not? \n\nNot really. If she did what I said all the time then she wouldn't be the person I love. I expect her to disagree sometimes.\n\n&gt; If your partner says 'hey, can you heat up the kettle,' you don't say 'no I shall not obey you,' you'd say 'sure sweety' or whatever.\n\nI guess, but there's a difference between doing something that someone asks you to do and being generally obedient to that person. When you say that you should be obedient to someone else in general, then you're saying that you basically should be submissive to them. I am not submissive to my girlfriend. She is not submissive to me.\n\n&gt; vexation\n\nNice word.\n\n&gt; What moral law when followed by everyone would cause the extinction of the human race?\n\nWhat? I'm advocating for someone to be able to freely express their love to someone, whether they be the same sex or opposite sex. That's... not the same as forcing everyone to bone exclusively with someone of the same sex. I'm not saying \"men should only love men\" or \"women should only love women.\" I'm saying \"everyone should love who they love.\"\n\n&gt; I have a gay friend\n\nDoes he know you feel this way? Because if so, then I'm surprised he's still your friend tbh...\n\n&gt; Children have an innate inclination towards their biological mother\n\n\\[citation needed\\]\n\n&gt; This not only causes problems for the mother, but the child also, how many children born from surrogate mothers spend their lives finding there real biological parents, why is that?\n\nI think you should talk with more adopted kids. They almost universally consider their adoptive parents their \"real\" parents, and usually only seek out their biological parents out of curiosity.\n\n&gt; Furthermore, you'll never have a child which is from both of you\n\nI think IVG is actually pretty close, so I'd be careful when you say \"never\".\n\n&gt; I can continue but to be honest I don't have a problem with those who are gay\n\nAwesome!\n\n&gt; I react to gays the same way I react to spiders, I don't mind them, but if I saw on in the bath I'd scream.\n\nOh, apparently not then.\n\nAs an aside, I think it's interesting how you only talked about children. Gay couples who don't want kids also exist, and they're equally illegal in Saudi Arabia.\n\n&gt; We respect the laws of your country, why can't you respect the laws of our country when they don't submit to yours?\n\nBecause the laws of your country violate internationally agreed upon human rights, and cause undue suffering in a very large number of people. That's why.\n\n&gt; But if you think things are dandy, just take a look at the sheer number of crimes and corruption going on.\n\nMy country has a relatively low crime rate, and [according to this website](https://www.transparency.org/country/NZL) is the least corrupt country on the planet.\n\nI'm gonna have to apologize, my government funded amphetamemes have pretty much run out for tonight and it's late, so my tone has shifted.

Thank you at least you did quote the full verse, however I must say that is a basic literary requirement. \n\n\"Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. \"\n\nMen are responsible for women '...what they spend for maintenance from their wealth.' If a man is paying and providing for his wife, then yes I don't think it is unfair he has responsibility and takes authority in some matters, as the reverse is true as it states 'what Allah has given one over the other.' If it is from their 'wealth,' they take responsibility and authority.  \n\nWealth can refer to the man or women's wealth, that is why it states 'what *they* spend' and 'from *their* wealth.'\nThe words 'they' and 'their' are quite important, it is not singular or exclusive. Men are generally the breadwinners, but if a women spends from her own wealth, she makes the decision, as is rightly so. So what do you think 'they' and 'their' mean in the context of that sentence? \n\nThis is what I mean about reading before and after;\n\n4:32\n\n\"And do not wish for that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of his bounty. Indeed Allah is ever, of all things, Knowing.\"\n\nThere is only ambiguity due to translation where this problem doesn't occur in Arabic, hence why translations are never 100% correct. However I think it's too easy a cop-out to accuse someone of not knowing the Qu'ran because they don't know Arabic, but as a person who understands literary works and translations, this is not an unfair point is it? As translations are plagued with mistakes, hence why the Qu'ran was strictly only allowed to be in Arabic, whilst translations are authorized, they are not considered canonical unlike Bible translations. \n\nWhilst women must be obedient to their wives, men must also be righteous to their wives. If a man is righteous to his wife, the problem of autonomy wouldn't occur, because righteous men don't control their wives as righteous women don't disobey a good husband. \n\nYou don't simply obey because they are your husband, you only obey on the condition they are righteous towards you and treat you with kindness as it states in the Qu'ran. If a husband is righteous towards his wife, it is unfair for her to disobey, unless of course the demand itself was unreasonable which wouldn't be righteous of him the first place which would give her the right to disobey since he has disobeyed the conditions for treating his wife properly. \n\nI completely disagree, Islam is not responsible for the abuses that humans make others suffer. They are the one's who have twisted its meaning, and the Qu'ran warns so many times of hypocrites who use religion to serve their own ends. It even discusses it in this very chapter with the Jews. \n\n4:46\n\n\"Among the Jews are those who distort words from their [proper] usages and say, \"We hear and disobey\" and \"Hear but be not heard\" and \"Ra'ina,\" twisting their tongues and defaming the religion. And if they had said [instead], \"We hear and obey\" and \"Wait for us [to understand],\" it would have been better for them and more suitable. But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, except for a few.\"\n\n4:47\n\n\"O you who were given the Scripture, believe in what We have sent down [to Muhammad], confirming that which is with you, before We obliterate faces and turn them toward their backs or curse them as We cursed the sabbath-breakers. And ever is the decree of Allah accomplished.\"\n\nThose who break the laws of God but pretend they follow, is that the fault of the Qu'ran or human fallibility? The guardianship thing you mentioned, the Qu'ran wouldn't justify that behavior whatsoever, where does it? You're making quite a leap. Where in the Qu'ran does it state you can forcibly remove women against their will? You took one quote, completely ignored it's meaning, making your own fabricated presumptions than saying that is what it justifies. Doesn't wash with me. \nBe honest, reading that Surah, 3:34, does that give you the clear impression men are justified to forcibly remove women against their will when the men themselves are not righteous which is why she most certainly left in the first place? \n\nYou did do what I asked, but poorly at that may I say. However I must thank you for being far more amicable than me which I must say doesn't bode well for me but all this ignorance is starting to grate on me. \n\nYou may not expect obedience, but it is desired between you two is it not? If your partner says 'hey, can you heat up the kettle,' you don't say 'no I shall not obey you,' you'd say 'sure sweety' or whatever. Obedience to good people goes both ways and is not a bad thing. \n\nI feel comparing one's relationship to others is an exercise in vexation. \n\nNo, when did I say you deserve to die? Actually, I have a few;\n\n1) I believe a moral law should be applicable to everyone. Homosexuality does not permit this. What moral law when followed by everyone would cause the extinction of the human race? Now you can call that stupid because we both know in reality that'll never be the case, but philosophically and biologically, is that not a valid point? \n2) Procreation - Issues with surrogacy and such. I have a gay friend, him and his partner are having a surrogate mother, whom one will donate the sperm, for the fetus to gestate to which she'll hand over the baby after birth. I find this wrong. Children have an innate inclination towards their biological mother and I believe it is the right of every child to know their biological parents, however reality doesn't always afford that most basic right. This not only causes problems for the mother, but the child also, how many children born from surrogate mothers spend their lives finding there real biological parents, why is that? Furthermore, you'll never have a child which is from both of you, one partner has to take precedent because that is what biology permits, this also causes problems. Basically, it's opening a can of worms. \n\nI can continue but to be honest I don't have a problem with those who are gay, I react to gays the same way I react to spiders, I don't mind them, but if I saw on in the bath I'd scream. We respect the laws of your country, why can't you respect the laws of our country when they don't submit to yours? And I use the word 'submit' specifically because that is what it is.

", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed there are 3-4 verses those who criticize Islam use extremely often, they just google &amp;#39;bad things about Islam&amp;#39; and all use the same sources. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not fixated on anything, I merely addressed it, if you&amp;#39;d like to me to address other points, I shall, I haven&amp;#39;t shied away from anything. Thank you at least you did quote the full verse, however I must say that is a basic literary requirement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men are responsible for women &amp;#39;...what they spend for maintenance from their wealth.&amp;#39; If a man is paying and providing for his wife, then yes I don&amp;#39;t think it is unfair he has responsibility and takes authority in some matters, as the reverse is true as it states &amp;#39;what Allah has given one over the other.&amp;#39; If it is from their &amp;#39;wealth,&amp;#39; they take responsibility and authority.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wealth can refer to the man or women&amp;#39;s wealth, that is why it states &amp;#39;what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; spend&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;from &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; wealth.&amp;#39;\nThe words &amp;#39;they&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;their&amp;#39; are quite important, it is not singular or exclusive. Men are generally the breadwinners, but if a women spends from her own wealth, she makes the decision, as is rightly so. So what do you think &amp;#39;they&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;their&amp;#39; mean in the context of that sentence? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what I mean about reading before and after;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4:32&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And do not wish for that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of his bounty. Indeed Allah is ever, of all things, Knowing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is only ambiguity due to translation where this problem doesn&amp;#39;t occur in Arabic, hence why translations are never 100% correct. However I think it&amp;#39;s too easy a cop-out to accuse someone of not knowing the Qu&amp;#39;ran because they don&amp;#39;t know Arabic, but as a person who understands literary works and translations, this is not an unfair point is it? As translations are plagued with mistakes, hence why the Qu&amp;#39;ran was strictly only allowed to be in Arabic, whilst translations are authorized, they are not considered canonical unlike Bible translations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst women must be obedient to their wives, men must also be righteous to their wives. If a man is righteous to his wife, the problem of autonomy wouldn&amp;#39;t occur, because righteous men don&amp;#39;t control their wives as righteous women don&amp;#39;t disobey a good husband. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t simply obey because they are your husband, you only obey on the condition they are righteous towards you and treat you with kindness as it states in the Qu&amp;#39;ran. If a husband is righteous towards his wife, it is unfair for her to disobey, unless of course the demand itself was unreasonable which wouldn&amp;#39;t be righteous of him the first place which would give her the right to disobey since he has disobeyed the conditions for treating his wife properly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I completely disagree, Islam is not responsible for the abuses that humans make others suffer. They are the one&amp;#39;s who have twisted its meaning, and the Qu&amp;#39;ran warns so many times of hypocrites who use religion to serve their own ends. It even discusses it in this very chapter with the Jews. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4:46&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Among the Jews are those who distort words from their [proper] usages and say, &amp;quot;We hear and disobey&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Hear but be not heard&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ra&amp;#39;ina,&amp;quot; twisting their tongues and defaming the religion. And if they had said [instead], &amp;quot;We hear and obey&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Wait for us [to understand],&amp;quot; it would have been better for them and more suitable. But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, except for a few.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4:47&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;O you who were given the Scripture, believe in what We have sent down [to Muhammad], confirming that which is with you, before We obliterate faces and turn them toward their backs or curse them as We cursed the sabbath-breakers. And ever is the decree of Allah accomplished.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those who break the laws of God but pretend they follow, is that the fault of the Qu&amp;#39;ran or human fallibility? The guardianship thing you mentioned, the Qu&amp;#39;ran wouldn&amp;#39;t justify that behavior whatsoever, where does it? You&amp;#39;re making quite a leap. Where in the Qu&amp;#39;ran does it state you can forcibly remove women against their will? You took one quote, completely ignored it&amp;#39;s meaning, making your own fabricated presumptions than saying that is what it justifies. Doesn&amp;#39;t wash with me. \nBe honest, reading that Surah, 3:34, does that give you the clear impression men are justified to forcibly remove women against their will when the men themselves are not righteous which is why she most certainly left in the first place? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You did do what I asked, but poorly at that may I say. However I must thank you for being far more amicable than me which I must say doesn&amp;#39;t bode well for me but all this ignorance is starting to grate on me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may not expect obedience, but it is desired between you two is it not? If your partner says &amp;#39;hey, can you heat up the kettle,&amp;#39; you don&amp;#39;t say &amp;#39;no I shall not obey you,&amp;#39; you&amp;#39;d say &amp;#39;sure sweety&amp;#39; or whatever. Obedience to good people goes both ways and is not a bad thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel comparing one&amp;#39;s relationship to others is an exercise in vexation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, when did I say you deserve to die? Actually, I have a few;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) I believe a moral law should be applicable to everyone. Homosexuality does not permit this. What moral law when followed by everyone would cause the extinction of the human race? Now you can call that stupid because we both know in reality that&amp;#39;ll never be the case, but philosophically and biologically, is that not a valid point? \n2) Procreation - Issues with surrogacy and such. I have a gay friend, him and his partner are having a surrogate mother, whom one will donate the sperm, for the fetus to gestate to which she&amp;#39;ll hand over the baby after birth. I find this wrong. Children have an innate inclination towards their biological mother and I believe it is the right of every child to know their biological parents, however reality doesn&amp;#39;t always afford that most basic right. This not only causes problems for the mother, but the child also, how many children born from surrogate mothers spend their lives finding there real biological parents, why is that? Furthermore, you&amp;#39;ll never have a child which is from both of you, one partner has to take precedent because that is what biology permits, this also causes problems. Basically, it&amp;#39;s opening a can of worms. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can continue but to be honest I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with those who are gay, I react to gays the same way I react to spiders, I don&amp;#39;t mind them, but if I saw on in the bath I&amp;#39;d scream. We respect the laws of your country, why can&amp;#39;t you respect the laws of our country when they don&amp;#39;t submit to yours? And I use the word &amp;#39;submit&amp;#39; specifically because that is what it is. We won&amp;#39;t submit to your laws anymore than you should submit to ours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for being bad in other respects, I don&amp;#39;t think I need to get into that and I find a slug match of lauding morality over one another and which society is better a fruitless exercise.

I quoted the whole thing so you wouldn't accuse me of quote mining.\n\nAnyway, I think it's fairly clear that the first sentence is a statement that men are the protectors and guardians of women. This translation uses the phrase \"in charge\", although I believe they've taken \"charge\" to mean responsibility rather than authority. So, basically, women are men's responsibility. Given that, \"by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other\" is *probably* a reference to men being more athletic and physically stronger than women on average (although I stomp most guys at basketball lmao.) So, basically, men are the protectors of women because Allah has given (or \"bestowed\") them more physical ability, so they're more suited to a protector role.\n\nI believe wealth refers to a man's wealth. When the Quran was written, a higher proportion of jobs were physically taxing, so in general men had more earning power then women because there were more job opportunities for them. Therefore, men would share their earned wealth with women, because they are supposed to be the guardians of women or something.

I believe you could interpret the use of \"obedience\" to have a double meaning. One, a righteous woman is obedient to her husband, and two, a righteous woman is obedient to Allah.\n\nYou seem to agree with the former, since you said\n\n&gt; Yes women should be obedient to their husbands\n\nI disagree. I believe people should have autonomy. I don't think you should have to obey someone simply because they're your husband.
