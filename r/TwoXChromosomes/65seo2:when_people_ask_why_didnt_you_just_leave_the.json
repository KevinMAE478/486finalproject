She'll need to digest it on her own, but reinforce she had support and people who love her.

When people are critical of the relationship she takes it as criticism of her, and then he's there telling her \"see they don't love you like I do\" or \"they think you are stupid too\". Support, support, support and an explication of what behaviors abusive partners use to manipulate the people who love them. Always give her an out to come to you where she know she won't be told \"I told you so\" or \"you are stupid/ dumb for being with him\". She needs to know that isn't what love is, and when the people you love are just as mean and critical in trying to get you away from the person who is abusive it's very confusing because you think it's ok for people who love you to treat you without respect. It's ok for people who love you to be mean and critical of you and make you feel stupid for making bad (immature) choices. Loving someone isn't a bad choice. He's the one in the wrong. It's ok for her to be sad that he sucks, but now she has to empower herself to protect herself, and she'll never be able to do that if she doesn't have examples of what real, healthy love looks like. You can't just do what everyone else tells you to make them happy in order to feel like you are loved. She needs to know you want her of this bad relationship so she can be happy, healthy, and respected.

Maybe print out an article about it, and how abusers manipulate their victims into thinking the conflict is the victim&amp;#39;s fault. Then the abuser starts acting like perfect angels to pull the victim back in. I would just show it to her, and let her take it in without criticizing him/ their relationship directly. She&amp;#39;ll need to digest it on her own, but reinforce she had support and people who love her. I&amp;#39;m sure she is blaming herself for a lot of the problems in the relationship because that&amp;#39;s how abusers gaslight &amp;amp; blame their victims.  When people are critical of the relationship she takes it as criticism of her, and then he&amp;#39;s there telling her &amp;quot;see they don&amp;#39;t love you like I do&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;they think you are stupid too&amp;quot;. Support, support, support and an explication of what behaviors abusive partners use to manipulate the people who love them.

She needs to know that isn&amp;#39;t what love is, and when the people you love are just as mean and critical in trying to get you away from the person who is abusive it&amp;#39;s very confusing because you think it&amp;#39;s ok for people who love you to treat you without respect. It&amp;#39;s ok for people who love you to be mean and critical of you and make you feel stupid for making bad (immature) choices. Loving someone isn&amp;#39;t a bad choice. He&amp;#39;s the one in the wrong. It&amp;#39;s ok for her to be sad that he sucks, but now she has to empower herself to protect herself, and she&amp;#39;ll never be able to do that if she doesn&amp;#39;t have examples of what real, healthy love looks like.
