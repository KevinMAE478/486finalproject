As you said, the clitoris is sensitive tissue, and it's there for pleasure. The urethra is a small hole beneath the clitoris and above the vagina. It connects through your urinary tract to your kidneys. \n\nYour vagina is the large opening beneath that. Your vagina is a muscular canal that leads directly to your uterus. the border between your uterus and vagina is called the cervix. \n\nThe top side of your uterus has two openings, connected to something called fallopian tubes. Those lead to your ovaries, which produce eggs.\n\nEvery month, your uterus goes through a cycle where it prepares for a potential baby. It coats itself in thick, bloody tissue for a fertilized egg to attach to. \n\nOnce a month, your ovaries should produce an egg or two. Those eggs travel down the fallopian tubes towards the uterus. If it gets fertilized (which can happen when a man ejaculates in, or sometimes even around your vagina) the egg will attach to your uterus. You won't get a period for 9 months, because the baby is growing inside your uterus. When it's time for birth, the baby gets pushed out of the uterus through the vagina.\n\nIf no egg gets fertilized, it keeps on heading out. Your uterus will also get rid of the bloody tissue that isn't needed, and your period happens. Rinse and repeat, every month.\n\nIt's important that you make sure to take good care of your vagina. It's a self-cleaning organ. You know the discharge that drips out during the day? That's the vagina cleaning itself. You don't need to wash inside it, just use a gentle soap around the outside of your labia and clitoris while you shower. When you go to the bathroom, wipe front to back instead of the other way. Otherwise, bacteria from your anus can contaminate your vagina or urinary tract, causing painful infections. \n\nIf you're sexually active, always use protection. While most of the time, a man would need to come inside you to get you pregnant, sperm can swim. Even if he comes outside of you, a drop of sperm near the entrance to your vagina can swim up and potentially get you pregnant. \n\nTypes of valid protection include condoms, birth control pills, and IUDs. You should go to a planned parenthood to see which type is right for you. They can also tell you how everything works in more detail. \n\nKeep in mind, only condoms can help protect from STDs. STDs are certain kinds of viruses and bacteria that can live in the genital region of men and women. They spread through unprotected sexual contact. They can cause sores, blisters, cancer, painful swelling, and in the case of HIV, can kill you by destroying your immune system. You really don't want to get an STD. But if you do have one, many can be treated. So see your doctor if you have any unexplained itching, rashes, bumps, sores, or pain down there.\n\n\nYour breasts are a bit simpler. They are made of fat tissue, and have milk glands. The milk glands start to become active during pregnancy, so that you will produce enough milk to feed your baby once it's born.
