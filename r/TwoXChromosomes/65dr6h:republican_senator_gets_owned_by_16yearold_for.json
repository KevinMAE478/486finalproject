Yes I noticed girls in the 6th grade. Girls noticed me back then as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jodi was really good looking and nice. Abagail was also good looking and nice. Same for many other girls at the time. Matt and Bob were good looking guys. Same with many other guys around me. Guess what Matt and Abagail decided to do? Guess what happened 9 months later? So Matt, Abagail and their parents decided on a few major life decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me? I was an awkward nerd that played DnD way back before it was cool to be an awkward nerd. Jessica was also an awkward nerd that played DnD. I&amp;#39;m sure Jessica and I could have done more than roll dice and swing our battle-axe at an orc but we chose not to. To us it was mindboggling that Matt and Abagail would make the decisions they did rather than choose something else. Back then it was considered very selfish to have sex due to what parents (grandparents of the baby) would have to do in order to make sure things worked out in the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Way back up through the early 1990&amp;#39;s if somebody made a decision it was for the most part on that person to reap any rewards or deal with the consequences of that decision. This goes way beyond simply having sex. Today if somebody makes a bad decision it&amp;#39;s expected that society as a whole will pick up the slack and soften the blow of that bad decision.
