Thanks for posting.  I have been a nail biter/cuticle picker all my life.  I have gotten better about my nails (I still bite though), but my cuticles are terrible.  Like others, I deal with anxiety, but I feel like it's not a huge detriment to my life.  Still, it would be nice to find a way to stop doing it.  It's definitely a stress reliever for me.
