Even if you had outright cancer, if your doctor couldn't actually see/measure a tumor, you're in good shape.\n\nLook at your thumb - it's probably a little less than 2 inches long. Any tumor less than 1.6 inches is still stage Ia or less which has a 93% 5 year survival rate. That rate includes everyone who was diagnosed regardless of the type of treatment. That's pretty friggin' high so well done!\n\nJust for clarification, a Pap test detects mutative cervical cells and is almost always indicative of an HPV infection. On occasion, another STI may make the Pap more difficult but if you have actual mutative cervical cells, that's HPV.\n\nA pregnancy would not cause your cervical cells to mutate, for instance.\n\nOne last thing, your doctor was pretty specific when s/he said \"squamous lesion\". That's odd. If s/he is right, be sure to avoid tobacco use since it is a risk factor. Still, it's odd that s/he was that specific after just a physical exam - non microscope.\n\nThere are a few different types but only 2 that are worth mentioning. One is squamous and the other is adenocarcinoma. Squamous is the most common but adenocarcinoma is on the rise. I don't think you can tell the difference without a microscope.
