People perceive a situation quite differently. I'll give you an example. I was with a girl in my car after a first date. We were listening to music and things escalated to us making out(she started it). We get in the back seat and I started touching her all over and asked \"are you good?\"(asking for consent) she said \"yes\" quite happily. So she ends up going giving me a blowjob. 10 minutes in she says \"wow you take a long time\". Another 5 minutes go by and she says \"don't you have to get home?\" Since I had told her I had plans after but I was willing to be late for the sake of getting off and I tell her \"it's fine\". Another minute goes by and she says \"You think someone could see us in here?\"(we were parked in the parking lot of the restaurant we just had dinner in and yeah it was possible someone could see it but as if I would let that stop us cause really, the fuck does it matter if someone sees?) I tell her \"well it hasn't been a problem yet\"(it really hasn't). Another minute goes by and then she says \"its hot\" and I say \"yeah it is\"(in hindsight, the first time I should have reasonably seen something was up). Another 5 minutes go by and finally she says \"it's really hot can we stop?\" and I tell her \"you're almost there, don't give me blue balls okay?\" she gets back to sucking without saying a word(now she had a choice here right? I asked her to and she continued. I did have this really stupid idea that she was trying to purposefully give me blue balls as to keep me on some leash so I come crawling back to her which I realize now was dumb as fuck. Still, as far as I was concerned here, I had asked and she agreed). Another minute goes by and she finally says \"Can we stop please?\" I say \"Yeah sure\" in a really disappointed tone and then she stops for a few seconds and then keeps going. I end up cumming in her mouth she swallows and we talk for a little bit but she isn't that responsive. So I take the hint and start bringing her home. I asked her \"have you done this a lot with guys on the first date?\" She says \"a few times but only with guys I really like\" and I say \"wow you really like a lot of guys huh?\". She puts her head down at that(I understand now that was a dick thing to say, but honestly I'm more into girls who wouldn't do stuff like that on the first date so I had already established in my head she wasn't girlfriend material. I think this statement has to do with the accusations later). Anyway after I bring her home I text her about how I enjoyed the time with her with a winky face. She outright ignores that and texts back \"I never got your last name! (Excited emoji)\" And that seemed a little weird to me so I ask \"why? lol\" and she says \"just curious\" so I give her a fake last name since I didn't plan on this going anywhere and that seemed suspicious as fuck. So she ends up ignoring my texts the next few days. I finally tell her \"it's rude as fuck to ignore someone for days, if you don't want to see each other again step up and say it\" she responds back with \"a women should never be forced to do anything she doesn't want to\"(I thought this was weird as fuck as if she was implying something but moved on from it). Fast forward through the conversation where I'm just trying to get a reason and she isn't giving one so I end up just calling her a whore who I didn't want anything serious with anyway. She goes on to tell me she went to the police that night claiming rape gave my name and they asked if she wanted to press charges, but she said she wasn't planning on it, but since I was \"being an asshole\" she decided she was going to. I ask her what the fuck she was talking about. She says she said no many times, but I didn't care. I tell her bullshit, she could have stopped anytime I literally never forced her and I asked consent at the start. She says she wanted to stop but I didn't care. In the end I tell her have fun trying to get those charges through since I didn't fucking rape her. Anyway, in my perception she was willingly doing it the whole time since I had never physically forced her and while she (kind of) protested, she still did it willingly. I don't think fucking asking her to do it and then her doing it is rape but I'm sure some would think otherwise. Also moral of the story, don't give a girl your real last name until you know she isn't crazy. The worst part about it was apparently she wasn't going to press charges until I insulted her. Like what the fuck? So yeah, different perceptions and all. The \"victim\" isn't always right despite what seems to be popular belief.

She puts her head down at that(I understand now that was a dick thing to say, but honestly I&amp;#39;m more into girls who wouldn&amp;#39;t do stuff like that on the first date so I had already established in my head she wasn&amp;#39;t girlfriend material. I think this statement has to do with the accusations later). Anyway after I bring her home I text her about how I enjoyed the time with her with a winky face. She outright ignores that and texts back &amp;quot;I never got your last name! (Excited emoji)&amp;quot; And that seemed a little weird to me so I ask &amp;quot;why? lol&amp;quot; and she says &amp;quot;just curious&amp;quot; so I give her a fake last name since I didn&amp;#39;t plan on this going anywhere and that seemed suspicious as fuck. So she ends up ignoring my texts the next few days. I finally tell her &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s rude as fuck to ignore someone for days, if you don&amp;#39;t want to see each other again step up and say it&amp;quot; she responds back with &amp;quot;a women should never be forced to do anything she doesn&amp;#39;t want to&amp;quot;(I thought this was weird as fuck as if she was implying something but moved on from it). Fast forward through the conversation where I&amp;#39;m just trying to get a reason and she isn&amp;#39;t giving one so I end up just calling her a whore who I didn&amp;#39;t want anything serious with anyway. She goes on to tell me she went to the police that night claiming rape gave my name and they asked if she wanted to press charges, but she said she wasn&amp;#39;t planning on it, but since I was &amp;quot;being an asshole&amp;quot; she decided she was going to. I ask her what the fuck she was talking about. She says she said no many times, but I didn&amp;#39;t care. I tell her bullshit, she could have stopped anytime I literally never forced her and I asked consent at the start. She says she wanted to stop but I didn&amp;#39;t care. In the end I tell her have fun trying to get those charges through since I didn&amp;#39;t fucking rape her. Anyway, in my perception she was willingly doing it the whole time since I had never physically forced her and while she (kind of) protested, she still did it willingly. I don&amp;#39;t think fucking asking her to do it and then her doing it is rape but I&amp;#39;m sure some would think otherwise. Also moral of the story, don&amp;#39;t give a girl your real last name until you know she isn&amp;#39;t crazy. The worst part about it was apparently she wasn&amp;#39;t going to press charges until I insulted her. Like what the fuck? So yeah, different perceptions and all. The &amp;quot;victim&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t always right despite what seems to be popular belief. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dg5mfx0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492012718.0, "created_utc": 1491983918.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vv02", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5g0vs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Daikuroshi", "parent_id": "t3_64vv02", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 1, "body": "What you're describing is so ridiculously wrong I don't see how your friend could explain it away.
