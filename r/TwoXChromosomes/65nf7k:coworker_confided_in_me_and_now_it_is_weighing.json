Later she confided in me and told me that when she got home from having a drink (one drink and swore she wasn&amp;#39;t drunk...not that it matters) that her husband forced himself on her. She stated they had been having issues and she was out with her mother and sister and he possibly had issues with her spending time with her family and not him. Either way she never said rape. She said when it happened she was visibly crying and holding her vagina so he couldn&amp;#39;t get to it and said no and once screamed no. She wasn&amp;#39;t crying when she told me and was avoiding making overly dramatic statements (possibly minimizing the seriousness of the situation?). I am a blunt person. I think I blinked a few times then told her that I think that is called rape. I am also a rational person and realize that victimization is a real thing. I don&amp;#39;t throw the rape word around lightly, but a duck is a duck right?! I asked her if she was ok and if she needed anything and suggested she talk to someone. I checked on her a couple of times in the day. She seemed ok. Should I have done more? Should I do something? Should I say something? She didn&amp;#39;t want to call it rape. Should I leave it alone?
