Berry dishes make good snacks, maybe yoghurt and stawberries if you can handle it. If you need the protein and calories there is Ahi Poke which is high in both, no prep work, and super filling. All kinds of other fish dishes. Lots of options!     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: shrimp is technically a shellfish.&lt;br/&gt;\nDouble edit: can you eat white rice, just not brown?     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Triple edit: what kind of breads can you eat? You said MOST grains, so maybe there are some? Slap any of the reheated ledt over oily and fatty meats on a roll and you have an amazing meal/hangover cure. Only you can drink so stick with just the meal I guess.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quadruple edit: lots of cool stuff with ginger too, namely seasoning for meats, and a good soup stock when combined with meat!
