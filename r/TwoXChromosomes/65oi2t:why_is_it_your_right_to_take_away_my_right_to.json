You are forcing a woman to endure all the risks and discomforts of pregnancy and then forcing her to literally risk her life and experience excruciating pain REGARDLESS of whether she chooses to raise the child. It isn&amp;#39;t just about convenience. Do you know how hard it is to comfort a woman in labour? Have you ever tried to comfort a woman in labour who was pregnant against their own will? Sometimes you tear from vagina to asshole. Childbirth basically always involves one or multiple people&amp;#39;s fingers and hands in a woman&amp;#39;s vagina. Sorry to freak out the pregnant people of this world but I&amp;#39;m not exaggerating. Imagine forcing someone to go through that against their will. To me it would be comparable to rape. I&amp;#39;ve had to care for a young girl whose mother wouldn&amp;#39;t let her get an abortion. It wasn&amp;#39;t fucking pleasant. I&amp;#39;d like to never do it again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dgcsinp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492416033.0, "created_utc": 1492387233.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 37}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oi2t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oi2t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oi2t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65oi2t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd9nf0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dack_Blick", "parent_id": "t1_dgcwvyf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah, I see.

I don't agree that this is an argument with enough weight to prohibit abortion. However, it's ridiculous to sit here and pretend that it's an issue of absolutely no consequence, and to act like *nobody* could *ever* think of defending the baby over the woman in this scenario. There's a very real moral dilemma to consider, and it's totally understandable why someone would side with the baby.\n\nIn my eyes, the alternative argument isn't \"Stop talking about god, and stop trying to coerce me to bear children.\" Most Republicans have done neither--they're coercing you to not kill something, and they're talking about the basic natural rights which form the foundation of all functioning democratic societies on this planet.\n\nThe argument that I agree with is two parts. The first part is simply the idea that, given two decisions of roughly equal moral weight, we should favor the party that possesses consciousness and independence *now* over the party that will require years to develop them. Essentially, the mother's life and autonomy are worth more than the child's. It's a bit cold, but I think it's the most reasonable solution.\n\nThe second half of it comes from practicality. First off, it's impossible to completely prevent unwanted pregnancies, and there's no way to differentiate pregnancies that people attempted to protect against from those they did not. A woman could use birth control, and the guy could use a condom, and there's a chance she can still get pregnant.\n\nThe only true way to guard against pregnancy is to abstain from sex, which people won't do. It's impractical to build policy around expecting people to behave in ways that they don't.\n\nAnd finally, despite all that, if a woman wants an abortion then she'll get one. If we make them illegal, the abortions just become orders of magnitude more dangerous. It's impractical.\n\nThe solution, in my mind, is for the government to leave the decision up to the woman. It's not a pretty decision, and I certainly think it should be a decision that women take very seriously, but at the end of the day there's too much going on that's dependent on the situation for anyone but the woman to be making the final call.\n\nAs far as the government is concerned, it seems like the most *moral* support they can provide is to prevent unwanted pregnancies to begin with. Pro-abortion and pro-choice is always going to be a decision between two shitty options. The government should spend less time deciding which shitty decision is the least shitty, and instead should just prevent that decision from ever having to be made. That means more effective sex education and a better distribution of contraceptives to demographics that struggle with unwanted pregnancies.\n\nBut no part of that argument involves me hand-waving away a very legitimate position. Nobody will ever make progress on these issues if we keep making shit up about those that don't share our beliefs--Republicans aren't evil, they just place different moral weights on the life of the baby and the woman.
