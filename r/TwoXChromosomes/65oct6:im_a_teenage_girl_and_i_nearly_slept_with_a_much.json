Self esteem comes from things you *do,* not from how other people view you, especially not from them viewing you as a sex object.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad you decided not to go through with it, and I&amp;#39;m sorry you&amp;#39;re feeling worthless. We live in a society that tells girls and women all the time that our worth comes from how sexually desirable we are, so it&amp;#39;s easy to believe it. But remember that it&amp;#39;s not true. Sex and relationships are great, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong. But your worth is not derived from how many men want you, or how much they want you. Your worth is derived from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re going to improve your self esteem, you have to focus on &lt;em&gt;you.&lt;/em&gt; Not what other people think of you, not how other people feel about you, how you really are. Put work into being a good person. Put work into improving at the things you like to do. Ultimately, you&amp;#39;ll never get real self esteem from having a guy find you sexy. You&amp;#39;ll get self esteem from knowing you did a kickass job at your soccer game, or that you aced a difficult test, or that you nailed your piano recital.
