Most of the time this is straightforward (e.g. broken bone - put a cast on it) but there are occasions where it is not straightforward. Examples might include:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a woman who has a family history of breast cancer but wants a double mastectomy despite the minimal survival improvement over yearly surveillance &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the patient in a coma with miniscule chance of recovery whose family want them kept on life support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the patient who has had a stroke because of (unsuccessful) IVF treatment but who wants to try again despite the risks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All these scenarios present the doctor with an ethical dilemma of what is in the patient&amp;#39;s best interests. They have to decide and act accordingly and it is not always clear cut and it is not always what the patient wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dgc07n4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492376810.0, "created_utc": 1492348010.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbt35w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "j917f874", "parent_id": "t1_dgbqvsl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Them being a doctor....", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Them being a doctor....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dgbt35w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492355502.0, "created_utc": 1492326702.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbqvsl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Master_Builder", "parent_id": "t1_dgbielf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What on gods green earth makes you think a doctor has to treat someone?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What on gods green earth makes you think a doctor has to treat someone?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dgbqvsl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492350164.0, "created_utc": 1492321364.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l358", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbze5y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lootot", "parent_id": "t1_dgbielf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Doctors are not normal service providers. \n\nThere is a series of ethics they have to comply with and they can't just do whatever they feel like or whatever the patient asks for.
