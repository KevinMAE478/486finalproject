Last night me and my brother were looking for someone around our age to talk to during the later parts of the evening, we&amp;#39;d watched the champions league match earlier and enjoyed maybe 3 or 4 small beers during the match so I was a little tipsy at most. As we go along the beach we don&amp;#39;t really seem to find anything or anyone so we&amp;#39;re thinking about heading back towards the hotel and calling it a night, but just as we&amp;#39;re right by we hear someone shouting at us, naturally as we were looking for socializing we stopped and it was a local guy in his 20s who was going to a local club nearby. A little skeptical at first we discuss it together but agree on joining him as it could be exciting at the least, so together with him (was actually just a nice guy) we walk along the beach for maybe 20 minutes before we go into some alleys and arrive at a really local run down place which maybe has around 50 locals in it and we&amp;#39;re the only &amp;quot;white&amp;quot; there so naturally we stick out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we hang out there, dance a little bit and talk to the people there, generally having a good time. After maybe 2-3 small beers I go for another round (note I&amp;#39;m a pretty social guy so I&amp;#39;m very used to drinking and I was not drunk at all at this point) and after ordering my beer I foolishly turn my back to my drink as I&amp;#39;m talking to the other guys at the bar. Can&amp;#39;t remember really when I finished my drink but after a little while I suddenly just felt extremely intoxicated, this is where I should&amp;#39;ve grabbed my brother and went out but foolishly I thought maybe I was just drunk or something, so I find my brother and he&amp;#39;s dancing with some local (gorgeous) girl so I start dancing in close proximity not really talking to him, can&amp;#39;t really remember 100% what happened next but suddenly some girl maybe twice my age starts dancing with me and shortly thereafter grabs my dick like literally sticks her hand in my boxer and starts semi jerking me off, me not at all at my full self don&amp;#39;t really understand most of it and I&amp;#39;m letting it happen for a short amount of time until she leads me outside dragging me along basically, drops my pants and starts blowing me. Next thing I now she drops her pants and starts fucking my basically half limp dick, it goes on for maybe 30 seconds before I manage to get away from it and she starts nagging me for money, I respond that a) I don&amp;#39;t have any more money on me and that b) I never wanted this but my words are extremely slouched. I go back inside and find my brother and tell him I want to leave and we leave shortly after. I tell him I got a blowjob and he tells me not to worry, and I don&amp;#39;t really feel like telling him everything so we go to bed. When I wake up I feel absolutely horrible and defeated and tell him about the whole ordeal and he almost starts crying as we&amp;#39;re afraid I might&amp;#39;ve gotten HIV, my watch is of course also stolen (at least the girl got her money :/) but that&amp;#39;s the least of my worries, we go meet my father and tell him about it and he starts getting stressed out aswell. Do a check with the doctor (although it&amp;#39;s too early to find anything in your blood) and it comes out negative, but we tell him that we need to get PEP which was something I found online which could potentially stop the disease if taken early enough and hopefully we&amp;#39;ll get it tomorrow. So the entire day my brother is super worried while I try to stay strong not really managing to look anyone in the eye but seeming pretty alright with the whole thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In reality I&amp;#39;ve been on the verge of a collapse all day, incredibly afraid I might&amp;#39;ve gotten hiv or something else and just feeling stupid and angry at myself. Never really thought about worrying about my drink as I&amp;#39;m usually not in risk of that, but I should&amp;#39;ve understood how vulnerable I was in that situation. I don&amp;#39;t really know if I was raped or not but the general feeling is horrible and I don&amp;#39;t know how to bounce back from this at the moment. Don&amp;#39;t really care that much for responses but at least if someone reads it feels maybe a little bit better. Currently laying in bed in the hotel room after passing out at 23:00 but waken up at 3 by my father who was locked out of his room somehow so his key card wouldn&amp;#39;t work. I have no idea how I&amp;#39;m gonna fall asleep now, it&amp;#39;s 5 in the morning, have a doctors appointment at 10 and I just can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about all the potential consequences and the general horrible feeling I have. Don&amp;#39;t really blame anyone but myself as I can see the situations of the other parties involved but it feels really bad as I generally look at myself as a really kind guy and this really destroyed me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for formatting, bad language and wall of text as I&amp;#39;m pretty tired psychologically and I&amp;#39;m typing this on my phone..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello, this might not be the right place to type this nor the right time but I'm pretty down right now and I believe at least this is the one place where people might've been put in a similar situation before.\n\n\nSo to start it off I'll tell a little bit about the context of what happened yesterday, I'm a male, 20 yrs old from Norway who's currently on a much needed vacation in Zanzibar, I'm here with my family and in general we have enjoyed ourselves.
