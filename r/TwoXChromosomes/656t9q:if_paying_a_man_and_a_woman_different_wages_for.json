If a woman asks a man to reveal the closely held wage and salary secret she is asking for access to his soul; and very few men will give that up to a woman.  If a man asks another man for that secret he is agreeing to be part of the team, a trust relationship between the two males is formed.  This is a male thing, which unfortunately makes almost no sense at all, unless the tribe surviving the next couple of hours has any place in society at this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women have to be ready to discuss their work value in finite monetary terms before accepting the offer, because the man will not reveal the secret wage range or salary.  And pricing yourself to the workplace is probably the hardest thing you can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;a href=\"http://www.glassdoor.com\"&gt;http://www.glassdoor.com&lt;/a&gt; for some insights in how to go about guessing what your potential employer thinks of your pay range for your potential job.  Know before the offer, indeed during the interview so you can set a standard for that offer.  Its the only way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dga88ak", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492256113.0, "created_utc": 1492227313.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656t9q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc07u4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "markrusmark", "parent_id": "t3_656t9q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No wage gap, you get the same if you do as good, no but for real talk take action or fuck off and get paid less", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No wage gap, you get the same if you do as good, no but for real talk take action or fuck off and get paid less&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dgc07u4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492376821.0, "created_utc": 1492348021.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
