In my humble opinion, sex work keeps being a controversy not because of the work or the workers but because of how people talk about - or rather don't talk about - the customers and clients.\n\nSex work isn't the classic exchange of goods in the sense of \"here is my money, now give me the thing.\" Sex work is a service, and I dare say that people largely understand that. Nonetheless, it's an exchange that involves money, and with that exchange of money comes a sense of entitlement.\n\nIn my chat, I as an operator was given the power to set my own boundaries. If a client asked for something that I was not comfortable with, I refused: \"I\"m not comfortable with this. How about we do zyx instead?\"\n\nThis usually went one or the other way:\n\n1.  \"Sure! I'd like to do xyz.\" / \"What about abc, is that okay for you?\"\n\n1. \"But I pay for this!\" / \"Why are you working here then?!\" (Add a slur or two.)\n\nI don't have to tell you which answer is the better one. In my experience, the way people view sex work and sex workers makes all the difference. If you realize - and remind yourself, even in the face of disappointment - that you are interacting with a human being with their own boundaries, desires, personality, and so forth, you will naturally reply with 1.\n\nIf sex work is seen as a commodity or service detached from the person offering and performing it, the answer is likely to be 2. People feel entitled to what they demand, because that's how it works, right? Someone offers a thing, and if you want that thing, you can get that thing with money. Sex work, however, is not a thing. I like to call it a shared experience instead.\n\nOftentimes, I see people comparing sex work to other services - like therapy, going to a hairdresser, or whatever else you can think of. I feel like these comparisons actually are more harmful than helpful when it comes to talking about sex work. Nobody thinks twice about having their hair cut or working as a hairdresser in terms of taboos and morale. Therapy is already trickier, with stigmas about mental heatlh. But sex? And sex work? Hoo boy.\n\nSex work deserves its own narrative, and in my opinion, this narrative cannot be one-sided. By that I mean that discussing endlessly about sex workers will lead to nothing if we do not start to talk about those who seek out the services of sex workers. This naturally includes the topic of how sex is seen by society as a whole and all its ugly taboos, stigmas, and misconceptions.\n\nWe should be beyond the point of endlessly stating how sex work is perfectly fine if it's the worker's own, free choice, no pressure or strings attached. That is a given, as the author of the article has rightfully pointed out. Everything else should be unacceptable by default.\n\nInstead, those consumers who feel entitled to step over another person's boundaries because of money deserve a long hard look, because it's them who make a sex worker's experience shitty. Why do they feel so entitled, why do they refuse to see a sex worker as a person, and not as a commodity? And - how do we change that?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The writer makes such an important point with this article.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have worked as a virtual sex worker, meaning in a text-based sex chat. In my humble opinion, sex work keeps being a controversy not because of the work or the workers but because of how people talk about - or rather don&amp;#39;t talk about - the customers and clients.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sex work isn&amp;#39;t the classic exchange of goods in the sense of &amp;quot;here is my money, now give me the thing.&amp;quot; Sex work is a service, and I dare say that people largely understand that. Nonetheless, it&amp;#39;s an exchange that involves money, and with that exchange of money comes a sense of entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my chat, I as an operator was given the power to set my own boundaries. If a client asked for something that I was not comfortable with, I refused: &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;m not comfortable with this. How about we do zyx instead?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This usually went one or the other way:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure! I&amp;#39;d like to do xyz.&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;What about abc, is that okay for you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I pay for this!&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;Why are you working here then?!&amp;quot; (Add a slur or two.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have to tell you which answer is the better one. In my experience, the way people view sex work and sex workers makes all the difference. If you realize - and remind yourself, even in the face of disappointment - that you are interacting with a human being with their own boundaries, desires, personality, and so forth, you will naturally reply with 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If sex work is seen as a commodity or service detached from the person offering and performing it, the answer is likely to be 2. People feel entitled to what they demand, because that&amp;#39;s how it works, right? Someone offers a thing, and if you want that thing, you can get that thing with money. Sex work, however, is not a thing. I like to call it a shared experience instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, I see people comparing sex work to other services - like therapy, going to a hairdresser, or whatever else you can think of. I feel like these comparisons actually are more harmful than helpful when it comes to talking about sex work. Nobody thinks twice about having their hair cut or working as a hairdresser in terms of taboos and morale. Therapy is already trickier, with stigmas about mental heatlh. But sex? And sex work? Hoo boy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sex work deserves its own narrative, and in my opinion, this narrative cannot be one-sided. By that I mean that discussing endlessly about sex workers will lead to nothing if we do not start to talk about those who seek out the services of sex workers. This naturally includes the topic of how sex is seen by society as a whole and all its ugly taboos, stigmas, and misconceptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We should be beyond the point of endlessly stating how sex work is perfectly fine if it&amp;#39;s the worker&amp;#39;s own, free choice, no pressure or strings attached. That is a given, as the author of the article has rightfully pointed out. Everything else should be unacceptable by default.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, those consumers who feel entitled to step over another person&amp;#39;s boundaries because of money deserve a long hard look, because it&amp;#39;s them who make a sex worker&amp;#39;s experience shitty. Why do they feel so entitled, why do they refuse to see a sex worker as a person, and not as a commodity? And - how do we change that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dg902uw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492195864.0, "created_utc": 1492167064.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 91}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658wx5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658wx5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658wx5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658wx5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658wx5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg97vec", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Paranoidexboyfriend", "parent_id": "t1_dg96i5x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "well since she did it in college, i think 'i was focusing on school' is a better explanation.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;well since she did it in college, i think &amp;#39;i was focusing on school&amp;#39; is a better explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dg97vec", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492210034.0, "created_utc": 1492181234.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg96i5x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tehallie", "parent_id": "t1_dg8xcwq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's either that, or explaining an employment gap, which can be equally as awkward and/or disqualifying on a resume.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s either that, or explaining an employment gap, which can be equally as awkward and/or disqualifying on a resume.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dg96i5x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492208238.0, "created_utc": 1492179438.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658wx5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgap2dp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lordperiwinkle", "parent_id": "t1_dg8xcwq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A friend long ago, became a stripper then moved onto lap dancing, bjs, full on prostitution as a dominatrix.

There is no leader, there is no prophet, no devine answer or \"manifest\" or scripture of \"the feminism\" and no one single \"wave\" or stream, but a bunch of waves and streams. \n\n\nFeminism is a range of academical, ideological, political and social movements those are adressing womens rights on several instances. Which means that can be a \"bigger\" picture of the role of women within the world, within a society, within a certain culture, within a religion, within a work space and so on and on and on.\n\nHowever you might or might not like it!\n\nThe role of women and rights of women are socially more complicated than just a \"let everyone do what they want\". In order to achieve for example, a progress in one topic, people might think you have to sacrifice on others to reach an overall greater and more neutral good or goal. Or that you support with actions an old system that keeps to support for example an old view, stereotype or whatever (could be anything).\n\nIn any(!) topics, no matter which, you will find different views on how to deal with this problems and different answers of how and why they developed such views, who did, why they think that is reasonable, what they base their knowledge on. \n\nI can really only recommend to grab academical books regarding different topics and to read about the all in all connections of actions, social roles, language, sexuality, religion, social status, work and so on (more to get an overview).\n\nSo yeah, do some \"feminist\" think that women should be restricted to work in fields those socially put them in a position that socially \"serves\" desires of men and is \"valued\" with negative implications of the value of a woman? Yes, certainly. (If sexual work would be a prestige kind of work that is socially in place for respected people, they would not fight it, in most cases, because the position of the woman within that one society would be different to sexuality and work, in relation).\n\n\nAre they \"not real feminist\"? I am sorry, but they are \"real feminists\", just like the ones who think that individual choices of a woman should stand above all, just like the ones who will say it has a negative impact, but we should try to change world views on sexuality, instead of changing choices of work.\n\nIt should be also considered that a lot of people seem to talk about those topics without having ever bothered to educate themselves about them, yes also people who call themselves \"feminist\" and people who try to oppose it because \"some person on huffingtonpost/facebook said\". So yes, they can indeed claim things, those they claim because \"they\" think it is right, not because they have actually anything to back it up with as a view, besides \"their view\". Some people also confuse misandrism that can also be a stream in feminism, with \"just being a regular feminist in all streams\", without pointing out the specific branch. It is not just a black and white. And yes, women are also sexist towards men and women, rude and whatever. Just because someone thinks of themselves \"I am a feminist\", that alone does not mean anything. It does not say anything about their attitude, if they actually respect women or men, how they look at sexuality, how polite they are, how educated they are, how sexist they are or how and why they display or demonstrate power.\n\nSo here, in this article, a lot of factors are simply mixed together to make the impression \"all those factors are feminism for you, therefore it is representing feminism in general, but you are not a true feminist\". There is also a flow in feminism where women think of themselves of an \"exclusive\" closed group with own rules of dominance and power, as sisters and not all of them are nice cute \"women power\" images of feminists, no. But since it is can also be connected to ideologies, there are also gonna be those people, because they can choose to be radicals, fashists and so on, can happen, just like someone would choose a liberal ideology to represent feminism within a certain frame. Some people are also religious, so they bring religious values into the play and so on.\n\nAlso the word misogyny (puuh really, people need to stop using words randomly in a random context...). Misogyny deals with the position of women within a concept, based on the relation of access to power and status in comparison from men to women. Sexual work is not just freedom of expression of an individual, it is also imbedded in a social concept. Now the general concept could be empowering for women. Like I said, we could live in a society that thinks sexuality is respected and women being sexually active is the biggest expression of sexual freedom and also respected (like it for example is for men often). But since the work is connected to the general view on women and their different roles and relationships to social norms, women are often not respected I am sorry to break it to everyone. \n\nThere is a reason why sexuality is still a taboo, there is a reason why both, men and women can hardly publicly mention that they are \"sexual workers\" or work related and being as proud of it like anyone else who has a job. And there is a reason why there are derogerative words for the sexual expression and freedon of other women and why socially people think \"less\" of their worth and value because of that choice. \n\nTherefore it is reasonable if some people with a certain view on social sexism point out \"this line of - whatever specific work - serves in particular, this kind of social stigma and role of women those primarely serve and please men but in return get little social aknowledgement for it or because of it, instead it is used to reduce them to their looks, to respect and value the individual less\" and so on and on. That is indeed misagynistic and a valid point (because the overall social structure we have at the moment, is). \n\nThis is just a superficial try to explain it, but I really hope this whole \"you are not a real...\" attitude ends and that people instead adress the specifics of a topic.\n\nYou do not agree to a certain interpretation and so on? First try out to find out why people define it like that. Then find counter arguments to explain on which parts the argument might be true, but also on which it might be wrong or do harm or should be also considered and have a public discourse about it. Just pointing at people and to say \"you are not a true... Because you do not follow my interpretation of how I think it should be, even thou there are no rules and leaders\", is absurd.", "edited": 1492155649.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is in fact not true.

It does not say anything about their attitude, if they actually respect women or men, how they look at sexuality, how polite they are, how educated they are, how sexist they are or how and why they display or demonstrate power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here, in this article, a lot of factors are simply mixed together to make the impression &amp;quot;all those factors are feminism for you, therefore it is representing feminism in general, but you are not a true feminist&amp;quot;. There is also a flow in feminism where women think of themselves of an &amp;quot;exclusive&amp;quot; closed group with own rules of dominance and power, as sisters and not all of them are nice cute &amp;quot;women power&amp;quot; images of feminists, no. But since it is can also be connected to ideologies, there are also gonna be those people, because they can choose to be radicals, fashists and so on, can happen, just like someone would choose a liberal ideology to represent feminism within a certain frame. Some people are also religious, so they bring religious values into the play and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the word misogyny (puuh really, people need to stop using words randomly in a random context...). Misogyny deals with the position of women within a concept, based on the relation of access to power and status in comparison from men to women. Sexual work is not just freedom of expression of an individual, it is also imbedded in a social concept. Now the general concept could be empowering for women. Like I said, we could live in a society that thinks sexuality is respected and women being sexually active is the biggest expression of sexual freedom and also respected (like it for example is for men often). But since the work is connected to the general view on women and their different roles and relationships to social norms, women are often not respected I am sorry to break it to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a reason why sexuality is still a taboo, there is a reason why both, men and women can hardly publicly mention that they are &amp;quot;sexual workers&amp;quot; or work related and being as proud of it like anyone else who has a job. And there is a reason why there are derogerative words for the sexual expression and freedon of other women and why socially people think &amp;quot;less&amp;quot; of their worth and value because of that choice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore it is reasonable if some people with a certain view on social sexism point out &amp;quot;this line of - whatever specific work - serves in particular, this kind of social stigma and role of women those primarely serve and please men but in return get little social aknowledgement for it or because of it, instead it is used to reduce them to their looks, to respect and value the individual less&amp;quot; and so on and on. That is indeed misagynistic and a valid point (because the overall social structure we have at the moment, is). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is just a superficial try to explain it, but I really hope this whole &amp;quot;you are not a real...&amp;quot; attitude ends and that people instead adress the specifics of a topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You do not agree to a certain interpretation and so on? First try out to find out why people define it like that. Then find counter arguments to explain on which parts the argument might be true, but also on which it might be wrong or do harm or should be also considered and have a public discourse about it. Just pointing at people and to say &amp;quot;you are not a true... Because you do not follow my interpretation of how I think it should be, even thou there are no rules and leaders&amp;quot;, is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "name": "t1_dg8vgk2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492181619.0, "created_utc": 1492152819.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658wx5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9dvqr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "deviladvokate", "parent_id": "t3_658wx5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think the reason this gets people to feel uncomfortable or prejudiced is just the rampant amount of abuse historically and around the world in \"sex trade\" and exploitation of women and children of both genders that ...
