Chop some cold avocado and finish it with coarse salt and ground black pepper.\n\nHISTORY BEHIND\n\nI decided to do a small write-up about why I'm making my recipe this way and not the other way.\n\nPre-salting and pre-mixing. Pre-salting is adressed in [this article](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/04/does-pre-salting-eggs-make-them-tough.html). Pre-salting isn't used in the food industry, because for breakfast service you break big batch of eggs and sieve them because nobody ain't got time to do it for every table. If you pre-salt this big batch hours in advance, eggs will get darker, so you salt them directly on the pan. However pre-salting eggs a couple of minutes in advance has no negative effects. I also tried both pre-mixed and untouched eggs for my scramble. In this recipe I add eggs to already pre-heated pan. In non-mixed eggs I get some amount of egg whites that sets before I start stirring it, and I don't like unmixed egg-whites in my egg scramble. I'm not a food scientist, but I guess if you don't go full retard on your eggs and beat them up until they start to foam you don't actually change their structure.\n\nAdded liquids. I tried three different batches of eggs: one with two tablespoons of butter, one with two tablespoons of milk and one with nothing at all. Butter eggs were most rich and tender, milk eggs I didn't like at all becuase they were too soft, and pure eggs were the most firm. I feel like firm eggs work best with texture of watery and soft spinach.\n\nCooking technique and doneness. Real time between adding eggs and transfering them to the plate was just above two minutes. Because there is no added liquids or fats in the eggs, they get done earlier and more fast that buttered/milked down version. Cooking eggs on low/no fire and scrambling eggs with spatula or whisk the whole time is a requirement regardless how done they are. I like eggs rather done than not, but I HATE big curds, or even worse, egg-scramble baked in a half-omelette. Spinach actually comes in handy here: leaves of spinach help eggs stay separate and not to cook in one big omelette after you'll let them sit for one minute on your plate. Again, it's a personal preference, but I feel like almost done eggs work better for this recipe.\n\nServing.  don't spread your egg scramble across the board, try to put it in more folded omelette shape to let it stay hot. I eat with avocado, sour cream or creme fraiche out of the fridge becuase I like to combine taste of hot scrambled eggs with something cold, fatty and creamy.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recipe is for 1 portion of &lt;strong&gt;486 kcal, 33g proteins (28%)/ 34g fats (62%)/ 13g total carbs (10%)/ 8g fiber&lt;/strong&gt;.
