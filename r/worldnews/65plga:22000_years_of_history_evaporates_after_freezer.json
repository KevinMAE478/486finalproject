These defrost cycles are generally started on a timed schedule and terminate on some sort of temp setpoint or are also just timed. It sounds like the termination mechanism probably failed and if they didn&amp;#39;t have any high temp alarm, you get a heating unit instead of just a standard defrost cycle. I&amp;#39;m not sure on the specifics or how sophisticated the systems are but there should have been some sort of redundancy if these cores were so special.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope it helps, have a nice day, luv!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;:)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dgcuce0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492418514.0, "created_utc": 1492389714.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgctpfe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RedditModsRcucks", "parent_id": "t3_65plga", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "they built a $4M freezer that was capable of malfunctioning and pumping 40C* air into itself?
