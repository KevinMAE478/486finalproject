It is not immoral to provide birth control and teach it&amp;#39;s proper use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d argue that to force someone to have a child is as immoral as forcing someone to have no children. Pretty soon though, if people don&amp;#39;t choose to make those decisions for themselves, there will come a time when someone else will be forced by chaotic and critical circumstances, to do it for them. I understand what people who call birth control &amp;quot;race suicide&amp;quot; are saying,  and I understand the harm which enforced population control policies in places like China have done. I understand people saying its a very personal or a religious decision how many children to have. It isn&amp;#39;t personal though. That choice impacts not just you, but every other person in your community and society, and their limited resources have to be shared with you and your child because of a choice you made without their input or consent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless, population control absolutely is key to fixing many entrenched problems like global hunger, poverty, and chronic disease, as well as possibly being the answer to ending much violent fighting and inter personal aggression, over increasingly more scarce resources. Tech can help us dig ourselves out of our global environmental nightmare hole, but tech includes modern methods of birth control-and that should absolutely be discussed and considered fair game, every single time environmental matters are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg7f7jh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492111819.0, "created_utc": 1492083019.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7d2ly", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 23, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wafflashizzles", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ar46", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What are you talking about? 50 Billion humans on earth?
