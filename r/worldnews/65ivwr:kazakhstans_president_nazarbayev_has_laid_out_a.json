The standard book on early Soviet nationality policy is Terry Martin's *The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939* (2001). His main focus is Ukraine, but he also spends a good part of it on Kazakhstan, and includes an entire chapter on the Latinisation policies of the 1920s. Also worth considering is Francine Hirsch's *Empire of Nations: Ethnographic Knowledge and the Making of the Soviet Union* (2005), which looks at how the Soviet Union classified the various peoples of the USSR, and naturally this has a large focus on Central Asia. If you want a more region-specific case study, I'd recommend Adrienne Lynn Edgar's *Tribal Nation: The Making of Turkmenistan* (2005).
