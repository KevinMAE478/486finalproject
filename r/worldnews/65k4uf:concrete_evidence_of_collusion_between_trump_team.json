There is effectively no character limit as he can just keep tweeting, there is no reason to limit himself to just 140 characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no reason to specifically mention one form of spying except to exclude others. This is the part of the way English works. If you were to read a book, that said &amp;quot;there was an apple and a pear inside the crate&amp;quot; and then proceeded to describe a character reaching into the crate and pulling out a banana, you would be confused. The author didn&amp;#39;t explicitly state there wasn&amp;#39;t a banana but the explicit mention of the apple and pear implies that there was nothing else. Trump mentioned a particular form of spying which thus implies that there were no other forms of spying. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t being pedantic, this is literally a basic element of how English speakers communicate. When Trump says something his words have meaning. You can&amp;#39;t just dismiss an argument as &amp;quot;pedantic&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;semantics&amp;quot; when someone points out that what he said means something entirely different than what you claim.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dgb2p3l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492314194.0, "created_utc": 1492285394.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb1od8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KiwiBattlerNZ", "parent_id": "t1_dgb00c8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Ah yes, pedantics...
