Summary wise or did I miss something?\n\nUS strikes Syria, widely seen as a warning to North Korea.  North Korea is observed as about to test a nuke.  Instead of the international community later condoning the test and putting up more sanctions, this time China cancels coal from North Korea in favor of US coal and masses troops at the border, state media says if China is ecologically or economically damaged it will react against North Korea.    \n\nMeanwhile an US carrier strike group, now joined by Japanese ships are headed towards North Korea.  North Korea sends off 600 000 of it's residents to the suburbs.  So is Kim going to test that nuke?  \n\nDid this seriously all happen because a few weeks ago Trump met with the Chinese president.  Now Trump achieves one of his promises to help U.S. coal, gets China on the U.S. side and changes the North Korean government to something more stable.  I suspect one favorable to China, but still...something way better than the current for everyone.  I mean I have very negative opinions about Trump's ability to govern...but if his team did manage to do all this.  Well..that's geopolitics...always interesting.  I wonder if the plan is to slowly escalate the situation to where an invasion would be inevitable but before that breaking point can be reached, it would be obvious to evacuate Seoul - taking away the North's biggest threat, artillery strikes against the capital of South Korea and killing hundred of thousands.  If that happened, it's going to be a fast invasion.  ", "edited": 1492069086.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this what is really going on?
