", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did some research on all of this earlier today and couldn&amp;#39;t find anything credible.  The reports of China moving 150k troops was being passed around Chinese social media and their bond markets.  The Chinese government denied it and no credible news source has picked it up.  It just looks like doomsday stuff to spur up speculation in the bond markets and let savvy investors cash in on sketchy markets.  So take that bit of news with a grain of salt.  Analysts watching the region have said that upwards of 250,000 troops regularly reside all over that region and they haven&amp;#39;t seen any abnormal troop movements.  Last bit I heard is that number of troops would be more of an anti-refugee force, if China were preparing for a mass influx of NK refugees flowing across the border.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The US is however cancelling strike group Carl Vinson&amp;#39;s scheduled stops in Australia and is now heading North from Singapore more towards NK waters.  That much is known.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also heard that NK has ordered up to 600k people evacuate Pyongyang, the city has 2.6M normally.  They were told to go to the suburbs and that speculation was due to the city&amp;#39;s bomb shelters not being big enough to hold everyone.

The world isn&amp;#39;t afraid of anything in NK except their nukes (and refugees) so they must build them and have as many as possible. As to what they seek in all their madness then the answer is pretty simple. They want the regime to endure and frankly if you were Kim and you looked out into the world and saw what happened to Saddam, Ghadaffi, Bashar e.t.c (far more compromising leaders) then it is easy to see why they choose the &amp;quot;madman&amp;quot; strategy as their strategy to survive. \nI&amp;#39;m not some apologist for NK but they certainly don&amp;#39;t want to watch the world burn but then again they will burn it if their regime feels threatened. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg6x4o7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492075680.0, "created_utc": 1492046880.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 50}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651jpn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651jpn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651jpn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg76291", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hackrid", "parent_id": "t1_dg6ww6u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME??", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME??&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg76291", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492088031.0, "created_utc": 1492059231.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ww6u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "buymorenoships", "parent_id": "t1_dg6v8ma", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "WHERE'S RACHEL!?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHERE&amp;#39;S RACHEL!?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg6ww6u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492075385.0, "created_utc": 1492046585.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6v8ma", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BUDDHAKHAN", "parent_id": "t1_dg6r7yc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sad but true", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sad but true&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg6v8ma", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492073351.0, "created_utc": 1492044551.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6r7yc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 156, "report_reasons": null, "author": "beachieboys", "parent_id": "t3_651jpn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money...
