Hours after the drone left, a Russian-made fighter jet bombed the hospital in what American officials believe was an attempt to cover up the usage of chemical weapons.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The official said the presence of the surveillance drone over the hospital **couldn't have been a coincidence, and that Russia must have known the chemical weapons attack was coming** and that victims were seeking treatment.\n\nI'm not completely following the chronology here. I'd be inclined to interpret this equally as evidence that the new **an attack** was coming, but I don't see that you've got enough yet to say that this was prior knowledge of a chemical attack\n\nLook at this way round. Is it so unbelievably coincidental that you might use a UAV to surveil a target ahead of an attack? Probably not. I think that most people would accept this is fairly normal?\n\nGiven how long these things can stay on station would you not keep it in the area? Fast jets fly away quickly, a UAV can hang around and watch the aftermath, potentially being used to call in a second strike if something emerges from the first attack, like a fleet of subarus suddenly making a run for it. I wouldn't over state the significance of a UAV in the area to be honest\n\nIt doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that a UAV might then follow evacuations to a hospital. The chances are there are going to be casualties regardless of whether sarin or conventional explosives were used. Casualties go to hospitals. You might even do so to try and estimate the damage you caused by casulaty count and thus be simply adding to your intelligence\n\nTaking a decision to bomb the hospital however is pretty dispicable, no one is going to pretend otherwise, but it has happened before.

Are the Russians really so naive of chemical warfare to think they'd destory all traces of it by bombing a hospital? Why would an American official seriously believe this is an attempt by Russia to cover up the attack anyway? So far as I can see Russia hasn't denied the presence of a nerve agent. What they've done instead (if there's any cover up) is to try and explain how it came to be there. They're probably familiar enough with sarin to realise there's limitations as to what they could do to cover up a footprint. \n\nEDIT for additional thought on why they might bomb the hospital\n\nThere is a possible explanation that can turn the American hypothesis on its head. It starts from the position of the jets not carrying chemical weapons at all (something which most commentators don't even seem to be prepared to consider). Now put yourself in the Russian commanders position without prejudice under this scenario. You know you've dropped four 500Ib bombs say, containing conventional explosives. About 10 minutes later reports start to emerge of a nerve agent release. Would you not be asking \"how the hell has that happened? we know we didn't do it\". After about 20 mins you begin to accept that something has indeed occurred. You've got a UAV in the area, would you not park it above the nearest hospital to try and establish the extent of what's gone on? As you and your fellow commanders are trying to understand the events, you're naturally going to form the view that any nerve agent release has to have come from the ground, and quite probably be secondary to your own activity. That would be logical, how else do you explain its presence? It won't be too long after you've drawn this conclusion, before you determine that some of the people you've observed being taken to hospital have to have been close enough to it for you to assume that they were handling it. In the war against ISIS/ AQ/ Rebels etc these are fairly high value targets. Sure you know there are innocent civilians in the casulaty count too, but this is Russia, sentiment needn't be the first thing they consider. They could probably justify killing 80 people if they thought that 15 of them were chemical weapons operatives. With this line of logic then you'd be drawn into bombing the hospital not because you're trying to clear up evidence (you'd use incediaries to do that anyway) but precsiely because the chemical weapon release was likely due to some of the people inside it. In other words bombing the hospital is confirmation that you weren't the ones responsible for the release of the nerve agent\n\nI also think there's a slight contradiction with what we were told in the immediate aftermath. Remember the victims were reported as having been taken to Turkey for treatment and it was the Turks who confirmed the use of sarin (which might raise a few eyebrows as they themselves have been implicated as suppliers of sarin ingredients to rebel groups). I tend to think however that this can be explained by a first response hospital becoming overloaded and unable to cope, and perhaps patients were then transferred to Turkey. So far as I can see however, the evidence in Turkey has mysteriously dried up outside of the first few hours (or I've missed it)", "edited": 1491908112.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The official said a drone operated by Russians was flying over a hospital &lt;strong&gt;as victims of the attack were rushing to get treatment&lt;/strong&gt;.

Is it so unbelievably coincidental that you might use a UAV to surveil a target ahead of an attack? Probably not. I think that most people would accept this is fairly normal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given how long these things can stay on station would you not keep it in the area? Fast jets fly away quickly, a UAV can hang around and watch the aftermath, potentially being used to call in a second strike if something emerges from the first attack, like a fleet of subarus suddenly making a run for it.
