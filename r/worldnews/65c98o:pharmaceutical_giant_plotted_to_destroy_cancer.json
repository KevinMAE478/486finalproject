It's precisely in the realm of social welfare and health that this is most obviously untrue. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are all fabulously successful programs that have lower overhead than the private sector (correction: there's no equivalent of social security in the private sector, unless you count private retirement funds, which are less stable and definitely have higher overhead), minimal bureaucratic costs, and deliver great services.\n\nI keep seeing and hearing variations of the argument that \"It's my money; I should be allowed to spend it how I want\" or \"taxes are theft and an infringement on my basic freedoms.\" Setting aside the obvious fact that when you live in society you have obligations to it and should NOT be allowed to decide, by your own whim, what parts of it you contribute to, I'd love for these people to show me a single country where society and the state function well in the absence of a strong state and robust tax system -- Scandinavia being of course the best example. \n\nAnd then there's the argument that \"Scandinavia's fundamentally different and they have their own social problems.\" Yeah, all countries have problems because nothing is perfect and circumstances, society and the social contract constantly evolve. But these countries, which aren't as wealthy as the US, still manage to educate their citizen better and maintain a considerably more equitable society with a higher overall standard of living, far less income disparity and higher wages.
