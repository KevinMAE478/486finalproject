I am just required to pay whatever they choose to bill me for.\n\nIt is true that there is no \"deductible\" on Canadian government mandatory health insurance so when you go to the doctor, you don't usually have to pay anything because it's covered by your health insurance that you already paid for.\n\nAnother detail of Canadian health care that Americans seem completely unaware of, but that Canadians all seem to know about, is that if you need treatment that is high-tech or expensive, you can end up on a waiting list for a long time. Like months to get a CAT scan. People do sometimes die while on those waiting lists because their condition was not treated in time. Canadians who have enough money go to the US for medical treatment for anything serious.\n\nThe strength of the Canadian system is that since it costs no additional money to see a doctor, people don't put it off and minor problems are diagnosed and treated far more quickly, preventing some of them from getting worse.

In Canada, it takes months because they don't have nearly enough CAT scan machines.

Of course this an impression given to a Chinese tour group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually don&amp;#39;t think communism has anything to do with their disdain of China.  First of all, due to China&amp;#39;s size all of China&amp;#39;s neighbors have reservations or fear of becoming Chinese.  In my tour group 1/3 were Korean Chinese, and you could tell the Norks treated them worse probably thinking that they are betraying their Korean identity.  I think it all goes to Korean Juche or self reliance. They probably think China relies upon the US and worked against communism in bring down the USSR, which had huge negative impact on NK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think even to this day NK&amp;#39;s closest ally is still Russia.
