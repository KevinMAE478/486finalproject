Were you all born after 1990?  DID YOU ALL FUCKING MISS THE MULTIPLE DEALS THE US HAS MADE NUMEROUS TIMES IN ORDER TO GET NK TO ABATE THEIR WEAPONS PROGRAMS?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve literally tried the peaceful solution.  For decades.  We offered assurances that we would not attack them or interfere in their politics.  Multiple times.  And all they continue to do is build weapons in violation of all international law and IAEA agreements.  There wouldn&amp;#39;t be an existential threat to NK in the first place if they agreed to stand by the deals they signed to in the first place.  Now they&amp;#39;re trying to build nukes that can attack dozens of countries in the world.  It is time to have a spine and get tougher on NK.  We&amp;#39;ve flat out tried diplomacy for decades.
