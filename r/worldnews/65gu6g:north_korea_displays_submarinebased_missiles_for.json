Here's why, as stated on [the Wikipedia page for the KN-08 (their primary ICBM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KN-08), the overall threat for DPRK's ICBMs are low*ish*:\n\n&gt;In early 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that although they had not seen the KN-08 tested, they believed North Korea had the ability to put a nuclear weapon on a KN-08, and it was prudent to plan for that threat. The KN-08 theoretically poses a threat to the U.S. mainland, able to deliver a 500\u2013700 kg (1,100\u20131,500 lb) payload 7,500\u20139,000 km (4,700\u20135,600 mi) to the American West Coast. **Practically speaking however, its accuracy is likely \"barely adequate\" to target large cities, mobility would be limited to paved roads, and the system will require 1\u20132 hours of pre-launch fueling**.\n\nThis means that, while North Korea *might* be able to launch a missile that could reach the West Coast, there are *many* checks standing in the way of an actual detonation on a major US target. \n\nCurrently, North Korea could nuke South Korea and *possibly* (although it's **HIGHLY** unlikely in relation to South Korea's chances) Japan. I say that Japan is less likely because of its distance from North Korea, and the fact that the Sea of Japan stands between the two countries. Aside from the likely involvement of the United States Navy and potentially China's in that body of water, it's a fairly long distance and, so far, North Korea has not demonstrated an ability to shoot missiles that far/accurately. \n\nThe same is true of the United States, except to *many* more degrees. There's the gigantic Pacific Ocean, the plethora of missile defense systems that are designed to shoot down faster, stronger, and more accurate ICBMs coming in the *hundreds*, and the aforementioned period of preparation that North Korea would have to go through in order to have a ready-to-launch ICBM (if preparation took two hours, that's an *entire* two hours that gives China, Russia, South Korea, Japan, and/or the United States to retaliate).\n\nIn short, the only country currently at threat from a North Korean nuclear tantrum is South Korea\n\n~~--------------------------------------------------------------------------~~\n\nSLBMs would *drastically* alter the level of supervision and security that all of the involved nations would require in dealing with North Korea. Although it's possible to detect and track submarines, it's vastly more dangerous to have North Korean nuclear submarines swimming around. \n\nCan we even allow them to implement them? Isn't the risk of sending out these submarines too high? North Korea could decide to preemptively bomb both South Korea *and* Japan with both an ICBM and SLBM. Or, on the flip side, the United States might find a North Korean submarine off of its coast and do its own preemptive strike, which would cause a domino-effect into a potential third world war. \n\nChina would have to go even *further* in holding Kim Jong Un by the leash, and I don't think they're willing to go much further in terms of bottling that situation up. If North Korea deploys these subs, I can't see it going well for their economic relationship with China. \n\nAs of now, we have to see if they'll even *work*, but if they can (and I'd imagine that SLBMs are slightly less difficult to master building than ICBMs), North Korea just threw another whole factor into this mess.
