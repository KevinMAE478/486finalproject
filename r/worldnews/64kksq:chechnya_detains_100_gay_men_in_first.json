Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Odd,&amp;quot; said Arthur, &amp;quot;I thought you said it was a democracy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I did,&amp;quot; said Ford. &amp;quot;It is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So,&amp;quot; said Arthur, hoping he wasn&amp;#39;t sounding ridiculously obtuse, &amp;quot;why don&amp;#39;t people get rid of the lizards?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It honestly doesn&amp;#39;t occur to them,&amp;quot; said Ford. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;ve all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they&amp;#39;ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You mean they actually vote for the lizards?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh yes,&amp;quot; said Ford with a shrug, &amp;quot;of course.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But,&amp;quot; said Arthur, going for the big one again, &amp;quot;why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because if they didn&amp;#39;t vote for a lizard,&amp;quot; said Ford, &amp;quot;the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I said,&amp;quot; said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, &amp;quot;have you got any gin?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll look. Tell me about the lizards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ford shrugged again.\n&amp;quot;Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happenned to them,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone&amp;#39;s got to say it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But that&amp;#39;s terrible,&amp;quot; said Arthur.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Listen, bud,&amp;quot; said Ford, &amp;quot;if I had one Altairian dollar for every time I heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the Universe and say &amp;#39;That&amp;#39;s terrible&amp;#39; I wouldn&amp;#39;t be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2015 Douglas Adams, So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg36r2r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491883674.0, "created_utc": 1491854874.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 388}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64kksq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg34cni", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 454, "report_reasons": null, "author": "-DeadRabbit-", "parent_id": "t1_dg33pg9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Power corrupts the innocent and attracts the already corrupt.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power corrupts the innocent and attracts the already corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg34cni", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491881188.0, "created_utc": 1491852388.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 454}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg33pg9", "gilded": 1, "archived": false, "score": 6771, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Scolopendra_Heros", "parent_id": "t1_dg329v8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "These sort of people ALWAYS hold government positions. \n\nfucked up people loooooove positions of power, they are drawn to them like flies to shit.
