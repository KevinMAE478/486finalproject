Even their current missiles use &amp;quot;smuggled&amp;quot; electronics from the West, and there is speculation that these parts were &amp;quot;allowed&amp;quot; into North Korea because they are compromised for easymode cyber attacks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, the US has a fairly formidable multi-tier ABM shield.  And more importantly, unlike Russia, North Korea is positioned geographically such that any long range missile launch will be very vulnerable to sea-based ABM in the ascent phase, which is the easier interception phase.  A single carrier strike group is comprised of 1-2 Ticonderoga Class Destroyers, each with 121 VLS tubes and 2-3 Arleigh Burke Class destroyers, each with 90 VLS tubes.  That means a strike group can carry up to 500 AMB interceptors (exact loadouts are classified).  Each ship can additionally track up to 800 individual targets alone, or as part of a networked radar grid.  In addition, Japan is home to two AN/TPY-2 radars which is unquestionably the most advanced ABM radar in the world, and the Japanese Navy has an additional 17 missile destroyers, each capable of carrying between 30 and 90 ABM interceptors.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a very good reason why Russia and China fear US ABM technology.  It&amp;#39;s getting awfully close to being a legit missile shield which is capable of degrading even the largest salvos that the largest nuclear powers could muster.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - North Korea is literally the one country in the world which would have the most difficulty launching a ballistic missile strike against anyone.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg9bbps", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492214187.0, "created_utc": 1492185387.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 122}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg98uky", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 99, "report_reasons": null, "author": "OneKardia", "parent_id": "t1_dg98lw9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I take it seriously Everytime.
