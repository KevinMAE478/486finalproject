China bites on this deal because they can obviously have even closer ties (than the US) with the new NK leaders, maintain their status in the region and country, and avoid a major WWIII type scenario with the USA. Russia can say \"fuck it, go for it\" because they can dump shitty arms and gear on to NK for dirt cheap, because it's easier than decommissioning it, and they get a little ROI as apposed to spending money destroying all that stuff.
