It just turns people totally off from the conversation. and thats why no one takes these scientific predictions seriously because they are almost inevitably always proven untrue - so of course they turn to &amp;quot;By the year 2100, or the next 200 years....&amp;quot; to try and boost there credibility by making claims that can&amp;#39;t be proven untrue until they are dead and there are no ridiculous theories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer to climate change isn&amp;#39;t dramatic economic measures, its investing in green technology and finding ways to get off fossil fuels rather than PENALIZING fossil fuels. You will never win that battle, and climate alarm-ism isn&amp;#39;t going to end the world but make it much more unsafe. Countries that have tried forcing themselves to use greentech always fail, Sweden tried it and now buy coal based electricity from neighboring countries as well as Germany, which also shut down its nuclear reactors if I&amp;#39;m not mistaken and is also relying on foreign bought (FOSSIL) energy. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dgcc6pp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492394318.0, "created_utc": 1492365518.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 52}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc8v5v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 109, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Thatsnotwhatthatsfor", "parent_id": "t1_dgc715y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The fact that so many people think its a circlejerk is why the outlook is so bad.
