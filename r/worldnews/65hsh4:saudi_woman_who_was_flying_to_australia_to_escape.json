Seriously.\n\nIt's easy to say that Saudi Arabia is uniquely horrible, or that (not you, but commonly stated) the issue is rooted in one particular religion.\n\nWhat's interesting is that Saudi Arabia in many ways is not much different from us, a short time ago (historically speaking). e.g. I'm from the Netherlands, commonly viewed as one of the most progressive places on the planet. But it wasn't until 1956 (my mother was already born, let alone my grandmother) that women were equalised within the law.\n\nUntil then, married women were viewed as (in)capable on the level of mentally handicapped persons, or underage children. i.e., not able to run a household, engage in contracts, manage their belongings/wealth, and indeed, similar to this story, request a visa, without approval of their husbands. In decisions on parenting of kids, the husband's voice ruled. Even if the daughters's father died, who left 'her' a farm as inheritance, it would instead go to his son in law. And if the husband sold it all because of a gambling addiction and racked up huge debts, the wife would be held responsible for those debts, too.\n\nBanning this practice was a culmination of a slow, 19th century movement. e.g. in 1907 women could for the first time spend the money from their jobs (which were approved by their husbands), although only on the condition it was spent on things for the family. e.g., still fully geared towards being a good housewife. \n\nThis patriarchal legal system took on the weirdest forms. For example, a dying wife had invited her family to her deathbed. However, her husband refused because he was at odds with her family. The judge ruled in his favour, after all he was the head of the household, legally.\n\nNote that opposition to the 1956 law for equality was mostly Christian. In fact, the law itself was inspired by Christianity in the first place. Further, it wasn't until the 70s until the husband wasn't considered to be legally the head of the family. \n\nJust considering that one of the most progressive places on the planet had, in my parents' lifetimes, just a few decades ago, BY LAW, many of the same sexist and gender discriminatory practices in place as Saudi Arabia is I think important to note.\n\nNone of this excuses Saudi Arabia, but it is I think interesting to note that Saudi Arabia was a country of 3 million mostly nomadic desert folk, at a time my mother was alive and the Netherlands was just coming to terms with a more equal society, after many centuries of patriarchy, despite it being a country with good universities in a region with great philosophers, both Dutch and foreign. \n\ne.g. after John Stuart Mill's essay The Subjection of Women (1869) it took the Netherlands 100 years to fully remove its principle patriarchal element in its legal system. Saudi Arabia hasn't even been a country for 100 years.\n\nI hope its move towards progressivism and modernity will be swift, it can't come too soon. But if you ask 'what is wrong with Saudi Arabia?', I'd say, it's simply a young nation that's only just stepping out of its medieval, nomadic, desert background, and exhibits many of the flaws our countries shared a relatively short time ago on the issue of patriarchy.\n\nThere's lots of hopeful signs however. For example, literacy youth rates (15-24) among women are 96%, for men 98%. This is up from &lt;50% levels just a few decades ago. There are lots of such indicators that show there's growing opportunities for feminist elements within the country. Let's do our bit to support that any way we can, which includes holding our governments accountable for one of the longest-standing cooperations between the western world and Saudi Arabia's dictatorship, with very few conditions. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What the hell is wrong with Saudi Arabia. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to say that Saudi Arabia is uniquely horrible, or that (not you, but commonly stated) the issue is rooted in one particular religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s interesting is that Saudi Arabia in many ways is not much different from us, a short time ago (historically speaking). e.g. I&amp;#39;m from the Netherlands, commonly viewed as one of the most progressive places on the planet. But it wasn&amp;#39;t until 1956 (my mother was already born, let alone my grandmother) that women were equalised within the law.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until then, married women were viewed as (in)capable on the level of mentally handicapped persons, or underage children. i.e., not able to run a household, engage in contracts, manage their belongings/wealth, and indeed, similar to this story, request a visa, without approval of their husbands. In decisions on parenting of kids, the husband&amp;#39;s voice ruled. Even if the daughters&amp;#39;s father died, who left &amp;#39;her&amp;#39; a farm as inheritance, it would instead go to his son in law. And if the husband sold it all because of a gambling addiction and racked up huge debts, the wife would be held responsible for those debts, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Banning this practice was a culmination of a slow, 19th century movement. e.g. in 1907 women could for the first time spend the money from their jobs (which were approved by their husbands), although only on the condition it was spent on things for the family. e.g., still fully geared towards being a good housewife. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This patriarchal legal system took on the weirdest forms. For example, a dying wife had invited her family to her deathbed. However, her husband refused because he was at odds with her family. The judge ruled in his favour, after all he was the head of the household, legally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that opposition to the 1956 law for equality was mostly Christian. In fact, the law itself was inspired by Christianity in the first place. Further, it wasn&amp;#39;t until the 70s until the husband wasn&amp;#39;t considered to be legally the head of the family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just considering that one of the most progressive places on the planet had, in my parents&amp;#39; lifetimes, just a few decades ago, BY LAW, many of the same sexist and gender discriminatory practices in place as Saudi Arabia is I think important to note.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of this excuses Saudi Arabia, but it is I think interesting to note that Saudi Arabia was a country of 3 million mostly nomadic desert folk, at a time my mother was alive and the Netherlands was just coming to terms with a more equal society, after many centuries of patriarchy, despite it being a country with good universities in a region with great philosophers, both Dutch and foreign. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;e.g. after John Stuart Mill&amp;#39;s essay The Subjection of Women (1869) it took the Netherlands 100 years to fully remove its principle patriarchal element in its legal system. Saudi Arabia hasn&amp;#39;t even been a country for 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope its move towards progressivism and modernity will be swift, it can&amp;#39;t come too soon. But if you ask &amp;#39;what is wrong with Saudi Arabia?&amp;#39;, I&amp;#39;d say, it&amp;#39;s simply a young nation that&amp;#39;s only just stepping out of its medieval, nomadic, desert background, and exhibits many of the flaws our countries shared a relatively short time ago on the issue of patriarchy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s lots of hopeful signs however. For example, literacy youth rates (15-24) among women are 96%, for men 98%. This is up from &amp;lt;50% levels just a few decades ago. There are lots of such indicators that show there&amp;#39;s growing opportunities for feminist elements within the country.
