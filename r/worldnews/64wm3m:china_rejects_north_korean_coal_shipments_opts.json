In the past decades, a huge amount of coal has been transported from these areas to the central and\nsouth China via ports in Hebei Province and Port of Tianjin. Traditionally, coal is transported in bulk\nshipment. However, in recent years, an interesting phenomenon is that the lump coal is sorted out in the north\nand thenmovedin containers to the south. This paper aims to ascertain whether the coal containerization will\nbecome an alternative transport mode for moving lump coal from the north to the south of China. Based on\nextensive field investigation and data analyses, it is found that although the container mode appears to be\nmore expensive than the bulk shipping mode, the cost difference between the two modes is not as significant\nas our expectation if we also take into factors like fragmented demand, environment pressure, geographic\ndistribution characteristics of customers and so on.\n\n**Design/methodology/approach** \u2013 Extensive field investigation, data analysis and economic\ndecision model.\n\n**Findings** \u2013 It is found that although the container mode appears to be more expensive than the bulk\nshipping mode, the cost difference between the two modes is not as significant as the authors\u2019 expectation if\nthey also take into factors like fragmented demand, environment pressure, geographic distribution\ncharacteristics of customers and so on.\n\n**Originality/value** \u2013 Although the major focus has been placed on the food containerization, the coal\ncontainerization is still a new thing and has attracted only limited attention.
