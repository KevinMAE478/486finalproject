Anything else would be insanity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m will to bet taxes before 400k are probably a super high amount too in his plans, 60%-80%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So income will be pretty drastically low. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think in America the most you will get feasibly taxed is like 40%, at least when you account for other forms of taxing. ~40% seems roughly accurate. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dgdjjt3", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492468134.0, "created_utc": 1492439334.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdj40c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "probablymakingthisup", "parent_id": "t1_dgdiohx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Good.
