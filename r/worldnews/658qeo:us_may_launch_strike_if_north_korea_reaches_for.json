With Trump, the Norks think he is crazy and is willing to fight a war.  With China, they probably believe Trump&amp;#39;s threats more and thus for the first time, Chinese state media is also very anti-NK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another side issue the western media is not aware is that Xi Jinping personally detest little Kimmy.  People don&amp;#39;t realize that Xi like Kim is the son of one of the founding generals of PRC...so to a extent Xi still believes some of the founding motifs of Mao&amp;#39;s revolution of course adapted to modern times.  So seeing North Korea in its current state under a cultish communist monarchy is probably a personal affront especially considering China&amp;#39;s blood and treasure essentially allowed for little kimmy&amp;#39;s dynasty to exist.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another interesting fact about North Korea that people may not realize, China not only lost about 200K lives fighting in NK but also lost Taiwan due to NK.  The US gave indications that they would not protect Taiwan from a communist invasion since the US was completely disillusioned with Chiang Kai-shek but decided to protect Taiwan after China intervened in Korea.  The Chinese military force that fought in North Korea was originally intended to unify Taiwan.  So I think to Xi, who is a Chinese nationalist, seeing North Korea under Kim like  it is today probably pains him a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg8mm5r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492165635.0, "created_utc": 1492136835.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 266}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8dqp4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1816, "report_reasons": null, "author": "irrelevant_canadian", "parent_id": "t1_dg8dbpf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can't tell if it's real or just the media exploiting fear of Trump and North Korea for ratings. \n\nThe media themselves might escalate this into a conflict, it sure would help their ratings.
