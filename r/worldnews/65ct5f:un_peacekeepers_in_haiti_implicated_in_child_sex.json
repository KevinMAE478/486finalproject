It&amp;#39;s because the military often does questionable things and sweeps them under the rug. And that&amp;#39;s not even just in the US, that&amp;#39;s a trend with military across the globe. But to get back to the US, it wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me if US troops had done this or worse at several points; it&amp;#39;s just been swept under the rug better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Relevant to this, recently huge scandals have arisen in several branches of the military, with the big ones being a large group of marines trading illicitly obtained nude pictures of female core members on social media (Facebook iirc), and then it&amp;#39;s come out recently that there&amp;#39;s a huge drug problem among the Navy Seals, though I don&amp;#39;t recall the specifics of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, at least if we enter WW3 soon we can hope it will whip armed forces around the world in to shape. And lead to &lt;del&gt;dissolution of the UN&lt;/del&gt; world peace. ;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dga1w00", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492246966.0, "created_utc": 1492218166.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9xiij", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bilky_t", "parent_id": "t1_dg9v42x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Surely they'd be able to bring proceedings against these people through the legal systems of the appropriate countries, acting as informants whilst the local departments of prosecution handled the case.\n\nI work in the courts in Australia.
