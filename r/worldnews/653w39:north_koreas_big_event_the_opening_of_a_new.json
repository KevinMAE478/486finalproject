It creates an incentive structure in which clickbait makes you money. Thorough research does not. Journalists that do multiple sources checking and non-sensationalist headlines do get drowned in the breaking news /hyperbole bullshit that gets voted to the top. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:\nJust wanted to include one recent positive example of a great, well-researched article. It is a topic you will encounter very often on reddit and mosty with shit sources that push a certain agenda. &lt;a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/06/trump-putin-and-the-new-cold-war\"&gt;It is about Trump and Russia. And more specifically about the tactics Russia applies in foreign politics. \nIt lays the facts bare and shows that there is a lot less evidence for collusion than some parts of reddit want you to believe (r/politics), but also there are some connections, (which other parts like like r/the_donald deny). People from both sides of the aisle could learn a lot from it. \nClick here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also from a more conservative outlet, another calm and informative article about the same topic can be found &lt;a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/446339/donald-trump-russia-2016-election-controversy-explained\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of these articles do not much to evoke emotions like clickbait articles do, but they have the advantage of being more likely to be true. They take some time to read. But this is time well spent compared to spitting outraged comments on here in reponse to stuff that turns out to be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also &lt;a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year\"&gt;here are the Pulitzer Price winners of 2017 (and before), including links to their work. If you are interested in high-quality journalism.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg7f0ch", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492111363.0, "created_utc": 1492082563.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6195}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653w39", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653w39", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653w39", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7humw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Claidheamh_Righ", "parent_id": "t1_dg7h9sz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It wasn't even SK news, it was the SK office of an American company quoting a Taiwanese company.", "edited": 1492088362.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t even SK news, it was the SK office of an American company quoting a Taiwanese company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg7humw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492116729.0, "created_utc": 1492087929.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7h9sz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 44, "report_reasons": null, "author": "slickyslickslick", "parent_id": "t1_dg7f9v0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "People need to stop quoting South Korean media on anything to do with North Korea.
