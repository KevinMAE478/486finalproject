It&amp;#39;s more likely they&amp;#39;ll go after Seoul since they&amp;#39;ll have less reaction time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The JSDF Air Force has tons of Patriot missiles ready to kill anything that even looks at the island wrong, and their costal radar can track a seagull shitting over North Korean airspace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually worry more about artillery that they have pointed at Seoul since that&amp;#39;s a bit more of a pain to stop. They could use an Israeli Iron Dome system, but currently they&amp;#39;re focusing on quick detection and neutralization of artillery in the event of war. With the RoK air force and USAF they basically want to flatten all the artillery pieces in less than 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg7co25", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492104751.0, "created_utc": 1492075951.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg77xba", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shniper", "parent_id": "t1_dg7546e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "as someone living in Tokyo, concern for me is that NK get a nuke off somewhere before it can be dealt with, hitting either Japan, SK or China.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;as someone living in Tokyo, concern for me is that NK get a nuke off somewhere before it can be dealt with, hitting either Japan, SK or China.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg77xba", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492091650.0, "created_utc": 1492062850.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7546e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg74a1n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg7546e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492086452.0, "created_utc": 1492057652.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6535yi", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7r9xg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nightbefore2", "parent_id": "t1_dg74a1n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How many innocent people lose their lives BECAUSE of North Korea?
