On this scale, participants are asked to indicate, from 1 to 5, how likely they would be to engage in a variety of behaviors, with a \"1\" corresponding to \"not likely at all\", while \"5\" corresponds to \"very likely\". Included on this scale are two questions, one concerning whether the respondent would \"rape\" a woman, and another asking about whether he would \"force her to do something she did not want to do\" in a sexual setting. The participants in question were asked about their likelihood of engaging in such behaviors \"if nobody would ever know and there wouldn't be any consequences\".

Edwards et al (2014) do not explicitly mention how they managed such a feat, but I think the answer is clear from the labeling in one of their tables: \"Any intention to rape a woman\" (emphasis, mine). What the researchers did, then, was code any response other than a \"1\" as an affirmative; the statistical equivalent of saying that 2 is closer to 5 than it is to 1. In other words, the question was, \"Would you rape a woman if you could get away with it\", and the answers were, effectively, \"No, Yes, Yes, Yes, or Yes\". Making the matter even worse is that all that participants were answering both questions. This means they saw a question asking about \"rape\" and another question about \"forcing a woman to do something she didn't want to\".
