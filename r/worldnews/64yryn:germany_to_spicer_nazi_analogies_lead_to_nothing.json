Thinking of Nazis as incarnated evil, especially when you're talking about the lower ranks, is ignoring what may well be the most important lesson from that part of history.\n\nHitler had broad support. Especially among the youth and the better educated (working class was mostly socialist, and no, the Nazis [weren't socialists](https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/sep/17/greatinterviews1) by anyone's understanding of the term but their own). Those people weren't evil in the biblical sense, even though they did evil things. You're not immune to that just because you're not \"evil\". Who thinks of one's self as evil, anyway?\n\nAt the end of a busy week organizing industrialized mass murder, those people went home and took their children for a fun day at the park. Hell, Hitler (\"Uncle Wolf\") himself crawled around and let the (Richard) Wagner (grand-) kids ride his back. Those were normal people. Normal people can do evil things, if the conditions are right, and it's not as if we had evolved to some higher moral state since then. Let that sink in.\n\nIMHO, this makes it all the more scary.\n\nEdit: There's a documentary, *Hitler's Children*, about the children of important Nazis and how they deal with their family's history.

Thinking of Nazis as incarnated evil, especially when you&amp;#39;re talking about the lower ranks, is ignoring what may well be the most important lesson from that part of history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hitler had broad support. Especially among the youth and the better educated (working class was mostly socialist, and no, the Nazis &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/sep/17/greatinterviews1\"&gt;weren&amp;#39;t socialists&lt;/a&gt; by anyone&amp;#39;s understanding of the term but their own). Those people weren&amp;#39;t evil in the biblical sense, even though they did evil things. You&amp;#39;re not immune to that just because you&amp;#39;re not &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot;. Who thinks of one&amp;#39;s self as evil, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of a busy week organizing industrialized mass murder, those people went home and took their children for a fun day at the park. Hell, Hitler (&amp;quot;Uncle Wolf&amp;quot;) himself crawled around and let the (Richard) Wagner (grand-) kids ride his back. Those were normal people.
