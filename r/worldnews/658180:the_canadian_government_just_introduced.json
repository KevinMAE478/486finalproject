The result of a test on an approved screening device would not, by itself, lead to a charge. It would lead only to further investigation, including a test on an approved instrument at the police station.\n\nDrug-impaired driving offences \n\nThe legislation would also create three new offences for having specified levels of a drug in the blood within two hours of driving. The penalties would depend on the drug type and the levels of drug or the combination of alcohol and drugs. These elements were included in the proposed legislation after careful consideration of the available scientific evidence on cannabis and driving. The levels would be set by regulation. For THC (the main psychoactive compound in cannabis), the proposed levels would be: 2 nanograms (ng) but less than 5 ng of THC: Having at least 2 ng but less than 5 ng of THC per millilitre (ml) of blood within two hours of driving would be a separate summary conviction criminal offence, punishable only by a fine. This lower level offence is a precautionary approach that takes into account the best available scientific evidence related to cannabis. This offence would be punishable by a maximum fine of up to $1,000. 5 ng or more of THC: Having 5 ng or more of THC per ml of blood within two hours of driving would be a hybrid offence. Hybrid offences are offences that can be prosecuted either by indictment, in more serious cases, or by summary conviction, in less serious cases. Combined THC and Alcohol: Having a blood alcohol concentration of 50 milligrams (mg) of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, combined with a THC level greater than 2.5 ng per ml of blood within two hours of driving would also be a hybrid offence. Both hybrid offences would be punishable by mandatory penalties of $1,000 for a first offence and escalating penalties for repeat offenders (e.g., 30 days imprisonment on a second offence and 120 days on a third or subsequent offence). The maximum penalties would mirror the existing maximum penalties for impaired driving. These would be increased in Part 2 to two years less a day on summary conviction (up from 18 months), and to 10 years on indictment (up from 5 years). The latter would make a dangerous offender application possible in appropriate circumstances.\n\nhttp://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=8894959\n\nSection 86\n\nPower to enter\n\n86 (1) Subject to subsection (7), an inspector may, for a purpose related to verifying compliance or preventing non-compliance with the provisions of this Act or of the regulations, enter any place, including a conveyance, in which they believe on reasonable grounds (a) an activity that may be regulated under this Act is being conducted; (b) any record, report, electronic data or other document relating to the administration of this Act or the regulations is located; (c) any record, report, electronic data or other document relating to the promotion of cannabis, a cannabis accessory or a service related to cannabis is located; (d) an activity could be conducted under a licence, permit, authorization or exemption that is under consideration by the Minister; or (e) an activity was being conducted under a licence, permit, authorization or exemption before the expiry or revocation of the licence, permit, authorization or exemption, in which case the inspector may enter the place only within 45 days after the day on which it expired or was revoked.\n\n*The inspectors can even come in and search your computers.*\n\nOther powers\n\n(2) The inspector may in the place entered under subsection (1) (a) open and examine any receptacle or package found in the place; (b) examine anything found in the place that is used or may be capable of being used for the production, preservation, packaging, labelling or storage of cannabis; (c) examine any record, report, electronic data or other document, or any label or promotional material, found in the place with respect to cannabis, other than the records of the medical condition of individuals, and make copies of them or take extracts from them; **(d) use or cause to be used any computer system at the place to examine any electronic data referred to in paragraph (c);** (e) reproduce any document from any electronic data referred to in paragraph (c), or cause it to be reproduced, in the form of a printout or other output; (f) take the record, report or other document, or the label or promotional material, referred to in paragraph (c) or the printout or other output referred to in paragraph (e) for examination or copying; (g) use or cause to be used any copying equipment at the place to make copies of any document; (h) take photographs and make recordings and sketches; (i) examine any substance found in the place and take, for the purpose of analysis, any samples of it; (j) seize and detain in accordance with this Part, cannabis or any other thing found in the place that the inspector believes on reasonable grounds is something in relation to which the Act was contravened or is something the seizure and detention of which is necessary to prevent non-compliance with the provisions of this Act or of the regulations; (k) order the owner or person having possession of cannabis or any other thing to which the provisions of this Act or of the regulations apply that is found in that place to move it or, for any time that may be necessary, not to move it or to restrict its movement; (l) order the owner or person having possession of any conveyance that is found in the place and that the inspector believes on reasonable grounds contains cannabis to stop the conveyance, to move it or, for any time that may be necessary, not to move it or to restrict its movement; (m) order any person in that place to establish their identity to the inspector\u2019s satisfaction; and (n) order a person that, at that place, conducts an activity to which the provisions of this Act or of the regulations apply to stop or start the activity.\n\n\n", "edited": 1492147378.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT3: I MADE A MISTAKE REGARDING ENTRY TO A PERSONS DWELLING, THE REST OF THE INFORMATION STANDS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just to give everyone an idea of what this &amp;quot;legalization&amp;quot; will look like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit1 :TL:DR &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1)Mandatory alcohol screening regardless of whether or not there is reason to suspect the driver having consumed alcohol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2)Extremely low THC limits 2-5ng up to $1000 fine 5+ng becomes hybrid offence with punishment scaling depending on situation, changed window to within 2 hours of operating a vehicle and consuming intoxicant as opposed to driving and consuming&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3)Civil investigator powers beyond that of by-law enforcement and police officers.
