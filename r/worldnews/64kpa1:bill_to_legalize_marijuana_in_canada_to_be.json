Or he may write the ticket or whatever it is the law says is the official punishment for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see where they are concerned with the store fronts since officially it is NOT legal as of yet unless you have the medical waiver, and as far as I know you generally have to get it from the Government in that case.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is totally unregulated in terms of quality, they are making a lot of money with unknown tax (both in terms of sales tax and employee tax), and they have to handle only cash, which combined with the distrust of police due to the legality, makes them very tempting targets for robbers and the like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best comparison that I can come up with is if someone set up shop selling Native Cigarettes in the city.  Set up a store that sold nothing else.  That would be raided as well, even though tobacco itself is already legal.  Throw in the fact that Marijuana is still NOT, and as I said I can see why they are getting raided, and I do not think that the stores will be able to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will just have to see what the various Provinces come up with since from what I have read this law will let the distribution be up to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say all this as a non-user that wants it to be legal, and may look into using for back pain when it is legal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg3m60b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491902220.0, "created_utc": 1491873420.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3kwsu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CanadianLatitude", "parent_id": "t1_dg3e9m6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But the law is not enforced equally and I wonder if that could be used as a defence for stores raided in un friendly cities?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the law is not enforced equally and I wonder if that could be used as a defence for stores raided in un friendly cities?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg3kwsu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491900616.0, "created_utc": 1491871816.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3e9m6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ranger7381", "parent_id": "t1_dg3agr6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And just to point out that the Criminal Code is federal, so the law on of it is legal or not is the same across Canada, unlike in the US", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And just to point out that the Criminal Code is federal, so the law on of it is legal or not is the same across Canada, unlike in the US&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg3e9m6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491892114.0, "created_utc": 1491863314.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64kpa1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64kpa1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3ou93", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ClubSoda", "parent_id": "t1_dg3kiwa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Meatballs.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meatballs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg3ou93", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491905457.0, "created_utc": 1491876657.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3kiwa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Odin_The_Wanderer_", "parent_id": "t1_dg3agr6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What is an old school thinking movie?
