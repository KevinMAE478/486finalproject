The history of despotic regimes since the late 80's is that they crumbled from within so they were prepared to let the natural course of events unfold\n\nI do tend to sense that the calculation is changing though, and I'm not sure its even fair to pin this on Trump, even if his own personality has to be part of that equation now.

The frequency of the failures isn't as high as it used to be and he could be a couple of years away from moving to the next level.

Ultimately successive administrations have always judged that the risk of attack outweighed the risk of inaction. For a long time that looked sensible, and its not as if there weren&amp;#39;t grounds for adopting this strategy. The history of despotic regimes since the late 80&amp;#39;s is that they crumbled from within so they were prepared to let the natural course of events unfold&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do tend to sense that the calculation is changing though, and I&amp;#39;m not sure its even fair to pin this on Trump, even if his own personality has to be part of that equation now. I&amp;#39;m possibly a little bit more inclined to give him the benefit here and say he&amp;#39;s been left standing when the music stopped playing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The simple fact is North Korea&amp;#39;s capabilties have been growing. People can laugh as much as they like about the missile failures (you only need a dozen to work) they can laugh too about targeting fish in the Sea of Japan (where else do you think he&amp;#39;s going to fire incidentally?). The frequency of the failures isn&amp;#39;t as high as it used to be and he could be a couple of years away from moving to the next level. Who&amp;#39;ll be laughing then?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point the risk of inaction begins to outweigh the risk of a pre-emptive offensive action. When do we cross that Rubicon? What would constitute evidence that this time has arrived? Being to bloody late isn&amp;#39;t going to be a sustainable defence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately Trump isn&amp;#39;t going to allow Americas west coast to come within range of North Korea, so something is going to give if Kim continues on his current trajectory, and this is likely going to happen in the next 18-24 months you sense. It could of course be a whole lot sooner&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like it either, but I&amp;#39;m pretty close to being out of ideas on this one. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg6rzqp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492069400.0, "created_utc": 1492040600.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 191}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6lxg5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 178, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MobiusF117", "parent_id": "t1_dg63iya", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Japanese deploying anything that looks remotely offensive is weird enough honestly... \n\nSomething is brewing, and i dont like it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese deploying anything that looks remotely offensive is weird enough honestly... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something is brewing, and i dont like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg6lxg5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061927.0, "created_utc": 1492033127.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 178}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y01g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6f7ms", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 62, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ItCameFromWeston", "parent_id": "t1_dg63iya", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They're moving in herds.
