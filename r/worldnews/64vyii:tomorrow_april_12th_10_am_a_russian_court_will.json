On March 15, 2017, the Ministry of Justice in Russia filed a claim with the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation seeking \u201cto declare the religious organization, the Administrative Center of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, extremist, ban its activity, and liquidate it.\u201d A decision by the Supreme Court in favor of this claim will have dire consequences for all of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Russia. The Administrative Center and 400 local legal entities used to own or rent Kingdom Halls would be dissolved. This means that the branch property in St. Petersburg and Kingdom Halls throughout the country could be seized by the State.

Russia\u2019s \u201cFederal Law on Extremist Activity\u201d is being misapplied to Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Russia. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses strive to be good citizens and are known worldwide for our peaceful activities, and ***under no circumstances*** would Jehovah's Witnesses ever resort to any activity that could legitimately be construed as \u201cextremist\u201d or criminal in nature.  \n\n3.  The activity of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and the publications that is produced encourage love of God and neighbor, love for family, and respect for government. There is absolutely nothing \u201cextremist\u201d or criminal in such Bible-based publications, which you can view for yourself [here](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/).

Witnesses in Russia have historically been persecuted because of their neutral political stance (refusal to support the Russian State or war efforts), and because they act as a thorn in the side of the Russian Orthodox Church, who wield tremendous political influence. [(Link)](http://www.cesnur.org/2004/JW/04_08_16.pdf) They were hauled away to concentration camps in Germany during WWII for the same political stance.\n\nWitnesses are putting up a strong fight worldwide for the Right of Conscientious Objection to war, and many governments are furious at that. \n\n&gt;The right of conscientious objection to military service is gradually gaining recognition as a fundamental human right in international law. This right emanates from and is a manifestation of the more established right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Jehovahs Witnesses influence this issue from their sheer numbers, making up over 95 percent of all conscientious objectors currently imprisoned worldwide, and from their strategic use of domestic and international courts.

I understand the sentiment that many of you hold for the refusal of Witnesses to accept blood transfusions. However, many here are under the assumption that JWs are against medical treatment of any sort and would rather die than undergo a procedure. This is a lie. JWs will go above and beyond, like anyone else would, to save themselves and those they love by taking advantage of the best possible treatment available. There's many sensible reasons, however, why Witnesses refuse blood transfusions. \n\nAside from potential risks of immune reactions and infections from blood transfusions, and the fact that bloodless techniques do not lead to worse outcomes, the most important reason is how our Creator views it. To put it simply, it doesn't belong to us in the first place (Ezekiel 18:4). God's Word tells us that the \"soul\", or life, of a person or animal is in their blood and since all souls belong to God, he will demand it back when we die (Leviticus 17:11, Genesis 9:5). To highlight the value of blood think about this, the only way we can pay for our sins is through the blood that we shed upon death (Romans 6:7). In fact, during Bible times, the Israelites used the blood of dead animals as a symbolic exchange for their own to maintain an approved standing before God. \n\nClearly, blood is very precious to our Creator. So much so that he even required the blood of his very own Son to be shed in order to give humans a chance for salvation. The is why the consumption of blood of any sort is so strongly condemned in the Bible. Whether it be taken in through the mouth or intravenously, it doesn't matter. Jehovah God wants us to abstain from it completely and he has every right to demand that of us (Genesis 9:4, Leviticus 17:14, Acts 15:20).

I understand the sentiment that many of you hold for the refusal of Witnesses to accept blood transfusions. However, many here are under the assumption that JWs are against medical treatment of any sort and would rather die than undergo a procedure. This is a lie. JWs will go above and beyond, like anyone else would, to save themselves and those they love by taking advantage of the best possible treatment available. There&amp;#39;s many sensible reasons, however, why Witnesses refuse blood transfusions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from potential risks of immune reactions and infections from blood transfusions, and the fact that bloodless techniques do not lead to worse outcomes, the most important reason is how our Creator views it. To put it simply, it doesn&amp;#39;t belong to us in the first place (Ezekiel 18:4).
