And it won't stop.\n\nIn Ancient Rome they started the practice of being offered gifts, not soliciting bribes, and it's continued for a while. But genuinely - nowhere in the world have I ever seen (not counting the USA, more credit to our bureaucrats) a government office where you couldn't pay someone to do their job more efficiently.\n\nNow, I am not sure about the technical definition of a bribe, but is it a bribe to pay someone a gratuity for doing a better job? Not sure, really. Think about it - the normal time to do something is two weeks but perhaps you can move to the top of the list if you can make it worth the worker's while to work harder, etc.\n\nFace it. These folks work their way up making almost no money get to a position of authority and want more money. Their own government says, well, take it from those who have it to give. An hour's pay to us is three day's pay to some.
