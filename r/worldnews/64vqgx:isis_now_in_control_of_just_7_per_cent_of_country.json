In Afghanistan they own a sliver of land in the south western part, and in Libya they basically lost all territory when the Libyan National Army retook Sirte. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, Boko Haram has fractured into two factions and have been losing fights and territory to the combined African forces. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Sinai ISIL didn&amp;#39;t have the manpower or equipment to do much, but they seem to have persisted and continue fighting against Egyptian forces there. The Egyptians seem to have bad tactics there that turn the population against them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Yemen they don&amp;#39;t hold that much territory either, but they do pose a threat as there does seem to be a large number of fighters there. They usually do bombings which are pretty effective. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;#39;t know much about what the ISIL provinces in the Philippines or Somalia are doing, but I recall reading that in Somalia they captured a pretty large coastal city last December (?). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "worldnews", "name": "t1_dg5ly3z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492011287.0, "created_utc": 1491982487.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vqgx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vqgx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5p3dw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ShineMcShine", "parent_id": "t1_dg5m5ii", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not even in Libya, not anymore.
