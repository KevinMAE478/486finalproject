I vastly prefer Breezango or Usos or Rhyno/Slater. All they have going for them is they are pretty good technical wrestlers. I&amp;#39;m sorry to say, but in this day and age, that isn&amp;#39;t enough unless you are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fucking good. D Bry had a personality, Rollins can be a great villain, Styles is surprisingly good in talking segments(even if you were to argue his mic skills are shit, I think he falls in the &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fucking good category). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watch NJPW for phenomenal wrestling, and even most of the top wrestlers over there who don&amp;#39;t even speak English have more charisma, and can tell better stories than AA. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also doesn&amp;#39;t help that I don&amp;#39;t think tag wrestling is very fun to watch, unless done a certain way. I can&amp;#39;t stand the tropes of tag wrestling. Hot tags mainly. Tandem moves as well. Especially if the partner comes in randomly to do it, not even from a tag. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it the people behind the characters&amp;#39; fault? Hell I don&amp;#39;t know. I don&amp;#39;t really care, tbh. I was never insulting them personally, just the characters I see. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dgbd32u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492328763.0, "created_utc": 1492299963.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbc4eu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "roadkillv1", "parent_id": "t1_dgb82vo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "hardly their fault. they're amazing in the ring, as talented as the world's greatest tag team were. maybe even more so. but when they put the belts on them, the smackdown tag division was just forgotten about. they never defended them, then they were made to lose them a week before mania and the belts weren't even on the line at the event. i don't think they're overrated at all, they're one of the most entertaining tag teams on the roster, they just haven't been allowed to show that since moving up. instead we've got the god damn usos again (though i'll admit i much prefer them now they're heels than before).", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;hardly their fault. they&amp;#39;re amazing in the ring, as talented as the world&amp;#39;s greatest tag team were. maybe even more so. but when they put the belts on them, the smackdown tag division was just forgotten about. they never defended them, then they were made to lose them a week before mania and the belts weren&amp;#39;t even on the line at the event. i don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re overrated at all, they&amp;#39;re one of the most entertaining tag teams on the roster, they just haven&amp;#39;t been allowed to show that since moving up. instead we&amp;#39;ve got the god damn usos again (though i&amp;#39;ll admit i much prefer them now they&amp;#39;re heels than before).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dgbc4eu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492327405.0, "created_utc": 1492298605.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kake", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kake", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbdzt3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DarthZ3bra", "parent_id": "t1_dgbcrc8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's the same issue with almost every NXT call-up sadly.
