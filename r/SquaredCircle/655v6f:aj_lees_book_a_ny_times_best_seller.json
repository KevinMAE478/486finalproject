It's much more focused on the stigma surrounding mental illness and how she was eventually able to turn that handicap into a form of empowerment. It doesn't really talk about wrestling all that much until the last 60 pages or so. \n\nIt's clear that she was trying to avoid the whole \"shoot\" aspect associated with the typical wrestling book. Aside from her mother and father, she goes out of her way to compliment the people who helped her along the way, while leaving names and specific details out of the negative experiences she had. The only two relationships she specifically mentions are with Trent, (who was the first person she slept with on top of her blaming herself for that breakup), and CM Punk.\n\nFor all we know, her and Lethal ended in a highly volatile way and she wanted to avoid the subject altogether. Maybe she didn't feel it had much bearing on the mental illness focused story she was telling, (which is my guess since she only mentions her first and presumably last relationship with any sort of detail). Maybe the relationship wasn't as serious as a bunch of people who don't know either of them on the Internet assumed it was. \n\nWho knows? I just find it weird that this celebrity ownership mentality leads some to try and dismiss the validity of the whole book over one thing that was allegedly omitted just because we didn't get the gossip we were hoping for. \n\nGood for her though! It's a hilariously fun read that has the ability to go from laugh out loud to horribly sad within the span of a few sentences. I highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling with mental illness, who needs inspiration to push for their dreams in the face of crippling adversity, or someone who wants a glimpse of what it meant to be a Diva in the early 2010's.\n\nI've read about a dozen wrestling books and this is up there as one of my favorites.", "edited": 1492113331.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the Jay Lethal omission:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I loved this book, but a big part of the reason why I did is because it ended up catching me off guard with how little it was focused on wrestling.
