Shit happens. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think one shot to the dome was bad than dont watch Scott Dawson&amp;#39;s indy work. Ive personally been 2 feet away as he turned a guy HE LIKES chest purple and bleeding from chops and german suplexed him seperating guys shoulder. That&amp;#39;s how the guy worked. Didnt intend to kill anyone but that&amp;#39;s just how some people work because they want to protect the business. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jinder went from being a &amp;quot;why did they bother bringing this guy back&amp;quot; to a guy I could see as a real player in the midcard if he sheds the jobber stigma. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But really Jinder is really at a disadvantage. Loses his dream job, works his way back, people start to respect him, he hits someone that the office and the internet adore and signed in part because of the large following. Now Jinder might get shit on and lose his job again. Finn has far more options if WWE falls out. Jinder&amp;#39;s got TNA&amp;#39;s next WWE castaway to look forward to.
