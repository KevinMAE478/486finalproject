I think he has many of the tools young Angle did - great in the ring, good on the mic, can flip between goofy comedy and &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll fucking kill you!!!&amp;quot; intensity at the drop of a hat. All he really lacks so far is the right push/gimmick to really bring out his top quality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I can imagine his interactions with Bryan could be great fun, and if they decided to push him, a feud with AJ Styles could bring out some ***** matches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also think separating him out from Lana is a good idea. Let him stand on his own two feet for a while and see how he does - he&amp;#39;s not really needed her talking for him for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dg5o4hs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492017982.0, "created_utc": 1491989182.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vk09", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ze97", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "erock142", "parent_id": "t3_64vk09", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "By far.
