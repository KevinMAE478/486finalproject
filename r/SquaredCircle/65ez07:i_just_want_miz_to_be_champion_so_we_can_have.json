He&amp;#39;ll step in and face down Brock when it&amp;#39;s safe but get the heck out of dodge when Brock is angry/dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite his goading, he got people motivated and believing they could do it. So when it comes time he challenges, saying he&amp;#39;s been spending the last X months studying Brock and knows how to beat him. Brock is un-amused, but to the surprise of everyone: All of the previous challengers show up to be in The Miz&amp;#39;s corner, heels and faces alike. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On some level it&amp;#39;s become more important that Brock lose than that someone singularly win. The faces are keeping Miz pumped. More importantly the heels are nipping at Brock, keeping him off balance, and overall helping Miz behind the Ref&amp;#39;s back. It&amp;#39;s chaos. Heyman is screaming bloody murder. There&amp;#39;s a chair shot, a fire extinguisher, Brock is taking finishers and suplexing people because he can&amp;#39;t watch five guys at once. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the dust clears, The Miz&amp;#39; limp body is thrown on top of Brock&amp;#39;s. The Miz is champion. We find out the following night, with Miz in a (faked) full-body cast, that Brock and Heyman were so confident they didn&amp;#39;t pay the fee to empower the rematch clause. So Lesnar can&amp;#39;t challenge for a while and The Miz is Universal Champion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now he&amp;#39;s just gotta keep it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dga3xi9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492249783.0, "created_utc": 1492220983.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ez07", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ez07", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9whzi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 52, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WhatSheOrder", "parent_id": "t1_dg9w0pq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "INTENSITY \n\nINTEGRITY\n\nINHUMAN AMOUNTS OF BEAR TRANQUILIZERS", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTENSITY &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;INTEGRITY&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;INHUMAN AMOUNTS OF BEAR TRANQUILIZERS&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dg9whzi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492239804.0, "created_utc": 1492211004.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 52}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9w0pq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "voneahhh", "parent_id": "t1_dg9uh2y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He might know someone on that show who can hook him up with bear tranquilizer.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He might know someone on that show who can hook him up with bear tranquilizer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dg9w0pq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492239158.0, "created_utc": 1492210358.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ez07", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga2kki", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheyCallMeDouly", "parent_id": "t1_dg9uh2y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "what about the Big Dawg?!?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;what about the Big Dawg?!?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dga2kki", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492247913.0, "created_utc": 1492219113.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9uh2y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 80, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Anonim97", "parent_id": "t1_dg9pcng", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I wanted to say he could somehow cheat his way up to the title, but then I remembered that Lesnar is champion.\n\nYeeaaahh...
