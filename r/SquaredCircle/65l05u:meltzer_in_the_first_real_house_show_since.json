It was full out hostility.\n\nThere was a very real rejection by the smart crowds and they tried very very hard to sabotage the Super Cena push by booing him at just about every PPV or 'smart' town show....\n\nBut after Wrestlemania 23 and his defeat of Shawn Michaels, it really felt like that same passion fizzled right out. \n\nI could be wrong because honestly I gave up watching wrestling shortly after the Benoit Murders .... But Cena fatigue was also a major reason I lost interest in the product entirely and why I preferred Smackdown.\n\nIt felt like the fans were just at the point where it was beaten in to them that Cena wasn't going anywhere.

They WANT to like wrestling, they WANT to watch WWE but Roman is just such a bother that people are lashing out whatever way they can to get that point across. \n\nRAW has an insanely stacked roster but it feels redundant when you know nobody will ever be booked as equal to Roman or Brock. It makes it appear like there is a 'glass ceiling and that's infuriating to a lot of fans. Especially when Roman is not exactly Hulk Hogan or Steve Austin.\n\nThat's my take on it. And I'm sure Vince feels like if he just rides it out, people will get tired of booing THE BIG DOG  (which IMO makes him sound so much more infinitely uncool) that they just give up.\n\nWell see in this next year how the ratings go. RAW has been trending downward for years. Smackdown has only trended upwards. I don't think there's a coincidence there.\n\nI'm just about ready to give up RAW entirely to watch only Smackdown due to the fact their 3 top babyfaces are ACTUALLY OVER (AJ/Dean/Nakamura) and even if they don't hit on every single story they run, I don't feel like anyone is going to run into the booking wall of ROMAN/BROCK/CENA MUST GO OVER.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe he&amp;#39;s getting booed now in the same way Cena was getting boos around Wrestlemania 22.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that years Wrestlemania he was met with &amp;#39;Fuck You Cena chants while wrestling the &amp;#39;smart wrestling fans&amp;#39; anti Christ at the time Triple H. It was full out hostility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a very real rejection by the smart crowds and they tried very very hard to sabotage the Super Cena push by booing him at just about every PPV or &amp;#39;smart&amp;#39; town show....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after Wrestlemania 23 and his defeat of Shawn Michaels, it really felt like that same passion fizzled right out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong because honestly I gave up watching wrestling shortly after the Benoit Murders .... But Cena fatigue was also a major reason I lost interest in the product entirely and why I preferred Smackdown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It felt like the fans were just at the point where it was beaten in to them that Cena wasn&amp;#39;t going anywhere. After 3 straight Wrestlemanias of World Title matches and no end in sight to his title reign (remember he only lost it due to injury in 2007) ... the reactions never quite reached that same hostility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roman may just be at that same level where people are just furious over the push. They WANT to like wrestling, they WANT to watch WWE but Roman is just such a bother that people are lashing out whatever way they can to get that point across. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RAW has an insanely stacked roster but it feels redundant when you know nobody will ever be booked as equal to Roman or Brock. It makes it appear like there is a &amp;#39;glass ceiling and that&amp;#39;s infuriating to a lot of fans. Especially when Roman is not exactly Hulk Hogan or Steve Austin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my take on it. And I&amp;#39;m sure Vince feels like if he just rides it out, people will get tired of booing THE BIG DOG  (which IMO makes him sound so much more infinitely uncool) that they just give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well see in this next year how the ratings go. RAW has been trending downward for years. Smackdown has only trended upwards. I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a coincidence there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just about ready to give up RAW entirely to watch only Smackdown due to the fact their 3 top babyfaces are ACTUALLY OVER (AJ/Dean/Nakamura) and even if they don&amp;#39;t hit on every single story they run, I don&amp;#39;t feel like anyone is going to run into the booking wall of ROMAN/BROCK/CENA MUST GO OVER.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dgbbbbt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492326231.0, "created_utc": 1492297431.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l05u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l05u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l05u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l05u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l05u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l05u", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbzwvm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nmt2013", "parent_id": "t1_dgbfjzg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Crispy!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crispy!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dgbzwvm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492376164.0, "created_utc": 1492347364.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbfjzg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wearethat", "parent_id": "t1_dgb9hgb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Woooooo!
