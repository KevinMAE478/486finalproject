Even as a Cena fan, I can still understand the &amp;quot;John Cena sucks&amp;quot; chants in line with his music, because it&amp;#39;s catchy. But like even so, stuff like that, or even the &amp;quot;You Suck&amp;quot; chants toward Angle, even though the crowd loves him, still seem kind of out of place. I just chalk it up because it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;the thing to do&amp;quot;, and it&amp;#39;s nostalgia/catchy, but it makes the chant less &amp;quot;meaningful&amp;quot; IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m just an alternative alternate fan, who boos when I normally cheer, and cums when I normally boo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dgbei3b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492330740.0, "created_utc": 1492301940.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kvii", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbl258", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SoSaltyDoe", "parent_id": "t1_dgb5939", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 1, "body": "For a lot of people, the Summer of Punk and Summerslam 2011 was the *only* time in recent history that the WWE was *really fucking good*.
