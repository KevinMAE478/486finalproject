He has a great attitude, he&amp;#39;s confident but knows he has to improve, and he&amp;#39;s got some great mentors in Big Show, Kane, and the  Wyatt&amp;#39;s. He seems to have a good grasp on what he should be, a monster who can spring the occasional surprise move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I do find a little funny or strange I guess, is that this is a guy who has been handpicked by Vince, brought up to the main roster very quickly and given a push, and yet he is getting cheers while Roman is getting booed. Now, dont get me wrong, he hasnt had the championships that Roman&amp;#39;s had, and you could argue his character is easier to establish, but I do find it a little odd that there are people who boo Roman for being pushed too much too soon but will cheer Braun even though the same thing (to a slightly lesser degree) is happening to him. Having said that, even though I like both wrestlers, I do find Braun&amp;#39;s character more entertaining right now.
