Jumbo looked bad, too, as he wrestled like a guy trying not to hurt a friend, throwing half-power suplexes and just trying to score a roll-up victory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dg9keub", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492224651.0, "created_utc": 1492195851.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bdws", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9widx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "somethingtolose", "parent_id": "t1_dg9770z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If bret was in Japan for an extended stay with those guys he could have adapted to their style, but his career would have been way shorter.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If bret was in Japan for an extended stay with those guys he could have adapted to their style, but his career would have been way shorter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dg9widx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492239820.0, "created_utc": 1492211020.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9770z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LongWangDynasty", "parent_id": "t1_dg8zk2r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You are being very generous.

Baba sent Jumbo Tsuruta and Yoshiaki Yatsu to face Kengo Kimura and Osamu Kido, Tenryu and Tiger Mask (Misawa) to face Choshu and George Takano, and Stan Hansen to face Vader in the infamous match where Vader&amp;#39;s eye socket gets caved in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In return for that favour, New Japan sent a couple of matches to the AJPW/WWF show in April. The New Japan guys only worked each other since the show was filmed to air on Nippon TV and NJPW had an exclusive deal with TV-ASAHI. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The New Japan/All Japan friendliness continued for a few months - Hansen worked a few shows for New Japan in June, and Steve Williams &amp;amp; Bam Bam Bigelow were loaned to All Japan. The relationship was supposed to be them working together to fight SWS and WWF, but it fell apart when Dr Death decided he was staying with Baba.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dg90h4z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492197034.0, "created_utc": 1492168234.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bdws", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bdws", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bdws", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bdws", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bdws", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bdws", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8zdej", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 20, "report_reasons": null, "author": "brokenbatarang", "parent_id": "t1_dg8y6ts", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dibiase was a big star in Japan right before debuting for the WWF, so that also made the match worse.
