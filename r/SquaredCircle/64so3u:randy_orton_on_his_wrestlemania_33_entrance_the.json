No need to change it if it works. The Hardy's music is also stock that gets used everywhere.\n\nI would say in general though entrances tend to be pretty un-inspired considering the layout of the stage the options are basically limitless but only a few wrestlers really take advantage of all the trons (New Day/Miz) or have grand entrances (Balor). I mean even back in the day Gangrel elevated slowly out of the floor surrounded by fire, and that was Gangrel! \n\nThough I will say I'm biased since I prefer WWE having practical effect elements (just look at how great Finn/Wyatt's entrances are compared to most of the roster and all they're doing is turning the lights on and off), and more organic, less perfected over produced camera work. \n\n[This is one of Okada's least complicated entrances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RvrYzvO6mM) and it still works incredibly well. Some CO2, some money, and camera work that is built around him instead of having him completely play up for the camera makes him feel like a big deal. \n\nBy comparison this NWO entrance  [is one of the best of all time]( https://youtu.be/SHqBPw5HYDU?t=124) but even when you break it down it's really simple. The camera just follows the NWO from them getting out of their limo and then you get that amazing shot when it follow Rodman out to the entrance ramp with Hogan already out there, posing for the crowd, smoke effects going off, and pyro going off the distance. \n\nDespite the fact that this obviously had a ton of production going into it it feels incredibly natural. Used one camera through the whole thing, used camera angles that weren't used over and over to the point of being a science, Hogan and Rodman only played up to the cameras when they felt like it which let them come off as bigger stars because of it.\n\nI love the creative opportunities the trons add but I can't help but feel some more organic, less overly produced camera work, and some practical effects could go a long way.

No need to change it if it works. The Hardy&amp;#39;s music is also stock that gets used everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would say in general though entrances tend to be pretty un-inspired considering the layout of the stage the options are basically limitless but only a few wrestlers really take advantage of all the trons (New Day/Miz) or have grand entrances (Balor). I mean even back in the day Gangrel elevated slowly out of the floor surrounded by fire, and that was Gangrel! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though I will say I&amp;#39;m biased since I prefer WWE having practical effect elements (just look at how great Finn/Wyatt&amp;#39;s entrances are compared to most of the roster and all they&amp;#39;re doing is turning the lights on and off), and more organic, less perfected over produced camera work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RvrYzvO6mM\"&gt;This is one of Okada&amp;#39;s least complicated entrances&lt;/a&gt; and it still works incredibly well. Some CO2, some money, and camera work that is built around him instead of having him completely play up for the camera makes him feel like a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By comparison this NWO entrance  &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/SHqBPw5HYDU?t=124\"&gt;is one of the best of all time&lt;/a&gt; but even when you break it down it&amp;#39;s really simple.
