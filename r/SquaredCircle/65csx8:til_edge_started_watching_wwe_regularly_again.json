Pretty much stayed off and on until Aces and 8s, and stopped when AJ left. Watched a couple of random ROH and NJPW matches after that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When AJ Styles walked through that curtain and down to the ring for the Royal Rumble, I watched WWE for the first time in all that time. He is the only reason I even considered giving it a chance. I&amp;#39;m not a regular watcher, but I try to check out as much of what he&amp;#39;s doing as I can. Makes it easier that they have other guys I like there too, and they aren&amp;#39;t all jokes, like I thought WWE would make them. This run by AJ has semi made me a wrestling fan again, and that&amp;#39;s something I can admit to not thinking would happen, as much as it will always be in my heart&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dgb6ty9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492319875.0, "created_utc": 1492291075.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65csx8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9e9g8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "trevor_daniles", "parent_id": "t3_65csx8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I read a lot of twitter comments that say the same exact thing.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read a lot of twitter comments that say the same exact thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SquaredCircle", "name": "t1_dg9e9g8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492217462.0, "created_utc": 1492188662.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sljg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65csx8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9rxf3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Scizzler", "parent_id": "t3_65csx8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "controversiality": 1, "body": "You're the type that believes everything you read.
