I think if you send in your gently used, brand name clothing items for &amp;quot;consideration&amp;quot; by ThredUp, if there are pieces that they feel they cannot sell that would be profitable for all involved (them), it would appear they don&amp;#39;t send that clothing back, even though they don&amp;#39;t sell it. The person who sent it in would have to pay return shipping to get back the clothes ThredUp can&amp;#39;t sell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which, I wonder if they get a collective tax write-off for donating all the clothing they can&amp;#39;t sell, but people won&amp;#39;t pay to get back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;#39;s essentially online consignment, but to be honest, if I&amp;#39;m getting rid of clothes and maybe ThredUp could sell it, if they can&amp;#39;t, 99% of the time it&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;m personally going to miss the clothing, since I would have rather sold it than kept it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, if I say, sent in five gently-used J.Crew sweaters I paid $80 each for, and ThredUp shrugged and said, &amp;quot;Oh noooo, we just can&amp;#39;t.... there&amp;#39;s a stain .... yeah, a stain on two of them, and some piling on one sweater, and the other two are out of season. Eeeessh oh and shipping back in a flat-rate is going to be $20.&amp;quot; It makes you wonder if they are gaslighting you, hoping you won&amp;#39;t pay to have them sent back, so they can keep them in some way (or an employee keeps them after the sender rejects paying for the return shipping).
