You can end up with dead spots in your park and no matter what you throw in there it&amp;#39;s really difficult to induce people to actually go to that section rather than an area that&amp;#39;s already really popular. Which does present a challenge but there&amp;#39;s no explanation for why it&amp;#39;s like that so it isn&amp;#39;t something you can easily fix. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed playing it for a few days (like super addicted 4+ hour sessions). But because of the lack of challenge my enjoyment and interest quickly petered out. In my opinion if you enjoy building custom buildings and placing things to make stuff pretty you&amp;#39;ll likely enjoy the game. If you want to have the actual feeling of running a theme park this game probably isn&amp;#39;t for you (at least at full price).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GameDeals", "name": "t1_dg52h5r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491980010.0, "created_utc": 1491951210.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4n7ck", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BongAppetite", "parent_id": "t3_64s5vv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GameDeals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "thanks for your helpful replies. anyone willing to explain a bit deeper on the issues with the management?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;thanks for your helpful replies. anyone willing to explain a bit deeper on the issues with the management?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GameDeals", "name": "t1_dg4n7ck", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491962515.0, "created_utc": 1491933715.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s5vv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s5vv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s5vv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s5vv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5jssr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "forth_floor", "parent_id": "t1_dg4qo7o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GameDeals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It did improve management but just made it playable.
