Oh, and a sister thread on r/Fantasy: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/64zyaa/humble_book_bundle_brandon_sanderson/\n\nBrandon Sanderson is actually /u/mistborn and has done AMAs on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5t9nyy/iamonce_againa_novelist_named_brandon_sanderson/\n\nPersonally, a am a bit of a fan (I think I like him more than any other fantasy author currently publishing his/her works). What I like about his works\n\n- He is basically setting the direction of modern high magic fantasy single handed\n- Avoids the whole \"grey\" and \"grimdark\" trope.\n- Unlike other fantasy authors (GRRM, Rothfuss) he puts out works consistently and regularly, keeping up with his commitments to fans. What other authors [updates his fans with the current progress of his works](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/5zidxz/oathbringer_spoilers_stormlight_three_update_7/)?\n- His books have absolutely amazing endings/conclusions. Some authors can write a book that's really amazing all the way through, most write a book that's really good at the beginning and just \"meh\" or \"good enough\" at the end. Sanderson's endings are absolutely amazing but I can't give much away without spoiling his works. When you finish the book, what normally sticks with you? Generally, the last thing you read. I can't remember disliking a Sanderson book or even feeling ambivalent about it after I put it down.\n- Unlike most fantasy authors, he is quite scientific about magic. Most of his books have a clearly defined and unique magic system. No \"wave hand, magic happens\", but instead \"consume stormlight, change how the force of gravitation applies to an object\" or \"digest metal and you can push metals by thinking\". Look up Sanderson's First Law sometime.\n- And this only really applies if you already like his works, but all his fantasy works take place in a shared universe, called Cosmere, with a shared history. Some (currently) minor characters  (Hoid, Khriss) appear in places they really shouldn't be and are probably going to play a major part in overarching story.\n- His works cover a whole bunch of sub-genres. Want high fantasy? Stormlight Archives. Want steampunk? Mistborn Era 2. Want to read about a sword that wants to destroy evil but doesn't actually understand the concept of evil? Sanderson's got you covered.\n\nSome things that may make you avoid Sanderson:\n\n- You are looking for stories primarily driven by characters. In Sanderon's works, the characters are present and definitely drive the plot, but magic and worldbuilding as just as important. I think he's getting better at it, especially if you compare Mistborn Era 1 with Mistborn Era 2.\n- Sanderson's not a Hemmingway or Rothfuss. His books aren't the sort of things you want to read if you want to be blown away by the prose. He uses simple words and sentences (intentionally, as he explained in a lecture) to make sure the focus is on the story, not the prose.", "edited": 1492033044.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an entire reddit thread devoted to that question: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1l4k80/what_is_reddits_opinion_on_brandon_sandersons/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1l4k80/what_is_reddits_opinion_on_brandon_sandersons/&lt;/a&gt;.
