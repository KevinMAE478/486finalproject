I paid $20 during an &amp;quot;Anniversary sale.&amp;quot; It wasn&amp;#39;t a game when my friend paid, and it wasn&amp;#39;t even a game when I paid. Just now, years later is it slowly lurching towards something more than a glorified tech demo. It would be perfectly reasonable that people who bought in early feel a bit jilted by the fact others got it cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a lot of comments here say Astroneer is severely lacking in content. There is such a thing as doing a sale too early (look at the Humble Botanicula Debut) and it is very easy to do that when you&amp;#39;re still in Early Access and your game is just a framework. If I&amp;#39;m paying for what amounts to a demo, I&amp;#39;d at least hope that price remained stable for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GameDeals", "name": "t1_dgbi3xq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492335922.0, "created_utc": 1492307122.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbgs4v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Deceptichum", "parent_id": "t1_dgbcq8u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GameDeals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What a terrible, self-entitled community. \"It's not fair, how dare others get it cheaper than I paid\".", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a terrible, self-entitled community. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not fair, how dare others get it cheaper than I paid&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GameDeals", "name": "t1_dgbgs4v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492333988.0, "created_utc": 1492305188.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65k5gg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbps5w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Asmero", "parent_id": "t1_dgbcq8u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GameDeals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you, bit gutted though  lol", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you, bit gutted though  lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GameDeals", "name": "t1_dgbps5w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492348046.0, "created_utc": 1492319246.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbcq8u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bevjo", "parent_id": "t1_dgbaco8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GameDeals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sale was unintentional;
