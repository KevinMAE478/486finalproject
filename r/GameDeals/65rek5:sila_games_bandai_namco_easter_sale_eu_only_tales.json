And a lot of people don&amp;#39;t want to jump to a second game of a franchise without having played the first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If someone is interested in a Monster Hunter like game, he should stay away from God Eater&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No. As someone who really likes Monster Hunter games, God Eater is a fun and worthwhile addition to the stack. And the fact that they released the game on PC makes it even better. Don&amp;#39;t needlessly scare people away from the games because &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t like it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from the other subjective points, I&amp;#39;ll say that the multiplayer was flawless for me and I&amp;#39;ve had the game since release.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GameDeals", "name": "t1_dgdfjpp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492461872.0, "created_utc": 1492433072.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rek5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rek5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdhuev", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dancingstein", "parent_id": "t1_dgdcc16", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GameDeals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "All of them are fun, I can recommend you starting with the oldest title, though Monster Hunter Freedom Unite seems like a good start to the series, if you don't mind the graphics.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of them are fun, I can recommend you starting with the oldest title, though Monster Hunter Freedom Unite seems like a good start to the series, if you don&amp;#39;t mind the graphics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GameDeals", "name": "t1_dgdhuev", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492465708.0, "created_utc": 1492436908.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdcc16", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zunawhyyoudothis", "parent_id": "t1_dgdbool", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GameDeals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What monster hunter games do you recommend?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What monster hunter games do you recommend?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GameDeals", "name": "t1_dgdcc16", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492454054.0, "created_utc": 1492425254.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rek5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdekz9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NoNonsenseNomad", "parent_id": "t1_dgdbool", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GameDeals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm going to agree to disagree.
