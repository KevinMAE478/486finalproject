I have absolutely no desire for a PS4 outside of being able to play the newer Uncharted games. The PS4 can&amp;#39;t play PS3 or PS2 games. That was a huge reason I bought a PS3 on launch - the early models had an actual PS2 processor on the board. Fortunately, after 15 years that thing is still ticking but I expect the disc drive may fail and it will only be harder to source replacements as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GameDeals", "name": "t1_dgav4vl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492303962.0, "created_utc": 1492275162.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d4xi", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgavgd7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KevBago", "parent_id": "t1_dgagek0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GameDeals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yup, I own an Xbox One.
