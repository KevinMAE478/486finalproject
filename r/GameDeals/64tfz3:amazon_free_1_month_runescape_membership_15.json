I guess I shouldn't assume that because it's not a big problem for me it's not a large issue for others. I can understand your frustration in those situations, I guess it's just one of those things that is part of learning a boss/rotation. I think my personal biggest frustrations with the tick system come with things like the movement issues you mentioned, but those are usually only fatal at places like telos. \n\nThat's understandable, it definitely became a lot more challenging to partake in PvE, and PvP was killed off. Unfortunately with the survey of quitting members/players in RS3 before EOC, most people said they were quitting because of stale combat.\n\nI'll admit I was really frustrated with EOC at first, because I was really big into PKing and staking. Once I actually got into bossing and saw the full potential of the new combat system I got instantly hooked though, especially with the new bosses in GWD2 and things like ROTS. It's just as much fun as I used to have pking, with a lot less stress and people raging at me. \n\nThe new combat system personally added a lot to the game for me, I used to hate slayer and dungeoneering because of how the slow combat based around weapon specs and flicking made it kind of tedious repetition. Now, I actually ended up enjoying dungeoneering and making it to 99, and at about level 110~ slayer if we're tracking virtual levels.

I guess I shouldn&amp;#39;t assume that because it&amp;#39;s not a big problem for me it&amp;#39;s not a large issue for others. I can understand your frustration in those situations, I guess it&amp;#39;s just one of those things that is part of learning a boss/rotation. I think my personal biggest frustrations with the tick system come with things like the movement issues you mentioned, but those are usually only fatal at places like telos. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s understandable, it definitely became a lot more challenging to partake in PvE, and PvP was killed off. Unfortunately with the survey of quitting members/players in RS3 before EOC, most people said they were quitting because of stale combat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll admit I was really frustrated with EOC at first, because I was really big into PKing and staking. Once I actually got into bossing and saw the full potential of the new combat system I got instantly hooked though, especially with the new bosses in GWD2 and things like ROTS.
