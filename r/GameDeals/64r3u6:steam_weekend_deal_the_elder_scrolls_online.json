I wrote this review earlier on steam:\n\nOh boy, how to talk about my new obsession\u2026\n\nElder Scrolls Online has really got its hooks in me, and I\u2019m not an MMO guy at all. In fact, I usually get frustrated and bored before getting too far into these types of games. There is a ridiculous amount of price to content ratio here even if you pick up just the base edition, and it would take forever to describe everything I liked or disliked in such a massive game. So, as a non MMO player, I will list what issues I have with the majority of them and how ESO fixes or avoids these issues.\n\n1) Boring, Tab Targeting Combat\nAnyone who has played WoW remembers the frustration that came from being 40 feet away from a wild boar whose attack still manages to hit you because his attack was already queued up. The combat in the majority of MMOs is usually a static, detached affair, watching from afar, barely paying attention while numbers ping away. ESO\u2019s combat is a much more input driven and reaction based system. Left click, and you attack. Right click, and you block. If an enemy is about to attack and you\u2019re out of range or hiding behind a rock? They miss, as to be expected. A giant storm atronarch fires a charged lightning bolt at your face? Dodge roll out of the way and avoid the damage if you're quick enough. This isn\u2019t the only MMO to have an action based combat system, but it serves the game well and keeps fights interesting. During the more intense fights I am at the edge of my seat, spamming healing spells, rolling away from danger, and interrupting enemy casts with well timed bash attacks. As good as Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim were, the combat system are the weakest aspect of these games. ESO\u2019s combat is very good for an MMO, but would be considered dull in a single player RPG, in my opinion. However, with ESO's variety of movement skills, dodge rolls, and varied abilities I can safely say that the combat in this game is definitely better than the combat in main series Elder Scrolls games, and anyone who disagrees with me needs to go back and replay vanilla Skyrim and remember just how bad that game\u2019s combat really is. There\u2019s a good reason why \u201cStealth Archer\u201d is a running joke in the series, turning the game into a stealth based high critical damage FPS just makes the awful combat pass more quickly, which is sad considering that the most fun form of combat is also the one that gets it over with the fastest.\n\n2) Generic Collectathon questing\n\u201cCollect 50 bear hides\u201d quests are the bane of many MMOs, and while ESO definitely isn\u2019t without a few of these quests, the majority of the content tries to tell a story within them. As superficial as this is, the voice work and dialogue options sell these mini stories well, although some better than others. Some quests are also surprisingly compelling, it is clear that Zenimax Online has tried hard to make their world one that\u2019s believable and immersive, which is commendable. Despite the effort they put into the writing and storytelling, if you rush through all of the quest content to level up quickly I can see you getting burnt out pretty quickly, which leads to my next point.\n\n3) Level Grinding\nMany MMOs only let you do the \u201cend game content\u201d when you hit max level. This has led to the phenomenon of many games being filled with \u201cpower levelers\u201d as players try and get to the \u201cReal Game\u201d as fast as possible. Remember WoW\u2019s Chinese power leveling economy? With ESO\u2019s One Tamriel update, everything in the world scales to your character\u2019s level. When I first heard about this, I was pretty upset, since this mean that even the crappy mudcrabs from the starter level will still take a couple of hits to kill, despite your character's level. It is admittedly jarring to see a character covered in flames and glass armor struggling to kill a measly wild wolf. However, after playing through some of the vast content offered, I understand now why they added this level scaling mechanic to the game. Since the content scales, from level 10 onward you can start doing the massive Alliance PVP and the four man dungeons, even playing alongside Level 50s and above. This means that even as a casual player I can get into some pretty challenging dungeon crawls and massive PVP battles at my own leisure, which is something in other MMOs I would have to grind levels to get to, by which time I would have most likely have lost interest.\n\n4) Class/Role Restrictions\nMost MMOs have very strict classes with little room for experimentation. While the holy trinity of Tank, DPS and Healer is present in ESO, the way weapon, class, guild, and armor skill lines are delineated mean that anybody can make any kind of crazy character combo they want. Want to make a Khajitt Sorcerer wearing heavy armor and shooting arrows and lightning bolts alternatively? Go for it! Want to try a sneaky Orc Nightblade who heals his teammates and maims his enemies as a support class? Totally viable! Obviously if you want to min/max there are definitely optimal class, weapon, armor and race combinations to choose, but the freedom to experiment and the ease of refunding skill points means that you are allowed to experiment with unique character combinations without fear of ruining a build and wasting your time leveling. I am currently attempting to make a Breton Templar Tank who also heals on occasion, but I couldn't resist getting the skill that allowed me to hurl javelins of pure light at long ranges, sniping mobs from far away. One thing I would recommend is that when you create a character, decide from the beginning to either put 90% of your stat points into Magicka OR Stamina, not both. Unfortunately, splitting your stat points between both will make you a jack of all trades, but master of none. \n\n5) Subscription Based Payment Plans\nOnce you buy ESO, it is yours to play whenever you want. When I tried out Eve Online (and boy was that an experience) I always felt a constant pressure to play the game because of its subscription model. My brain would tell me, \u201cNO ROCKET LEAGUE FOR YOU, MUST GET YOUR $15 PER MONTH WORTH.\u201d In ESO, the game is playable without a monthly subscription fee, so there is no such nagging voice in my head. There is an ESO+ option which lets you access all the smaller DLC and a separate crafting bag in game, leading to more convenient inventory management. However, you can buy this DLC separately, and with eight character slots and a shared bank space, it will be a long, long time until you can\u2019t just manage your inventory through mules. I really think Buy to Play is the \u201csweet spot\u201d of MMOs, compared to Free to Play which may lead to some purchasable items giving an advantage, Buy to Play manages to fund the developers without creating a need to monetize their product further.\n\nI have yet to talk about the addicting crafting system which lets you specialize in six different disciplines, or the chaotic massive battles that is the Alliance PVP, or the excellent add-on support which allows you to customize the game's already slick interface to your heart's content with user generated tools. With the player count rising lately, plus the large Morrowind Expansion\u2019s release this year, I can see this game having a long, healthy future. Are there more hardcore MMOs on the market? Undoubtedly. Are there \u201cbetter\u201d ones? Probably, but for a player like myself who wants nothing more than to explore the lands of Tamriel at their own leisure, this is the best MMO I have ever played.
