There&amp;#39;s a lot of DLC for these. With that said, Paradox does add a lot of stuff to the base game for free that allows you to get a lot of the benefits of the DLC/expansions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are really only a few of the main DLC that you should get. If you were to get the &lt;a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/sub/103526/\"&gt;Five Year Anniversary Edition&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;re pretty much set (although, I&amp;#39;m kind of surprised that they excluded Sons of Abraham and The Republic from that collection).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, as a person who has done no research and is just presented with the steam page for these games, you&amp;#39;re right. It&amp;#39;s daunting and pricey and would push you to another game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CK2 is fantastic. I love it, but there&amp;#39;s a big learning curve and so much extra content that it&amp;#39;s enough to drive people away. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GameDeals", "name": "t1_dg57ur8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491987212.0, "created_utc": 1491958412.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64siiw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64siiw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64siiw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwx3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64siiw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5dzjm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cos1ne", "parent_id": "t1_dg5acrd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GameDeals", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Note: If one person has DLC for a paradox title and they host the game, all players have access to those DLC features in a multiplayer game.
