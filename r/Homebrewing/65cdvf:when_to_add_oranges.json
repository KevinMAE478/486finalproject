It's the citrus oils in the zest that will pack the most punch.  But, if you are dead-set on doing it, here's how I did it in a fresh orange wit (and why).\n\nZest 5 or so oranges per five gallons. Remove the fruit from the rind; I found a grapefruit spoon to be the best for this. Place the fruit and zest in a straining bag for fermentation. Heat fruit and peels in 8 cups of water to 160 degrees and then turn off the heat. Let it steep as it cools.  What you want to do is pasteurize the orange zest and pulp/juice, but not boil it as that will extract some off flavors and cloudiness.\n\nFerment using a Belgian Wit yeast; I used WLP400, and then use .5 to 1 oz crushed corriander at flameout.  This really helps bring out the fruit/citrus elements that frankly, all that heat and alcohol are going to slaughter.\n\nOnce you have cooled your wort, add the fruit/zest/water that has been cooling on your stovetop.  You may want to bring down your wort to even cooler than usual, say 65 degrees, to offset the still-warm orange/water.\n\nThe above process is mostly why I use the dried orange peel.  So much easier to rip open a bag and just tip in how much orange you want than zesting all those oranges.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, what the earlier user said was true - the zest, the outer layer from the peel of the orange, is what you want.
