The system that they were trying to get me to put together involved attaching 3/4 inch vinyl tubing to the copper tubing on both sides and attaching them with hose clamps. Then, on the input side of the vinyl tubing, I would attach a 5/8 ID x 3/4 in MIP hose barb ($6.21). After that, I would attach a 3/4 inch coupler and fitting to my kitchen faucet ($13.49), and finally a 3/4 female coupling to attach both parts together ($7.24).
