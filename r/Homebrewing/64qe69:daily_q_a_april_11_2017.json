I started my first ever brew on Friday(Midwest bucket kit, pale ale recipe). So far so good, lots of bubbles in my blowoff jar! I was reading about cold crashing and had a couple of questions though.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Should I cold crash?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At what point in the brew should I start cold crashing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What temperature should it be at and how long do I cold crash? Will a regular fridge work?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Will there be enough yeast left in the beer to bottle condition?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg4mqq9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491962006.0, "created_utc": 1491933206.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qe69", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qe69", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg546gm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "knowitallz", "parent_id": "t1_dg4lm8x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "https://byo.com/stories/issue/item/3282-back-sweetening-hard-cider", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://byo.com/stories/issue/item/3282-back-sweetening-hard-cider\"&gt;https://byo.com/stories/issue/item/3282-back-sweetening-hard-cider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg546gm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491982307.0, "created_utc": 1491953507.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qe69", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qe69", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qe69", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qe69", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qe69", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qe69", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4sri7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cemetary", "parent_id": "t1_dg4sic5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Haha that's true mate, touch wood.

It's overwhelming at first if you don't know what's what but it's really pretty straightforward once you get how everything works together.\n\n- You need a CO2 bottle of basically any size (5 is typical, but I'd get a 10 or 20 if I had to do it again since filling costs don't scale linearly so you're cost to fill a 10lb might only be 20% more than filling a 5lb, for example)\n\n- You need a CO2 regulator to connect to the tank to reduce the pressure to usable levels.

Yours is soooooo tiny at 1.75 gallons. That's only 14 pints. That's a single evening for me with another friend. I would say not worth owning a keg setup at that size for regular consumption. The keg you list is better served as a \"bring to a party or camping\" size than anything you'd want to drink from regularly. \n\n- You'll need a liquid quick disconnect fitting to fit onto the dispensing post on the keg. \n\n- You'll need beer line (forget the balancing calculators - 10 feet is perfect for 95% of setups) which will connect to your quick disconnect. \n\n- You need a faucet. This is the only part that gets a little \"funky\" because it has multiple pieces and ways to put it together. The most common is a tailpiece (your hose connects into) connected to a shank (shank is the piece that fits through a barrier like a fridge or freezer wall or lid, piece of wood in the case of a wooden collar, a physical wall, garbage can, whatever...) the shank and tailpiece are held together tightly by a hex beer nut. Then there is usually a black plastic cover that hides the hole the shank went through to give a \"finished\" look, then the faucet connects to the shank (on the other size of the barrier, along with the cover I just mentioned). \n\nHere is a total faucet/cover/shank/nut/tailpiece setup:  [CLICK HERE](https://www.williamsbrewing.com/BEER-FAUCET-WITH-SHANK-P76.aspx)\n\nNow, the faucet setup you linked to is not meant to connect through anything (by the way, the \"going through something\" is called a \"pass-through\" setup). It goes directly from faucet to keg - again, perfect for portability and camping and parties but horrible if you want to keep your keg someplace cold and pour the beer from somewhere else (like on the other side of a fridge). \n\nAnother method is a tower - this is like you see at bars where the faucet is connected to an upright chrome tower. I have no experience with this but that's what it's called. \n\nSo you need to decide if you want to connect directly to the keg (good for putting the whole thing in a fridge and taking it out when needed), a tower setup (good for a nice looking bar-style vertical setup on top of a mini fridge, for example), or a pass-through setup (putting the keg in a fridge and the tap on the other side). \n\nOBK (ontario beer kegs) has EXCELLENT photos and part lists to describe each:\n\nPortable: https://www.ontariobeerkegs.com/Faucet_Adapter_Complete_Kit_with_NEW_Cornelius_Keg_p/newkeg-faucet-adpater-kit.htm  \nTower: https://www.ontariobeerkegs.com/Stainless_Steel_Single_Tower_Complete_Kit_p/1tower-kit-complete.htm  \nPass-through: https://www.ontariobeerkegs.com/Deluxe_Single_Tap_Kit_p/deluxekegsingle.htm  \n\nSpeaking of faucets - get Perlick.
