How old the fridge is and if it&amp;#39;s a mini fridge make sure that the compressor is mounted to the top. You&amp;#39;ll see what I mean when you start looking in the mini fridges. There will be a &amp;quot;shelf&amp;quot; towards the back that limits where you and put kegs if it&amp;#39;s mounted to the bottom. If it&amp;#39;s mounted on higher up you can fit a pinlock keg under it. That&amp;#39;s what I do. 2 pinlock kegs in the back and a Ball lock and CO2 tank in the front. Mine was specifically built to be a kegerator, so it has casters on the bottom and a water proof top. It was a craigslist find that I upgraded to a triple tap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also if you dont have a lot of tools I would recommend getting a prebuilt one and upgrading the tower at some point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also i missed the link in the description. It looks a lot like the one I ended up buying, mine was a single tap though. I haven&amp;#39;t had any real problems with it. I would ask for actual pictures of it though... I&amp;#39;m always leery of people who can&amp;#39;t do that. Definitely find out how old it is and how long it&amp;#39;s actually been in use. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much space do you have in your home/apartment?\nDo you move a lot?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg9ddet", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492216460.0, "created_utc": 1492187660.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65coa1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9edmx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sanserif80", "parent_id": "t3_65coa1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I just sold a very similar kegerator for $275 (was asking $300).
