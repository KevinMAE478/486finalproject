I say probably, because, to quote Jeff Goldblum, &amp;quot;Life, uh, finds a way.&amp;quot;  You&amp;#39;re effectively betting that the yeast are too stressed to restart.  That being said it might not bottle condition well (or just slowly) for that reason; yeast are already overworked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re super concerned, you could always dose with campden and then potassium sorbate, but your beer would not bottle condition at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do you mean they will likely produce off-flavours in the beer&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taken to the extreme I imagine it could.  My understanding is that preserved dry yeast don&amp;#39;t have much energy reserves.  When they wake them up they&amp;#39;re hungry; without food they go dormant after a time.  I&amp;#39;m sure taken to an extreme it could cause off flavors, but I&amp;#39;d imagine more likely it just can lead to a slightly more sluggish fermentation start.  I don&amp;#39;t think 15 versus 30 minutes is the culprit here, more just flying by the datasheets from Fermentis and Lavalin and the like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adding pure table sugar or honey to the rehydration might shock the yeast and mess with the metabolic pathways, however.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg8jjwz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492161369.0, "created_utc": 1492132569.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg845by", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Stimpson-J-Cat", "parent_id": "t1_dg7vl49", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks a tonne for your advice, this gives me a lot to consider.
