I have read that pitching at 64 and letting it rise is the thing to do.

Now I'm afraid of fusel alcohol flavors are being created. Is there anything I can do to help this beer from having to much of a solvent flavor? Or is this just a lesson learned and Should I RDWHAHB?\n\nI also just moved the fermenter to the basement which is probably 60F. It got hot today 72F in the apartment at 7 at night.  Probably part of the reason it has risen so quickly. I didn't think to move the fermenter to the basement after pitching last night.....\n\nEdit: this morning the help probe on the side of he fermenter is at 70F. Should I turn up he heater on to make its 72 or 75?

I have read that pitching at 64 and letting it rise is the thing to do.  I became lazy at the end of brew day and pitch at 66F and I also made a starter that ended up being 67 degrees when I pitch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;24 hours later I my temp probe on the side of my bucket is at 76 and the center I&amp;#39;m guess it&amp;#39;s is at least 80. Now I&amp;#39;m afraid of fusel alcohol flavors are being created. Is there anything I can do to help this beer from having to much of a solvent flavor? Or is this just a lesson learned and Should I RDWHAHB?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also just moved the fermenter to the basement which is probably 60F. It got hot today 72F in the apartment at 7 at night.  Probably part of the reason it has risen so quickly.
