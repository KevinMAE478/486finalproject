Cold crash, fine with gelatin, keg, enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my standard easy to brew, easy to drink, easy to wonder where it all went summer beer :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dgbsan7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492353435.0, "created_utc": 1492324635.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kun2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kun2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kun2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kun2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kun2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcm3co", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TapasBear", "parent_id": "t1_dgceov1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Lemon juice, like in those bottles from the store.
