You can do this with a stone and pure O2 canister, dumping the wort into the fermenter through a sieve, or by transferring and then shaking the crap out of your fermentor (being careful not to lose anything...).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, I doubt that shaking or even pouring the wort roughly will add that much oxygen in terms of dissolved ppm. And I also doubt that using a stone and pumping in pure O2 will make that big of a difference on the final product, either, if you have good sanitization practices and fermentation temperature control. I am just not sold that oxygenating is really that important on the home brew scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally don&amp;#39;t worry too much about oxygenating the wort (though maybe I could/should -someone else can chime in here who knows more than I), and instead focus on pitching a healthy culture of yeast and ensuring my fermentation temp. is on point - my beers come out fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: reworded for clarity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dgaz8gx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492309539.0, "created_utc": 1492280739.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ir4w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ir4w", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb0ui0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "geekbozu", "parent_id": "t1_dgaz6yz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The concern was about over aeration!
