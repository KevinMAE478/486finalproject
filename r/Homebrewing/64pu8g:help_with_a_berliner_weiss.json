Mash, sparge. Heat your beer up to 185 cool to about 100 and pitch your yogurt starter or lacto. Put some saran wrap over the top (down to where its touching the surface of the wort) and give it a day or two to sour. Once you like the flavor, boil add your hops, crash and pitch as usual.\nThat way you&amp;#39;ll at least know you&amp;#39;re getting your lacto going, and you don&amp;#39;t have any IBU yet to interfere with the lacto doing its thing.\nGood luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg49t4f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491947366.0, "created_utc": 1491918566.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pu8g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pu8g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pu8g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4j1wf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "floppyfloopy", "parent_id": "t1_dg4impf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Wyeast 5335 perhaps?](https://www.brouwland.com/en/our-products/brewing/beer-yeast/wyeast-liquid-yeast/lambic/d/beeryeast-wyeast-5335-lactobacillus)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.brouwland.com/en/our-products/brewing/beer-yeast/wyeast-liquid-yeast/lambic/d/beeryeast-wyeast-5335-lactobacillus\"&gt;Wyeast 5335 perhaps?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg4j1wf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491957984.0, "created_utc": 1491929184.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pu8g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pu8g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5by1h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "polishprocessors", "parent_id": "t1_dg4yqz8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's what got me into this pickle...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what got me into this pickle...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg5by1h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491992585.0, "created_utc": 1491963785.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4yqz8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "officeboy", "parent_id": "t1_dg4impf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yogurt!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yogurt!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg4yqz8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491975321.0, "created_utc": 1491946521.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4impf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "polishprocessors", "parent_id": "t1_dg4h0hc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm in Europe, so I need to find strains I can get here.
