A long time ago, that article turned around my brewing career for the better.\n\nBut industry wise, it's way harder than that. By the time your brewery is 20 years old and well established, people start not caring about your brand. So, instead of buying a well made beer, they'll buy a beer made with crap in it. Look at stone. They've been making simple yet very well made beer for what, 20 years? Then they hit that mark and now every beer of theirs is a lavender chocolate IPA. The problem is, consumers are still uneducated when it comes to beer (although much more educated than a decade ago). The average consumer looks at a 6 pack, looks at the alcohol content, looks for the word \"hops\" and then buys it. 12% DIPA that tastes like a burning tire? Sure. It's imperial! That means craft! Stone doesn't want to make these beers, but their dumb adjunct beers sell because **gimmicks are what consumers want right now**.

I used to sell the fuck out of that pink rogue bottle. People would ask &amp;quot;Is that beer good?&amp;quot; and I would answer, no, it is the most disgusting thing I&amp;#39;ve ever drank. They would still buy it. Every time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, if I had saw PBR drinker and someone drinking a peanut butter bourbon chili stout, I would say only one of those people likes beer, and it isn&amp;#39;t the guy with the stupid beer. Beer is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. The ingredients in beer taste &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. Water, years, malt and hops taste &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. If you&amp;#39;re at the point where you&amp;#39;re combining 3+ adjuncts into your beer, it isn&amp;#39;t beer. It&amp;#39;s just stupid water with shit in it. Personally, I like the taste of beer. I love when I drink a lager and can taste every ingredient elegantly combined yet layered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it was up to me, all brewers would be required to read Brewing on the Ones. A long time ago, that article turned around my brewing career for the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But industry wise, it&amp;#39;s way harder than that. By the time your brewery is 20 years old and well established, people start not caring about your brand. So, instead of buying a well made beer, they&amp;#39;ll buy a beer made with crap in it. Look at stone. They&amp;#39;ve been making simple yet very well made beer for what, 20 years? Then they hit that mark and now every beer of theirs is a lavender chocolate IPA. The problem is, consumers are still uneducated when it comes to beer (although much more educated than a decade ago). The average consumer looks at a 6 pack, looks at the alcohol content, looks for the word &amp;quot;hops&amp;quot; and then buys it. 12% DIPA that tastes like a burning tire? Sure.
