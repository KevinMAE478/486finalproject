So yeast are almost always fermenting for energy when sugar is available, for example. Or even though sugar is available and the Crabtree Effect is in effect, yeast can be respiring aerobically while also respiring anaerobically if I understand that accurately. Or, even as some yeast are in the \"stationary phase\", adapting to the new environment and taking up nutrients, others have already started budding.\n\nWhat this means for metabolism of intermediary products of fermentation is that it can be happening while fermentable sugar remains, but it can also happen (and happens at a higher rate) when fermentable sugar is gone. In terms of why and when this happens, intermediary products leak out or are excreted by yeast during fermentation. Sugar has high energy for yeast. The intermediary products are worth less energy. \n\nThe idea is that if you have a healthy and active enough population when the fermentable sugar is running out or has run out, yeast will take up these chemicals to recover the substances that they can use for energy production *before flocculating and settling out*. But to the extent the population is not active at that stage, then that part of the population will go quiescent without doing much recovery and the off flavor-causing chemicals remain in the beer.\n\n----------\n\nBut you want a straight answer, I am sure. So what does this mean to you? If you control the (1) culture preparation, (2) pitch rate, and (3) fermentation such that the fermentable sugar is consumed when the population is mostly active, then you will get uptake of the unwanted chemicals, which could continue for a day to a few days. However, if you fail to control one or more of those factors properly, then you might not get fully satisfactory uptake of the unwanted chemicals.\n\nEdit: added \"like\" and corrected spelling of uptake", "edited": 1492023122.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some home brewers have this misconception that the yeast are marching lockstep through phase 1, then they all stop phase 1 and do phase 2 upon some secret signal. etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In reality, yeast are able to have multiple metabolic pathways going on at the same time, just like many other organisms, like you. So yeast are almost always fermenting for energy when sugar is available, for example. Or even though sugar is available and the Crabtree Effect is in effect, yeast can be respiring aerobically while also respiring anaerobically if I understand that accurately. Or, even as some yeast are in the &amp;quot;stationary phase&amp;quot;, adapting to the new environment and taking up nutrients, others have already started budding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What this means for metabolism of intermediary products of fermentation is that it can be happening while fermentable sugar remains, but it can also happen (and happens at a higher rate) when fermentable sugar is gone. In terms of why and when this happens, intermediary products leak out or are excreted by yeast during fermentation. Sugar has high energy for yeast. The intermediary products are worth less energy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea is that if you have a healthy and active enough population when the fermentable sugar is running out or has run out, yeast will take up these chemicals to recover the substances that they can use for energy production &lt;em&gt;before flocculating and settling out&lt;/em&gt;. But to the extent the population is not active at that stage, then that part of the population will go quiescent without doing much recovery and the off flavor-causing chemicals remain in the beer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you want a straight answer, I am sure. So what does this mean to you? If you control the (1) culture preparation, (2) pitch rate, and (3) fermentation such that the fermentable sugar is consumed when the population is mostly active, then you will get uptake of the unwanted chemicals, which could continue for a day to a few days.
