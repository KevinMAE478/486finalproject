Heats up strike water like it&amp;#39;s a joke, so easy to have a rolling boil and easy to control flame. Amazing unit. Only downside? It&amp;#39;s kinda loud, like a jet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heats 9 gal of water to temp in about 15-25 mins. Also, it&amp;#39;s better on gas than the sp10. In any case, you&amp;#39;re going to want more BTU/$, because it cuts down on time. Might want to consider what kind of stand you want too, like &lt;a href=\"/u/Gobias_Industries\"&gt;/u/Gobias_Industries&lt;/a&gt; mentions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg5xpic", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492036285.0, "created_utc": 1492007485.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wb7l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ifqg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Buadach", "parent_id": "t3_64wb7l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "11.5KW propane Fokker", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;11.5KW propane Fokker&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg6ifqg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492058014.0, "created_utc": 1492029214.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wb7l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ndot", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "massassi", "parent_id": "t3_64wb7l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "you could run electric pretty cheap by getting a 5500w ULWD HWT element and a 10000w SCR ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;you could run electric pretty cheap by getting a 5500w ULWD HWT element and a 10000w SCR &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg6ndot", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492063688.0, "created_utc": 1492034888.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wb7l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ys4q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PizzaParrot", "parent_id": "t3_64wb7l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Love my edelmetal", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love my edelmetal&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg6ys4q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492077732.0, "created_utc": 1492048932.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wb7l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8kupa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "reddit_clint", "parent_id": "t3_64wb7l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Blichmann hellfire", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blichmann hellfire&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg8kupa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492163164.0, "created_utc": 1492134364.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wb7l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5l4ra", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jonny_boy27", "parent_id": "t3_64wb7l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Straddling two burners on the hob, does the job", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Straddling two burners on the hob, does the job&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "name": "t1_dg5l4ra", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492009062.0, "created_utc": 1491980262.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
