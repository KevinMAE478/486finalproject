No, that&amp;#39;s not an insult, it&amp;#39;s just a saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comedy, as a medium, is easy to learn and difficult to master. Good comedy is organic. It doesn&amp;#39;t come from forcing a joke into a situation; it&amp;#39;s predicated on timing, situation, context, and format. Even the more abstract humor relies on these building blocks, however, this is especially true of improv comedy, as the nature of improv is on-the-feet thinking and development of a natural sense of these factors as they come up, which is essentially what being a Let&amp;#39;s Player is, to a degree. It varies based on channel and personality of that channel, but I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say that Game Grumps falls fairly close within the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where growth comes into play. For a comedian, especially an improv comedian, they need to grow as an entertainer via developing that natural sense that I mentioned earlier until it becomes like second nature to them, and to then continue to adapt as new situations and new contexts arise either from your own bits or from external influences - in other words, you must compensate change by changing yourself and your jokes to match. And this is where we come into the problems of Game Grumps as a platform of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of growing, the show has become stagnant by appealing to, lastly, the &amp;quot;lowest common denominator.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;d like to explain this through contrast. Let&amp;#39;s look at South Park, a show that has cut its teeth and made its name on the same kind of low-brow toilet humor. However, it at least attempts to use that low-brow humor in a smart way. Either through some kind of commentary, or through subversion, or lampshading. Or even just being gross for the sake of it. However, they still try to vary the routine to some extent. Granted, they are a scripted show and not improv, but it still serves the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Game Grumps, on the other hand, to put it frankly, has sacrificed potential growth for a steady stream of lowest common denominator. They are akin to something like, say, Jerry Springer. A predictable one-trick pony. Wheel out the idiots and the trailer trash, encourage them to bitch at each other, then leave them to duke it out on set. However, at least Springer is willing to publicly demonstrate self-awareness and admit his show is absolute garbage with no redeeming value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, that is NOT to say that GG is &amp;quot;absolute garbage with no redeeming value.&amp;quot; Though it is skirting the water&amp;#39;s edge of that particular sinkhole. Without growth, there is no improvement; I think that is a point that is by no means controversial. I feel safe in saying we can all universally agree to that. So, answer me this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is the situation about randomly singing about dicks? How does the timing of &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to pre&amp;quot; play into the humor? What is the context of screaming &amp;quot;my pussy?&amp;quot; And how does a shrill, irritating voice support the format?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to prove me wrong, but I&amp;#39;ll answer those myself: There is none, it doesn&amp;#39;t, there is none, and it doesn&amp;#39;t, respectively. So why is it supposed to be funny? Because it appeals to a a kind of humor that would find the mere mention of &amp;quot;penis&amp;quot; as inherently hilarious. Think carefully about what I just said there. Do you see why I refer to it as &amp;quot;lowest common denominator?&amp;quot; Because it is a humor that requires no set up, nor any punchline. The humor exist simply because a subject exist. It cannot get any more simple than that, there is no further division to be had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean in regards to their viewership? Well, let me ask this: do you really want to be treated like that? That you&amp;#39;re so basic that you&amp;#39;ll laugh at anything put in front of you? Because this is, essentially, what is going on here, or at least, that seems to be how the Grumps, and specifically Arin, see his audience. Perhaps not in such a negative way as I express, but nonetheless, the sentiment appears to be the same. That is also not to say the viewership IS a lowest common denominator; instead, the implication is that, that is how the audience is being treated and there is complacency within the audience to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is, in other words, that he does not need to try to have that audience. That he can attract an audience with minimal effort. To those who think I&amp;#39;m wrong, do me a favor, an experiment, if you will. Remember that these episodes are recorded in bulk, with a session being a number of episodes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pick a bunch of videos from this year, 2017. Play them back to back for a few hours, the length of one of their sessions, I don&amp;#39;t know how long those sessions usually last. Don&amp;#39;t watch, just listen. Or maybe do something on the side, but try to actually pay attention to what&amp;#39;s being said. See how often he tells the same jokes, how often he uses the same voices. When he makes a joke pay attention to his set ups and his punchlines, and how often he does have a set up or a punchline. And at the end of it, ask yourself: is this what you want for the show? Should you demand better? Because if you do that, hopefully you see the problems I&amp;#39;ve talk about in full view. All the stuff I asked you to pay attention to happened in the span of a single session (or at least that&amp;#39;s the idea).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you love something, wouldn&amp;#39;t you want the best for it?

Hell, the Grumps themselves prove this to be true, too: both Danny and Arin are very intelligent and yet Danny still lost it when Arin said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna pre&amp;quot; in his Obama voice. Plus, the Grump audience has always been vocal about which jokes are good and which aren&amp;#39;t - jokes about pedophilia, for instance, and now I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve heard a single pedophilic joke for a long time.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Onto growth: put simply you cannot force growth, it has to come naturally. And sometimes growth stops or moves at a snail&amp;#39;s pace - not because you&amp;#39;re doing something wrong but because everything has a limit. You can try and force yourself to grow even more by experimenting with things like format tweaks, new humor, and new shows, but are you growing what you already have or are you making something new? Do these new things make you happy and satisfied that your idea is reaching its fullest potential? The answers are rarely as simple as they seem and can destroy your idea completely by turning it into something you never wanted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want to see the Grumps improve and grow, which I commend. I also want to see the same thing. Can their jokes get repetitive? Absolutely. Are they still funny? To me they sure as hell are. Does that mean you&amp;#39;re wrong? Absolutely not, but they will change and grow at their own pace because, ultimately, Game Grumps is about Arin and Dan making each other laugh and inviting us along for the ride.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamegrumps", "name": "t1_dg5ru2t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492027719.0, "created_utc": 1491998919.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ulfu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xg6n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ulfu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xg6n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ulfu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xg6n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ng7n", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "milesrhoden", "parent_id": "t1_dg6lb0q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamegrumps", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; I don't see it as \"awesome\" that you repeatedly do a joke your partner actively loathes\n\nI meant that Arin and Dan having that conversation was awesome because we witnessed them reconciling their opinions.

If \"I'm gonna pre\" and \"looks like you have a baby penis\" were jokes that were written into a script and practiced by Arin and Dan to get their delivery just right, I'd agree that the humor is lazy and appeals to the lowest common denominator. It's akin to the writing in Big Bang Theory where Sheldon just has to say \"Bazinga\" or other characters just need to reference a bunch of stereotypical \"nerdy\" things to get a laugh. But GG isn't scripted, nor is it strictly a comedy show. The show has always been about two friends playing games and just enjoying each other's company. That doesn't strictly mean they have to focus on the audience in their recording sessions. \n\nCase in point: how do you talk to your closest friends? If you're like me, your conversations meander between in-depth discussions about life and what we are dealing with at the moment (be it some piece of media we really like, an issue we're having with someone at work, or our changing outlook on the world around us); or attempts to make each other laugh which, given enough time, will ultimately devolve into the inside jokes we've developed with each other over the years. Arin and Danny do the same thing, and it just so happens that they managed to develop an audience that shares their humor and outlook on life. \n\nDoes the humor fall flat for the audience sometimes? Sure, but that's because they aren't trying to make the audience laugh. I doubt I could make thousands of people laugh at some of the inside jokes I've developed with my friends. Do their conversations sometimes get repetitive? Absolutely. But, try carrying on a conversation for hours on end for four straight years, and I bet you'd run into the same issues. Those problems are simply inherent to the GG format of two friends playing games and hanging out with each other. \n\nNow, does the format need to change? Sure. I'd personally prefer they stayed away from current releases and stick with obscure games from the 80s and 90s and wish they'd finish more games, but I think we'd still run into the same issues given enough time. \n\nAll of that being said, I have felt that, over the last year or so, Arin and Danny have been \"treading water\" so to speak. Aside from a few episodes here and there, neither of them have felt like they've been really energetic or passionate (aside from Arin rage). I feel like that has largely to do with their current workload. Not only are they recording GG episodes; they're also working on that Dan Harmon/Jesse Cox web series, performing GG Live and NSP/Starbomb shows across the country, and, for Danny in particular, working on two new NSP albums. Right now, they are stretched thin in terms of creativity and energy, and I think that is rubbing off on the actual recording sessions. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If GG were a scripted comedy show, I&amp;#39;d agree with you 100%. If &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna pre&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;looks like you have a baby penis&amp;quot; were jokes that were written into a script and practiced by Arin and Dan to get their delivery just right, I&amp;#39;d agree that the humor is lazy and appeals to the lowest common denominator. It&amp;#39;s akin to the writing in Big Bang Theory where Sheldon just has to say &amp;quot;Bazinga&amp;quot; or other characters just need to reference a bunch of stereotypical &amp;quot;nerdy&amp;quot; things to get a laugh. But GG isn&amp;#39;t scripted, nor is it strictly a comedy show. The show has always been about two friends playing games and just enjoying each other&amp;#39;s company. That doesn&amp;#39;t strictly mean they have to focus on the audience in their recording sessions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Case in point: how do you talk to your closest friends? If you&amp;#39;re like me, your conversations meander between in-depth discussions about life and what we are dealing with at the moment (be it some piece of media we really like, an issue we&amp;#39;re having with someone at work, or our changing outlook on the world around us); or attempts to make each other laugh which, given enough time, will ultimately devolve into the inside jokes we&amp;#39;ve developed with each other over the years. Arin and Danny do the same thing, and it just so happens that they managed to develop an audience that shares their humor and outlook on life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does the humor fall flat for the audience sometimes? Sure, but that&amp;#39;s because they aren&amp;#39;t trying to make the audience laugh. I doubt I could make thousands of people laugh at some of the inside jokes I&amp;#39;ve developed with my friends. Do their conversations sometimes get repetitive? Absolutely. But, try carrying on a conversation for hours on end for four straight years, and I bet you&amp;#39;d run into the same issues. Those problems are simply inherent to the GG format of two friends playing games and hanging out with each other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, does the format need to change? Sure. I&amp;#39;d personally prefer they stayed away from current releases and stick with obscure games from the 80s and 90s and wish they&amp;#39;d finish more games, but I think we&amp;#39;d still run into the same issues given enough time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of that being said, I have felt that, over the last year or so, Arin and Danny have been &amp;quot;treading water&amp;quot; so to speak. Aside from a few episodes here and there, neither of them have felt like they&amp;#39;ve been really energetic or passionate (aside from Arin rage).
