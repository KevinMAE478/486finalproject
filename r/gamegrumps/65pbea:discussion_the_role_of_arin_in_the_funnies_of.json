Nobody&amp;#39;s ideal game exists. I know mine doesn&amp;#39;t, I personally want a game like phoenix wright or danganronpa with more animation, but that wouldn&amp;#39;t work. This combined with his contradictory (games shouldn&amp;#39;t tell you what to do VS why the fuck didn&amp;#39;t this game tell me that) or just wrong (Majora&amp;#39;s mask holds your hand and tells you everything, let&amp;#39;s see him beat Ikana canyon thinking that.) statements will infuriate gamers and game designers who watch the show as when he says these he says it with an almost I&amp;#39;m the god of game design and all others suck view (I&amp;#39;m most likely overanalyzing that though)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Arin needs to find a good middle ground, if not he can come across as irritating or douchey. I don&amp;#39;t want to boo what was an amazing comedy show that helped me through a rough time in my life when it was hard to find anything that made me smile, but it&amp;#39;s becoming harder to cheer when the head of the team is starting to become lost in his own world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arin, if you see this, listen to criticism, if your comedy partner says the joke is old or annoying he may be right, he is an important part of the show to, focus on the game for humour but don&amp;#39;t overanalyze and never forget what made us subscribe in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is all just my opinion though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamegrumps", "name": "t1_dgc71hc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492387561.0, "created_utc": 1492358761.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ulfu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pbea", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc9sfe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "OmegaScorpio", "parent_id": "t3_65pbea", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamegrumps", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Every time he screams \"My Pussy!\" or makes a fart noise, I lose a little bit of faith that game grumps will get better.
