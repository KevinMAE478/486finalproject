Huge corporations in the restaurant industry make sure to follow OSHA and Health Department rules to a T (though of course individual franchises may forego this) and have people from &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the corporation visit the locations secretly to evaluate the cleanliness of the restaurant, particularly the bathrooms. No such process exists for small businesses, and there&amp;#39;s less incentive for a small business to follow such rules, and less available resources for a small business owner to learn the intricacies of health regulations (no legal department).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever I&amp;#39;m travelling, unless a particular restaurant is well known and recommended in that region, I&amp;#39;ll go to a chain restaurant because I can be sure that the health standards there ought to be the same as the standards at my local franchise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamegrumps", "name": "t1_dg7kph4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492120689.0, "created_utc": 1492091889.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ulfu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650z8g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ulfu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650z8g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6lkap", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bad-r0bot", "parent_id": "t1_dg6kw1l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamegrumps", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Both Dan and Arin?
