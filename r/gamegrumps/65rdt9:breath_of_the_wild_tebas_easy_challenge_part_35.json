Just asking the player \"hey, so I'd really like some raw meat. Can you get that for me?\" is an incredibly dull side quest. There's no story to be compelled by. Hunting isn't terribly enjoyable and is just something that most people do while they're running from place to place. And you probably already have some raw meat on you in the first place, so you probably won't even need to do anything. \n\nThere's one side quest in Hateno where a farmer has the hots for the woman who runs the hotel, but he doesn't have the guts to go talk to her, so he sends you to go and figure out what she likes, so he can give her a gift. She is a little creeped out when you ask her, and tells you that she likes grasshoppers to get you to leave. This side quest has a lot of potential already for a funny thing to happen. \n\nYou tell the farmer and he says \"great! go get me some grasshoppers\" which turns into a fetch quest, but you're still holding out hope that something funny will happen at the end so you go hunt them down anyway, even though it's pretty boring. \n\nWhen you return with the grasshoppers, he says \"thanks! here's $100! I'll take these to her and then I'll have a date!\" and then nothing happens. That's the end. He doesn't confront her. He doesn't give her the grasshoppers. That's it. Such an anticlimactic quest for a genuinely funny situation. \n\nArin actually has already done what I think is the best side-quest in the game, which is the sand/snow boot quest. Bonsai is a weird and creepy character and funny to interact with because you get to swindle him. The quest he sends you on is pretty cool because you get to to see this secret heroine that you probably didn't know about beforehand, and the reward is substantial in the form of clothing, which is the best possible reward for a side quest in this game. It's technically a fetch quest because you have to bring him back a picture of the heroine, but it doesn't feel like one because it's a new discovery for you as well (again, unless you've already found it). It's also satisfying because you catfish this creep out of his fancy shoes. Sadly though, quests like these are few and far between. And I think that's what people are saying when they say \"there's just the same 3 things to do over and over again\" which are shrines, koroks, and towers. I think shrines are fantastic but koroks aren't that interesting and there's only so many towers. If there were more of those deeper side quests I think that people would feel differently.
