The Curios (your magic trinkets in this game) were neat to use beyond just making a certain part easier.  The story was pretty interesting, not as good as Plague of Shadows but an entertaining framework with neat side dialogues.  Only real complaint would be the boss battles; slash/dash+Curios made most of the Order battles a breeze, until the final battles which are pure skill tests/waiting game.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I encourage everyone to play along, this game is a treat, something you need to experience first hand.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamegrumps", "name": "t1_dgdvp87", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492482110.0, "created_utc": 1492453310.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ulfu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wsv4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdw10b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hollybluee", "parent_id": "t3_65wsv4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamegrumps", "controversiality": 0, "body": "fucking danny keeps referencing hamster style from orgazmo i will never get tired of it", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;fucking danny keeps referencing hamster style from orgazmo i will never get tired of it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamegrumps", "name": "t1_dgdw10b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492482478.0, "created_utc": 1492453678.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ulfu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wsv4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge3zgp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MisterSympa", "parent_id": "t3_65wsv4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamegrumps", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I am DEEPLY saddened that this is not co-op.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am DEEPLY saddened that this is not co-op.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamegrumps", "name": "t1_dge3zgp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492491438.0, "created_utc": 1492462638.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ulfu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wsv4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge5exc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hunter_vanLierop", "parent_id": "t3_65wsv4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamegrumps", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Think they'll play Plague of Shadows?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think they&amp;#39;ll play Plague of Shadows?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamegrumps", "name": "t1_dge5exc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492493137.0, "created_utc": 1492464337.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ulfu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wsv4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ulfu", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wsv4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgec7m4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Acheros", "parent_id": "t1_dge6ccd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamegrumps", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Shovel knight isn't really big on story, which is the main reason to avoid watching lets players(spoilers).
