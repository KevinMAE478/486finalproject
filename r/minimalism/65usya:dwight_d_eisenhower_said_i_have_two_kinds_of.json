That way, when urgent problems arose, the important thinking and actions had already been dealt with and planned out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t presume to know your business, but hypothetically, in your first case, it&amp;#39;s important to have a plan in place to for when a machine breaks to minimize the hold up of your production line, like knowing who to call for repairs or having spare machinery. That way when it breaks, you waste as little time as possible getting back to productivity because all you have to do is execute your pre-determined contingency plan(s).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the second case (also hypothetically speaking), it would be important to know the procedure for checking into the hospital when your wife goes into labor (e.g. which hospital, route to take, doctors to contact, etc.) and have made necessary preparations (e.g. bag packed for when it&amp;#39;s time to go to the hospital). Then, when the urgency of labor occurs, the important planning and prep are done, and all you have to do is execute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes life throws a curveball that you weren&amp;#39;t expecting, like a problem you couldn&amp;#39;t see coming, but the lesson/message that Ike was trying to share was prior planning makes managing tough situations easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "minimalism", "name": "t1_dgdqqvu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476615.0, "created_utc": 1492447815.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0z9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65usya", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdtlos", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shalendar", "parent_id": "t1_dgdjmdj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/minimalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Did you watch the video?
