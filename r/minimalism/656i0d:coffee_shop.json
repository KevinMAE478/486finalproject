Like all of El Socorro&amp;#39;s coffees, this coffee is processed directly on the farm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Diego has gone to great lengths to produce consistently high quality coffees. Located near Palencia, Guatemala, the region benefits from the rich volcanic soils and the ideal micro-climate for producing a great coffee. Quality is the highest priority at El Socorro. The farm goes to great lengths to ensure they are producing coffee in an environmentally sustainable manner. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://store.ptscoffee.com/collections/coffee/products/el-socorro-pacamara\"&gt;https://store.ptscoffee.com/collections/coffee/products/el-socorro-pacamara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "minimalism", "name": "t1_dg83x4r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492141611.0, "created_utc": 1492112811.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0z9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656i0d", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg82cfz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jrdhytr", "parent_id": "t1_dg7zau4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/minimalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I only regret that I have but one upvote to give.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I only regret that I have but one upvote to give.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "minimalism", "name": "t1_dg82cfz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492139904.0, "created_utc": 1492111104.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0z9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656i0d", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8j611", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wlbeachboy", "parent_id": "t1_dg7zau4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/minimalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They tried too hard.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tried too hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "minimalism", "name": "t1_dg8j611", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492160838.0, "created_utc": 1492132038.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7zau4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 45, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rchase", "parent_id": "t1_dg7x9w2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/minimalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Given the amount of words written in this thread about the price of a fucking cup of coffee (approaching 4 digits as I write), I'm thinking this sign is a bit *too* minimalist. \n\n*This* is how you make a minimalist restaurant [sign...](https://imgur.com/xJAf2yP)", "edited": 1492112221.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the amount of words written in this thread about the price of a fucking cup of coffee (approaching 4 digits as I write), I&amp;#39;m thinking this sign is a bit &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; minimalist. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is how you make a minimalist restaurant &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/xJAf2yP\"&gt;sign...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "minimalism", "name": "t1_dg7zau4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492136625.0, "created_utc": 1492107825.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 45}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0z9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656i0d", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg84wt3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nature-Is-Awesome", "parent_id": "t1_dg7x9w2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/minimalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As someone who had had formal coffee experience, you're right on the money", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who had had formal coffee experience, you&amp;#39;re right on the money&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "minimalism", "name": "t1_dg84wt3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492142700.0, "created_utc": 1492113900.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0z9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656i0d", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8cbgl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cicadawing", "parent_id": "t1_dg7x9w2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/minimalism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Was a barista for a very short time, around the time slow pour over coffee first started catching on (where I lived) and you wouldn't believe the let down people had both in terms of time to make the coffee and the end result.
