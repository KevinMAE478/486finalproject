Was driving down the freeway, and all of a sudden I was spinning like a button on a shithouse door. I still have no idea why, I think someone behind me clipped my rear bumper. Ended up spinning two and a half times, finished going backwards two lanes over going 65 miles an hour. Clutch in, staring at a pickup in 'front' of me. Got on the brakes slowly and the pickup driver slowed down with me. The wheel really wanted to turn, but I figured I would roll if I tried to turn around at speed. Stopped in that lane, restarted the car, and flipped a u turn and drove to the shoulder. No damage at all, save having to have the seat surgically removed from my ass.
