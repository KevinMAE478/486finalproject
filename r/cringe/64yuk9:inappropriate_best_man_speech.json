As we grew up though, his love of WWF wrestling was replaced with a new one; the love for his beautiful wife, Sarah. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[turn to address newlyweds] Jack, Sarah, I wish you a lifetime of love and happiness together and may the love that you radiate towards each other today, serve as the guiding light that illuminates the path of your lives together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[turn to the crowd and raise your glass] I think we can all agree, that with a love as bright as the one you two share, Jack will never have a reason to use that night-light ever again. And that&amp;#39;s something we can all toast to, cheers.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cringe", "name": "t1_dg952i2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492206196.0, "created_utc": 1492177396.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 160}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r6rj", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yuk9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8jdwr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ReturnoftheSanders", "parent_id": "t1_dg8fmh8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cringe", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Spread those buttcheeks", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spread those buttcheeks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cringe", "name": "t1_dg8jdwr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492161136.0, "created_utc": 1492132336.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8fmh8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chris-colour", "parent_id": "t1_dg73nje", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cringe", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Let's say you knew a guy and a girl called A and B.
