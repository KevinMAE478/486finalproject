One day one of my coworkers (we will call him Kevin) for a good half hour was talking to me about this girl he was seeing and telling me about how cute she was, and how great her personality is. He showed me a pic of her and I agreed she was very cute. Although tbh I didn\u2019t really look, I just wanted to be polite. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I was happy for Kevin but I had my mind on work and wasn\u2019t too invested in what he was saying. About a week or so later on one of the days I didn\u2019t work I was in the local Target with my brother and saw Kevin. He approached me and asked me how I was doing. Now one thing you should know about Kevin before I continue is that he was the type of guy who did hard drugs and hung out with people who did too, the kind that change your look and make you look older, so he looked older than me even though I was older. Anyways, he was with this woman and right after he said \u201chey man, how\u2019s it going\u201d I responded with \u201cI\u2019m doing fine, (I turn to the woman) and how are you? You must be Kevin\u2019s mother.\u201d There was about 5 seconds of pause and he said, \u201cthat\u2019s not my mother... that\u2019s my girlfriend. I showed you a picture of her before, remember?\u201d I felt so bad for what I had just said and I cringed so hard too. I was at a loss for words, because not only did I basically say his girlfriend (who he was so happy about) looked like the age of his mother, this also showed that I really wasn\u2019t paying too much attention to him when he was talking about her and showing me a pic of her a week or so prior. Although she was someone who was into drugs too so she looked in her late 30\u2019s or early 40\u2019s (even though she was in her early 20\u2019s). I had nothing to say to him other than the flinch reaction of \u201cI was only kidding,\u201d to which he responded \u201chow is that a joke?!\u201d The only thing I could think to do was just apologize for making a bad joke and I came up with some BS reason why I had to leave right away. My brother was standing next to me the whole time and said that was the worst thing he had ever seen... although he did say he understood why I thought what I did, either way that didn\u2019t make me feel any better&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR- I saw my coworker out in a Target and mistook his girlfriend for his mother&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This was about 4 years ago when I worked at Papa John's as a delivery driver.
