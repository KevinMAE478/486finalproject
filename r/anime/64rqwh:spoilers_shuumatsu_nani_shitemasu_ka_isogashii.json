Next thing I knew, I had flown through the entire first volume and quickly placed an order for all of the remaining volumes. I'm enjoying it immensely.\n\nThis first episode covered chapters 1 and 2 of the first LN (excluding the prologue which was covered in the after credits scene). Volume 1 has 5 chapters all up excluding the prologue, so it's looking to be a very well-paced adaptation. Not entirely unexpected when you have [the author of the LN as the main writer for the anime.](http://i.imgur.com/7iyLpad.png)  \nAll-in-all, I can say I'm genuinely confident in this adaptation.
