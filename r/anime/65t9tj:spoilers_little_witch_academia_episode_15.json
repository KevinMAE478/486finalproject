We got ~8 episodes of really nice episodic stuff and then a smooth 4-6 episode transition into what looks like a more plot-oriented last third of the series. To anyone who bashed the pacing at first, how &lt;em&gt;dare&lt;/em&gt; you doubt Trigger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have 10(?) episodes left so that breaks down to 2.5 episodes per word - plenty to get everything done and still have 1-2 episodes to completely devote to the finale.

It makes me wonder if/how Trigger is already using that theme in LWA - like maybe Trigger sees Akko as the daughter, mentored by Ursula/Chariot as the mother, mentored by Prof. Woodward as the crone.\n\nAnyway, it's tough to see what 3 witches are gonna end up being needed tho. It's easy to just say Akko/Sucy/Lotte, since they're already a trio, but Sucy and Lotte have never shown interest in this stuff, and doing some high level magic like that may even require strong witches for all we know, so it could very well be Akko/Diana/???.\n\nTo further analyze this, let's look at some clues: the first few seconds of the new OP, with 3 witch students clasping arms, seems to vaguely suggest Akko/Sucy/Lotte. I say vaguely because no hair or face is shown of the trio but the bottom of the robes on one of them resemble Sucy's. HOWEVER, all their headband colors are red. Why does that matter? Remember the scene in this episode where Ursula is explaining the Grand Triskelion to Akko. It shows different colored, fiery outlines of witches working together (red, blue, and green). Now remember that Akko wears red, Diana wears blue, and Amanda wears green. So while the trio at the beginning of the OP with 3 red headbands are most likely Akko/Sucy/Lotte, it doesn't mean they'll be the ones unlocking the Grand Triskelion. Also, let's look at how the Shiny Rod is noted (by Croix, so this could be her misinterpretation) to react to 'emotional energy'. Sucy and Lotte have their passions for mushrooms and object-spirit things going on respectively (or maybe not object-spirits in Lotte's case but her passion for Nightfall :P), but these passions could be considered somewhat 'casual'. Diana on the other hand is *extremely* passionate about magic itself (in her own, serious-minded way), and Amanda has a fiery, free-spirited personality in general, and of course we know Akko is passionate about magic. Also note how Akko, Diana, and Amanda are all featured front and center in the new OP as the 'leaders' of their respective 3 witch groups. So all those clues could be hinting that it will be Akko/Diana/Amanda as the trio that team up to unlock the Grand Triskelion. (random thought: I wonder if Diana represents order&amp;tradition, Amanda chaos&amp;freedom/free-thinking, and Akko passion - for whatever any of that is worth, especially in regards to the 3 potentially working together. probably nothing. no idea if this is relevent to anything at all, just tossing it out there.)\n\nThen again, OVA 2 showed us Lotte and Sucy helping with the Shiny Ballista attack, so who knows besides Trigger at this point? I also wonder why Amanda would be considered worth including since she's barely gotten any screen time in comparison to Akko and Diana. Maybe that will change as we near the end? I know I personally feel her group in general needs more screen time, but we're past the daily life / episodic stage of the series where most of the world building and character intros/expositions were handled. We're into the guts of the over-arching story now, so I don't know how they might raise the importance of Amanda and company in the series without it feeling forced at this point.\n\nOn the other hand, we don't know for sure if 3 are needed to unseal it at all. It may have required 3 to seal the magic in the first place, but that doesn't necessarily mean 3 are needed to unseal it. It could be as simple as having one worthy witch wielding the key (the Shiny Rod), which given how Akko is the only one reviving the words, could easily be the case.\n\nObviously we'll just have to wait and see where Trigger goes with all this, but the signs do seem to point to needing 3 working together, even with the key in hand, either for unlocking the Grand Triskelion, or perhaps only for using it after it's unlocked.", "edited": 1492438153.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, three witches is a pretty well known theme in the world of witches, plus the whole &amp;#39;daughter, mother, crone&amp;#39; thing.
