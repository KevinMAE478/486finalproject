The personality and way that both Mizuno and Azumi act are extremely realistic and, for me at least, relatable.

Or the scene at the beginning where where the group of guys are giddily talking about Mizuno's butt, and Azumi of course decides to look at it, but his face immediately flushes red and he looks down.

I am extremely impressed with how well this series is being handled so far. It&amp;#39;s extremely grounded, and human. The personality and way that both Mizuno and Azumi act are extremely realistic and, for me at least, relatable. For instance, just seeing Mizuno shake because she didn&amp;#39;t have &amp;#39;potato-chan&amp;#39; there to relieve her social anxiety really makes me reminisce about how bad it was for me in high school (even now in college in some situations) to the point that I would tremble and grow antsy. Or the scene at the beginning where where the group of guys are giddily talking about Mizuno&amp;#39;s butt, and Azumi of course decides to look at it, but his face immediately flushes red and he looks down.
