You should probably put them in your bag.\u201d\n\n**Serious Quote of the Day:**\u201dIt\u2019s a form given to the Class Rep\u2019s hidden personality. A dark, evil Hanekawa Tsubasa.\u201d\n\nToday, the mystery of Hanekawa Tsubasa begins to unravel. We\u2019ve known since the beginning that she had needed Oshino\u2019s help in the past, during Golden Week, and we\u2019ve known for almost as long that she never wants to go home. The flashback in the beginning of today\u2019s episode finally tells us why. Neither of Hanekawa\u2019s parents are related to her. She was unwanted by her family, a victim of childhood neglect. Near the beginning of her senior year, at the beginning of Golden Week, that neglect escalated to abuse. Hanekawa had always hidden the difficulty of her home life, and adopted her perfect class president persona so that nobody would suspect her life of being anything but normal. When her stepdad hit her, that didn\u2019t change; she still tried to justify his actions to Araragi, and made him promise against his will that he wouldn\u2019t tell anyone about it. But at the same time, she encountered the meddlesome cat, and Black Hanekawa was born.\n\n[Owarimonogatari](/s \"In retrospect, it\u2019s remarkable how similar Hanekawa\u2019s and Oikura\u2019s life stories are. Both were abused children, both tried to deal with it by becoming perfectionists in their outside personas, both identified Araragi as a potential way to escape the shitty hand they were dealt in life.\")\n\nThe rainy devil and the meddlesome cat are, in a way, pretty similar oddities. They both latch on to and take over a human host, and act violently to fulfill his or her darkest subconscious desires. The difference is, the rainy devil only became active when Kanbaru made a conscious wish on the monkey paw. Hanekawa has no control whatsoever over the meddlesome cat. Whereas the rainy devil was really just a convenient excuse for Kanbaru to act on her jealousy and hate, Black Hanekawa, as Oshino explains it, is completely separate from normal Hanekawa. She represents everything that Hanekawa tries to keep buried deep down inside. She\u2019s aggressive where Hanekawa is demure, impulse-driven where Hanekawa is thoughtful, sexual where Hanekawa is modest, and vengeful where Hanekawa is submissive. This also means that while Black Hanekawa does act with Hanekawa\u2019s best interests in mind, she doesn\u2019t limit herself to doing things that Hanekawa wanted, even on a subconscious level. It would be understandable if she harbored a secret desire for revenge against the stepparents who abused her, but Black Hanekawa attacked anybody indiscriminately. Her only motivation was to drain enough energy that it would relieve Hanekawa\u2019s stress; she didn\u2019t care who the energy came from.\n\nIn the present, Hanekawa is once again displaying similar symptoms, though not exactly the same, as when she first transformed during Golden Week. Twice now, her conversations with Araragi have been interrupted by the sudden onset of what seem like excruciatingly painful migraines. [This arc spoilers](/s \"Note that both of these times, the subject that led to the headaches was Hanekawa giving him relationship advice. It\u2019s really impressive that she can be so pained by seeing Araragi with somebody else, and still be nice enough of a person to try and help him maintain that relationship.\") Is the same issue as in Golden Week returning, or is it different this time?\n\nIn non-Hanekawa-related news, this episode wraps up a few loose strings from Nadeko Snake. We get to see a little more of Nadeko\u2019s interactions with Araragi, and they\u2019re as uncomfortable for everybody involved as ever. She also raises the subject of Shinobu. At this point, still the only things that we know about her are that she used to be an extremely powerful vampire who attacked Araragi during spring break, and now also that she was responsible for stopping Black Hanekawa. \n\nAnd finally, Hanekawa continued to give Araragi relationship advice, but it was a little more positive this time. She says that most people think he\u2019s a bad influence on Senjougahara (presumably because when she was closed off, she was a better  student, and they think Araragi\u2019s slacker attitude is dragging her down), and Hanekawa herself admits  to not understanding what they see in each other. So she warns Araragi to keep in mind that what he does now reflects on his girlfriend too, but she also does acknowledge that something about them works, because Senjou is noticeably improving. \n\nOne this is for sure, their relationship is complicated. At this point, it\u2019s really hard to get a read on how Araragi actually feels about it. When they started dating he seemed almost reluctant to go out with her, and he doesn\u2019t seem to have gotten any more passionate since then. When Kanbaru asked what he liked about his girlfriend in Suruga Monkey, he didn\u2019t even answer and instead deflected the question by saying that \u201cNobody can be someone else\u2019s replacement.\u201d Senjougahara, for her part, has been getting better at letting down her guard, but last we saw she\u2019s still a little brusque and emotionally distant.

I was hoping for another episode of the last arc but to be honest they pretty much solved Sengoku\u2019s problem ( also, I wander why we didn\u2019t get a scene of [The Tsuganoki Middle School Fire Sisters](http://imgur.com/oevvFUg) waking Araragi up like we have for all the other arcs so far? ). Anyway, **New Arc New OP** and boy was this one slightly unsettling. I think u/VacantVagabond described it best when he commented about it in yesterdays thread, \n&gt; Will just like to let you know that the final OP of Bake is incredible. Its not cute or meme friendly or adorable. Its sexy, uncomfortable, and epic though. The song and visuals together are perfect.\n\n* Onto the episode! We begin with what I think is a flashback to a conversation Hanekawa has with Araragi a year previous. It gives us some detail into Hanekawa\u2019s situation at home (which is nice since we now have an explanation why she was at the park during mothers day and also why she could see Hachikuji). It\u2019s a weird situation in which I\u2019m still trying to figure out how it works ( would be awesome if someone could explain to me the dynamics of it :D). Essentially though, it seems she is an unwanted child to her \u201cparents\u201d and didn\u2019t have the best of childhoods while living with them, hence why she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with them. It sucks for Hanekawa since she has so far been portrayed as such a nice kind girl, so I can definitely see why she wants to travel the world as soon as she leaves school.\n\n* During the conversation it is brought up how Hanekawa has been beaten by her dad. One thing I noticed about this is how she tries to pass it off as a common occurrence and even has an excuse for it when Araragi shows his concern. It\u2019s like she wants to just forget about that situation and move on and this ep really hammers that point in (for me). It was brought up by [Oshino a few eps ago](http://imgur.com/D57QYQF) and here we see a practical application of this willingness to forgive and forget. Even later on in the episode, once we get introduced to Hanekawa\u2019s spirit, it\u2019s explained through a past event rather than an ongoing one (although it seems like it might return) which has never really been touched upon all series until now. I find this idea of Hanekawa choosing to forget certain situations or, just pass them off as common, interesting. It seemingly ties into her well known phrase, [\u201cIt\u2019s not that I know everything. I just know what I know.\u201d](http://imgur.com/GratOk0) in the sense that what she knows is what she chooses to know rather than only the knowledge and experiences she has accrued in her life.What she has forgotten, or chosen to forget, may be overlooked and cause a problem in this arc due to this willingness to move on rather than face and resolve the situation like Araragi.\n\n* Anyway back to the ep. We get do end up getting a nice catch up with Sengoku after the events of the last arc. I must say I\u2019m glad to see she\u2019s ok, especially after the last arc. Seeing her interact with Araragi was adorable and how she ran away after seeing Hanekawa was just as cute. Think I might have a new fave character :D.\n\n* During the next conversation Araragi has with Hanekawa, they mention how rumours are starting between Araragi and Senjou. It\u2019s interesting to see how when asked about it Hanekawa defends Araragi\u2019s side and states to Araragi \u201cI never lie at all\u201d, to which Araragi says \u201cOther than you, I\u2019ve never heard anyone but liars use that line\u201d. I have a feeling this is in line with my thoughts of Hanekawa choosing to forget things, in that to herself, she is telling the truth but the reality is not that way. Either that or that with choosing to forget things, she is only lying to herself.\n\n* We then get to see Hanekawa\u2019s spirit, Meddlecat (aka [Neko-Hanekawa](http://imgur.com/vdC5qTJ) Nya-ha-ha~). I\u2019d seen mentions towards cats and Hanekawa in comments before so I was clued into the relationship between Hanekawa and cats but I never knew the spirit turned her into an energy draining cat-woman. It\u2019s also interesting how it\u2019s victims are in relation to Hanekawa\u2019s stress. Her \"parents\" being victims made sense but what stood out was how Araragi was a victim too. I\u2019m guessing this was because she knew that he was a vampire (or 1/10th of one) at that time and had to keep it secret but if that\u2019s not the reason I wonder if she maybe has feelings for him and so he would source of stress that way.\n\n* One thing I have glossed over so far is the how we got **even more on Shinobu** this ep too (Shinobu info in 2 eps in a row? God bless!!). She is one of the most interesting characters to me since we know so little about her and only get snippets here and there so the more info we get the better. Anyway earlier on we hear how she looks at Araragi differently to Sengoku and Kanbaru. I\u2019m guessing this is due to how linked to her Araragi is rather than her being jealous of him hanging around with other girls than her. We also get a look at how [Shinobu is before she is Shinobu](http://imgur.com/udM2hWn) and we see her save Araragi from Ha-neko-awa (Nya-ha-ha~) . It is becoming increasingly apparent that Shinobu is heavily linked into Araragi and his past and with her saving him, it almost seemed as if she maybe be a type of guardian to him? \n\nThis episode was satisfying. It touched on some topics I\u2019ve been wanting to talked about such as Hanekawa\u2019s often repeated quote and Shinobu\u2019s past and her relation to Araragi. I\u2019m excited to see how this arc turns out as well because with the past arcs hinting at Araragi\u2019s gung ho\u2019 ness to aid someone in need and how it might turn out for the worse. We finally have someone who is close to Araragi before the situation occurs and I\u2019d assume he is even more willing to help Hanekawa than someone he knows through his sisters or friends. I wonder if this is how things backfire for Araragi, and if his relationship with Hanekawa gets changed by the end of the arc.\n", "edited": 1491867467.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Watch Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On to a new arc after a 2 ep arc this time. I was hoping for another episode of the last arc but to be honest they pretty much solved Sengoku\u2019s problem ( also, I wander why we didn\u2019t get a scene of &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/oevvFUg\"&gt;The Tsuganoki Middle School Fire Sisters&lt;/a&gt; waking Araragi up like we have for all the other arcs so far? ). Anyway, &lt;strong&gt;New Arc New OP&lt;/strong&gt; and boy was this one slightly unsettling. I think &lt;a href=\"/u/VacantVagabond\"&gt;u/VacantVagabond&lt;/a&gt; described it best when he commented about it in yesterdays thread, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Will just like to let you know that the final OP of Bake is incredible. Its not cute or meme friendly or adorable. Its sexy, uncomfortable, and epic though. The song and visuals together are perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onto the episode! We begin with what I think is a flashback to a conversation Hanekawa has with Araragi a year previous. It gives us some detail into Hanekawa\u2019s situation at home (which is nice since we now have an explanation why she was at the park during mothers day and also why she could see Hachikuji). It\u2019s a weird situation in which I\u2019m still trying to figure out how it works ( would be awesome if someone could explain to me the dynamics of it :D). Essentially though, it seems she is an unwanted child to her \u201cparents\u201d and didn\u2019t have the best of childhoods while living with them, hence why she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with them. It sucks for Hanekawa since she has so far been portrayed as such a nice kind girl, so I can definitely see why she wants to travel the world as soon as she leaves school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the conversation it is brought up how Hanekawa has been beaten by her dad. One thing I noticed about this is how she tries to pass it off as a common occurrence and even has an excuse for it when Araragi shows his concern. It\u2019s like she wants to just forget about that situation and move on and this ep really hammers that point in (for me). It was brought up by &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/D57QYQF\"&gt;Oshino a few eps ago&lt;/a&gt; and here we see a practical application of this willingness to forgive and forget. Even later on in the episode, once we get introduced to Hanekawa\u2019s spirit, it\u2019s explained through a past event rather than an ongoing one (although it seems like it might return) which has never really been touched upon all series until now. I find this idea of Hanekawa choosing to forget certain situations or, just pass them off as common, interesting. It seemingly ties into her well known phrase, &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/GratOk0\"&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s not that I know everything. I just know what I know.\u201d&lt;/a&gt; in the sense that what she knows is what she chooses to know rather than only the knowledge and experiences she has accrued in her life.What she has forgotten, or chosen to forget, may be overlooked and cause a problem in this arc due to this willingness to move on rather than face and resolve the situation like Araragi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway back to the ep. We get do end up getting a nice catch up with Sengoku after the events of the last arc. I must say I\u2019m glad to see she\u2019s ok, especially after the last arc. Seeing her interact with Araragi was adorable and how she ran away after seeing Hanekawa was just as cute. Think I might have a new fave character :D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the next conversation Araragi has with Hanekawa, they mention how rumours are starting between Araragi and Senjou. It\u2019s interesting to see how when asked about it Hanekawa defends Araragi\u2019s side and states to Araragi \u201cI never lie at all\u201d, to which Araragi says \u201cOther than you, I\u2019ve never heard anyone but liars use that line\u201d. I have a feeling this is in line with my thoughts of Hanekawa choosing to forget things, in that to herself, she is telling the truth but the reality is not that way. Either that or that with choosing to forget things, she is only lying to herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then get to see Hanekawa\u2019s spirit, Meddlecat (aka &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/vdC5qTJ\"&gt;Neko-Hanekawa&lt;/a&gt; Nya-ha-ha~). I\u2019d seen mentions towards cats and Hanekawa in comments before so I was clued into the relationship between Hanekawa and cats but I never knew the spirit turned her into an energy draining cat-woman. It\u2019s also interesting how it\u2019s victims are in relation to Hanekawa\u2019s stress. Her &amp;quot;parents&amp;quot; being victims made sense but what stood out was how Araragi was a victim too. I\u2019m guessing this was because she knew that he was a vampire (or 1/10th of one) at that time and had to keep it secret but if that\u2019s not the reason I wonder if she maybe has feelings for him and so he would source of stress that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I have glossed over so far is the how we got &lt;strong&gt;even more on Shinobu&lt;/strong&gt; this ep too (Shinobu info in 2 eps in a row? God bless!!). She is one of the most interesting characters to me since we know so little about her and only get snippets here and there so the more info we get the better. Anyway earlier on we hear how she looks at Araragi differently to Sengoku and Kanbaru. I\u2019m guessing this is due to how linked to her Araragi is rather than her being jealous of him hanging around with other girls than her. We also get a look at how &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/udM2hWn\"&gt;Shinobu is before she is Shinobu&lt;/a&gt; and we see her save Araragi from Ha-neko-awa (Nya-ha-ha~) . It is becoming increasingly apparent that Shinobu is heavily linked into Araragi and his past and with her saving him, it almost seemed as if she maybe be a type of guardian to him? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This episode was satisfying. It touched on some topics I\u2019ve been wanting to talked about such as Hanekawa\u2019s often repeated quote and Shinobu\u2019s past and her relation to Araragi. I\u2019m excited to see how this arc turns out as well because with the past arcs hinting at Araragi\u2019s gung ho\u2019 ness to aid someone in need and how it might turn out for the worse. We finally have someone who is close to Araragi before the situation occurs and I\u2019d assume he is even more willing to help Hanekawa than someone he knows through his sisters or friends. I wonder if this is how things backfire for Araragi, and if his relationship with Hanekawa gets changed by the end of the arc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "anime", "name": "t1_dg3gxzf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491895565.0, "created_utc": 1491866765.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64n1dv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64n1dv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64n1dv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3je51", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "StarmanRiver", "parent_id": "t1_dg3grsq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh thanks for pointing that out, seems I wasn't paying enough attention.

We got a little bit of text saying that she would travel in the future and some countries pop up (yay, Argentina appeared!).

She also wanted to thank Kanbaru but she couldn't since Kanbaru went past her running at high speeds.

Then he asks her about Shinobu, if he told her anything when he wasn't there since they spent the night with Oshino. That didn't happen but Nadeko noticed that Shinobu stared at her a lot and that she looked her and Kanbaru different that she does with Araragi and Oshino. The bad references that Nadeko made were cute. Ah, that last scene were Araragi tries to grab Nadeko's hair and ends up grabbing her skirt was weird and confusing.\n\nThen Hanekawa shows up again and a timid Nadeko flees so she ends up being alone with Araragi again. She tells him that some rumours about him being a bad influence to Senjougahara are being spread since she changed. A teacher even asked Hanekawa if she knew anything about it. Hanekawa thinks that it Senjougahara hasn't changed in a bad way but the other way around and that Koyomi should support her.

Hanekawa also had headaches and finally ended up transforming in a catgirl with white hair. Oshino said that it was a meddlesome cat which is a multiple personality disorder. He decided to call catgirl Hanekawa Black Hanekawa, not because of how she looks but what personality it took and the reason that this happened was because of stress. Then we get an explanation that to release that stress Black Hanekawa attacks citizens during night and drains their energy and vitality. Two people ended up being hospitalized and those were the cause of her stress: her parents. The flashback ends in the last day of Golden Week where Black Hanekawa was chasing Araragi who is saved by Shinobu.

They\u2019re just doing what they have to do in his mind, you can\u2019t blame them for existing.

It\u2019s kind of funny, because obviously people just don\u2019t really know Senjou, which makes sense seeing as the only one who really knows her is Araragi and maybe us as the audience. Hanekawa being the good friend as usual, but she really does pick up on a lot of subtext.\n\nOh boy, here\u2019s the oddity.

The show also revealed hints of her own troubles, however, ranging from obvious lies to headaches \u201cno one has to worry about.\u201d That conflict gains much more texture as this episode sets the stage for her arc and offers yet another small epilog to the previous one.\n\nHanekawa\u2019s appearance has a kind of calm, serene warmth to it. She always knows just what to say, offers Araragi advice on how to become a better person and how to make his relationship with Araragi work. She can do well with kids and awkward teenagers alike. Hanekawa is a kind of reassurance. The visual language mirrors that aura with warm, bright and vivid colors, offering a stark contrast to the seemingly cold appearance of Senjougahara most of the time. The directing reinforces that perception, taking an often much more conservative approach (for Monogatari standards, anyway) to highlight her words. But as with Senjougahara previously, that perception \u2013 as seen through Araragi \u2013 is very deceptive.\n\nHanekawa suffers underneath that appearance of perfection. She\u2019s far from as perfect as she appears to be, and far, far more imperfect than Araragi idealizes her as. She lies, then lies about lying. She tries her best to avoid her parents. She suffers but refuses to let anyone worry about her. She doesn\u2019t know everything, least of all how to handle her own situation right. She only knows what she knows, which isn\u2019t always enough.\n\nWhile most of her imperfections come from a place of genuine care for other people, they\u2019re deeply unhealthy. She avoids her parents because she feels responsible when /they hit her/, she lies to avoid other people having to worry about her, and as a result suffers more and more herself. She gives away her own happiness so that others can be marginally happier in the ignorance and terribleness she prevents them from realizing.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s no way to live, and just as she sends tiny cries for help in Araragi\u2019s direction, speaking to him about what troubles her, her other, less admirable feelings burst out during Golden Week and express what she tried to suppress as long as she could. In the form of an animalistic presentation of her ferocious, dark feelings (or, well, a cat-girl), she takes out her stress on the source and innocents alike.\n\nBack during the events of Golden Week, she was \u201cfixed\u201d in the same way that Kanbaru would have been \u201cfixed\u201d with her arm cut off. Instead of dealing with the source, Shinobu simply drained her stress away. But with her family situation as problematic as always, the source of her stress is still there, and so that phenomenon returns. Until now, or chronologically, from that point on, Araragi and the other characters made sure to confront their problems directly rather than try to shallowly cut them out. Monogatari realizes there is no easy, magical solution to our problems, and that fact now comes back in full force\u2026 in the form of a cat-girl. (It\u2019s amazing how ironic everything sounds as soon as you add that part.)\n\nHanekawa\u2019s problem is also much more complicated than every problem they faced before. For the first time, it\u2019s not an emotional problem that can really be dealt with confrontation. For the first time, adults are part of the problem. And with Oshino as the superhero, they are like super villains. Their selfish apathy towards Hanekawa is not something that can just be fixed or dealt with through some magical intervention. The real world is much more complicated than that.\n\nBut enough doom and gloom, we\u2019ll have plenty of that as the arc continues, I reckon. On a brighter side, this episode did a great job at portraying its entire cast as actual people. Even diving into Hanekawa\u2019s arc, pretty much every character made an appearance this episode. Senjougahara and Araragi\u2019s relationship is still a central thread with Hanekawa giving him advice, Kanbaru runs, Nadeko has a conversation with Araragi as a form of an epilog to last episode, and even Oshino and Shinobu made an appearance. By not ignoring characters outside of the arc they belong to, they feel much more like people also existing outside of the main story and how they relate to it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the episode! An interesting set-up for the arc, with Hanekawa hiding and enduring her problems being a major thread for the arc. A cat-girl, an interesting central character suffering underneath her fa\u00e7ade (who are, of course, the same person) \u2013 sounds like a Monogatari arc to me, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing that explored more.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanekawa has been appearing a few times in the show already, here and there offering advice and insight into the other characters, being a wise influence on Araragi not unlike Oshino. The show also revealed hints of her own troubles, however, ranging from obvious lies to headaches \u201cno one has to worry about.\u201d That conflict gains much more texture as this episode sets the stage for her arc and offers yet another small epilog to the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hanekawa\u2019s appearance has a kind of calm, serene warmth to it. She always knows just what to say, offers Araragi advice on how to become a better person and how to make his relationship with Araragi work. She can do well with kids and awkward teenagers alike. Hanekawa is a kind of reassurance. The visual language mirrors that aura with warm, bright and vivid colors, offering a stark contrast to the seemingly cold appearance of Senjougahara most of the time. The directing reinforces that perception, taking an often much more conservative approach (for Monogatari standards, anyway) to highlight her words. But as with Senjougahara previously, that perception \u2013 as seen through Araragi \u2013 is very deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hanekawa suffers underneath that appearance of perfection. She\u2019s far from as perfect as she appears to be, and far, far more imperfect than Araragi idealizes her as. She lies, then lies about lying. She tries her best to avoid her parents. She suffers but refuses to let anyone worry about her. She doesn\u2019t know everything, least of all how to handle her own situation right. She only knows what she knows, which isn\u2019t always enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While most of her imperfections come from a place of genuine care for other people, they\u2019re deeply unhealthy. She avoids her parents because she feels responsible when /they hit her/, she lies to avoid other people having to worry about her, and as a result suffers more and more herself. She gives away her own happiness so that others can be marginally happier in the ignorance and terribleness she prevents them from realizing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, that\u2019s no way to live, and just as she sends tiny cries for help in Araragi\u2019s direction, speaking to him about what troubles her, her other, less admirable feelings burst out during Golden Week and express what she tried to suppress as long as she could. In the form of an animalistic presentation of her ferocious, dark feelings (or, well, a cat-girl), she takes out her stress on the source and innocents alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back during the events of Golden Week, she was \u201cfixed\u201d in the same way that Kanbaru would have been \u201cfixed\u201d with her arm cut off. Instead of dealing with the source, Shinobu simply drained her stress away. But with her family situation as problematic as always, the source of her stress is still there, and so that phenomenon returns. Until now, or chronologically, from that point on, Araragi and the other characters made sure to confront their problems directly rather than try to shallowly cut them out.
