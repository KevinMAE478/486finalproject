If I was actually reading the novels I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I would like it a lot more, since I&amp;#39;m the one imagining the visuals, the sounds, the characters, the pacing, etc. Making it fun for me in my own way. But an anime has to do all those things in a way it entertains everyone while also keeping the source material intact. THAT is where the show fails to me.

Progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can say, I will follow this anime. This episode looks interesting than previous episode and i kinda enjoy it. Unfortunately, i&amp;#39;m not feeling anything watching every sad scene because it seems empty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for the first time ever, i dislike the ending song from anime. Very not fitting at all with that kind of anime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "anime", "name": "t1_dg6kwi6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492060716.0, "created_utc": 1492031916.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zb21", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6x2pr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "conicalPendulum420", "parent_id": "t3_64zb21", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Any LN spoilers about Soma?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any LN spoilers about Soma?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "anime", "name": "t1_dg6x2pr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492075614.0, "created_utc": 1492046814.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zb21", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg718fn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Netheral", "parent_id": "t3_64zb21", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Eh this episode is ok.
