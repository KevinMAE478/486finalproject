That information is not the same as US iStore, for example, so you cannot simply copy it without authenticating the account first and that, as far as my own experience goes, is not something you can do automatically, without compromising account&amp;#39;s security. Also, copying an account from one server from another would be a stupid move from financial perspective, since that would basically double the value of that account. I haven&amp;#39;t played F/GO, so I dunno, maybe they have their own unique authentication system that is not attached to iTunes/Google and it might make account transfer more manageable, but even then, they really have no incentive to remove an active player from one server to move them to another. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "anime", "name": "t1_dgb6cr0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492319201.0, "created_utc": 1492290401.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kvg3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb6it0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "J3N0V4", "parent_id": "t1_dgb5vea", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They would have to allow some late game content to be transferred and assuming this is like every other game that started in Japan and moved to a US server it will be pretty far behind content wise", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would have to allow some late game content to be transferred and assuming this is like every other game that started in Japan and moved to a US server it will be pretty far behind content wise&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "anime", "name": "t1_dgb6it0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492319436.0, "created_utc": 1492290636.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb5vea", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pamasich", "parent_id": "t1_dgb2enh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How would a new server make transfer impossible?
