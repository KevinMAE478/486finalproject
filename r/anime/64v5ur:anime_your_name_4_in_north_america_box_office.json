Smurfs + Going In Style have 3k theatres each (and took 1 and 2 respectively for new releases). Christian Film &amp;quot;The Case for Christ&amp;quot; was in 1k films and was ranked 3. After Your Name at 4th with 290 theatres, you have 13 other films. 1 of those (Gifted) was in only 56 theatres, 2 (Extraordinary Mission and Alive and Kicking) were in less than 20 theatres (19 and 20 respectively) and the remaining 10 were in in between 1 and 4 theatres nationwide (the most notable being Colossal which was in 4 and grossed 120k, a 30k theatre average compared to Your Name&amp;#39;s 5.6k theatre average).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If movies like Smurfs and Going In Style are wide release, Your Name and Case for Christ would be considered a Limited Release and everything else that was new this week would be considered Super Limited Release. So not really comparable weight class wise&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "anime", "name": "t1_dg5dvbw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491995282.0, "created_utc": 1491966482.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64v5ur", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5jrsl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bakakubi", "parent_id": "t3_64v5ur", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The film doing well in the US is always great news!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film doing well in the US is always great news!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "anime", "name": "t1_dg5jrsl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492005704.0, "created_utc": 1491976904.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64v5ur", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5z7ul", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FullmentalFiction", "parent_id": "t3_64v5ur", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "body": "PSA: to everyone who saw only one week's worth of showing for Your Name on Fandango, my local theater just updated their listings with another week's worth of shows.
