Weak stomachs turn away (although if you\u2019re watching this show I think you should be fine). \n\nSo in today\u2019s episode Killua was attacked with fleas that seem to make him constantly bleed, which could drain his stamina. \n\nWell, because of that, today\u2019s wonderful term for our 100th episode is **blading**.\n\nNow, I think in all my posts we\u2019ve established wrestling is fake. Yet if you\u2019ve ever seen clips, you may have seen people bleeding while wrestling. Obviously fake blood, right?\n\nUnfortunately, no. Blood is used to heighten the drama of a match. To raise the stakes. To further suspend people\u2019s disbelief. And how do they get the blood. Wrestlers used to hide miniature razor blades in pockets or tape, and then cut their own forehead. Not a deep cut, but enough to draw blood and then spread it around the face. Yes, this can and does go wrong sometimes. And because I can get grossed out by them too, I won\u2019t link to any bad (or in some cases, good) ones. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re saying \u201cthat\u2019s so awful\u201d, it\u2019s actually the preferred method. Now a day\u2019s blading is not allowed in WWE, and people have been fined 6 digits for doing it. Yet tell me, how would you get blood? With a tiny blade, or having someone [legitimately punch you until you bleed (really NSFW).]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEBssrbEg_Y)\n\nFortunately for all of you, showing blood in wrestling is now not allowed since WWE went PG. So now a days you should be safe. But still, after watching wrestling for a while, a little blood can heighten a match greatly, and there are some fans that desperately want it back.  \n   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOn to the episode itself, which was mostly centered on a really enjoyable fight with Killua. It felt similar to the one Gon was in yesterday, but for some reason I enjoyed this one a lot more. Once Killua is target by the dragonfly ant, he sends minions to attack Killua. But as I hoped, Killua ain\u2019t having none of that shit. Seeing him effortlessly take down all those ants, even if it was for a second was really fun to watch. Although being stopped in his tracks by a fart must be so insulting. I hope that ant on a roller can come back and get his neck snapped by Killua. \n\nThen comes the sniper dual, and I really like the sniper enemy. He had a charm to how he sang, that both got on my nerves and strangely made him endearing. He was eventually unmasked as an ~~octopus~~ parasite like ant that was controlling him. I was initially said that the personality was a fa\u00e7ade, but holy shit this ~~octopus~~ parasite is even better.

And here\u2019s to another 100! Or 48. ^^wish ^^it ^^was ^^another ^^100\n", "edited": 1491864531.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Timer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlXDxPU-VKDq9G0l-xjEh6820exrrtGkd7rD13Ijyjw/edit?usp=sharing\"&gt;Link to pro wrestling terms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I didn\u2019t think I would have to bring this out, but for today\u2019s wrestling term were getting a little gruesome. Weak stomachs turn away (although if you\u2019re watching this show I think you should be fine). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in today\u2019s episode Killua was attacked with fleas that seem to make him constantly bleed, which could drain his stamina. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, because of that, today\u2019s wonderful term for our 100th episode is &lt;strong&gt;blading&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I think in all my posts we\u2019ve established wrestling is fake. Yet if you\u2019ve ever seen clips, you may have seen people bleeding while wrestling. Obviously fake blood, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no. Blood is used to heighten the drama of a match. To raise the stakes. To further suspend people\u2019s disbelief. And how do they get the blood. Wrestlers used to hide miniature razor blades in pockets or tape, and then cut their own forehead. Not a deep cut, but enough to draw blood and then spread it around the face. Yes, this can and does go wrong sometimes. And because I can get grossed out by them too, I won\u2019t link to any bad (or in some cases, good) ones. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you\u2019re saying \u201cthat\u2019s so awful\u201d, it\u2019s actually the preferred method. Now a day\u2019s blading is not allowed in WWE, and people have been fined 6 digits for doing it. Yet tell me, how would you get blood? With a tiny blade, or having someone &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEBssrbEg_Y\"&gt;legitimately punch you until you bleed (really NSFW).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for all of you, showing blood in wrestling is now not allowed since WWE went PG. So now a days you should be safe. But still, after watching wrestling for a while, a little blood can heighten a match greatly, and there are some fans that desperately want it back.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On to the episode itself, which was mostly centered on a really enjoyable fight with Killua. It felt similar to the one Gon was in yesterday, but for some reason I enjoyed this one a lot more. Once Killua is target by the dragonfly ant, he sends minions to attack Killua. But as I hoped, Killua ain\u2019t having none of that shit. Seeing him effortlessly take down all those ants, even if it was for a second was really fun to watch. Although being stopped in his tracks by a fart must be so insulting. I hope that ant on a roller can come back and get his neck snapped by Killua. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then comes the sniper dual, and I really like the sniper enemy. He had a charm to how he sang, that both got on my nerves and strangely made him endearing. He was eventually unmasked as an &lt;del&gt;octopus&lt;/del&gt; parasite like ant that was controlling him. I was initially said that the personality was a fa\u00e7ade, but holy shit this &lt;del&gt;octopus&lt;/del&gt; parasite is even better. I\u2019ve only heard one joke from him, but him yelling \u201cDON\u2019T CALL ME AN OCTOPUS\u201d as the ED transition came on got a belly laugh out of me.

I love this guy, and his ability is pretty cool. All we know right now is that he can take control of bodies, but he can also shoot out fleas that prevent blood clotting. &lt;strong&gt;Sniper no sniping! Sniper no sniping! Sniper no sniping!&lt;/strong&gt; Plus, dude is so defensive about his appearance. &lt;strong&gt;Oh my god Killua, you can&amp;#39;t just ask someone if they are an Octopus!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arm Count&lt;/strong&gt; (for previous Arms, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5ztmwz/rewatch_hunter_x_hunter_2011_episode_75midseries/df0xwhb/\"&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/643gdk/rewatch_hunter_x_hunter_2011_episode_97/dfz3u8e/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). 1 on this list corresponds to number 60, because list making is stupid)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That Pincer Chimera Ant that Killua decapitated and disarmed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ikalgo&amp;#39;s host&amp;#39;s arms/body being devoured by the fish&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ikalgo&amp;#39;s tentacles cut off by Killua (I&amp;#39;m counting it)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have two other things happening. Orange Lion is trying to stop the Revolution, and try and get favors from people to rise up the ranks. He is trying to play a chessmaster, but he isn&amp;#39;t fooling anyone. Except Cheetu, but that guy is too stupid. Too bad he helped Cheetu, as otherwise he would have been captured by Knuckle and Shoot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, we get a fun meeting between Gon and Meleoron. He is so convinced that Gon won&amp;#39;t listen to him/trust him, but Gon straight up believes the guy who was stalking him for the past few days. &lt;strong&gt;Stop being so trusting Gon!!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "anime", "name": "t1_dg3cywf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491890495.0, "created_utc": 1491861695.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64mp90", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64mp90", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3tt52", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ShaKing807", "parent_id": "t1_dg3czw0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Gon has finally found his tracker, believed basically everything they said, and is willing to talk.
