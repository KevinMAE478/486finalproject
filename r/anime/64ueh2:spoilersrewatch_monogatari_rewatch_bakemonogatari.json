It's my third time watching the series as a whole, but I've watched this specific episode probably 7 or 8 times, if not more. It just has everything that I love about this series.\n\nIt starts off with Senjougahara sporting an awesome new hairstyle and playing around with Arararagi while eating lunch. Such a welcome scene for not having seen her for several episodes. They finally decide to go on their first date, which surprised me the first time I watched it. Didn't know they hadn't gone on a date yet. So the rest of the episode is them going on this date, which sounds amazing even without knowing what exactly is coming next. We also get a call back to \"Staple Stable,\" which is my all-time favorite opening for the series, as well as anime in general. And it's very appropriate for this episode.\n\nThe car scene is probably my second favorite scene in the series. For 10 or so minutes, we get a super high concentrated dose of that classic Hitagi/Koyomi banter that I fell in love with all the way back in episode 3. Except this time, they've already professed their love to each other and are dating, so every word they share carries an entirely different and much more emotional meaning. And it's so very charming/hilarious/whatever word you choose to describe their back-and-forth. Also, her dad sitting in the front makes this scene a thousand times more hilarious. It captures that feeling of meeting your girlfriend's dad for the first time and trying not to fuck up in front of him perfectly. I'm writing this up early, so I haven't watched the episode yet this time around, since I want it to be fresh in my mind when I read everyone's reactions, but I still remember clearly every single jab and reaction between the two and how amazing everything was. I wish I could have Senjougahara toy with me like that for the rest of my life.\n\nThe talk with her dad in the middle of the episode is also super special. You get that feel of relief after he basically asks Araragi to help make Senjougahara a better person and be an important part of her life. Getting that kind of blessing from your girlfriend's dad, especially given their family history, is one of the greatest things you can hear in that position.\n\nNext is probably my most favorite scene in the entire series. I'll preface this part by saying one thing. It's very easy to cry over a character's death, or over their childhood friend moving away, or any other tragic thing from a sad show, really. But to cry at something so purely romantic and positive, without a hint of negative feelings anywhere, it takes so much more to cause your emotions to overflow and break out crying over how beautiful the scene is. This scene was that sort of experience to me.\n\nThe starry sky scene is so iconic in the history of this show - if you've seen those reddit threads in the past about what your favorite episode/scene is, one of the most common responses is \"bake ep 12\" or \"starry sky scene.\" This is where that's from. Everything about this scene is absolutely beautiful. The scenery. Perfectly drawn nighttime skies that sit you right on the grass next to the main characters, staring upwards on a summer night. Senjougahara still looks beatiful (as if that hasn't always been the case). The words she shares with Araragi have incredible weight to them. It's one of the most honest and unique confessions of love I've seen. Hearing this for the first time made me fall in love with Senjougahara so hard. I already loved her from the beginning of episode 1, but this just elevated that so much. And the way she asked to kiss him at the end. So cute and so her. They're both new to this teenage love, and you can see that, but at the same time, you can see just how much in love they are with each other. She's trying so hard to express her love to him, and this is how those feelings manifest. Finally, if that's not enough, the music playing in the background for this scene is equally beautiful. \"Senjougahara Tore\" is probably my favorite OST track in the series as well. We've heard it a few times before, at very crucial moments in their relationship, so hearing this theme elicits all those emotions we had from before, plus everything we're experiencing right now. Every time I play this track at home, I start to well up and remember everything I felt from this. It's such beautiful music for such a beautiful scene.\n\nAnd then it plays off to the ending, \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari,\" my #1 favorite ending and probably just favorite song in all of anime. If you haven't looked at the lyrics to this song yet, look at them the next time you watch. After this episode, this song should mean so much more to you. The connection it has with the starry sky scene makes this song even more special to me than before (if that was even possible).\n\nTo sum all this up, everything about this episode is perfect. It has everything I love about the series all in one. And I absolutely LOVE Senjougahara. Like probably too much. She's my best girl of all time. GOAT waifu. And this episode probably played a huge role in developing that opinion. If you weren't in love with Senjougahara before this episode, that should be different now. I absolutely love this show and this episode means so much to me. I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as I did.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope you guys don&amp;#39;t mind if I gush for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is probably my favorite episode of anything ever in the history of everything.

The ability to help you study. A cute junior and a brusque father. And this starry sky.\u201d\n\nToday, we\u2019re taking a break from fighting supernatural monsters to watch what is almost certainly one of the best episodes of anime ever made. Let\u2019s be honest here; there\u2019s no way anything I can write here will measure up to what we just saw, but I\u2019ll try to do it justice.\n\nSenjougahara sure has changed a lot in the month since she reclaimed her feelings from the heavy crab and started dating Araragi. We see several different sides to her in this episode, all of them as different from each other as they are from her harsh and violent attitude at the beginning of the series. The first is in the opening scene, when she and Araragi are eating lunch. They\u2019re a pair of friggin\u2019 cuties with their I &lt;3 Hitagi and I &lt;3 Koyomi bentos, both of which I assume she made. She takes it even further with her dumb cute rice joke. It\u2019s a bubbly, goofy, carefree Senjougahara that we\u2019ve never really seen before. The rice-on-face thing shows off her penchant for teasing that she\u2019s always had, but it\u2019s perfectly innocent and light-hearted. Araragi was a little less cheery about the whole thing. Though he was appropriately excited once the date was confirmed, at first he was more scared or even suspicious of what his girlfriend was getting at.\n\nThe second side of Senjougahara comes forth in the car scene. This is her cheeky teasing turned up to 11. She undoubtedly picked up on how nervous Araragi was with her father in the car, and decided to mercilessly exploit that and make him as uncomfortable as possible. Her first barb was simply insisting on being called Hitagi, which despite its harmlessness was extra nerve-wracking for poor Koyomi because of how she actively pulled her dad into the conversation every time he said \"Senjougahara.\" Next, she put him on the spot by asking what he loved about her. We've seen before that this is a difficult question for Araragi to answer at the best of times. He brushed it off and changed the subject when Kanbaru asked him, and this time was no different. He tried to turn the tables on her, but Hitagi was able to answer instantly: \"You're kind. You're cute. You're like a prince who would rescue me whenever I'm in trouble.\" And finally, worst of all, she got kinky. Her fingers stroking the inside of his thigh was bad enough. Combined with the awesome double-entendre \u201cIf you keep it up, Araragi-kun, perhaps you can aim even higher\u201d that sequence is already more provocative than any fanservice I've ever seen. Interesting note, the leg stroking stopped as soon as Araragi mentioned Hanekawa. A little bit of jealousy maybe? Either way it soon returned with a vengeance, and Senjou topping it off by biting his ear makes that by far the most arousing thing I've ever seen in anime.\n\nAfter all that Hitagi did to make Araragi uncomfortable around her father, she delivered the coup de grace by forcing the two of them to sit and talk alone together, and even better, we quickly see that Hitagi got her nasty teasing wit from her dad. But seriously, I love that this scene exists. It would have been so easy for the story to ignore her dad, with his typical workaholic absentee parent characterization. But this conversation shows that Senjougafather really cares, and looked at through the lens of Araragi\u2019s perceived failure in the last arc, I think it taught him an important lesson. Senjougafather blames himself, at least in part, for everything that happened to his daughter. He was too busy and wasn\u2019t there for Hitagi when she needed him. Maybe if she had had that parental support when her mother betrayed her, she would never have fallen so deep into distrust and fear. And now that he sees Hitagi recovering, he is nothing but thankful to the one who helped her. Araragi tries to downplay his role in her improvement, because that\u2019s just the way he is, but Senjougafather gets around it. We\u2019ve seen that Araragi makes it his business to save people, then divests responsibility if he succeeds but blames himself if he fails. It\u2019s an attitude that keeps his self-esteem low no matter what the outcome is. Senjougafather cuts through all that by simply saying that he doesn\u2019t have to be the hero to be a good guy. The most important thing is just being there when you\u2019re needed. If you trust and support the people you care about, then they will be able to save themselves. It\u2019s neither your job nor your prerogative to sacrifice yourself for them.\n\nAnd finally, the starry sky scene shows the third side of Senjougahara, serious and earnest and vulnerable. Scenes like this one are always the best part of Monogatari, when two people drop all the fearful pretenses and conflicting emotions that they surround themselves with and simply open up and pour out their hearts to each other. For the first time, we\u2019re seeing Senjougahara without any of the defenses that she erected around herself. This sky is her treasure. It\u2019s her happiest memory of her and her parents together as a family. This beautiful sky was thrown away with everything else when she wished for the heavy crab to take away her feelings because remembering the happy times before everything fell apart was too painful, but now, with no hint of hesitation or sadness, Senjougahara is able to share that memory with the new most important person in her life. \u201cAlthough my life hasn\u2019t been very fortunate until now, I\u2019m glad if I caught your eye because of that misfortune. Because of that, I was able to fall for you.\u201d She has finally learned that her past is not what defines her, that the bad things that happened to her before are not traps that should hold her back from what her future could be. Our history informs our future, but bad things can lead to good. Just because you lost what once made you happy doesn\u2019t mean that you can never be happy again.\n\nStill, although Senjou has learned to accept and move on from her traumatic experiences, that doesn\u2019t mean she has gotten over them. The saddest and most beautiful lines in this scene are \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m afraid to do with you what he did to me. I\u2019m really afraid that I\u2019ll hate you for it, Araragi-kun. Right now, I\u2019m afraid of losing you.\u201d Senjougahara\u2019s sexual assault still haunts her. She\u2019s become comfortable enough with Araragi to open up to him emotionally, but sexuality still terrifies her. So she presents herself to him at her most vulnerable, and begs for his patience until she feels that she\u2019s ready to take the next step and open up to him physically as well. And Araragi responds in the perfect way. He holds her hand and squeezes her, a tacit understanding that he will give her whatever she needs and a silent promise that he will always be there for her, that she never has to be afraid of losing him. \n\nAt the end of the episode, they repeat the \u201cDo you love me?\u201d exchange from the car scene. Senjougahara gives the exact same reasons as last time: \"You're kind. You're cute. You're like a prince who would rescue me whenever I'm in trouble.\" And this time, for the first time, Araragi was finally able to answer: \u201cEverything. There\u2019s nothing about you I don\u2019t love.\u201d This is what I love so much about their relationship. Araragi and Senjougahara weren\u2019t meant for each other, they didn\u2019t fall in love at first sight, they didn\u2019t instantly understand and fix each other. They\u2019ve both struggled to come around to each other\u2019s failings and peculiarities, but they made it work. And now, finally, we can see the moment when they open up and fully, truly fall in love with each other. Their kiss is the end of the first chapter of their relationship, but for the two of them, there is so much more to come.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/cUv2JsO.png\"&gt;Screenshot of the Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun Quote of the Day:&lt;/strong&gt; \u201cIf you keep it up, Araragi-kun, perhaps you can aim even higher.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serious Quote of the Day:&lt;/strong&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s all I have.

From such a question inducing first ep of the arc we take a break with this heartwarming ep from start to finish. No twists, no turns, just Senjou and Araragi being themselves around each other and having a nice time. This kind of slow down was something that was needed. \n\n* We start off at school and Senjou and Araragi are having a conversation. Senjou starts off by acting more cutesy around Araragi than we are used to seeing. It\u2019s nice to see that even though she hasn\u2019t been part of the last few eps, her relationship with Araragi s progressing along well. One thing I find interesting, and it\u2019s something I notice throughout the ep, but you can see how Senjou is putting a lot of effort to this relationship. It clearly means a lot to her, especially after what she\u2019s had to go through in her life, and it definitely comes through in how she tries to re-phrase her lines to seem more like questions. Ultimately though, she ends up saying them as she normally would.\n\n* One thing that threw me for a loop was when Araragi gave us the [ol\u2019 bait and switch](http://imgur.com/CTMiSsl) in foreshadowing. I was almost sure at this point that by the end of the episode something would have happened in relation to the arc that would have put a strain on their relationship. \n\n* Speaking of this arc, does this ep really count as a continuation of it? They only really mention it once and even then its really just in a passing statement about how Hanekawa must be experiencing a lot of stress. I\u2019ll be interested how this ep in particular ties into the arc, if it even does. The only tie in I can imagine right now is that maybe part of Hanekawa\u2019s stress is linked to Senjou, so when she turns into Ha-neko-awa (*Nya-ha-ha~*), Araragi will be in a predicament where he has to choose to save only one of them. Even if both get saved in the end, the dilemma that Araragi would have could maybe cause a hesitation that causes Senjou to question whether he is fully into this relationship. \n\n* Anyway, back to the ep at hand. So Senjou\u2019s father is their chauffeur for their trip to where the date will take place. It\u2019s nice to see Senjou\u2019s dad show up in an ep. I must say I did feel for Araragi a bit at the start of the date. He\u2019s expecting a nice relaxing date in the house only to end up in a car with his girlfriend and her dad. On a first date no less, you can see him sweating bullets at just about every turn in their conversation, especially when Senjou starts trying to bring her dad into the conversation.\n\n* Soon things start ramping up and Senjou starts becoming a smooth criminal and making moves. Rubbing Araragi\u2019s leg and letting the cars momentum push her close to him, I almost expected her to top it off with a fake yawn into putting her arm around Araragi. Although this all stops at the mention of Hanekawa. It was at this point I thought a twist would happen or maybe even a \u201cHow can you mention Hanekawa while on a date with me?\u201d, since we already saw how Senjou can get jealous of Araragi during their last study session, but I was wrong. Senjou\u2019s actions might have suggested that that wasn\u2019t what she wanted but she wasn\u2019t as vocal about it this time and just let the conversation flow through it. Like I mentioned before, she is putting a lot of effort into this and its these small details of Senjou we\u2019ve become accustomed to that seem to point it out quite well.\n\n* Soon the car parks and Senjou goes to get the date all set up, leaving Araragi with Mr Senjougahara. Now this is where the real twist happens for me. After the car journey and the last conversation in the car with Senjou going full Leroy Jenkins with her dirty quotes and hand movements while trying to convince Araragi that Kanbaru is not the erotic one, I was expecting the rest of the ep to carry this banter forward. I was wrong. Suddenly we have this heartfelt scene between Senjou\u2019s father and Araragi where Senjou\u2019s father thanks Araragi for all he is doing for her. It\u2019s obvious how much he loves his daughter and since he focuses so much on his job, he doesn\u2019t get to spend as much time with her as he wants but through Araragi he has managed to not only spend more time with her due to her wanting to do stuff with/for Araragi but also see her happy and enjoying life for the first time after her event with her mum\u2019s cult and the eventual sickness she gained after that. Araragi being himself, sees that he didn\u2019t have much of a part to play in those situation so declines the thanks ( like he does in Sengoku\u2019s arc when she thanks him for saving her) but Senjou\u2019s dad doesn\u2019t care about that. He cares about the changes he is seeing in his daughter and it\u2019s all coming from Araragi doing what he can\u2019t, **just being there for her**. Even if that is all Araragi does, as far as Senjou\u2019s father is concerned [\u201cThat is all he has to do\u201d](http://imgur.com/HYiny2V). \n\n* The wholesomeness of this ep doesn\u2019t end there. Senjou comes back and takes Araragi to their date site, which happens to be a night of relaxing under the stars. The whole of this scene just picks up from there. We get a stunning shot of the night sky with it\u2019s millions of stars in the sky and in the background we here the quiet hum of wildlife around them over the soft tones of Senjou\u2019s theme in piano version. Boy, is that version of her theme so good. It adds more emotion to the moment and really drives home her feelings towards him as she speaks. Then the first words she says is the first line of the [ED](http://imgur.com/6X6DwLt). \n\n* I mentioned before how I liked how Shaft used their music to set the tone of the situation in Sengoku\u2019s arc but this is just wonderful. We\u2019ve heard this version of Senjou\u2019s theme once before I think when she is apologising to the Hitagi Crab but the emotion and weight given off by it now is completely different than it was then. It also kind of ties into then as well also, in the sense that it gives us a perspective to see the relationship. Like, \u201clook how far we\u2019ve come from that time\u201d and this is highlighted by Araragi\u2019s flashback to those events and times since then with her. and that look of [content](http://imgur.com/LOQjgPN) afterwards.\n\n* We then get Senjou talking about how this is everything she has and that she is giving them all to Araragi, which leads to a question ask earlier on in the ep. \u201cWhat does he like about he\u201d to which we get \u201cEverything. There is nothing I don\u2019t like\u201d. It\u2019s such an adorable scene that made me vocally \u201cawwww\u201d. I swear Shaft went into the future, spent the day lurking on r/WholesomeMemes and then came back to  make this ep. \n\nThis ep was great. It was so heartwarming and wholesome and\u2026 damn it Shaft stop playing with my emotions. It really advanced both Senjou and Araragi not only as individual characters but also as a couple. Due to their conversation at the end of the ep I made sure pay attention to the words of the ED today and it really did stand out. It felt like a continuation of this ep with Senjou talking to Araragi. I\u2019m know expecting the next few episodes to be intense and really start to answer some questions in relation to the current arc, Shinobu\u2019s part in the series and Araragi\u2019s willingness to help anyone and how it will ultimately affect things. Shaft won\u2019t let us off easy with an ep like this without turning the next ep up to 11, right?\u2026.Right?\n", "edited": 1491952398.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Watch Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well.. that ep was not what I was expecting.

Senjou\u2019s back! 2. She makes a damn cute Bento (I\u2019m guessing she made it).  The *\u201cI &lt;3 Hitagi\u201d* and *\u201cI &lt;3 Koyomi\u201d*  With heart shaped eggs is adorable.  3. This new hairstyle\u2026Be still my heart.  Ok back to the write-up\u2026\n \nAnd for me, Staple Stable is back, not sure if it\u2019s the same for everyone else after reading the comments from others, but it kind of fits after the opening to this episode. NOTE: Came back here after finishing the ep. It definitely feels right to have used this OP.  \n \nHer dad is oddly quiet through all of this.  We don\u2019t even see his face. He is so quiet it\u2019s getting kinda weird. Btw, Why does she live alone if her parents are there.  All the love talk comes off very strange in the car.  Not sure what to think here, this whole situation is just kind of odd.\n\nActually Senjou brings up a good point.  They\u2019ve been dating for a bit now, why hasn\u2019t he been using her first name. They\u2019ve even confessed love.  Might be reading too much into it, but it seems odd.\n \nI love that she has a prepared answer to the love question and he just dodges it.  It fits the two of them perfectly\n \nWoah Senjou, getting a little handsy there with your pops in the car lol. *\u201cPerhaps you can aim even higher\u201d*  I\u2019m dying.  She just loves toying with him.\n\nSenjou makes an interesting point here about Hanekawa.  Maybe her cat from is coming back because of a new form of stress.  Hanekawa always puts on a strong act, but all that pressure must be overwhelming.\n\n*\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d*  Them\u2019s fighting words Ragi haha.  It\u2019s surprising he can handle all that stimulus without passing out.\n \nAnd so, he finally speaks and we meet her father.  His voice kinda took me by surprise. He\u2019s a nice guy, who really cares for his daughter, but I think isn\u2019t sure how to handle things in the follow-up of her almost-rape. He also gives us a different view of the change in Senjou while being with Ragi, except this time, unlike last ep, it\u2019s very positive.  Hanekawa and Ragi\u2019s classmates saw this as Ragi corrupting Senjou, but her father sees the truth in the change. She was finally able to open her heart again after closing it down to the outside world. For a self-proclaimed never-around workaholic, that seems oddly astute, but makes sense considering he\u2019s her father. I really like how they played this reveal.  It also explains his lack of action in the car.  He trusts Senjou implicitly and lets her be herself. \n \nWoooow.  That night sky is gorgeous.  The summer triangle stands out as that\u2019s part of the first line of the ED.  Gonna see if anything new hits me that information.\n \nSome really honest words from Senjou that sort of clash and don\u2019t clash with her actions in the car. *\u201cI can offer spiteful and abusive words.\u201d*  I\u2019d add actions to that statement.  She pushes the limit with him, like in the car, but that\u2019s because she knows Raragi so well and likes to push his buttons, not to be seen as sex-crazy. She really doesn\u2019t know how she\u2019s been affected by the trauma in her past and how that will come out while they\u2019re together.  This is her opening everything to him as wide as it can go.  Something that stands out through all of this is that there\u2019s no sense of the usual biting sarcasm she hides behind, she\u2019s not hiding in this place. She has her own fears even if she buries them deep. It\u2019s beautiful.  Him grabbing her hand is a lovely cap to it all.  It feels like he\u2019s giving her some of his strength.  \n\n*\u201cI\u2019m glad if I caught your eye because of that misfortune.  Because of that, I was able to fall for you.\u201d*  There\u2019s a silver lining to everything.  She can\u2019t look too badly on some of the pain in her past, because it lead her to him in the end, and in her heart, that\u2019s all that matters.  \n \nAnd now he has an answer for her question.  *\u201cEverything\u201d*  And it doesn\u2019t feel cheap, because we know how true it is.  Everything, as an answer to that kind of question, usually comes off as a nothing answer when it comes to love.  But he feels for her so deeply, it rings true.\n \n*\u201cI\u2019m happy\u201d*  It\u2019s feels powerful coming from Ragi.  For the past 11 episodes, we\u2019ve gotten a sense of all the bad in his past.  He\u2019s never felt particularly happy to me.  He can be very cynical for the kind of guy he is.  But to hear him speak those words makes for a strong moment.\n \nAwwwwww we don\u2019t get to see the kiss, but I\u2019m not really that disappointed.  The scene holds so much without it.\n \nI\u2019ve talked before about how much I love this ED.  But, rightfully so, it reads SO MUCH different after this.  The words have so much more meaning behind them now.  He\u2019s remembering that night where she truly opens herself to him.  I feel like that the last couple arcs they were still feeling each other out, but now it\u2019s complete in a sense.\n \n**FINAL THOUGHTS**\n \n \nWhat a beautiful episode, made for a longer post than my usual fare.  Everything about it was just lovely.  It was just so calm, It almost feels like the end to the series.  It was a nice breather after the crazy pace of the bad things happening during the last two arcs. They at a nice, cute little bow on the first part of their relationship at the end there, meaning we can focus on Hanekawa and her troubles until the actual end.  This may be my favorite episode yet. Don\u2019t get me wrong, 8 was amazing, but this was breathtaking.  These two have come a long way in 12 episodes from Senjou\u2019s first fall into Ragi\u2019s arms.\n\nThat all being said, was this the actual end when it was airing? /u/Sinrus mentioned something about the last three eps being OVA\u2019s yesterday.  That must have been a horrible feeling; Getting teased with Hanekawa and then ending, unless everyone knew more was coming soon.\n\nI put most of what this series has been making me think and feel above, but just as a final note, I\u2019ve been listening to the Your Name music obsessively for the past 2 days and am listening while finishing this write up. They are a perfect representation of what the back half of the episode felt like to me.\n", "edited": 1491952352.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST TIMER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REACTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First note, right off the bat.  1.

Loved everything about it.\n\nFirst of all we have Senjougahara back! I missed her, too many episodes without her... She is having lunch with Araragi, it was cute to see that they had written \"I love 'lovers name'\" on their rice. Hitagi asks Araragi out on a date, not before doubting what she should say.\n\nOh, Staple Stable is back!\n\nSo the thing he had to do with Senjougahara and mentioned last episode was this date. It is kind of uncomfortable to go out on your first date and have your girlfriend's father there too. Man, Senjougahara touching Araragi's inner thigh with his father driving must've been hard for Koyomi, even more when she dirty talked to him and then bit him to make sure he viewed Kanbaru as pure and innocent.\n\nThey arrive at the place and Hitagi leaves Araragi alone with her father. Didn't expect Hitagi's father to be Madao. Well he said he is a workaholic so I guess he isn't Madao but Gendo (a way better version it seems, at least he cares for her daughter). The conversation was interesting, the father approved of Araragi even before they talked. He said that he managed to change Senjougahara and that is a lot. Araragi says it wasn't that big of a deal since she saved herself and he only was there. The father's response was great, sometimes you only need to be there when they need you and he did just that. The response is great because the father tells him because of his work he wasn't there for Hitagi when she needed him and thus failed his job as a father, and seeing how Senjougahara started to get more involved with him and asked a few things related to Araragi he decided to leave her in his hands.\n\nHitagi returns and takes Araragi deep in the forest without letting him look. When they arrive to the spot Araragi opens his eyes and we get a beautiful night sky full of stars. Both of them are now lying looking at the stars and Hitagi proceeds to teach Koyomi the constellations and stars, just like the first verses of the ED. After that she says that that is all that she has, all that she can give him: to help him with his studies, a cute kohai, a father and a starry night. Also some abusive words and her body. But she says that for that she wants to wait since she is afraid to start hating Araragi due to the incident where she was almost raped. Araragi says that he loves Hitagi, he loves everything about her. Hitagi says that she loves Araragi,  she loves that he is nice, cute and that he comes like a prince when she is in trouble. Then she says that the pig that tried to rape her didn't take anything from her lips and asks Koyomi for a kiss, ending the episode with ED playing while we look at the sky.\n\nThis might be my favourite episode of them all so far but it felt weird that it was placed here, in the middle of Hanekawa's arc.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First time viewer here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wow, that was a beautiful episode.

Well, here goes nothing.\n\nThat was a wonderful experience from start to finish, a beautiful articulation of everything that Hitagi and Araragi\u2019s relationship is built on. That was honestly one of the best romance episodes I have ever seen. Feeling each character shining through in every line, every moment brimming with instances of their unique personalities bouncing off each other \u2013 Hitagi and Araragi are a fantastic couple, both from a viewer perspective and for each other, and this episode managed to portray everything that is great about them in one gorgeous, hilarious, poignant romantic date.\n\nHitagi is afraid. Afraid of other people, afraid of being hurt, afraid of romance. She does well hiding that fact, from her sharp tongue to her emotional shields. She\u2019s warded of many people like that, even people genuinely in love with her (such as Kanbaru.) One person, however, managed to break through her shield, and while maybe not quite keeping up with her sharp tongue, at least offers a genuine attempt. He broke through her shield, pulled her out of her comfort zon, and helped her lift the emotional weight that was too heavy for her on her own. Through his help (and, of course, Oshino\u2019s), she could save herself. In turn, Hitagi drags out the best in him. She saved him from the limits of the foolish mindset that is the reason he could break through her shield. Without her intervention, Araragi would succumb to the limits of his desire to save everyone, no matter the cost \u2013 and he could easily end up dead. Similarly, though perhaps somewhat less flashy, Hitagi helped him gain better grades and Araragi helped her gain back an old friend. They help each other with their social awkwardness. They bring out the best in each other, challenge each other to become ever better and grow out of their juvenile fantasies, little by little. What Oshino is to every character, Araragi and Hitagi are to each other \u2013 someone that can help them grow past or learn to live with their problems. To help save themselves from their hell. Someone who can help them grow up. \n\nA little less spectacularly than the show\u2019s painfully accurate portrayal of adolescence, but equally great: Their date starts off with one more elaborate scene presenting their characters\u2019 and how wonderfully they bounce off each other. That scene was a hilarious joy from start to finish. In what I can only describe as Hitagi\u2019s elaborate, meticulously crafted battle plan for their date, she systematically flusters Araragi, drives him into a corner, and leads him to say exactly what she wants to hear. In the battle of love, to Hitagi, all weapons are fair, including the most gruesome of all \u2013 a parent. She mercilessly users her father\u2019s presence like a weapon, forcing him to awkwardly respond to the question \u201cDo you love me\u201d and \u201cWhat do you like about me.\u201d That\u2019s another reflection of Hitagi\u2019s insecurity \u2013 she first has to ask Araragi these personal questions brimming with emotional vulnerability in the safety of her father\u2019s presence (we\u2019ll go into more detail on that later). She also can\u2019t just ask Araragi to call her by her more personal first name \u2013 no, Hitagi has to literally leave him no other way than to refer to her other than Hitagi by abusing how embarrassed he is of her father\u2019s presence. That may seem like manipulation, and in some way, it is. But it also comes from a very understandable place that the show explores with great empathy. She only wants to grow closer to Araragi, this is just the only way she knows how. She asks if his grades improved after her tutoring, and is happy to hear to they did. She genuinely cares and tries her hardest to strive for an even better relationship, to bring the best out of each other even more. To strike the final blow, she uses her sexuality to drive Araragi crazy. Her battle plan succeeds; Araragi lies in utter defeat. It\u2019s the only way she knows how to become closer to Araragi, and that dynamic is as hilarious and endearing as it is one more sharp reflection of their characters. I love them so much.\n\nHitagi built a shield after being hurt. She can only slowly move on from that wound, but she tries her best. As she isn\u2019t quite ready yet to ask Araragi these personal questions like \u201cwhat do you like about me,\u201d she first asks him in front of his father, and then later asks him again in privacy, growing more comfortable. In the same manner, when she asks Araragi to go on a date with her, she starts off in her awkward, assertive manner, then tries to get away from it but doesn\u2019t quite get there. Later on when she asks Araragi to kiss her, she has the same troubles, but eventually she comes out with a diplomatic \u201clet\u2019s kiss.\u201d She\u2019s still awkward because of how much she closed herself off to others. She\u2019s still afraid of being hurt because of her emotional scar. In a physical sense, by doing with Araragi what the person trying to assault her wanted to do. And in an emotional sense, by being afraid of emotional vulnerability after she was betrayed time and time again. Her mother, con-artists, and all the other people that have forsaken her in one way or another, from her father\u2019s neglect to Kanbaru avoiding her after she harshly rejected her \u2013 Hitagi has many flaws as a result of her tough past, but she constantly makes an effort to improve. \n\nShe reveals more and more to Araragi, becomes more and more vulnerable, and eventually shows him everything she has. Despite her past, she goes as far as wanting physical intimacy, at least as much as she can deal with. And so they kiss. One last affirmation of how good they are for each other, of how much they have improved since they got together. The girl who wouldn\u2019t let anyone near her offers the boy she loves everything she has. The boy who would be nice to anyone has an incredibly personal, fulfilling romantic experience with the single girl who challenges his foolish ideals. What a beautiful moment as all they accomplished together, all they've  converges under the beautiful night sky, and, after going through hell, they finally find genuine happiness together. I love them so, so much.\n\n", "edited": 1491952151.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I\u2019m more than a little afraid I can only ruin the magic of this episode by putting it into words.
