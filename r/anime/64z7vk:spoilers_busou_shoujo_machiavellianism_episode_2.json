These are the ones that are all about &amp;quot;Rub my tits so I get more power&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is, however, a very different thing from something like &amp;quot;The World God Only Knows&amp;quot;, or even something with Ecchi components like To Love Ru, Saekano, or Infinite Stratos, in which the &amp;quot;harem&amp;quot; consists of a bunch of heroines competing for the protagonist&amp;#39;s individual attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The former- I can see how it would annoy you. A bunch of female characters engaging in intimacy with the guy solely for some manner of gain at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The latter? Eh... think of the most popular guy in your high school- how many girls were in his social group. How many of them would happily have dated him, individually on a one to one basis, if they thought they had a chance and he was unattached? You can argue that the protagonist isn&amp;#39;t special enough or interesting enough to BE that popular, but that&amp;#39;s a very different thing than it being a &amp;quot;disgusting notion&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the thing about the latter is that it offers the possibility of various &amp;quot;romantic endings&amp;quot;, since rarely do they settle upon a single heroine as being the canon choice. You want the protagonist to end up with Charl in Infinite Stratos? Use your imagination, you don&amp;#39;t have to get rid of something the author wrote.
