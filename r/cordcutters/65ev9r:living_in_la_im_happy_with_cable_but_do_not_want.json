BUT each one of these teams broadcasts a bunch of games on local tv and Fox always has a country wide saturday or sunday game.. so I can normally catch a bunch of games free right off my tv if I get my antenna straightened out.. at the minimum I can get baltimore and philly and the fox national game (not national&amp;#39;s game) so thats a few games right there.. then there is Yahoo Sports that has a free game of the day.. and whatever... and you know what .. thats enough for me.. however I really feel for people that are big fans and want to see every game their team plays whether its the dodgers that has a horrible broadcast plan or other people that like other sports even.. even people that miss game of throwns. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The deal is you have to choose.. can you do without? can you change your life? maybe you need a hobby like a car to work on or a second job to pay that student or home loan off .. I don&amp;#39;t know.. you know.. but you make choices..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your choice is to stay with cable then do it.. but don&amp;#39;t cry about it because there are a lot of choices out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cordcutters", "name": "t1_dga31uw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492248587.0, "created_utc": 1492219787.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sa6y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ev9r", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sa6y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ev9r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9qjlg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bryshawhere", "parent_id": "t1_dg9q91e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cordcutters", "controversiality": 0, "body": "True but the total price rises more and more over what id be paying my cable provider.
