Clearly in the telecom industry but also in politics. If you have a safe vote anywhere there&amp;#39;s no need to actually do a good job if that&amp;#39;s not the best way to get into office. Just like how for telecom the best way to make money isn&amp;#39;t actually in offering good service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any political office that&amp;#39;s more likely selected by pandering to special interests or drumming up fear of political opponents rather than governing will be filled by someone who&amp;#39;s better at doing those things no matter who they are. The person that&amp;#39;s good at governing loses to the person that&amp;#39;s good at campaigning and the person that&amp;#39;s good at campaigning will lose to the person that&amp;#39;s good at structuring (gerrymandering, outreach to targeted voters, disenfranchisement).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cordcutters", "name": "t1_dg65f1s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492044701.0, "created_utc": 1492015901.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sa6y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vv9k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg62sxa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg610c0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cordcutters", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cordcutters", "name": "t1_dg62sxa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492041956.0, "created_utc": 1492013156.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg610c0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IceBreak", "parent_id": "t1_dg60k8t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cordcutters", "controversiality": 1, "body": "&gt; The other wing of the same vampire sucking us dry.

When I went to read the actual bill (linked above) I found a quite different story.  The bill isn't so long, so it's a pretty quick read, so I recommend that.\n\nNothing in the bill gives $45M to AT&amp;T/Comcast, so there's nothing to quote. It provides a grant system (see section 5) of $10M/yr for 3 years to any authorized provider (of any sort authorized to provide broadband, including rural co-ops, but also AT&amp;T/Comcast (see block quote from first comment)) that can be applied for to expand to areas that meet certain criteria (no access faster than 10/1, etc.).  That's the closest it gets to giving them money.  So I guess if AT&amp;T/Comcast were the only providers to apply for and be accepted to build out infrastructure to under-served areas, then it might be true.  But only if they're the only ones awarded. \n\nThe other $15M comes from a $5M/yr for 3 years tax credit for providers serving \"Tier 3 and 4 enhancement counties\" which I'm less sure of (see section 3).  My guess is those that are designated as being a certain level of under-served.  Again, if AT&amp;T/Comcast were the only ones to do that and somehow managed to pay enough franchise/excise taxes in Tier 3 and 4 states to earn the $5M/year they could get to the 45M.\n\nSection 1 says:\n&gt; Authorizes electric cooperatives to provide broadband internet access or related services. Under the Rural Electric and Community Services Cooperative Act in present law, cooperatives are authorized to provide telephone, telegraph, and telecommunications services. This bill adds the provision of broadband internet access to the services that a cooperative may provide. This bill adds that any of the services that may be provided pursuant to the Act, including broadband internet access, outside the service area of the cooperative requires the permission of any municipal electric plant or cooperative in whose service area the services will be provided. This bill also requires that any of the authorized services be furnished on an area coverage basis. Generally, the provision of broadband internet services will be subject to the same present law provisions that apply to the provision of telephone, telegraph, and telecommunications services by a cooperative;\n\nSo there's your co-ops can do broadband, and even do it outside their areas as long as they have permission of whatever co-op serves that area.\n\nAs far as banning Chattanooga's EPB from expanding, this bill doesn't do that because that's already been done.  This bill just doesn't allow it, unlike a different bill that was passed.\n\nBasically, I read this bill as \"ok, in the rural areas, the telecom lobbyist aren't too worried about those since the density is too low.  If their co-ops want to offer services inside and outside their areas, fine.  But in the cities where we're located and care, we're going to hold steady and keep this language from effecting city-owned services like EPB\"  So it's a step in the right direction, but just a small one.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m saying the vice article is slanting things to a degree that they&amp;#39;re not accurate anymore, and we, on reddit, took that on faith.  When I went to read the actual bill (linked above) I found a quite different story.  The bill isn&amp;#39;t so long, so it&amp;#39;s a pretty quick read, so I recommend that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing in the bill gives $45M to AT&amp;amp;T/Comcast, so there&amp;#39;s nothing to quote. It provides a grant system (see section 5) of $10M/yr for 3 years to any authorized provider (of any sort authorized to provide broadband, including rural co-ops, but also AT&amp;amp;T/Comcast (see block quote from first comment)) that can be applied for to expand to areas that meet certain criteria (no access faster than 10/1, etc.).  That&amp;#39;s the closest it gets to giving them money.  So I guess if AT&amp;amp;T/Comcast were the only providers to apply for and be accepted to build out infrastructure to under-served areas, then it might be true.  But only if they&amp;#39;re the only ones awarded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other $15M comes from a $5M/yr for 3 years tax credit for providers serving &amp;quot;Tier 3 and 4 enhancement counties&amp;quot; which I&amp;#39;m less sure of (see section 3).  My guess is those that are designated as being a certain level of under-served.  Again, if AT&amp;amp;T/Comcast were the only ones to do that and somehow managed to pay enough franchise/excise taxes in Tier 3 and 4 states to earn the $5M/year they could get to the 45M.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Section 1 says:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Authorizes electric cooperatives to provide broadband internet access or related services.
