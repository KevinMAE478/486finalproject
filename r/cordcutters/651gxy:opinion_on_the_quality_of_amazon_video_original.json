Good Girls Revolt controversially got canceled, but I thought it was really good, and you can still watch the first season. Critics kind of hated Crisis in Six Scenes, but if you like Woody Allen, you&amp;#39;ll like it. Their Marvelous Mrs. Maisel pilot was as good as anything on Netflix, and they just picked it up for two seasons. I didn&amp;#39;t really like Man in the High Castle and I HATED The Grand Tour, but they&amp;#39;re both really popular, especially Grand Tour.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cordcutters", "name": "t1_dg6q8rl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492067252.0, "created_utc": 1492038452.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sa6y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651gxy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6t564", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zulmirao", "parent_id": "t3_651gxy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cordcutters", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There's some decent stuff -- I like \"Mozart in the Jungle\" for one.\n\nBut it is not on the level of Netflix originals.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s some decent stuff -- I like &amp;quot;Mozart in the Jungle&amp;quot; for one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it is not on the level of Netflix originals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cordcutters", "name": "t1_dg6t564", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492070841.0, "created_utc": 1492042041.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sa6y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651gxy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sa6y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651gxy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7d6f4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PowerSurged", "parent_id": "t1_dg75nl1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cordcutters", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Red Oaks is pretty great and it's getting one more (final) season I believe.
