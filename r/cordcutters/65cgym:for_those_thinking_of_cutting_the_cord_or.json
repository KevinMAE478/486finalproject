But I can live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad I went this route if not only for the moving savings, but I feel freer - not tied to a provider.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cordcutters", "name": "t1_dg9maqw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492226933.0, "created_utc": 1492198133.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sa6y", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cgym", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg95rsf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hypergur1", "parent_id": "t3_65cgym", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cordcutters", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not for me.
