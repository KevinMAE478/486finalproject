If you plug it into the same cable you&amp;#39;ll have the same results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Now there is a signal to noise ratio that you CAN POSSIBLY reduce by placing the modem as close to the incoming connection as possible. I.e. no cable splitters or T&amp;#39;s etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the error handling is unneeded overhead so if there is a low signal to noise ratio there is a lot of communication from your modem to their&amp;#39;s basically asking &amp;quot;Hey I think my &lt;del&gt;phone&lt;/del&gt; modem scrambled that, did you say &amp;quot;Two thirty&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;tooth Dirty&amp;quot; ?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;dr&lt;/strong&gt; Cheapest thing to try is move modem closer to the incoming cable connection bypassing cable spliters or T-junctions. Next is make sure you have a modem capable of the FULL channle spread, i.e. 8x4 or 16x4. If you have that but it&amp;#39;s DOCSIS 2.0 instead of 3.0 that is the least problem but will slow you down a tiny amount. I would not upgrade if the only difference is 2.0 -&amp;gt; 3.0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cordcutters", "name": "t1_dge2rf2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492490071.0, "created_utc": 1492461271.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
