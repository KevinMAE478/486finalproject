I feel like I'm immune to a lot of things after trying to remove a lot of my emotional reaction, but I'm still often left feeling destroyed by plenty of small things. Even things that aren't directly negative.\n\n&gt;tendency to bear grudges persistently, i.e. refusal to forgive insults and injuries or slights;\n\nI feel like I never *really* hold grudges, but in action, I'll be the horrible type of person like my mom has trained me to be by bringing stupid things up at horrible times.\n\n&gt;suspiciousness and a pervasive tendency to distort experience by misconstruing the neutral or friendly actions of others as hostile or \ncontemptuous;\n\nI often have *periods* where this tendency flares up. I had a sort of paranoid mental break in high school that never really got handled, so I've repressed all of that and simultaneously felt that everyone who knew me at that time is still judging me negatively, which adds to my feelings of forced immaturity. As if my potential for confident adulthood is impossible.\n\n And there are a lot of extraneous factors that I sometimes get locked in my mind where I worry about the true motives of people I thought were good to me. Sadly, the situation was extreme enough that I physically distorted my appearance and saw people directly laugh at my face over it. There was no doubt to my situation, although my girlfriend of the time kept denying anything was wrong. I wasn't crazy. I wasn't wrong. But the fact that she lied to me over it led me to feel crazy in a way that multiplied the problem. I know all these signs would lead into the assumption that I was lying here, but I simultaneously disagree with that, while also essentially self-referencing and doing some meta shit that's mentioned in another point.\n\n&gt;a combative and tenacious sense of personal rights out of keeping with the actual situation;\n\nI could work to apply this to myself, like a few situations where I felt frozen over, say, some Walmart worker saying I couldn't buy alcohol because my *friend* was underaged. I was about to stand there and just stare at the woman indefinitely, considering I should be able to buy alcohol and directly hand it to my friend, because that would be my choice to break the law. Does this even apply?\n\n&gt;recurrent suspicions, without justification, regarding sexual fidelity of spouse or sexual partner;\n\nConsidering my past jealousy in life. Yes, and yes. (Also, I just got the very brief spontaneous suspicion that you could be someone I know who was spying on me and lying about their age. Definite paranoia. I keep my information all open and shit because I theoretically don't care if people spy on me, but it adds some odd anxiety when certain discussions arise. I normally wouldn't analyze a thought like this one, but it happened to seem relevant for once.)\n\n&gt;tendency to experience excessive self-importance, manifest in a persistent self-referential attitude;\n\n***Yes.*** This is why I feel like such a pretentious asshole all the time. I always feel like self-referencing puts me \"above\" myself, but I keep learning that the self-references don't actually lead people to forgive me or trust me for my \"honesty.\" I ultimately just get myself twisted around in my own mind.\n\nIn fact, finally putting it bluntly for myself, I tend to manipulate people with my words in a way that I hope they get angry or judgmental *specifically* so I can defend myself and \"change their mind\" to understand me. Normally, that just leaves me feeling horrible and improperly judged.\n\n&gt;preoccupation with unsubstantiated \"conspiratorial\" explanations of events both immediate to the patient and in the world at large.\n\nWell, I do believe 9/11 was probably an inside job, however, I accept that the moon landing was real, the Earth is round, and the Holocaust happened.

I feel like I&amp;#39;m immune to a lot of things after trying to remove a lot of my emotional reaction, but I&amp;#39;m still often left feeling destroyed by plenty of small things. Even things that aren&amp;#39;t directly negative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;tendency to bear grudges persistently, i.e. refusal to forgive insults and injuries or slights;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I never &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hold grudges, but in action, I&amp;#39;ll be the horrible type of person like my mom has trained me to be by bringing stupid things up at horrible times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;suspiciousness and a pervasive tendency to distort experience by misconstruing the neutral or friendly actions of others as hostile or \ncontemptuous;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I often have &lt;em&gt;periods&lt;/em&gt; where this tendency flares up. I had a sort of paranoid mental break in high school that never really got handled, so I&amp;#39;ve repressed all of that and simultaneously felt that everyone who knew me at that time is still judging me negatively, which adds to my feelings of forced immaturity. As if my potential for confident adulthood is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there are a lot of extraneous factors that I sometimes get locked in my mind where I worry about the true motives of people I thought were good to me. Sadly, the situation was extreme enough that I physically distorted my appearance and saw people directly laugh at my face over it. There was no doubt to my situation, although my girlfriend of the time kept denying anything was wrong. I wasn&amp;#39;t crazy. I wasn&amp;#39;t wrong. But the fact that she lied to me over it led me to feel crazy in a way that multiplied the problem. I know all these signs would lead into the assumption that I was lying here, but I simultaneously disagree with that, while also essentially self-referencing and doing some meta shit that&amp;#39;s mentioned in another point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;a combative and tenacious sense of personal rights out of keeping with the actual situation;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could work to apply this to myself, like a few situations where I felt frozen over, say, some Walmart worker saying I couldn&amp;#39;t buy alcohol because my &lt;em&gt;friend&lt;/em&gt; was underaged. I was about to stand there and just stare at the woman indefinitely, considering I should be able to buy alcohol and directly hand it to my friend, because that would be my choice to break the law. Does this even apply?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;recurrent suspicions, without justification, regarding sexual fidelity of spouse or sexual partner;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering my past jealousy in life. Yes, and yes. (Also, I just got the very brief spontaneous suspicion that you could be someone I know who was spying on me and lying about their age. Definite paranoia. I keep my information all open and shit because I theoretically don&amp;#39;t care if people spy on me, but it adds some odd anxiety when certain discussions arise. I normally wouldn&amp;#39;t analyze a thought like this one, but it happened to seem relevant for once.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;tendency to experience excessive self-importance, manifest in a persistent self-referential attitude;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This is why I feel like such a pretentious asshole all the time. I always feel like self-referencing puts me &amp;quot;above&amp;quot; myself, but I keep learning that the self-references don&amp;#39;t actually lead people to forgive me or trust me for my &amp;quot;honesty.&amp;quot; I ultimately just get myself twisted around in my own mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, finally putting it bluntly for myself, I tend to manipulate people with my words in a way that I hope they get angry or judgmental &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; so I can defend myself and &amp;quot;change their mind&amp;quot; to understand me.
