Every night until I went back to school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I talked to my dad about it later on. Apparently, she still did it. When I came home for Christmas, she came out to see me. Sniffed and rubbed on me a few times then disappeared so the kids wouldn&amp;#39;t fuck with her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She ran away a couple months after that. Even though I&amp;#39;m over four hours away, I still look around my doors to see if I&amp;#39;ll see her calico head looking for me. Dad said he thought he saw her once. I know deep down she&amp;#39;s probably dead because people speed through that area and people don&amp;#39;t give a fuck about cats. I&amp;#39;ll miss you Princess Bob.
