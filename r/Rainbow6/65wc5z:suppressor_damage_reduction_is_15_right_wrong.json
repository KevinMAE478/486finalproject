Actually honestly surprised that the majority of weapons I use suppressed deviate towards less damage than advertised, than more.\nIngame stats should absolutely be accurate though, whatever balancing the game has. If the numbers are presented, they should be accurate numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, it&amp;#39;s probably just because it&amp;#39;s flat text where they&amp;#39;ve indicated the reduction on suppressed fire, and maybe the game did that originally, but they&amp;#39;ve since gone in and tweaked it on a per-weapon basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wow, just saw the P229.
