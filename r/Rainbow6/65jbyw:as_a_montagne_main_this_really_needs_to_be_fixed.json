It explains it quite clearly.\n\nIf there was no lag compensation, it would fall back to server hit reg check, meaning you have to lead your shot based on your ping, and miss. That's what no lag compensation is, the reason for this is that there cannot be more than one game state, therefore the server's game state is the right one, and you play from the latency, which is what I described.\n\nNow, what you described, as I've said, is text book definition of lag compensation, although you don't take into account the server send-rate (16.7ms in between sends), but it's not too bad. Furthermore, take into consideration in that in video games, **latency is used**, which is one-way, even though games love to call it ping, it's still latency, but let's be clear, this lag compensation that we're talking about. This isn't base-line to client-server interaction.\n\nFinally, about this:\n\n&gt;Now let's assume that instead, we are talking about peeking a doorway. the same applies there. Whoever peeks first, has the advantage, regardless of who has the shitty ping.\n\nNope, the laggiest of player gets the advantage and here's why: Assume 2 players at a stand-still at a door way. So guy 1: 300ms latency, guy 2: 50ms latency. Guy 1 peaks, it will takes 300ms before the server receives the info, and then guy 2 will get that info 50-66.7ms later.\n\nNow, Guy 1 has 300 whole ms to spot you and shoot you, before you can even know the other person is there, now this actually goes both ways. If the 50ms person peaks, it will take the other person that much time to receive the information **but** the person with the highest ping has a buffer, so to speak. \n\nIf Guy 1 peeks, as I've said, after 210ms (which is fairly average for FPS), spots you and shoots you in the head, no matter what you do, **Before you even receive the packet to your computer**, you will be dead. What's even more aggravating is that the server doesn't have a good check for shot orders. That is, if you shot and hit an enemy on your screen, once that packet has been sent, it is more often than not considered a valid hit (there are a few exceptions).\n\nEven if you shoot him in 150ms, the server won't care, because of lag compensation, that's how you end up with mutual kill situations, where you both kill each other. Because you're dealing with time, we're speaking relativity, therefore the point of view is important.\n\nSo let's make a new scenario. Guy 1: 300ms ping, Guy 2: 100ms ping, Guy 1 peaks and fires a shot 250ms after spotting Guy 2. Guy 2, who is a much better player, shoots at Guy 1 in 100ms. We'll assume no send rate delay for simplicity's sake.\n\n-500ms Guy 1 gets into position\n\n0ms Guy 1 peaks\n\n250ms Guy 1 shoots the head of Guy 2.\n\n300ms Server receives the peak\n\n400ms Guy 2 receives the information that Guy 1 is peaking\n\n500ms Guy 2 shoots Guy 1 in the head.\n\n550ms Server receives the shot from Guy 1 &gt; Guy 2\n\n600ms Server receives the shot from Guy 2 &gt; Guy 1\n\nNow, with this scenario, I ask you, who should be dead, who should be alive? The server received the shot from Guy 1 first, even though because Guy 2 was clearly faster, but that was only possible because Guy 1 had a fat amount of lag compensation. \n\nWhat this also doesn't take into account, with lag compensation, are the few ms of grace players have. If you have 50ms ping, you die 50ms after the server receives the hit. If you have 400ms ping, you die 400ms after the server receives the hit. The gist is, for 2 players of equivalent skill level, the one with the most latency wins.", "edited": 1492305462.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because what you&amp;#39;re describing is &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; what lag compensation is, did you watch the videos I linked?

That&amp;#39;s what no lag compensation is, the reason for this is that there cannot be more than one game state, therefore the server&amp;#39;s game state is the right one, and you play from the latency, which is what I described.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, what you described, as I&amp;#39;ve said, is text book definition of lag compensation, although you don&amp;#39;t take into account the server send-rate (16.7ms in between sends), but it&amp;#39;s not too bad. Furthermore, take into consideration in that in video games, &lt;strong&gt;latency is used&lt;/strong&gt;, which is one-way, even though games love to call it ping, it&amp;#39;s still latency, but let&amp;#39;s be clear, this lag compensation that we&amp;#39;re talking about. This isn&amp;#39;t base-line to client-server interaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, about this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s assume that instead, we are talking about peeking a doorway. the same applies there. Whoever peeks first, has the advantage, regardless of who has the shitty ping.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope, the laggiest of player gets the advantage and here&amp;#39;s why: Assume 2 players at a stand-still at a door way. So guy 1: 300ms latency, guy 2: 50ms latency. Guy 1 peaks, it will takes 300ms before the server receives the info, and then guy 2 will get that info 50-66.7ms later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, Guy 1 has 300 whole ms to spot you and shoot you, before you can even know the other person is there, now this actually goes both ways. If the 50ms person peaks, it will take the other person that much time to receive the information &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; the person with the highest ping has a buffer, so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Guy 1 peeks, as I&amp;#39;ve said, after 210ms (which is fairly average for FPS), spots you and shoots you in the head, no matter what you do, &lt;strong&gt;Before you even receive the packet to your computer&lt;/strong&gt;, you will be dead. What&amp;#39;s even more aggravating is that the server doesn&amp;#39;t have a good check for shot orders. That is, if you shot and hit an enemy on your screen, once that packet has been sent, it is more often than not considered a valid hit (there are a few exceptions).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you shoot him in 150ms, the server won&amp;#39;t care, because of lag compensation, that&amp;#39;s how you end up with mutual kill situations, where you both kill each other. Because you&amp;#39;re dealing with time, we&amp;#39;re speaking relativity, therefore the point of view is important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s make a new scenario. Guy 1: 300ms ping, Guy 2: 100ms ping, Guy 1 peaks and fires a shot 250ms after spotting Guy 2. Guy 2, who is a much better player, shoots at Guy 1 in 100ms. We&amp;#39;ll assume no send rate delay for simplicity&amp;#39;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-500ms Guy 1 gets into position&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;0ms Guy 1 peaks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;250ms Guy 1 shoots the head of Guy 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;300ms Server receives the peak&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;400ms Guy 2 receives the information that Guy 1 is peaking&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;500ms Guy 2 shoots Guy 1 in the head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;550ms Server receives the shot from Guy 1 &amp;gt; Guy 2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;600ms Server receives the shot from Guy 2 &amp;gt; Guy 1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, with this scenario, I ask you, who should be dead, who should be alive? The server received the shot from Guy 1 first, even though because Guy 2 was clearly faster, but that was only possible because Guy 1 had a fat amount of lag compensation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What this also doesn&amp;#39;t take into account, with lag compensation, are the few ms of grace players have. If you have 50ms ping, you die 50ms after the server receives the hit. If you have 400ms ping, you die 400ms after the server receives the hit. The gist is, for 2 players of equivalent skill level, the one with the most latency wins.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Rainbow6", "name": "t1_dgbglzm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492333743.0, "created_utc": 1492304943.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbeitx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "smuttenDK", "parent_id": "t1_dgbd2kh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Rainbow6", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Okay, in that case, we have a different understanding of what lag compensation is.

Back then, they were decently common. Come Dust Line, they're less common once people get over Montagne's further extended shield. I'm not quite sure what happened.\n\nThen at some point come the general complaints about shields. Only once have I ever been shot through my shield as Montagne and even then there may be an explanation but I can't tell for sure as the Rook that shot me shot me through a chair; it's happened only a handful of times as any other shield. And of course, this eventually led to shields getting explosive resistance.\n\nI'm still torn about this. It was far from hard to learn to bait Nitros but even people that play regularly with me could never pick that up. My look at it was generally, 'If Nitros are a problem for you, learn to play around them, learn to better yourself.' That's my look on quite a lot of recent complaints regarding the game; frankly, get better.\n\nAt one point, I learned that shields function the same no matter where they are, if they're on your back, or if they're to your right because you've been meleed. I learned from that that you can look right when you've been meleed to block the next one or bullets and [posted a thread on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/4npi6g); I actually see other shield players do this every now and then!\n\nWhat I've observed over the months regarding shields is that they're very difficult to use. As the game progressed and people learned more and more how to play it, shields became more and more uncommon because people learned how to better counter them. Shields are far easier to counter than they are to play. You can use Kapkan/Frost traps to force them to go a different way or expose themselves to take it out, barbed wire to fuck *anyone* up, deployable shields force them to go another way and force Montagne to lower his shield, Echo is a direct counter to them all. At any time, a shield can be shot and damaged except for Montagne from the front when extended, and they are *always* at a disadvantage when outnumbered or outdistanced. \n\nI really like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAw850Li1c) because it shows a few things: it shows me baiting *two* Nitros, protecting someone as I play shield, distracting defenders, and a defender panicking because I didn't die to their Nitro.\n\nThe explosive resistance buff was... interesting. While I feel it was good for console players, for PC players, it's not really done anything. But this is generally what happens with all changes for shields: possibly good for console players but nothing really changes otherwise. It's lowered the skill needed to play shields, but it doesn't help people play shields. Shields in general or a particular operator gets a change and people are suddenly play them every round; in the case of shields, they still make the same mistakes over and over and over. \n\nThe fact is, shields are hard to play and not too hard to counter. This isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nEDIT: Of course, bad lag comp/netcode related issues are also a huge issue right now.\n\nBut then there's an interesting issue here: when a shield is good at something or players can use the shield to get kills, it's suddenly OP. If you play a shield and have a good round, chances are good that people on the enemy team will bitch about it. This happens with every shield I've ever played, but the trending topics right now are that Blitz needs a buff and that Montagne is OP. Blitz is strange; no one explains what could be made better about him; for Montagne, it's that he can extended his shield, walk up to someone, and hipfire them to death. The problem is, any shield can get close to anyone if they let them and fuck them up; this is not unique to Montagne nor does his shield extension play any real part in this. Every time I see/read this, it's a result of a good shield play well, a bad defending team freaking out at the sight of a shield and playing poorly, or a mixture of all three of those. It's also always funny how defenders still chuck Nitros at him or other shields and don't know what to do when they don't die. (To add, I've been playing Blitz quite a bit as of recent and have had no problems with him. &gt;_&gt;)\n\nMontagne hasn't really changed very much since Dust Line for me. His revolver originally did 60 damage, IIRC, and now it does 77; that was always enough to fuck someone up and a 17 point buff is not that significant for a weapon you use at close range. The explosive resistance buff just allowed me to play him a bit more boldly, not something that I ever needed. But going back the revolver, ever since launch, Montagne has gotten nothing but bug fixes and *buffs*. That's because Ubi listens to the forum and subreddit's feedback and decide where to go from there.\n\nI can't remember when it was, but Ubi changed the way some damage was registered: shooting someone in the neck counted as a headshot and arm limb damage was changed to be the same as torso damage. This made shooting a shield in their pistol hand devastating. It's straight up aggravating, but chances are good if you get killed that way, you would've been killed anyhow.\n\nSo I suppose in the end, **I** think shields are in a decent place. Not a great place, nor a bad one, but an okay place. Good players that know how to use them can do well while the people that are unwilling to learn to play them but very few are not. Most changes made to shields are not all that significant in the past and I'm unsure any future changes will matter either. However, what the community seems to think is usually quite different to what I think, then and now still, so I'm not sure where my experience really matters.

My look at it was generally, &amp;#39;If Nitros are a problem for you, learn to play around them, learn to better yourself.&amp;#39; That&amp;#39;s my look on quite a lot of recent complaints regarding the game; frankly, get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point, I learned that shields function the same no matter where they are, if they&amp;#39;re on your back, or if they&amp;#39;re to your right because you&amp;#39;ve been meleed. I learned from that that you can look right when you&amp;#39;ve been meleed to block the next one or bullets and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/4npi6g\"&gt;posted a thread on it&lt;/a&gt;; I actually see other shield players do this every now and then!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;ve observed over the months regarding shields is that they&amp;#39;re very difficult to use. As the game progressed and people learned more and more how to play it, shields became more and more uncommon because people learned how to better counter them. Shields are far easier to counter than they are to play. You can use Kapkan/Frost traps to force them to go a different way or expose themselves to take it out, barbed wire to fuck &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; up, deployable shields force them to go another way and force Montagne to lower his shield, Echo is a direct counter to them all. At any time, a shield can be shot and damaged except for Montagne from the front when extended, and they are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; at a disadvantage when outnumbered or outdistanced. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really like &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAw850Li1c\"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; because it shows a few things: it shows me baiting &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; Nitros, protecting someone as I play shield, distracting defenders, and a defender panicking because I didn&amp;#39;t die to their Nitro.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The explosive resistance buff was... interesting. While I feel it was good for console players, for PC players, it&amp;#39;s not really done anything. But this is generally what happens with all changes for shields: possibly good for console players but nothing really changes otherwise. It&amp;#39;s lowered the skill needed to play shields, but it doesn&amp;#39;t help people play shields. Shields in general or a particular operator gets a change and people are suddenly play them every round; in the case of shields, they still make the same mistakes over and over and over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact is, shields are hard to play and not too hard to counter. This isn&amp;#39;t necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Of course, bad lag comp/netcode related issues are also a huge issue right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then there&amp;#39;s an interesting issue here: when a shield is good at something or players can use the shield to get kills, it&amp;#39;s suddenly OP. If you play a shield and have a good round, chances are good that people on the enemy team will bitch about it. This happens with every shield I&amp;#39;ve ever played, but the trending topics right now are that Blitz needs a buff and that Montagne is OP. Blitz is strange; no one explains what could be made better about him; for Montagne, it&amp;#39;s that he can extended his shield, walk up to someone, and hipfire them to death. The problem is, any shield can get close to anyone if they let them and fuck them up; this is not unique to Montagne nor does his shield extension play any real part in this. Every time I see/read this, it&amp;#39;s a result of a good shield play well, a bad defending team freaking out at the sight of a shield and playing poorly, or a mixture of all three of those. It&amp;#39;s also always funny how defenders still chuck Nitros at him or other shields and don&amp;#39;t know what to do when they don&amp;#39;t die. (To add, I&amp;#39;ve been playing Blitz quite a bit as of recent and have had no problems with him. &amp;gt;_&amp;gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Montagne hasn&amp;#39;t really changed very much since Dust Line for me. His revolver originally did 60 damage, IIRC, and now it does 77; that was always enough to fuck someone up and a 17 point buff is not that significant for a weapon you use at close range. The explosive resistance buff just allowed me to play him a bit more boldly, not something that I ever needed. But going back the revolver, ever since launch, Montagne has gotten nothing but bug fixes and &lt;em&gt;buffs&lt;/em&gt;. That&amp;#39;s because Ubi listens to the forum and subreddit&amp;#39;s feedback and decide where to go from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t remember when it was, but Ubi changed the way some damage was registered: shooting someone in the neck counted as a headshot and arm limb damage was changed to be the same as torso damage. This made shooting a shield in their pistol hand devastating. It&amp;#39;s straight up aggravating, but chances are good if you get killed that way, you would&amp;#39;ve been killed anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I suppose in the end, &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; think shields are in a decent place. Not a great place, nor a bad one, but an okay place. Good players that know how to use them can do well while the people that are unwilling to learn to play them but very few are not. Most changes made to shields are not all that significant in the past and I&amp;#39;m unsure any future changes will matter either. However, what the community seems to think is usually quite different to what I think, then and now still, so I&amp;#39;m not sure where my experience really matters. Very few people have ~200 hours as shields in the game and very few are willing to keep trying something new when they don&amp;#39;t do well immediately with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Rainbow6", "name": "t1_dgbwl62", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492366718.0, "created_utc": 1492337918.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbu494", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MeshesAreConfusing", "parent_id": "t1_dgbmtwj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Rainbow6", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I know you've got some Monty experience.

The same people that pick frost/kapkan and sit in a corner and wait. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Rainbow6", "name": "t1_dgbov6k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492346362.0, "created_utc": 1492317562.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t1bl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jbyw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbp5c1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WardellMVP", "parent_id": "t3_65jbyw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Rainbow6", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is nothing for montane... check my most recent post smh", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is nothing for montane... check my most recent post smh&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Rainbow6", "name": "t1_dgbp5c1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492346873.0, "created_utc": 1492318073.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t1bl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jbyw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbp68a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "taylormilesbowman", "parent_id": "t3_65jbyw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Rainbow6", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As a Montagne main, nobody likes you ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Montagne main, nobody likes you &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Rainbow6", "name": "t1_dgbp68a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492346919.0, "created_utc": 1492318119.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t1bl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jbyw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbpw95", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Burb1409", "parent_id": "t3_65jbyw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Rainbow6", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Outplayed", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outplayed&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Rainbow6", "name": "t1_dgbpw95", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492348242.0, "created_utc": 1492319442.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t1bl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jbyw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbqh2a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Uncle_Pixy", "parent_id": "t3_65jbyw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Rainbow6", "controversiality": 0, "body": "i think they can't", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i think they can&amp;#39;t&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Rainbow6", "name": "t1_dgbqh2a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492349325.0, "created_utc": 1492320525.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t1bl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jbyw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbrt78", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nixaw", "parent_id": "t3_65jbyw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Rainbow6", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thats what you get for playing with a shield.
