But those 2 problems are complementary, you cant exclude player with 100+ping from game server if average ping is around 80.\n\nThe netcode as it is, is fine, if it was running on proper average latency (20-30ms in close countries, 50-60 at max from more distant countries) and do not match anyone over 100+ping and kick players whose average ping is higher than 100 after few minutes.\nThe netcode alone can be done by 2ways, first is shooter's advantage (r6, overwatch), second is target's advantage (csgo).\n\nNow lets look at this: In first example you see simulation of game from the game server, that is accurate BUT delayed by your latency. If you see somthing and shoot it. You will hit it. That's perfect solution from shooter's perspective (thats why it is called shooter's advantage). From target perspective there is a bit problem, because your movement and position is delayed by YOUR and your enemy ping, that means you can already be in cover (as gif above) but on enemy screen its not yet the case, so he can shoot and kill you. This rlly becomes problematic if pings get over average of 80-100. With lower ping, as target you are still in disadvantage but in 99 out of 100 cases its insignificant.\n\nOn the other hand when you look at CSGO: in csgo there is no \"delayed\" movement by ping, but you see where the enemy is actually moving, but as latency still exists your client has to predict what your target will be doing in those your ping+his ping miliseconds. And that creates NONACCURATE position of enemy in your game client (in many cases you can see target in position where he never was, because he unpredictably changed movement). What that means you shoot at where you see the target hoping to kill him. BUT on server which handles the hits, your target was never there so even though you have hit target on your screen, it was never hit from server perspective so it didnt count.\n\nI have played hundreds and thousands hours of csgo, overwatch, r6 and many other shooters, and from my point of view the shooters advantage is much better. Yes it is annoying to sometimes die when you should have not because you were already in cover, but trust me, its MUCH MUCH MUCH more frustrating when you hit those sick flick AWP shots that are actually miss on the server.\nI am not saying there is no problem in siege, it definitely is. But its not netcode that should be changed. Siege need better server infrastructure and AFTER that strict latency limitation.\n\nTLDR: netcode is fine, shit servers (and/or infrastructure) are the problem.\n", "edited": 1492097526.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problem with siege are shit servers (80average ping in central europe is terrible) and the fact that players over 100 ping are matched to games and allowed to stay. But those 2 problems are complementary, you cant exclude player with 100+ping from game server if average ping is around 80.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The netcode as it is, is fine, if it was running on proper average latency (20-30ms in close countries, 50-60 at max from more distant countries) and do not match anyone over 100+ping and kick players whose average ping is higher than 100 after few minutes.\nThe netcode alone can be done by 2ways, first is shooter&amp;#39;s advantage (r6, overwatch), second is target&amp;#39;s advantage (csgo).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now lets look at this: In first example you see simulation of game from the game server, that is accurate BUT delayed by your latency. If you see somthing and shoot it. You will hit it. That&amp;#39;s perfect solution from shooter&amp;#39;s perspective (thats why it is called shooter&amp;#39;s advantage). From target perspective there is a bit problem, because your movement and position is delayed by YOUR and your enemy ping, that means you can already be in cover (as gif above) but on enemy screen its not yet the case, so he can shoot and kill you. This rlly becomes problematic if pings get over average of 80-100. With lower ping, as target you are still in disadvantage but in 99 out of 100 cases its insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand when you look at CSGO: in csgo there is no &amp;quot;delayed&amp;quot; movement by ping, but you see where the enemy is actually moving, but as latency still exists your client has to predict what your target will be doing in those your ping+his ping miliseconds. And that creates NONACCURATE position of enemy in your game client (in many cases you can see target in position where he never was, because he unpredictably changed movement). What that means you shoot at where you see the target hoping to kill him. BUT on server which handles the hits, your target was never there so even though you have hit target on your screen, it was never hit from server perspective so it didnt count.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have played hundreds and thousands hours of csgo, overwatch, r6 and many other shooters, and from my point of view the shooters advantage is much better. Yes it is annoying to sometimes die when you should have not because you were already in cover, but trust me, its MUCH MUCH MUCH more frustrating when you hit those sick flick AWP shots that are actually miss on the server.\nI am not saying there is no problem in siege, it definitely is. But its not netcode that should be changed. Siege need better server infrastructure and AFTER that strict latency limitation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: netcode is fine, shit servers (and/or infrastructure) are the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Rainbow6", "name": "t1_dg7pdmi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126072.0, "created_utc": 1492097272.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t1bl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654f9n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ny6b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "notahappyrobot", "parent_id": "t3_654f9n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Rainbow6", "controversiality": 0, "body": "i witnessed 3000+ ping yesterday, for a good solid 2-3mins; funnily enough the guy had no deaths...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i witnessed 3000+ ping yesterday, for a good solid 2-3mins; funnily enough the guy had no deaths...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Rainbow6", "name": "t1_dg7ny6b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492124511.0, "created_utc": 1492095711.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t1bl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654f9n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t1bl", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_654f9n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7jgx8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LithiumPhase", "parent_id": "t1_dg7gco0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Rainbow6", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ping abusing, for sure it does.

Ranked is supposed to be semi-competitive and high ping completely makes it uncompetitive defeating the entire point of ranked. TBH while it would suck for some people it would be better for far more people. Either that or they need an option that people can set to not play with people over 150 ping.
