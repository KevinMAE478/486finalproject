I played two matches a few days ago with the same team, against the same team, and was MVP for the first one and LVP for the second (based on points). First round I was entering rooms and shooting people while others covered flanks and droned etc. The second round I was the flank coverer or droner, allowing the breachers to safely be more aggressive towards the objective room (they even killed a few people I&amp;#39;d downed from longer range). The game can&amp;#39;t really award points for verbal call-outs and positioning, but I was equally happy how I contributed to the team in both rounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I kill all the enemies myself that&amp;#39;s just as good as someone else on my team doing it, or everyone getting one kill each, the result is the same, we win the round.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I see an enemy, alive, injured, whatever, I&amp;#39;m almost always going to shoot them and would expect teammates to do the same, because that&amp;#39;s basically the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Rainbow6", "name": "t1_dga3wul", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492249758.0, "created_utc": 1492220958.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9za9v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DaBestGnome", "parent_id": "t1_dg9vh92", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Rainbow6", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Or the people who blatantly steal your kills or hard work to pad their stats?
