Whereas at the same time, the British had ships like the *HMS Victory* the US had a very different naming convention laid out.\n\nIt then states, that at the turn of the century:\n\n&gt;Shortly before the turn of this century the legislation was changed to reflect the remarkable changes taking place in the Navy itself as wooden hulls, sails, and muzzleloading ordnance gave way to steel ships with breechloading rifles.

Truman by Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, who would himself later be honored in the naming of our first \"supercarrier,\" Forrestal (CVA 59). Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first aircraft carrier to be named for an American statesman; Franklin and Hancock, wartime Essex-class fleet carriers, honored the former Navy ships of those names and not, as many think, the statesmen themselves.
