Sure, Venice had seized the cities of the Romagna in the previous decade, but there had been an understanding between Julius' administration in Rome and the Republic that it was done as a mutually beneficial effort to remove Cesare Borgia from his fiefs. \n\nIn fact, the Venetian Senate, at the solicitation of the Papal Ambassador Giangiorgio Trissino, had been in conversation with the Papal Court looking toward the maintenance of nominal Papal possession of the Romagna (including tax collection) while allowing Venice to maintain a military and administrative presence to secure the area south of the River Po. Julius found this arrangement unsatisfactory, and came to an agreement with Emperor Maximilian, who would descend from Tyrol onto Verona (the \"Door that keeps the barbarians locked out\" according to the contemporary Venetian commentator Andrea Minucci). After Maximillian's inevitable victory against the Venetians, as part of the peace treaty the Romagna would return to the Papacy. \n\nA wrench got thrown into the whole arrangement when the Venetian army under General Bartolomeo d'Alviano routed the Imperial army after a few weeks of campaigning. Detachments occupied Austrian cities in the Friuli, and Maximillian, already morbidly obsessed with his own mortality anyway, was more than happy to settle for a truce. \n\nJulian, baffled, evidently thought Venice's victory was a fluke. In March of 1508 the Venetian Senate moved to appoint a new Bishop of Verona from the shortlist presented by that city's council, as the previous one had dropped dead at the premature age of thirty-six. \"Aha!\" cried Pope Julian, and used this pretext to convey a meeting in the French town of Cambrai attended by Ferdinand of Aragon (and Naples, as well as Regent of Castille), Alfonso of Este (ruler of Ferrara), Charles of Savoy, Francesco Gonzaga (the ruler of Mantua), Ladislav of Hungary, Louis XII of France, and old Max of Austria. \n\nThe following deal was struck: Emperor Max would get the whole of the Veneto and the Friuli; Louis of France, recently confirmed Duke of Lombardy after Ludovico Sforza's removal, would get Venice's Lombard cities of Bergamo and Brescia, nevermind the fact that the Venetians were half the reason he held Milan in the first place; Ferdinand would get a number of free-ports in Puglia guaranteed by Venice, and consequentially be allowed to kick out the Venetian consuls; Ladislav would get Dalmatia; Alfonso would get the Po Delta, which Venice had seized some thirty years prior because it was a haven for piracy; Chucky of Savoy would get the Island of Cyprus, which he technically was the heir to; and Franky Gonzaga would basically get the Minico River floodplain between Verona and Brescia, fundamentally designating him the official Franco-Austrian babysitter (not sure it that move was incredibly clever or just lazy on Julius' part). And of course, Pope Julius would get his beloved cities in the Romagna. \n\nSo in the spring of 1509 Pope Julius excommunicated the Republic, and a French army marched out of Milan. Venice was up against France, Spain, Austria, Hungary, Mantua, Ferrara, and the Papacy. This did not look good. \n\nThe Republic's government banned the dissemination of the excommunication, while a second army under Niccol\u00f2 Orsini was raised to support d'Alviano. Pleas for help were dispatched to the lesser German rulers, as well as to the newly crowned Henry VIII of England. Even the Grand Prince of Muscovy Vasil III was contacted. None came to the Republic's aid. \n\nThe Republic would have to fend for itself. The two Venetian captain-generals, d'Alviano and Orsini, immediately distinguished themselves by being completely at odds in every conceivable way. D'Aviano marched to meet the French head-on as they were en route to Bergamo, however Orsini elected to avoid pitched battle. The result was that the Venetian armies were defeated in detail; d'Alvaino was even captured by the French. The Venetian senate, in a panic, voted to \"jettison the cargo to save the ship,\" and dissolved the Venetian cities of all ties of fealty. The Lombard cities submitted to the King of France, while Orsini, in full retreat until he could regroup the Venetian forces in Treviso, did nothing to stop the cities of Verona, Vicenza, and Padua from receiving imperial emissaries. \n\nBy early summer, Orsini withdrew to a perimeter around the old watchtower at Mestre, the Republic's medieval border. It would seem that the Republic's days as a power in Italy were over. \n\nHowever, by midsummer the tide was already changing. The emissaries sent to the Emperor by council of the city of Treviso were mobbed in the street before they could leave the city; the Trevisans wanted to fight. The joint commanders and sent seven hundred footmen to march down the Terraglio Road in double time; the walls of Treviso were manned, and the citizens began gathering stockpiles for a siege. \n\nThe siege never came; Imperial garrisons in the Veneto could barely keep order in the cities they occupied, a much larger force commitment would be needed for the Emperor to take any additional actions against the Venetians. By mid-July, a second Venetian detachment was deployed to Padua; the city's rebellious citizens had kept the gates open (Norwich narrates that this was done by way of an Oxcart crash) such that a small company of Venetian Knights headed by the *Proveditore Generale* Andrea Gritti could enter the city. Noe flanked by mounted men at arms, the mob expelled the Imperial Landsknechts. Gritti, at the time little over fifty years of age, as *Provveditore* was something of a cross between a procurement officer and a political officer; he had spent the better part of the past few years overseeing the reconstructions of fortifications in the Friuli. However, he had elected to personally oversee the dangerous sally to retake Padua; a testament to the fact that some elements of the Venetian ruling class still had some fight left in them. \n\nEmperor Maximillian was pushed to action; Padua would have been an invaluable addition to the Austrian demesne, and he was set on taking it back. An Enormous imperial army set forth from the Brenner to take the city. After linking with French and Spanish regiments, by September of 1509 the city was encircled. \n\nHowever, Orsini had set up headquarters in Padua with the bulk of his forces (perhaps on Gritti's behest). The Imperial artillery breached the walls, but the ferocious defense mounted by the Venetian army supported by the citizenry meant that by the end of September, the Imperial forces began withdrawing. \n\nOrsini, unexpectedly reversing his position on the usefulness of taking the initiative, pursued the withdrawing Imperial forces. He found the Vicenza in total rebellion against the Imperial occupation and entered the city with minimum fuss; however in spite of the bulk of the Imperial forces withdrawing to the Tyrol, the detachment left in Verona kept the city subdued and supply lines into Italy open. A brief siege was mounted; Orsini even managed to beat back the Papal relief expedition, but upon spotting French reinforcements on the horizon withdrew back to Padua. The Venetian fleet, which had kept the cities of Dalmatia well-supplied in spite of Hungarian incursions, attempted to cut off the French and Austrians from their Italian allies by establishing dominance on the River Po; however the fleet proved no match for Ferrarese artillery. A small victory came when a detachment of Venetian soldiers seized the stronghold at Este, not only securing the northern bank of the lower river Adige, but also humiliating the ruling house of Ferrara: Este is their ancestral home. But overall, in the winter of 1509, the conflict was at a stalemate. \n\nAll the while, the Venetian diplomatic machine had been meticulously working behind the scenes; Pope Julius was told of the massive size of the Austrian and French armies; the Venetian ambassador in Rome whispered that the cities of Bologna and Perugia were in endemic revolt, and what if the Emperor chose to seize those too? Perhaps the Austrians would come to an agreement with the Aragonese; perhaps they were discussing Julian's downfall right now. Wouldn't it make sense for them to seize Emilia and Umbria, now that they already held half the Veneto? \n\nPope Julius, dastardly coward that he was, saw that the Venetians had a point. However, he drove a hard bargain: not only would Venice have to abandon all claims in the Romagna, the Republic would allow the Papacy to appoint bishops in its cities. The terms were humiliating, but by February of 1510 the Senate accepted.
