Under two apparently contradictory rationalities has raged an identical gangsterism, an identical oppression of the isolated man.&amp;quot; wrote Raoul Vaneigem in 1967, in his book &amp;quot;Trait\u00e9 de savoir-vivre \u00e0 l&amp;#39;usage des jeunes g\u00e9n\u00e9rations&amp;quot; (published in English as The Revolution of Everyday Life).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So on the radical left, there was already an anti-authoritarian tradition which could be called on to critique Soviet abuses of power. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another fashionable trend associated with the French intellectual classes at the same period, of course, was post-structuralism and post-modernism. Post-modernism itself has been defined as &amp;quot;incredulity towards meta-narratives&amp;quot; (meta-narratives like international socialism) and tends to mitigate against political action in favour of theory and a field called &amp;quot;criticism&amp;quot;. Someone like Julia Kristeva (described as a &amp;quot;flaming Maoist&amp;quot; by Noam Chomsky when he first met her) by the early seventies had transformed into a full-fledged post-structuralist. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, to sum up, the statement is probably accurate but it has to be noted that there were other factors at work at that time which had also caused the French intellectual classes to be disillusioned with Soviet-style communism.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg6kvi2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492060684.0, "created_utc": 1492031884.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 391}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yd0b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6gx5e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 38, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t3_64yd0b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": 1492028182.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg6gx5e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492056454.0, "created_utc": 1492027654.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 38}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yd0b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6b4bq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t3_64yd0b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg6b4bq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492050492.0, "created_utc": 1492021692.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yd0b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yd0b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yd0b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6enl7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 21, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jschooltiger", "parent_id": "t1_dg6e65h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This comment has been removed because it is [soapboxing](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22soapboxing.22_or_loaded_questions.), [promoting a political agenda, or moralizing](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_political_agendas_or_moralising).
