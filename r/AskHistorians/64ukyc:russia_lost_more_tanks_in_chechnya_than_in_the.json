We estimated 4000 Russian battle-deaths and 6000 Chechen battle-deaths in the First Chechen War, which is consistent with data from the &lt;a href=\"http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/COW-war\"&gt;Correlates of War Project&lt;/a&gt;.  The source cited for the estimate is Clodfelter&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Reference to Casualty and Other Figures, 1500-2000,&lt;/em&gt; published in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that the term &amp;quot;battle-death&amp;quot; refers only to combatants who died (from all causes in the theater of operations), not to civilians.  We estimate that 60,000 Chechen civilians died, in addition to the 6000 combatants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg5l1r5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492008834.0, "created_utc": 1491980034.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ukyc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ukyc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ukyc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5751s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg56d20", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg5751s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491986277.0, "created_utc": 1491957477.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg56d20", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg54m3z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg56d20", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491985235.0, "created_utc": 1491956435.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg54m3z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t3_64ukyc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg54m3z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491982894.0, "created_utc": 1491954094.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
