It also includes poison and other gas, both famously used by Nazi Germany to kill millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The utilization of gas as a means of mass killing has in fact become so strongly related to the Nazis and their policies that it as well as the used gas chambers have become by now almost synonymous with the Holocaust and other Nazi mass crimes, even despite the fact that a lot of other means of killing, foremost among them mass-shootings, were also employed by the Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Historians generally distinguish between four different kinds of mass killings via gas as employed by the Nazis depending on the technical method of killing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the earliest iteration of Nazi mass murder via gassing (1940/41), in the six T4 killing centers (Grafeneck, Brandenburg, Hartheim, Sonnenstein Pirna, Bernburg and Hadamar) the Nazis employed Carbon Monoxide from gas canisters that was funneled into gas chambers. The same methods were also employed during the mass killing of concentration camp inmates unable to work dubbed &amp;quot;Aktion 14f13&amp;quot; and by the so-called Sonderkommando Lange, a special SS and Police unit that used two gas vans with the same method to kill both Polish intellectuals as well as inmates of Polish mental and handicapped institutions around the same time. This method was also later used in the first gas chamber in the Majdank death camp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the death camps of Aktion Reinhard (Sobibor, Treblinka, Belzec) as well as in the Chelmno death camp and in the Soviet Union and Serbia, the Nazis used exhaust fumes from a variety of motors to mass-kill people. In the Reinhard Camps, a tank engine was hooked to a funnel that lead into a gas chamber while in Chelmno as well as in Serbia, the USSR and Chelmno especially constructed gas vans were used where with the flip of a switch the driver could funnel the motor exhausts in the back cabin of the van.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Auschwitz \u2013 most famously \u2013 but also in a second gas chamber in Majdanek, the Nazis used Zyklon B,  cyanide-based pesticide invented in Germany in the early 1920s. It was a poisonous gas that interfered with cellular respiration, meaning it&amp;#39;s victims would effectively suffocate while air was all around them. Zyklon B was also supplied to the considerable smaller gas chambers in Mauthausen, Ravensbr\u00fcck, and Buchenwald among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gas chambers in Sachsenhausen and Natzweiler used a different compound that was also based on Hydrogen cyanide or prussic acid as it was called that was liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In these actions combined, the Nazis killed more than 3 million people using gas. The original idea to do so was developed by  Reichsleiter Philipp Bouhler, the chief of Hitler&amp;#39;s personal Chancellery and Karl Brandt, Hitler&amp;#39;s personal physician whom Hitler charged in 1939 with designing and carrying out the T4 killing program against handicapped and mentally ill in German institutions. Bouhler and Brandt decided on the use of gas for two reasons: First, they deemed it economical and in line with the mandate that the program should be carried out in secret (it would have been hard to hide mass shootings in Germany) and secondly, they thought that if details of the program would became known to the public, they could at least claim that its victims &amp;quot;peacefully fell asleep&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In reality however, death by Carbon Monoxide poisoning is far from &amp;quot;peacefully falling asleep&amp;quot;. Rather, as witnesses to the T4 gassing have described it, death took anywhere from 3 to 15 minutes all the while the victims were shaken by painful cramps and panicked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The T4 program and its way of mass killing was what also later lead to a similar method employed in the Aktion Reinhard Camps and with the gas vans. It was in fact the about 500 employees of the T4 killing centers who when the program was stopped due to public outrage got with a delay transferred to the Reinhard Camps, camps designed to kill the Jews of Poland from spring 1942 onward. Because pure Carbon Monoxide in gas canisters was hard to obtain / deliver in occupied Poland, the instead opted to use the tank engines as their source for gas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gas vans were originally an idea of the Sonderkommando Lange and while the origin of the first two models is unclear, it is very likely that Lange build them himself. Taking this idea and with the input from the T4/Reinhard personnel, it was the Kriminaltechnische Institut (KTI or Criminal Technological Institute) in Germany that developed the more &amp;quot;refined&amp;quot; versions of the gas vans that were used for mass killing in Chelmno, Serbia and the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To understand how the use of Zyklon B came around, it is important to understand that the Auschwitz personnel under commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss was actually competing with the Reinhard Aktion for who could build the more effective and useful concentration / death camp. H\u00f6ss and his personnel were looking for more effective and economic ways to mass murder people and after several experiments, including the first gassing in Auschwitz of Soviet POWs, in 1942 they settled on Zyklon B.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zyklon B as a Hydrogen cyanide has \u2013 according to H\u00f6ss \u2013 several advantages over exhaust gasses. Unlike in the reinhard Camps were the tank engines had broken down several times due to over-use, this would not happen with Zyklon B. Also, H\u00f6ss argued that it generally killed faster. While exhaust gasses could take anywhere from 8 to 18 minutes to kill a gas chamber full of people, Zyklon B was able to cut down this time by about half thus making the time between killing actions shorter and subsequently being able to kill more people per day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While all this occurred, the use of liquid cyanide in Sachsenhausen was actually experimental in order to find an even more economical and faster way to kill thousands of people daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion, the Nazis made extensive use of gasses that fall well within the definition of chemical weapons and killed more than 3 million people using this method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;But what about the use of chemical weapons as part of conventional warfare along the lines of WWI?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/kojin\"&gt;/u/kojin&lt;/a&gt; has answered this question previously on our sub &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/42nqi1/why_didnt_germany_use_chemical_weapons_during_ww2/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

It essentially serves \u2013 as we'd put it in German \u2013 as a rhetorical smoke grenade. Hitler has become a clear metaphor and signifier for evil \u2013 and justifiably so \u2013 but there is still a lot to unpack in such a comparison. Does it mean, that someone wants to establish a dictatorship? Oppress political opponents violently? Start a war of aggression on racial and political grounds with the aim to expand territory? Commit genocide?\n\nAnyone of these or all of them are factors contained in the Hitler comparison and so the question becomes, what is it that you want to say? And, wouldn't your cause be better served, if what you wanted to express with said comparison was said directly?

It adds another rhetorical and argumentative layer that if what you want to express with the comparison actually holds water is rather unnecessary.\n\nSo, on the first level it is intellectual lazy, obfuscating, and a poor rhetorical ploy.\n\nOn the level of the question of appropriateness, it is my distinct impression that both in political as well as \"normal\" discussion culture this comparison has become so pervasive both as a serious tactic as well as a joke that by now it really has cheapened and devalued the actual history that occurred \u2013 a history that is so horrendous that I as someone who studies sometimes feels seriously troubled by the magnitude of it.\n\nI mean, take what I wrote above or what any of the experts in this are have written about in this sub. It is incredibly easy to write and read posts that discuss issues like the gassing of 3 million people in a detached manner. But the realities of it, the actual historical process of people shoving other people in a chamber, turn on a tank engine and then watch and hear them die by asphyxiating, day after day, hour after hour, nothing but screams of pain, rigid dead bodies, people clawing at each other and the walls, trying, panicked, to save their lives in a last ditch attempt that must ultimately remain futile because they are trapped in a horrible concoction people have dreamed up, the only purpose of which is to kill, and kill, and kill  \u2013 it can be baffling to realize that this is not only the written word on a page but an actual historical reality, a thing that happened to actual people; people who before this came over them had lives, dreams, loves, hope, and families; it has the potential to at times make you question humanity as a basic notion.\n\nAnd yet, the person who bears the main responsibility for this, together with the ideology he and his followers embraced and the political system they set up in service of making all of the above happen \u2013 they have become a pop-cultural punchline and a cheap political ploy. I can't count the times people on this sub have told me and us as mods, both as a joke and a serious charge, that we are Nazis or Hitler. Not because we imprisoned, starved, murdered, and broke the gold teeth out of the mouths of the rigid corpses of their loved ones we murdered, but because we removed a comment that was against the rules or warned someone or banned someone \u2013 I mean, how is that in anybody's mind in any way shape or form an appropriate comparison to make? On a historical level, an argumentative level and a moral level.\n\nAnd the same goes for the political arena. Unless someone is actively working to recreate a similar reality or following a similar line of political thought, such a comparison only serves to cheapen the actual history and move it further away from public perception.\n\nUnlike Hitler, who as a historical individual was and probably like any historical individual will remain unique in history, both Fascism and Nazism [are actually abstract historical ideologies and movements which we can study and categories along certain factors and occurences](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5rloof/what_is_fascism_what_beliefs_does_it_entail/). Therefore, it would serve one better to actually take a look at those and make them potential factors in a comparison rather then the person of Adolf Hitler, if one was hell-bend or merely interested in actually checking if such a comparison would hold any actual historical, political, and moral value.\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1491984001.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, for my part, am never particularly happy with Hitler comparisons because before it even gets to the question of appropriateness, there is the issue that 99.9% of all cases, they are immensely intellectually lazy seeing as how they rely on a signifier rather than a concrete charge and because on a historical level they reinforce a view of Nazism and the Holocaust that is solely centered around the person of Adolf Hitler; a approach that I \u2013 &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4cewq8/on_adolf_hitler_great_man_theory_and_asking/\"&gt;as I have previously stated in this sub&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 find immensely misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Hitler comparison at the first level obfuscates more than it enlightens.

But the realities of it, the actual historical process of people shoving other people in a chamber, turn on a tank engine and then watch and hear them die by asphyxiating, day after day, hour after hour, nothing but screams of pain, rigid dead bodies, people clawing at each other and the walls, trying, panicked, to save their lives in a last ditch attempt that must ultimately remain futile because they are trapped in a horrible concoction people have dreamed up, the only purpose of which is to kill, and kill, and kill  \u2013 it can be baffling to realize that this is not only the written word on a page but an actual historical reality, a thing that happened to actual people; people who before this came over them had lives, dreams, loves, hope, and families; it has the potential to at times make you question humanity as a basic notion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, the person who bears the main responsibility for this, together with the ideology he and his followers embraced and the political system they set up in service of making all of the above happen \u2013 they have become a pop-cultural punchline and a cheap political ploy. I can&amp;#39;t count the times people on this sub have told me and us as mods, both as a joke and a serious charge, that we are Nazis or Hitler. Not because we imprisoned, starved, murdered, and broke the gold teeth out of the mouths of the rigid corpses of their loved ones we murdered, but because we removed a comment that was against the rules or warned someone or banned someone \u2013 I mean, how is that in anybody&amp;#39;s mind in any way shape or form an appropriate comparison to make? On a historical level, an argumentative level and a moral level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the same goes for the political arena. Unless someone is actively working to recreate a similar reality or following a similar line of political thought, such a comparison only serves to cheapen the actual history and move it further away from public perception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike Hitler, who as a historical individual was and probably like any historical individual will remain unique in history, both Fascism and Nazism &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5rloof/what_is_fascism_what_beliefs_does_it_entail/\"&gt;are actually abstract historical ideologies and movements which we can study and categories along certain factors and occurences&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, it would serve one better to actually take a look at those and make them potential factors in a comparison rather then the person of Adolf Hitler, if one was hell-bend or merely interested in actually checking if such a comparison would hold any actual historical, political, and moral value.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg57c2w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491986526.0, "created_utc": 1491957726.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 635}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4xmur", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 236, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chikindiner", "parent_id": "t3_64tnub", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm not sure if this question will be considered on topic or not...I think it is.\n\nI'm curious how /u/commiespaceinvader and anyone else who has spent a good deal of time studying the atrocities of the Third Reich in an academic capacity feel about public figures invoking Hitler or the Nazis (Godwin's Law) in policy debate or as justification for any certain action. \n\nDoes it serve as a reminder of how horrifying and unjust the Holocaust was when used appropriately?
