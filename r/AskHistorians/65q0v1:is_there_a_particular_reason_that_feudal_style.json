In much of Sub-Saharan Africa, land was relatively plentiful and human populations were sparse. You will find scholars like ~~Richard J Reid~~ John Illife who argue that this relative abundance in land shaped African attitudes toward land ownership and group dynamics. That is, since land is abundant, farmers or peasants wishing to avoid the exactions of a greedy elite or chief could simply \"vote with their feet\" by moving to an area outside of that chiefs control and cultivating land there. In theory, this movement could also mean the rise of new political units (i.e. new chiefdoms or kingdoms), or the reorientation of loyalty of a lineage from one chief to another. (A corollary of this idea is that it would encourage chiefs would look to slavery as a way of mobilizing labor which could be controlled/exploited to a greater extent)\n\nSo, with this concept in mind, scholars like Miers and Kopytkoff or Jane Guyer talk of wealth-in-people. The idea being that the amount of prestige an elite person/noble or a chief has is determined by the number of dependents or followers they have through social ties of family, loyalty, or obligation. TL:DR- in certain african societies, chiefs focused on attracting many followers, rather than valuing a system of land tenure.\n\nNow, with all that theory out of the way, I think it is important to mention the empirical example of the Middle Niger region, which was a very fertile agricultural region for the Mali and Songhai empires. Contrary to the theory of an abundance of free land, the Middle Niger was a relatively limited area of rich farmland, and in that region the Mali emperors and their Songhai successors controlled labor by establishing a system of royal estates where slaves farmed the grains that would feed the imperial armies. Here I will quote Nehmia Levtzion's *Ancient Ghana and Mali*^`\n\n&gt; Through taxation part of the agricultural surplus was channeled into paying for the army and the administration of the central government. With the apparent lack of useful technological innovations, production could have been increased only by expanding the cultivated land. This the imperial authority could do only by organizing the exploitation of labour. The rulers established slaves in new villages to till the land and fill the royal granaries. \n\n&gt; a detailed account of such slave villages at the time of Askiya Dawud of Songhay is given in *tarikh al fattash*. on one farm there were 200 slaves under four headmen, and above them the farm chief, a slave himself. The latter was responsible to the *Askiya* for the supply of a thousand sacks of rice. The farm handed over its quota of a thousand sacks and the surplus was kept by the chief slave who became quite wealthy in spite of his servile condition....\n\nAnd John Hunwick provides this insight in *Timbuktu and the Songhai Empire*^2\n\n&gt;...Although we should be cautious about accepting the full list of servile peoples ('groups in thrall to the ruler, not free persons enslaved' - *qabail ariqqa lahu la ahrar usturiqqu*) listed in (pseudo-) Tarikh al-Fattash, -one group, the Arbi mentioned above, is mentioned in what is evidently part of the original text of TF.
