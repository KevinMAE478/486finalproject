Anthony Hastings, Aviel Roshwald, and some others have tried to push it back even further, but I find they end up talking about national identities more than a national*ism*. Here's a useful paragraph from Greenfeld:\n\n&gt;The inventors of nationalism were members of the new Tudor aristocracy in England in the sixteenth century. Upwardly mobile commoners who reached the top of the social ladder, they found unacceptable the traditional image of society in which social mobility was an anomaly and substituted a new image for it, that of a nation as it came to be understood in modern times. Before this happened, the word \"nation\" meant something entirely different; it referred to a political and cultural elite, rather than to a society as a whole. Tudor aristocrats, however, made the \"nation\" synonymous with the English \"people,\" a concept which previously-in English as in other languages referred specifically to the lower orders of society, the commons (or worse: the rabble or plebs), as members of which so many of the new aristocrats were born. As a result of this redefinition, every member of the people was elevated to the dignity of the elite becoming, in principle, equal to any other member, as well as free, in vested with the right of self-government, or, in other words, sovereignty, and the people or the nation collectively was, in turn, defined as sovereign.\n\nGorski argues the same is true for Holland, but it's important to keep in mind that Anthony Marx and some others argue that exclusionary nationalism dates even earlier and appears to be linked to state centralization in England, Spain, and France. An Ottoman middle class is something we really don't see until the 19th century. And indeed, that rising middle class (they were bureaucrats, not merchants) is the core of Turkish nationalism. \n\nThe Ottoman System had a few key differences: 1) the period of the Ottomans having a strong central state was finite. There was a long period where the Empire decentralized and local elites effectively ruled, particularly from the 17th and 18th centuries. In the 19th centuries, you suddenly see a push for internal colonization (for instance, the crushing of the Kurdish beyliks) and recentralizations. But Ottoman State capacity is highly variable. 2) in *Nations before Nationalism*, John Armstrong argues that before national identies were important, trans-national religious identies were paramount. The during the height of the Empire, Ottomans were never Turks, not until late into the 19th century at least. What Ottomans were was Muslims, and in fact, from 1517 on, Caliphs. However, 3) the Ottomans had the millet system. They did not have equal citizenship, but they allowed for identity pluralism, and indeed, rationalized it into formal institutions. Just as Canada today recognizes effectively three different ways to be Canadian (English-speaking, French-speaking, and First Nation/M\u00e9tis) so too did the Ottomans have multiple ways of existing in the Empire. The Ottomans allowed assimilation into Islam, and that certainly incurred some advantages, but they only very very rarely tried to force it. Marc Baer's first book is about some of those rare instances. And perhaps most importantly, 4) the Ottomans were always self-consciously an empire.

The higher state capacity in Western Europe allowed these early nationalizing states to both \"expel Others\" and assimilate peripheral populations earlier than in the Balkans.  In other parts of Europe, we see a long history of ethnic diversity than eventually got smashed through the emergence of ethnic states and policies of ethnic cleansing to try to match populations to those states.  \n\nPrague, for instance, was historically a mixed German and Czech speaking city that also had a large Jewish population.  Franz Kafka, for instance, was a Jewish lifelong resident of Prague who attended the local German language Charles-Ferdinand University and wrote all his literary and professional works (he worked as an insurance officer) in German, though he could also speak Czech well.  In the interwar period, roughly a quarter of Czechoslovakia spoke German as a native language (likely a decrease from a few years earlier, as many moved to Austria or Germany after Czechoslovakian independence).  At the end of the war, these German-speakers had either been murdered (as with Kafka, many of the German-speakers were Jews), fled, or were expelled.\n\nThis is the common pattern for Eastern Europe.  In addition to the roughly six million Jews and half a million Romani and Sinti killed in the Holocaust, and more Jews ended up emigrating to the New World, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and of course Israel.  Before the War, Poland was 10% Jewish. Between 1944-1950, millions of ethnic Germans fled or were expelled.  Most of post-War Western Poland (the \"[Recovered Territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovered_Territories)\") had been German speaking before the War, and most of pre-War Eastern Poland (east of the [Curzon Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzon_Line)) was annexed by the Soviet Union.  Populations were expelled accordingly.  Poland was the most dramatic case, but such reengineering of demographics through expulsion and forced assimilation was common in the immediate post-War period.

The higher state capacity in Western Europe allowed these early nationalizing states to both &amp;quot;expel Others&amp;quot; and assimilate peripheral populations earlier than in the Balkans.  In other parts of Europe, we see a long history of ethnic diversity than eventually got smashed through the emergence of ethnic states and policies of ethnic cleansing to try to match populations to those states.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prague, for instance, was historically a mixed German and Czech speaking city that also had a large Jewish population.  Franz Kafka, for instance, was a Jewish lifelong resident of Prague who attended the local German language Charles-Ferdinand University and wrote all his literary and professional works (he worked as an insurance officer) in German, though he could also speak Czech well.  In the interwar period, roughly a quarter of Czechoslovakia spoke German as a native language (likely a decrease from a few years earlier, as many moved to Austria or Germany after Czechoslovakian independence).  At the end of the war, these German-speakers had either been murdered (as with Kafka, many of the German-speakers were Jews), fled, or were expelled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the common pattern for Eastern Europe.  In addition to the roughly six million Jews and half a million Romani and Sinti killed in the Holocaust, and more Jews ended up emigrating to the New World, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and of course Israel.  Before the War, Poland was 10% Jewish. Between 1944-1950, millions of ethnic Germans fled or were expelled.  Most of post-War Western Poland (the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovered_Territories\"&gt;Recovered Territories&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;) had been German speaking before the War, and most of pre-War Eastern Poland (east of the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzon_Line\"&gt;Curzon Line&lt;/a&gt;) was annexed by the Soviet Union.  Populations were expelled accordingly.  Poland was the most dramatic case, but such reengineering of demographics through expulsion and forced assimilation was common in the immediate post-War period.

Scott.  Scott notes that in addition to highlands, deserts, swamps, and dense jungles can also preserve ethnic diversity.  For deserts, we can point to Bedouins in Arabia and the Khoisan in South Africa; for swamps, the Marsh Arabs in Iraq and the Seminole in Florida; for dense jungles, Central African pygmy groups like the Aka or Mbuti or the still minimally contacted groups in the Amazon Rain Forest in Brazil.  So, in a certain sense, we'd expect the mountainous terrain of the Balkan Highlands to preserve regional diversity in resistance to lowland state-based cultures, just as we see in Southeast Asia, the Zargos Mountains (where you have Kurds, Turks, Iranians, etc), Switzerland, etc.\n\nBeyond the Greeks and the Albanians, it seems like all the other groups are the result of some post-Roman expansion.  Slavs, for instance, didn't come into the Balkans (which at the time were under Byzantine control) until roughly 6th century.  The history of the Romanians is very fraught.  Turks obviously arrived with the Ottoman Empire, and part of their policy was to bring in other Muslim minorities, which explains how Tatars ended up a minority in Romania.  Further, single ethnolinguistic groups got split between religions.  Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs are distinguishable first based on religion.  Pomaks and Bulgarians are similar.  These religions tend to be related to the large empires that fought over the region through the 20th century (notably, the Austro-Hungarian, the Russia, and the Ottoman Empires).  Many regions saw few conquests.\n\nI should note other groups never split based on religion: there are, for instance, Sunni Muslim, Bektashi Muslim, Catholic Christian, and Orthodox Christian Albanians.  Slavic groups in the Balkans are also divided by pretty arbitrary lines: Slavic languages tend to form a \"[dialect continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum)\" and the difference between these languages tend to be clear from the capital cities.  South Slavic languages are specifically mentioned in that Wikipedia article as one of the classic cases of the phenomenon, though Bulgarian is pretty distinct from the others.\n\nA factor is that we default to thinking about Western Europe, when we rarely think of how much ethnic cleansing and assimilation there has been in recent European history.  Let's use France as an example.  France saw, we think, three or so major conquests: a pre-historic Celtic conquest, the Roman Conquest under Julius Caesar, and the Frankish conquest.\n\nWe see that linguistic traces of conquest in France, too. The only pre-Celtic language is Basque spoken in the (surprise, surprise) Mountainous Pyranees in the Southeast.  Pre-Celtic languages were mostly displaced by Celtic languages.  Actually, all Celtic languages in France were displaced by Romance languages based off Latin.  However, Breton, a Celtic language, was brought to what's now the remote Northwestern French province of Brittany/Bretagne, from the Island of Great Britain.  Its closest relative is the Cornish Language.  The association between Britain and Breton are not coincidental.  \n\nHowever, most of France speaks a Romance language called French, developed from the local dialect of Vulgar Latin.  However, this two was a dialect continuum and until very recently, most French people didn't speak French.  Those who didn't speak Basque or Breton spoke a variety of romance dialects, with at least two literary standards, commonly known by their separate words for \"no\" the Langue d'o\u00efl (o\u00efl being the predecessor to the modern \"oui\") based around Paris and the Langue d'oc/Lenga d'oc based in the South of France, modern version of which might be called Occitan or Proven\u00e7al.  In the 19th century, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral even tried to create a literary Proven\u00e7al nationalism, though this never was elevated to the level of a political nationalism.  We tend to think of think of this Langue d'oc as just \"a southern dialect of French\", but it's probably more similar to Catalan or even some northern Italian \"dialects\" than to the Parisian-standard of French.  The most famous book on this is Eugene Weber's *Peasants into Frenchmen*; he argues that in about 1870, only about 60% of the citizens of France could actually speak French, and that mass education (only in the Parisian standard, and also teaching a French nationalism), the mass army (again teaching the standard language and inculcating nationalism), and a national economy made possibly by roads and railways are what turned diverse peasants into the modern French.  This assimilationist campaign was perhaps most acutely felt in the region of Alsace, which periodic had a German-speaking majority (only being conquered by France in 1689).  One 1999 survey found that 43% of Alsatian adults speak Alsatian German, but this is declining in the younger generations.  Because of its German heritage, Alsace is also unique in France in its strong Protestant minority and historically a strong Jewish minority (this is where Emile Durkheim's and Alfred Dreyfus's families were from, for instance, and according to one theory, the birth place of Yiddish) though its Jewish population is much less pronounced today.\n\nOr compare the Balkans to the British Isles.  There are generally considered to be at least six \"indigenous\" ethnic groups to the British Isles: the English (descended in part Angles, Saxons, and Jutes), Scots, Welsh, Irish, Cornish, and Manx, each with their own native language and in the Scottish case, two (Scots and Scottish Gaelic).  That doesn't count the Romany (\"Gypsies\"), the Jews, the Irish Travelers (\"Pikeys\"), Scottish Travelers, etc. who have long made the  British Isles their home, nor does it recognize the religious diversity (in England alone, you find Anglicans, Quakers, Methodists, Unitarians, Puritans, Baptists, Presbyterians, etc as well as indigenous Anglo-Catholics and, between 1070 and 1290 and again since 1656, Jews).  Much the \"internal colonialism\" of the government based in London, to use Michael Hechter's term, was against England's \"Celtic fringe\".  Likewise, England did a great deal to tolerate non-conforming (non-Anglican) Protestant churches early on, and since the Reformation Scotland had a separate (Presbyterian) established Church.
