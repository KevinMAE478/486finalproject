Let me add my tiny contribution to it and try to put Holmes\u2019 addiction in the context of cocaine use at the time. *The Sign of Four* was published in 1890, which means that Doyle was writing it amidst the first few years of pure cocaine becoming the new panacea, taking the throne from opium and later pure morphine. Annus mirabilis of pure cocaine was 1884, when Sigmund Freud published *On Coca* and Karl Koller, a german physician working in Vienna, presented his findings of cocaine\u2019s anesthetic abilities - it was pretty much the first local anesthetic which worked, and Koller utilised it in eye surgeries. Does this mean that before 1884 noone knew what cocaine was? Of course not. Albert Niemann was able to extract the alkaloid from coca leaves in 1859. The reason why it took so long for the \u201cwonderful white powder\u201d to gain notoriety, is one of purity and access. The amount of good available coca leaves in Europe was scarce and many experiments and findings were stiffled by materia medica which simply did not have enough of the alkaloid left to extract. Thanks to a certain gentleman called Merck and his company, which was exporting crude cocaine from Peru, the early 1880s saw a small, but stable supply of chemically active cocaine.

As I said, coca leaves were being extracted way before pure cocaine was introduced, and it gave rise a niche on the already extremely profitable market of [patent medicines](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4w2dga/how_common_were_early_remedies_like_childrens/). Among these, coca wines were extremely popular. I\u2019ll quote my older Tuesday Trivia post here, about the most succesful one, Vin Mariani (a direct inspiration and competitor to Coca Cola):\n\n&gt;Vin Mariani was a product which was created in the 1870s and consisted mainly of (only the finest!) Bordeaux wine and extract of coca leaves. Wines of coca were not strangers in the pharmacopoeias of many countries and in fact, various medicinal wines were one of the few cases in which the temperance movements kind of squinted their no fun, anti-booze eyes (then there were the patent medicines on which I wrote before and the trick there was always to simply not say that it had a substantial amount of alcohol and/or opium in it. In that way you got teatotaller ladies that died of cirrhosis of the liver).\n\nThese were popular all over the place and one thing which was troubling about them was the amount of advertising done through \u201cscientific\u201d magazines, published by the manufacturers of the patent medicines: \n\n&gt;Mariani had basically a little separate industry going, producing more then ten volumes of Album Mariani, where the endorsements were printed alongside biographies of the famous people. He also produced his own medical journal specifically to promote virtues of coca. It\u2019s not quite the same, but imagine \u201cPepsi presents Journal of Nutritional Value of Loads of Sugar\u201d.\n\nThe same goes for Parke &amp; Davis and their journal *Therapeutic Gazzette*. You could not find disclosure of the relationship between *Park, Davis &amp; Company* anywhere in this publication, but you could find plenty of articles praising their products. Including a whole series of articles about the possible wonderful cure for morphinism - cocaine. Freud quoted these very articles in his work, thus an advertising campaign had a very direct hand in spreading this belief in \u201cmiraculous\u201d use of cocaine. Freud later also accepted an offer of money in exchange of endorsing Parke &amp; Davis\u2019s products, when Merck hiked up the prices and made him mad (Freud and his friends were a huge chunk of Merck\u2019s customers).

This does not seem to be true. Not that there were no addicts amongst Civil War veterans, but it was more importantly the widespread use of morphine and the slow introduction of the hypodermic needle to public, that then led to these being used in everyday practice, which can be pointed out as the chief contribution of the war itself.

Without proper information on dosage, knowledge of the effects of withdrawal and so on, the young organisms of children were at risk for collapsing thanks to the use of these concoctions.

I'll refer you to *Emperors of Dreams: Drugs in the Nineteenth Century* by Mike Jay, and I'll mix in a few other sources as we talk about it. David Musto (the god of American narcotics historians) wrote a fascinating 1989 paper entitled \"Why did Sherlock Holmes Use Cocaine?\" that I recommend too.\n\nBefore we talk about Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, let's pull back a little bit and talk about late Victorian British society's attitude toward narcotics. Narcotics \u2500 particularly opium and morphine, but also cocaine and other substances \u2500 were a hot-button topic in Victorian Britain and the United States at the time.\n\nAs Jay points out, a lot of the discussion on opium portrays it almost as a plague with significant racial undertones, given that most British and American audiences were introduced to opium by Chinese immigrants or a Chinese experience. That's remarkably ironic given the role the British played in spreading opium in China. In Britain, the Anglo-Oriental Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade circulated a journal called *Friend of China* that ostensibly tried to point out all the harm opium had done to China.\n\nIn reality, it was a spectacularly racist publication that frequently claimed that the Chinese were piteous children unable to protect themselves against the opium menace, and only Western society could save them. Moreover, the journal warned, the opium menace might spread to Western society, with Biblical allusions to Hosea 8:7 (sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind).\n\nYou see an anti-opium mood spread rapidly into popular culture in the late 1860s and into the 1870s. Dickens' unfinished novel, *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*, for example, features an opium addict and scenes in an opium den. The notion of the opium den as a plague, as something to be feared because it might infect polite society, begins to come to pass at this time. Conan Doyle takes it up, as does Oscar Wilde in *Picture of Dorian Gray.*\n\nMeredith Conti, in a paper published last year in the book *Victorian Medicine and Popular Culture*, wonderfully explains that chronic drug use combined with this infectious, xenophobic viewpoint, and hit popular culture with a splash.\n\n&gt;\"Soon, however, a number of factors gradually reshaped public attitudes toward drug addiction: the return of wounded soldiers addicted to analgesics; physician over-prescription; the surge in opiate-laced patent medicines ... the invention of the hypodermic needle; and the first legislative restrictions on non-medical opiate use.\"\n\nIn popular society, there had been a belief during the middle part of the century that addicts had nothing to blame but themselves. It was because of their weak will, or poor morals, or some personal factor that made them vulnerable to opium, alcohol and vice. As Darwin's theories became more popular, the idea came about that there must be a genetic cause \u2500 that addicts have a hereditary inclination toward addiction.  \n\nNote that there is at this time a big difference between *addiction* and *use.* This distinction would persist until the early 20th century, by and large. You'll frequently run into references to the idea that high-performing individuals, fast thinkers, big-doers, need to use narcotics to moderate their overheating minds, otherwise they might suffer a breakdown. You see this in *The Sign of Four,* where Conan Doyle writes about Holmes needing to stave off boredom.\n\nElsewhere, there's often a feminine tone to this language, as the thoughts of the period were that the feminine spirit was fragile and needed to be kept in balance or otherwise preserved from too much emotion.\n\nThe idea of a \"naturally corrupt\" class of people prone to addiction starts to change in the late 1870s and early 1880s. In 1876, Edward Levinstein published the influential *Morbid Craving for Morphia*, which described narcotics' *corrupting* influence, about how even proper people could be brought low. In the years after his work, drug addiction became a medical condition in Britain.\n\nAt the same time, cocaine begins to come onto the British scene in a big way. In 1885, for example, Doyle's hometown of Southsea hosts the British Dental Association's annual conference. The conference's big topic? The virtues of cocaine anaesthesia. This was also the time when Americans, British citizens and others in Western society were flocking to coca-laced beverages (*Coca-Cola,* anyone?) as the new fad. \n\nIn a 1994 paper, \"Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle and cocaine,\" D.N. Pearce suggests that Doyle's studies at the University of Edinburgh, where toxicology research was quite advanced for the time, gave him a leg up in anticipating the harmful effects of cocaine.\n\nBy the time *The Sign of the Four* is published five years later, with its remarkable references to cocaine addiction, the popular mood had begun to shift in the direction of cocaine as a vice rather than a pure medicine. The Sherlock Holmes stories aren't the only place you see this discussion come up. Think of *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, published in 1886, and other stories, such as those by Bloomsbury and M.P. Shiel.\n\nJay suggests that Conan Doyle intended Holmes' cocaine habit to be part of his bohemian, counterculture identity, but as popular opinion began viewing cocaine as purely a vice, references fade to holmes' use. By 1904, when *The Missing Three-Quarter* is published, Conan Doyle writes that his hero has been \"weaned\" from his \"drug mania\" which had \"threatened to check his remarkable career,\" something that's clearly a ret-con to accommodate changing times.\n\nAs Musto wrote in his 1989 paper, \"Therefore, Holmes's use of cocaine was not reprehensible. Leading physicians much more prominent than the wise Dr. Watson recommended cocaine for the reasons Holmes used it. That he used cocaine was unfortunate, but he corrected the error \u2500 and that was commendable.\"", "edited": 1492328782.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great question!
