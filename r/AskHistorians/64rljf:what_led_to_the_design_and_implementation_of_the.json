Any unit unable to keep together is liable to be ridden down and sabared mercilessly by cavalry.\n\n* Weapons and training of the era is imperfect and most soldiers will die of disease rather than to enemy action.  \n\n* The nature of black powder weapons would often quickly shroud the battlefield in smoke, making communication even more difficult.\n\n* Most armies used mercenaries or other form of vounteer service to staff their armies in this era.\n\n* Open top weapons (such as flintlocks) are highly vurnurable to moisture.\n\n* Psychology on the battlefield is very important, as many (if not most) soldiers are killed as they break and run.\n\nTaking these things into consideration, a bright coloured uniform makes a lot of sense. It lets you separate your own men from the enemy easily. The unit is easy to spot on the battlefield for messengers or the general wishing to control it - a unit that cannot keep together and cannot be seen or controlled by the general is worse than useless - it is counter-productive, as it will still draw rations and supplies, but not add to the combat power of the army.\n\nCamouflage is not an issue to the same extent, as a unit kept together in a tight formation to be able to ward of any enemy cavalry and to be able to deliver massed volleys of musket fire.
