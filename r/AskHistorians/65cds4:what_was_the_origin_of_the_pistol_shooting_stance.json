While some manuals omit it altogether, instructors clearly taught it before it was put to print. Sadly, I haven&amp;#39;t been able to find out how widespread it was and at what times \u2013 to the best of my knowledge, it seems to have been intended for longer range shooting and teaching it largely depended on the instructor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most common of these &amp;quot;1,5 hand&amp;quot; stances is grabbing the strong hand from below (as in the video above), while others are simply steadying the strong hand by putting the weak hand as a fist under it, or supporting the strong arm by putting the weak hand/forearm under the strong forearm. There may well have been examples of &amp;quot;Weaver-ish&amp;quot; two hand stances before Cooper/Weaver, but I&amp;#39;ve yet to see anything but anecdotal evidence for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg9adpl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492213098.0, "created_utc": 1492184298.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cds4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9izhn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Minardi-Man", "parent_id": "t3_65cds4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "One possible reason is the sort of pistols they used.
