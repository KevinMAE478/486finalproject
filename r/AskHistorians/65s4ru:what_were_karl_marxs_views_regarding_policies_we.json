What decides how much food someone gets or how big their house is? \n\nIt would be based on need, but beyond that the details of \"how\" are numerous. Would everybody be forced to participate in the decision or would it be volunteer based? What if only one person volunteered or nobody volunteered to be responsible for rice distribution? Would we vote? In details like those you'll get dozens of different answers.\n\n&gt; How do you distribute scarce, high-demand goods like sports cars or jewelry?\n\nI think you're falling into the same mode of thinking as the person I originally replied to. You're imagining a model consumer from a capitalist society as described in ECON 101 living in the USSR when neither of those things are really applicable to how a communist utopia would work. Importantly, people from this society would wants cars and jewelry for relatively practical reasons unrelated to social status like driving fast and beautifying themselves. In fact, social status in their society wouldn't exist, and they probably wouldn't personally own anything of value on international markets.

Wherever commodities and commodity production exist, there the law of value must also exist.\n\n&gt;In our country, the sphere of operation of the law of value extends, first of all, to commodity circulation, to the ex-change of commodities through purchase and sale, the ex-change, chiefly, of articles of personal consumption. Here, in this sphere, the law of value preserves, within certain limits, of course, the function of a regulator.\n\n&gt;But the operation of the law of value is not confined to the sphere of commodity circulation. It also extends to production. True, the law of value has no regulating function in our socialist production, but it nevertheless influences production, and this fact cannot be ignored when directing production. As a matter of fact, consumer goods, which arc needed to compensate the labour power expended in the process of production, are produced and realized in our country as commodities coming under the operation of the law of value. It is precisely here that the law of value exercises its influence on production.

This, in fact, explains the confusion that still reigns in the sphere of price-fixing policy. Here is one of many examples. Some time ago it was decided to adjust the prices of cotton and grain in the interest of cotton growing, to establish more accurate prices for grain sold to the cotton growers, and to raise the prices of cotton delivered to the state. Our business executives and planners submitted a proposal on this score which could not but astound the members of the Central Committee, since it suggested fixing the price of a ton of grain at practically the same level as a ton of cotton, and, moreover, the price of a ton of grain was taken as equivalent to that of a ton of baked bread. In reply to the remarks of members of the Central Committee that the price of a ton of bread must be higher than that of a ton of grain, because of the additional expense of milling and baking, and that cotton was generally much dearer than grain, as was also borne out by their prices in the world market, the authors of the proposal could find nothing coherent to say. The Central Committee was therefore obliged to take the matter into its own hands and to lower the prices of grain and raise the prices of cotton. What would have happened if the proposal of these comrades had received legal force?

No: the competition of the market redistributes the surplus value among capitals so that a general rate of profit arises among capitals. This means, by adding this general rate of profit to the mere cost price of a product, we arrive at the \u201cprice of production\u201d around which supply and demand will gravitate in the market. Supply and demand are both partially regulated by profitability, albeit of course being subject to fluctuations according to scarcities, changes in consumer preferences and other factors. Marx goes on to show how rent is a redistribution of surplus value between capitalist and landlord, like interest is a redistribution between capitalist and money lender. He explains how that shapes the dynamic of capitalism on the aggregate and by that the lives of all people living under it.\n\nSo, now that we know all that, what is Marx\u2019s proposed solution? Marx explicitly holds back with depicting too accurately what a post-capitalist society would look like:\n\n&gt;We do not dogmatically anticipate the world, but only want to find the new world through criticism of the old one.\n\n- [Karl Marx, Letters from the Deutsch-Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher, Marx to Ruge, 1843](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/letters/43_09.htm)\n\nBut this negative critique contains in itself a positive description: The proletariat - the people that need to work wage labour for a living - has in itself the potential for the realization of a new society: in its struggle against capital, it expresses the form which the new society will take \u2013 communism. As we have seen, capitalism is characterized by alienated labour, which creates the commodity form of products and therefore value. A communist society \u2013 Marx made no distinction between socialism and communism \u2013 would therefore need to work unalienated labour. No private property would exist, products wouldn\u2019t take on the commodity form for exchange and value wouldn\u2019t be able to manifest itself. Therefore, economics as we currently understand it would cease to apply, and people would be able to consciously produce. Marx\u2019s critique fundamentally adresses the reality that the products of the worker\u2019s own labour in capitalism take on a life of their own, structuring reality and subsuming all spheres of life under them \u2013 capital. Commodity production puts people together, but they only relate to each other as objects, while the objects become subjects governing their lives. In capitalism, you work social labour that only takes on the form of private labour. You have no control over what you produce, and your product isn\u2019t your own either. Marx in one passage describes capital as an \"automatic subject\" that is akin to a robot in that it doesn\u2019t really live, but that people are objects in its eyes, mere bundles of human capital that need to be accumulated to do value producing work and exploited to produce even more value. Capital can be described as the actually existing god of this world.\n\nThis also means, that the capitalist is himself as much slave to capital as the worker is. Marx doesn\u2019t criticize the individuals that take on the roles assigned by capital, but rather capital itself. The same goes for democracy: Marx calls liberal democracy as we understand it the \u201cdictatorship of the bourgeoisie\u201d, as all decisions taken are ultimately restricted by the frame capital sets them. The politicians don\u2019t control capitalism, capital controls them. He counterposes this with the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\", which is not a simple autocracy like in the Soviet Union, but the revolution itself - a part of society violently enforcing its will upon the rest. A communist society thus gets rid of value, capital, money, the state and classes. Now let's look at the Soviet Union: Did money exist? Yes, the ruble. Did capital exist? Yes, it was merely concentrated in the hand of the state. Did commodities exist? Yes. Did the state exist? Of course. Was labour alienated? Yes. This leads us to conclude that the Soviet Union and other \u201csocialist\u201d states weren\u2019t in fact communist, but in fact plainly and simply capitalist. The collapse of the Soviet Union isn\u2019t the refutation of Marx\u2019s Capital, but rather its confirmation \u2013 the law of value continued to operate in the state planned economy, the state simply behaved like a large scale monopoly.\n\nMarx wanted to bring the means of production ultimately under one single, non-exclusionary body comprising the entirety of society, so that property would be sublated, and exchange would cease, and humanity could take its fate back in its own hands. This means, that communism can only exist on a global scale, or not exist at all - Marx made that point very clear:\n\n&gt;And, on the other hand, this development of productive forces (which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-historical, instead of local, being) is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced; and furthermore, because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established, which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the \"propertyless\" mass (universal competition), makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others, and finally has put world-historical, empirically universal individuals in place of local ones. Without this, (i) communism could only exist as a local event; (2) the forces of intercourse themselves could not have developed as universal, hence intolerable powers: they would have remained home-bred conditions surrounded by superstition; and (3) each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism. Empirically, communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples \"all at once\" and simultaneously, which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism. Moreover, the mass of propertyless workers -- the utterly precarious position of labour -- power on a mass scale cut off from capital or from even a limited satisfaction and, therefore, no longer merely temporarily deprived of work itself as a secure source of life -- presupposes the world market through competition. The proletariat can thus only exist world-historically, just as communism, its activity, can only have a \"world-historical\" existence. World-historical existence of individuals means existence of individuals which is directly linked up with world history.\n\n- [Karl Marx, The German Ideology, 1845](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/)\n\nNow coming back to your question - where is the crucial difference in politics between Lenin and Stalin? The most important point is that Lenin knew most of what I described above. He knew that Russia couldn't be anything but capitalist in isolation - he thought that the success of the Russian revolution depended upon the success of a revolution in western Europe. He went as far as to say this: \n\n&gt;But history has taught you a lesson. It is a lesson, because it is the absolute truth that without a German revolution we are doomed\u2014perhaps not in Petrograd, not in Moscow, but in Vladivostok, in more remote places to which perhaps we shall have to retreat, and the distance to which is perhaps greater than the distance from Petrograd to Moscow. At all events, under all conceivable circumstances, if the German revolution does not come, we are doomed. Nevertheless, this does not in the least shake our conviction that we must be able to bear the most difficult position without blustering. \n\n- [V.I. Lenin, Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the R.C.P.\\(B.\\), 1918](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/7thcong/01.htm)\n\nNow, we know that this German revolution never came, which brought the Bolsheviks into a dire situation. Around 1921, Russia ceased to be a dictatorship of the proletariat: strikes were put down, the left-wing opposition expelled, the \"New Economic Policy\" instituted and a year later the Treaty of Rapello was signed. Put differently: counterrevolution prevailed and Russia consolidated itself as a normal capitalist state. Something that was clear to Lenin: \n\n&gt;The state capitalism, which is one of the principal aspects of the New Economic Policy, is, under Soviet power, a form of capitalism that is deliberately permitted and restricted by the working class.\n\n- [V.I.

[...] Stalin is too coarse and this defect, although quite tolerable in our midst and in dealing among us Communists, becomes intolerable in a Secretary-General. That is why I suggest that the comrades think about a way of removing Stalin from that post and appointing another man in his stead who in all other respects differs from Comrade Stalin in having only one advantage, namely, that of being more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and more considerate to the comrades, less capricious, etc.\n\n- [V.I.

No: the competition of the market redistributes the surplus value among capitals so that a general rate of profit arises among capitals. This means, by adding this general rate of profit to the mere cost price of a product, we arrive at the \u201cprice of production\u201d around which supply and demand will gravitate in the market. Supply and demand are both partially regulated by profitability, albeit of course being subject to fluctuations according to scarcities, changes in consumer preferences and other factors.

Marx developed his ideas by grappling with Hegel's philosophy and Feuerbach's materialist take on it. His problem with Hegel was, that in Marx's view, Hegel claimed that a subject could sublate the contradictions within the real world in his mind, and thus come to peace with the present state of things. Marx argued that this would be impossible, as the contradictions were inherent in the practical material world itself, and would thus not simply be sublated by reflecting upon them. He therefore criticized philosophy itself as a constant attempt of coming to terms with the world, but never be able to do so. Instead, he argued, that people would need to practically change the world so they could appropriate it for themselves again. From Feuerbach, he took the rejection of abstractions. Feuerbach argued that humans were confronted with their own non-perfectness, while they could imagine a perfect being - this led to humans creating a perfect being, god, which they would start to obey to: humanity bowing down to its own creation. \n\nMarx went further than that - he claimed that the self-estrangement of humanity lies in its practical actions. In production, humanity appropriated the world for itself, and therefore purposefully recreated, as the only animal, the environment that would shape itself. Focusing on production would mean that he would need to look into the relations of production of his time, and therefore into political economy. He read the most important economists of his time, like Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Jean-Baptiste Say, Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay and others. His work was not so much a positivist science like we understand it today, but, being indebted to Hegel, akin to a negative science that made sense of capitalism through a ruthless interrogation of its own logic. It is no surprise that Marx named his central work \"Critique of Political Economy\" - it was decidedly not an attempt of formulating something like a \"Marxist economics\". Marx rather attempted to show why categories such as value, price, profit and rent even arise, and to show what the historical circumstances are that lead to them - that they aren't eternal categories of nature. \n\nIf we have private property, we have a society of producers whose products become commodities - this means that they are directly produced for exchange on the market. Private property is not a mere state of legal affairs, but instead a social fact. It rests on exclusion: if there is an instance that restricts access to means of production, you have private property. It doesn't matter if that instance is an individual, a corporation, a collective of some sort or the state. Not every product of human labour is automatically a commodity \u2013 let\u2019s suppose you bake a cake and share it with friends and family. You created something that meets your needs and the need of others, but you didn\u2019t produce it with the intention of immediately trading it for something else. Marx explained that private property and exchange were in a reciprocal relationship: the more exchange happens, the more private property develops, which again pushes exchange into further areas of human relationships that weren't regulated by exchange before. The abstract concept \u201ccommodity\u201d is two things: it is first a use value, meaning that society assigns it a concrete use that is inherent to its form as a thing \u2013 the cake I mentioned earlier has the use value of meeting the need of hunger and being delicious. But a commodity is also exchange value, that is, the relationship in which it exchanges for other commodities, as for example a chair might be exchangeable for a bushel of wheat, or for two sausages. It is clear that if we are looking at those exchanges on a case by case basis in isolation, it seems as if the individual judgement of their usefulness determines them. This ultimately leads to a tautology though, as price is seen to express utility, but you cannot measure utility independent of price. If you\u2019re participating in a market, there\u2019s generally some exchange ratio that is being seen as \u201cwhat the thing is worth\u201d, around which the individual trades will gravitate. If this ratio didn\u2019t exist, everyone could just trade up whatever he or she has, which is of course nothing that can work on the aggregate. Now how is this seemingly arbitrary exchange ratio defined? It is the necessary expression of value as a social construct. Value is the necessary common that is needed to equate two things of different properties; of different use values. It isn't self-evident that two things fundamentally different are commensurable - they need a third thing they both relate to, to make that possible. Marx argues, that on the aggregate, what people equate when they trade products is different kinds of labour. In doing so, they abstract from the concrete form of labour, just as they abstract from the concrete use of the product. You need a different kind of labour to catch a fish, compared to baking a cake. You thus only equate \u201cabstract labour\u201d, the expenditure of human labour power as such. The substance of value is abstract labour - labour time \u2013 but again, it is not the actual time an individual needs for reproducing a commodity, but rather the socially necessary labour time, the time the society needs on average to create the commodity. This is value that expresses itself necessarily in exchange value. Value is thus nothing actually intrinsic to a commodity, but something that people create by equating different kinds of labour in trade regardless if they're aware of it - a \"real abstraction\". \n\nNow intuitively, it makes sense that the value of a commodity is determined by its socially necessary labour time, but how do we get from value to price, which is the form value expresses itself in necessarily in capitalism? In order to get there, Marx explains how through different forms value can take on a universal equivalent has to accrue, in which all other commodities, and therefore value, express themselves in. Historically, this role was taken by gold, which by habit is then money. But how do we get from an economy in which equal amounts of value exchange against each other to the expansive nature of capitalism? Sure, in our situation one man can make a gain if he buys something below value, but one man\u2019s gain is another man\u2019s loss. There is no growth on the aggregate level. How can a surplus arise then? The reason is that it arises once human labour power itself becomes a commodity. Labour power has the use value of producing more use values. Labour power is \u201cpotential labour\u201d commodified and thus bought and sold. But why should a man sell his labour power for money? The reason is that there need to be people that possess no commodities but their labour power in order to sustain themselves. Historically, this was accomplished through mass dispossessions which brought people into misery, so they had to sell their labour power on the market. If now labour power is a commodity, its value gets determined just as the value of every other commodity: the socially necessary labour time needed in order to reproduce it. This means a monetary sum that compensates for food, living, sustaining a family, and all luxury goods that are currently seen as \u201cnecessary\u201d in the respective society. The exact value of labour power at any point in time is subject to a social process of struggle. So now labour power is assigned a price according to its value, the wage. In the production process however, labour power is forced to work more than what is necessary to reproduce itself: the worker creates more value during the time of his work than he receives. This means that he partly works for free for the capitalist. In this time, he produces surplus value.\n\nThis surplus value is partly used by the capitalist for consumption, but mostly reinvested for higher returns in the future, in order to stay competitive and not perish on the market. The capitalist is as much slave to this logic as the worker is. Thus, exchange value becomes capital \u2013 self-expanding value through exploitation of the worker. Apart from labour power and raw materials, a capitalist can also purchase means of production \u2013 tools that assist in the production process. The interesting thing with them is that they themselves are of course also valued according to their socially necessary labour time for reproduction. But they aren't able to produce surplus value, they just transfer their value over time onto products until depreciation. Suppose you have a machine with a lifespan of a year, that took 5000 hours of socially necessary abstract labour time to produce, that in this time is able to put out 1000 products. It will then transfer the value of 5 abstract labour hours onto every product \u2013 no surplus arises. Because of that, Marx calls means of production and raw materials \u201cconstant capital\u201d, as they aren\u2019t able to produce surplus value. Labour power in contrast is \u201cvariable capital\u201d. It has the potential of producing a surplus. The circulation of capital can therefore be described like this: Money (M) is used to buy a sum of commodities - labour power, raw materials and means or production - (C). In production (P) a surplus in value of the commodities accrues (C') which needs to be realized in money on the market in order to start the process anew (M') - the process of circulation of capital is thus M - C ... P ... C' - M' (the points signaling that production takes place outside of circulation).", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain this, one has to go back to what Marx wrote about capitalism and communism.

Marx explained that private property and exchange were in a reciprocal relationship: the more exchange happens, the more private property develops, which again pushes exchange into further areas of human relationships that weren&amp;#39;t regulated by exchange before. The abstract concept \u201ccommodity\u201d is two things: it is first a use value, meaning that society assigns it a concrete use that is inherent to its form as a thing \u2013 the cake I mentioned earlier has the use value of meeting the need of hunger and being delicious. But a commodity is also exchange value, that is, the relationship in which it exchanges for other commodities, as for example a chair might be exchangeable for a bushel of wheat, or for two sausages. It is clear that if we are looking at those exchanges on a case by case basis in isolation, it seems as if the individual judgement of their usefulness determines them. This ultimately leads to a tautology though, as price is seen to express utility, but you cannot measure utility independent of price. If you\u2019re participating in a market, there\u2019s generally some exchange ratio that is being seen as \u201cwhat the thing is worth\u201d, around which the individual trades will gravitate. If this ratio didn\u2019t exist, everyone could just trade up whatever he or she has, which is of course nothing that can work on the aggregate. Now how is this seemingly arbitrary exchange ratio defined? It is the necessary expression of value as a social construct. Value is the necessary common that is needed to equate two things of different properties; of different use values. It isn&amp;#39;t self-evident that two things fundamentally different are commensurable - they need a third thing they both relate to, to make that possible. Marx argues, that on the aggregate, what people equate when they trade products is different kinds of labour. In doing so, they abstract from the concrete form of labour, just as they abstract from the concrete use of the product. You need a different kind of labour to catch a fish, compared to baking a cake. You thus only equate \u201cabstract labour\u201d, the expenditure of human labour power as such. The substance of value is abstract labour - labour time \u2013 but again, it is not the actual time an individual needs for reproducing a commodity, but rather the socially necessary labour time, the time the society needs on average to create the commodity. This is value that expresses itself necessarily in exchange value. Value is thus nothing actually intrinsic to a commodity, but something that people create by equating different kinds of labour in trade regardless if they&amp;#39;re aware of it - a &amp;quot;real abstraction&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now intuitively, it makes sense that the value of a commodity is determined by its socially necessary labour time, but how do we get from value to price, which is the form value expresses itself in necessarily in capitalism? In order to get there, Marx explains how through different forms value can take on a universal equivalent has to accrue, in which all other commodities, and therefore value, express themselves in. Historically, this role was taken by gold, which by habit is then money. But how do we get from an economy in which equal amounts of value exchange against each other to the expansive nature of capitalism? Sure, in our situation one man can make a gain if he buys something below value, but one man\u2019s gain is another man\u2019s loss. There is no growth on the aggregate level. How can a surplus arise then? The reason is that it arises once human labour power itself becomes a commodity. Labour power has the use value of producing more use values. Labour power is \u201cpotential labour\u201d commodified and thus bought and sold. But why should a man sell his labour power for money? The reason is that there need to be people that possess no commodities but their labour power in order to sustain themselves. Historically, this was accomplished through mass dispossessions which brought people into misery, so they had to sell their labour power on the market. If now labour power is a commodity, its value gets determined just as the value of every other commodity: the socially necessary labour time needed in order to reproduce it. This means a monetary sum that compensates for food, living, sustaining a family, and all luxury goods that are currently seen as \u201cnecessary\u201d in the respective society. The exact value of labour power at any point in time is subject to a social process of struggle. So now labour power is assigned a price according to its value, the wage. In the production process however, labour power is forced to work more than what is necessary to reproduce itself: the worker creates more value during the time of his work than he receives. This means that he partly works for free for the capitalist. In this time, he produces surplus value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This surplus value is partly used by the capitalist for consumption, but mostly reinvested for higher returns in the future, in order to stay competitive and not perish on the market. The capitalist is as much slave to this logic as the worker is. Thus, exchange value becomes capital \u2013 self-expanding value through exploitation of the worker. Apart from labour power and raw materials, a capitalist can also purchase means of production \u2013 tools that assist in the production process. The interesting thing with them is that they themselves are of course also valued according to their socially necessary labour time for reproduction. But they aren&amp;#39;t able to produce surplus value, they just transfer their value over time onto products until depreciation. Suppose you have a machine with a lifespan of a year, that took 5000 hours of socially necessary abstract labour time to produce, that in this time is able to put out 1000 products. It will then transfer the value of 5 abstract labour hours onto every product \u2013 no surplus arises. Because of that, Marx calls means of production and raw materials \u201cconstant capital\u201d, as they aren\u2019t able to produce surplus value. Labour power in contrast is \u201cvariable capital\u201d. It has the potential of producing a surplus. The circulation of capital can therefore be described like this: Money (M) is used to buy a sum of commodities - labour power, raw materials and means or production - (C). In production (P) a surplus in value of the commodities accrues (C&amp;#39;) which needs to be realized in money on the market in order to start the process anew (M&amp;#39;) - the process of circulation of capital is thus M - C ... P ... C&amp;#39; - M&amp;#39; (the points signaling that production takes place outside of circulation).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dgdf6v2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492461182.0, "created_utc": 1492432382.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s4ru", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65s4ru", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdnq0c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheLordHighExecu", "parent_id": "t1_dgddrze", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Could you expand your comment?
