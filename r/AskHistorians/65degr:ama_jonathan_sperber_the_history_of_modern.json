By the 1830s, connections were rather more tenuous, and political developments were different, because of the very enhanced place of slavery in American society and American politics.  So I would say that Hobsbawm's conclusion hasn't borne up so well over time.  Following the 1848 revolutions, the contribution of German emigr\u00e9 revolutionaries to the anti-slavery movement in the US rather revived trans-continental connections.\n\nIn 1987, when I was in the university library in Cologne, working on a book on the revolution of 1848 in the Rhineland, I came across the speech Marx made in the Cologne Democratic Society in August 1848 where he denounced the class struggle and the idea of a dictatorship of a single class.  I remember thinking to myself, \"this is not the Marx I know.\"  Maybe, I thought, I should write a biography, from a perspective explaining this speech.  It took a while--a good quarter century--but academics are slow-moving.
