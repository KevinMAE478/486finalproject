The gist is that boob-plate is an occasional artistic motif from at least the 16th century, which is a couple centuries earlier than I had originally believed - call it 20th century myopia; there's such an abundance of examples in the last 100 years, I didn't look back far enough.\n\n**[end edit]**\nIn the 18th century, the British Empire adopted \"Britannia\" as a kind of cultural avatar, a female goddess-figure styled after the Greek Athena (at least, she typically wore a Corinthian helmet, carried a shield and trident - the latter emphasizing the UK's naval dominance, a la Poseidon). A version of this can be seen, for example, in this [1875 cartoon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Punch_-_Over-Weighted.png/440px-Punch_-_Over-Weighted.png). Other versions of Britannia sported scale or chain mail, which of course was closer-fitting than plate and emphasized the shape of the breasts. You can see a version of this in this [1897 photograph of the Duchess of Devonshire dressed as Britannia](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/08/7a/e4/087ae41b87adca79088bd1d6c91137b7.jpg).\n\nBritannia is not the *sole* example around this time period, Richard Wagner's opera *The Ring Cycle* (*Der Ring des Nibelungen*, \"The Ring of the Nibelungs\") (1876) included female warrior-spirits called Valkyries drawn from Nordic mythology, and the actresses wore distinct breast plates with noticeable cups [as shown in this period photograph](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/2d/2d/1c/2d2d1c12470aaa3ca36b3a0902d7787c.jpg). So while female breast-emphasizing armor is largely ahistorical, starting at least in the late 19th century there was beginning to be an artistic trend of women in armor that emphasized their female characteristics.\n\nThis trend appears to have ramped up during World War I, when propaganda and increased nationalism led to more militant depictions of national avatars - u/sunagainstgold was kind enough to share [this one](http://cdn.loc.gov/service/pnp/cph/3b40000/3b48000/3b48400/3b48466r.jpg) involving Jeanne d'Arc (Joan of Arc), for example.\n\nIt's also important at this point to remember that the shape of women's clothing - especially their underclothing - was changing. Brassieres were first patented in Germany in 1899, and the first recognizable modern bra was patented in the United States in 1914. These gave greater shape and emphasis to the breast - especially when there was nothing else. This is where we enter the pulp era.\n\nI cannot say for certain when the first boob-plate appeared in the pulps, but the earliest I am *aware* of is [Argosy All-Story Weekly of 12 February 1921](http://www.philsp.com/data/images/a/argosy_all_story_weekly_19210212.jpg) by P. J. Monahan, which contains part of the serialization of Edgar Rice Burrough's [Tarzan the Terrible](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2020/2020-h/2020-h.htm), a passage of which reads:\n\n&gt; Upon the edge of this dais sat a young female Waz-don. In one hand she held a thin piece of metal, apparently of hammered gold, with serrated edges, and in the other a short, stiff brush. With these she was occupied in going over her smooth, glossy coat which bore a remarkable resemblance to plucked sealskin. Her loin cloth of yellow and black striped JATO-skin lay on the couch beside her with the circular breastplates of beaten gold, revealing the symmetrical lines of her nude figure in all its beauty and harmony of contour, for even though the creature was jet black and entirely covered with hair yet she was undeniably beautiful.\n\nThe \"circular breast-plates\" that Burroughs describes are clearly ornamental rather than armor, and follow a tendency of his to depict females as exotic and erotic; his fiction largely followed the \"Lost Race\" and \"Sword &amp; Planet\" genres.\n\nI don't want to delve too deeply into speculation, but I think this provided some of the impetus for depictions of females wearing armor. Personal armor was tried during WWI, but not widely adopted, aside from helmets; and women generally didn't serve on the front lines, so armor for contemporary women was a bit of a subject for the imagination - and most applicable to cultures other than those of the contemporary world where women *didn't* wear armor, such as \"primitive\" and \"war-like\" cultures in some forgotten corner of the world (Lost Race) or on another world entirely (Sword &amp; Planet). \n\nExamples skyrocket as the pulps proliferated throughout the 1920s and 30s, especially as science fiction and fantasy pulps like *Amazing, Wonder Stories,* and *Astounding* came into their own, as well as hardback novels and even films - *Tarzan the Tiger* (1929) for example contains an early precursor to Red Sonja's [chain-mail bikini](http://terrororstralis.com/films/photos/2901.jpg) - although the actual bikini would not be adopted until 1946, the idea of a chain, scale, or metal cup \"bra\" was clear even in the 1920s and 30s to pulp artists that wanted to show a little skin while remaining technically decent.\n\nThese later inspired comic books, the covers of science-fiction and fantasy novels, and roleplaying games... and for much the same reason they first appeared: the emphasis of the female form, and sometimes titillation.
