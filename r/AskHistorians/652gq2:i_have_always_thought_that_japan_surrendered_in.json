I never got round to editing it and am still unsure exactly what to do with it, so I decided to write up some more specific objections to Ward Wilson's argument in the linked text.  I will try to show that Ward Wilson takes a very specific line of argument.  To that end, I will leave some open questions rather than trying to give a comprehensive answer to the question asked by both OPs (a comprehensive answer can be found in the links above).  For the same reason, however, I don't think this constitutes a full answer and I will post it as a reply to yours rather than as a standalone post.  \n\n* \n\n&gt;Viewed from the Japanese perspective, the most important day in that second week of August wasn\u2019t Aug. 6 but Aug. 9. That was the day that the Supreme Council met \u2014 for the first time in the war \u2014 to discuss unconditional surrender. The Supreme Council was a group of six top members of the government \u2014 a sort of inner cabinet \u2014 that effectively ruled Japan in 1945. Japan\u2019s leaders had not seriously considered surrendering prior to that day.\n\nThe facts of this passage can be admitted.  However, the question broadly stated by Ward Wilson is was the bomb effective in securing surrender?  In this section, 'Timing', the argument seems to follow that because the Supreme War Council convened soon after the Soviet intervention but a while after the detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, the Hiroshima bomb was not effective in securing a Japanese surrender.  Now this is persuasive in the sense that there was a delay of three days and that the Americans (and I should say the Japanese population) would have been much happier if the Supreme War Council had convened sooner than August 9.  However, Ward Wilson entirely avoids the question of whether the Hiroshima bomb was out of mind for the intervening time or whether it was an important factor in the decision to surrender.  In short, he makes an argument about timing but relies *solely* on the passage of time; he does not look at what *happened* during that time.  This is particularly problematic because, as Sadao Asada notes, \"the Soviet entry came on the heels of the Hiroshima bomb, [so] it is hard to separate the impacts of the two events\" (49).\n\nNow according to Robert J. C. Butow the detonation of the Little Boy *was* important in the proceedings on August 9.  According to Butow in *Japan's Decision to Surrender*, the peace faction in the Japanese govenrment \"recognised in the atomic bomb and the Soviet entry into the war not just an imperative need to give in but actuallly a supreme opportunity to turn the tide against the die-hards and to shake the government loose from the yoke of military oppression under which it had been laboring so long\" (158).  Furthermore, Bustow notes how Togo had wanted the Supreme War Council to convene on August 8 - that is, *before* Soviet intervention.\n\nFinally, Bustow corroborates what I said in my previous post: even if the detonation of an atomic bomb over Hiroshima failed to have a \"shock\" effect, the prospect of a protracted campaign of atomic bombardment terrified the Japanese.  Bustow draws on reports from the United States Strategic Bombing Survey and the US Army's Military History Section to show that local governments were terrified of atomic bombing and that this compelled a Supreme War Council meeting before August 12 (160; the Japanese had been led to believe there would be another atomic bomb dropped on August 12).\n\nThe question necessarily is - were the atomic bombs important to the passage of proceedings and were they important in the war faction losing ground?  According to Bustow, yes; in conjunction with the intervention of the Soviet Union, the atomic bomb exposed Japan's powerlessness and this was an argument invoked frequently on the side of the peace faction.\n\nOne must be alert to the fact that Wilson's point about timing is geared very carefully towards the question of whether the atomic bomb was successful in getting the Japanese to *consider* peace.  For the purposes of whether it was effective in *achieving* peace, it should be noted that the Supreme War Council's meeting on August 9 might be a non-essential moment in the surrender of Japan.  For their failure to reach a conclusion led to a convention ordered by Hirohito, and it was this council of ministers and military officials that finally determined the shape of Japan's surrender.  If one answers questions pertaining to Japanese surrender based on the records of the 'Imperial Conference' (which gave its final decision August 15), the only answer can be yes, the atomic bomb was a factor in proceedings.\n\n&gt;It could not have been Nagasaki. The bombing of Nagasaki occurred in the late morning of Aug. 9, after the Supreme Council had already begun meeting to discuss surrender, and word of the bombing only reached Japan\u2019s leaders in the early afternoon \u2014 after the meeting of the Supreme Council had been adjourned in deadlock and the full cabinet had been called to take up the discussion.\n\nI believe that this is false.  The bombing of Nagasaki occured (by most estimates) within minutes of the Supreme War Council convening.  The only question remaining is whether the news reached the Council within the 3-4 hours that the meeting lasted.  As far as I know, it did.\n\n&gt;First, Hiroshima\u2019s governor reported to Tokyo on the very day Hiroshima was bombed that about a third of the population had been killed in the attack and that two thirds of the city had been destroyed. This information didn\u2019t change over the next several days. So the outcome \u2014 the end result of the bombing \u2014 was clear from the beginning. Japan\u2019s leaders knew roughly the outcome of the attack on the first day, yet they still did not act.\n\nThe Japanese knew that Hiroshima had been destroyed.  The government received that information from a variety of independent sources.  Moreover, there were many communication stations in Hiroshima that could not be reached because the atomic bomb had disabled them.  The fact that the Japanese leaders \"knew roughly the outcome of the attack\" is not contested.  However, as I argue in my linked post, this is not the same thing as knowing the importance of the bomb.  In the paper I cited in my previous post, the author follows the progress of the Army's nuclear science team to Hiroshima and their efforts to get a report back to the Supreme War Council.  The Supreme War Council simply did not believe that what they had been hit with was an atomic weapon.  Instead, they thought up many crack-pot alternatives such as the Americans conducting hundreds of flyovers and covering Hiroshima in a combustible material which they then sparked on the morning of the Hiroshima bombing.  Moreover, most of the general populace were unaware.  The editor of one of Japan's largest newspapers at the time said that both the authorities and the public had no clue as to what had hit Nagasaki or what countermeasures could be taken (Braw, 13).  The point is that even if the Japanese Supreme War Council knew the outcome, that is not the same as having the full picture.  One can argue, therefore, that the Hiroshima bomb was not immediately effective in securing surrender, but one must be careful to notice that Ward Wilson is avoiding the words 'They did not act on their knowledge of the atomic bomb'.  This is a common and subtle position that Ward Wilson takes; my concern is that someone might misread it to mean more than it does.\n\n&gt;We often imagine, because of the way the story is told, that the bombing of Hiroshima was far worse. We imagine that the number of people killed was off the charts. But if you graph the number of people killed in all 68 cities bombed in the summer of 1945, you find that Hiroshima was second in terms of civilian deaths. If you chart the number of square miles destroyed, you find that Hiroshima was fourth. If you chart the percentage of the city destroyed, Hiroshima was 17th. Hiroshima was clearly within the parameters of the conventional attacks carried out that summer.\n\nOnce again, Ward is repeating one of his subtler positions.  This argument about casualties is trotted out a lot.  A journalist called Tom Ham recently tabulated the casualty figures for the various bombing raids on Japan to show the unexceptional nature of Hiroshima and Nagasaki taken in terms of their casualty figures.  \n\nIt's important to remember that this is not the only metric by which military effectiveness is measured.  For example, and as I note in my previous post, the use of atomic bombs significantly reduced projected American casualties in the event of a sustained war.  Furthermore, Lawrence Freedman (in his Bible on nuclear weapons *The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy*) notes that an important motivation in developing a nuclear arsenal is that only one bomber has to break the enemy's anti-air defenses.  In short, any time the Americans wanted to carry out an atomic air raid, the Japanese would have one shot to stop it and one shot only.  This is without factoring in other things like the troubles with detecting a lone bomber.  \n\nWhether the Japanese military command did or did not notice the singularity of the atomic bomb as a military weapon is not a question I can answer, but it's also not one that Ward seems to engage with.  I will note in brief that General Anami, who Wilson cites, was perhaps the most fanatical man on the Supreme War Council who denied out of hand the prospect of protracted atomic bombardment.

If one answers questions pertaining to Japanese surrender based on the records of the &amp;#39;Imperial Conference&amp;#39; (which gave its final decision August 15), the only answer can be yes, the atomic bomb was a factor in proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It could not have been Nagasaki. The bombing of Nagasaki occurred in the late morning of Aug. 9, after the Supreme Council had already begun meeting to discuss surrender, and word of the bombing only reached Japan\u2019s leaders in the early afternoon \u2014 after the meeting of the Supreme Council had been adjourned in deadlock and the full cabinet had been called to take up the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that this is false.  The bombing of Nagasaki occured (by most estimates) within minutes of the Supreme War Council convening.  The only question remaining is whether the news reached the Council within the 3-4 hours that the meeting lasted.  As far as I know, it did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First, Hiroshima\u2019s governor reported to Tokyo on the very day Hiroshima was bombed that about a third of the population had been killed in the attack and that two thirds of the city had been destroyed. This information didn\u2019t change over the next several days. So the outcome \u2014 the end result of the bombing \u2014 was clear from the beginning. Japan\u2019s leaders knew roughly the outcome of the attack on the first day, yet they still did not act.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Japanese knew that Hiroshima had been destroyed.  The government received that information from a variety of independent sources.  Moreover, there were many communication stations in Hiroshima that could not be reached because the atomic bomb had disabled them.  The fact that the Japanese leaders &amp;quot;knew roughly the outcome of the attack&amp;quot; is not contested.  However, as I argue in my linked post, this is not the same thing as knowing the importance of the bomb.  In the paper I cited in my previous post, the author follows the progress of the Army&amp;#39;s nuclear science team to Hiroshima and their efforts to get a report back to the Supreme War Council.  The Supreme War Council simply did not believe that what they had been hit with was an atomic weapon.  Instead, they thought up many crack-pot alternatives such as the Americans conducting hundreds of flyovers and covering Hiroshima in a combustible material which they then sparked on the morning of the Hiroshima bombing.  Moreover, most of the general populace were unaware.  The editor of one of Japan&amp;#39;s largest newspapers at the time said that both the authorities and the public had no clue as to what had hit Nagasaki or what countermeasures could be taken (Braw, 13).  The point is that even if the Japanese Supreme War Council knew the outcome, that is not the same as having the full picture.  One can argue, therefore, that the Hiroshima bomb was not immediately effective in securing surrender, but one must be careful to notice that Ward Wilson is avoiding the words &amp;#39;They did not act on their knowledge of the atomic bomb&amp;#39;.  This is a common and subtle position that Ward Wilson takes; my concern is that someone might misread it to mean more than it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We often imagine, because of the way the story is told, that the bombing of Hiroshima was far worse. We imagine that the number of people killed was off the charts. But if you graph the number of people killed in all 68 cities bombed in the summer of 1945, you find that Hiroshima was second in terms of civilian deaths. If you chart the number of square miles destroyed, you find that Hiroshima was fourth. If you chart the percentage of the city destroyed, Hiroshima was 17th. Hiroshima was clearly within the parameters of the conventional attacks carried out that summer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once again, Ward is repeating one of his subtler positions.  This argument about casualties is trotted out a lot.  A journalist called Tom Ham recently tabulated the casualty figures for the various bombing raids on Japan to show the unexceptional nature of Hiroshima and Nagasaki taken in terms of their casualty figures.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to remember that this is not the only metric by which military effectiveness is measured.  For example, and as I note in my previous post, the use of atomic bombs significantly reduced projected American casualties in the event of a sustained war.  Furthermore, Lawrence Freedman (in his Bible on nuclear weapons &lt;em&gt;The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy&lt;/em&gt;) notes that an important motivation in developing a nuclear arsenal is that only one bomber has to break the enemy&amp;#39;s anti-air defenses.  In short, any time the Americans wanted to carry out an atomic air raid, the Japanese would have one shot to stop it and one shot only.  This is without factoring in other things like the troubles with detecting a lone bomber.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether the Japanese military command did or did not notice the singularity of the atomic bomb as a military weapon is not a question I can answer, but it&amp;#39;s also not one that Ward seems to engage with.  I will note in brief that General Anami, who Wilson cites, was perhaps the most fanatical man on the Supreme War Council who denied out of hand the prospect of protracted atomic bombardment. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg7bccs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492100693.0, "created_utc": 1492071893.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 183}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652gq2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652gq2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652gq2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652gq2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg88334", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Themisuel", "parent_id": "t1_dg7lvl6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I haven't seen that film but will keep an eye out for it.

This was because the communication lines were completely obliterated, therefore they had to send a team to inspect the situation and so the report was only confirmed on August 10 - after the decision was made. Thus, any claim of a causal link is highly tenuous.\n\nSecondly, as many have stated before, the annihilation of cities was nothing new as the incendiary bomb campaign was already devastating. The deaths of the firebombing campaign numbered 100,000 in the Tokyo campaign on March 9, not to mention the fact that sixty-six other cities were either demolished or partially demolished by the bombing campaign. Additionally, as stated above, the report had to be made by a surveying team hastily, meaning the information gathered was likely insufficient to truly comprehend the magnitude of the bomb.\n\nAlternatively, revisionist historians tend to look at the Soviet invasion as the cause of surrender. The communications between the Soviets and Japanese right before their surrender strongly suggest that the Soviet invasion was what really forced their surrender. While the atomic bomb came after the decision was made, there is a strong chronological chain that dictates the events of the Japanese being betrayed by the once-neutral Soviets until they chose surrender based on their communications. \n\nThe reason for this is because the Soviet incursion threatened more than just the lives of the Japanese, it threatened the sovereignty of their land. The Japanese feared that if they did not surrender immediately, they would lose \"not only Manchuria, Korea, and Karafuto, but also Hokkaido\" - a quote by Prime Minister Suzuki during the debate over surrender.\n\nTraditionalist historians like to argue that the atomic bomb had a major impact but one may find that this was fundamentally political in nature - both for Japanese and Americans.\n\nFor the Japanese, it was ultimately the best way for them to surrender while retaining their dignity and land. If they had claimed surrender because of the Soviets, they first admit that they lost the war fairly in military strength. Instead, blaming the atomic bomb allows them to claim it was because of some nearly otherworldly power that was comparable to the celestial might of their Emperor, which is cogent with the narrative of how the bomb was portrayed as a godlike weapon capable of wiping entire cities compared to the firebombing campaign which unarguably achieved far more.\n\nAdditionally, the Soviets would have far less negotiating power in the settlements that follow, benefitting both Japanese and Americans. As the Americans were claimed by the Japanese to be the cause of surrender, they would have first pickings in all negotiations with Japan. The Japanese knew that the Americans were far less pernicious than the Soviets in how they treated sovereign land, and so they opted to have them be their overlords rather than the expansionist Soviets. \n\nLastly, for the Americans, the atomic bomb was a show of force against the Soviets. The atomic bomb was a deterrence tool back then just as much as it is now, even more so as the Soviets had not yet developed their own. The political benefit of showing off their atomic bomb rendered a massive boost to the clout of America in any  negotiations; the bomb was a whiff of the strength of a global superpower. Thus, both sides sang the same tune because it was politically beneficial - and historians in the same vein sang along as well, supported by the governments and the documents they were to release.\n\nI've left out a great deal of the subtle details, but do trust me in echoing the views of the revisionists. The subtleties of the events that spanned that critical week or so leading up to surrender are absolutely damning to any and all implication that the atomic bomb was any cause for surrender.\n\nIf you're interested in further reading, Tsuyoshi Hasegawa is the man.

Thus, both sides sang the same tune because it was politically beneficial - and historians in the same vein sang along as well, supported by the governments and the documents they were to release.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve left out a great deal of the subtle details, but do trust me in echoing the views of the revisionists. The subtleties of the events that spanned that critical week or so leading up to surrender are absolutely damning to any and all implication that the atomic bomb was any cause for surrender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in further reading, Tsuyoshi Hasegawa is the man. Speaking English, Russian &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Japanese, he&amp;#39;s unmatched in his range of covered sources. What I write in this post is essentially me just summarising part of his narrative as far as I can, so you can consider him my main source (the book is Racing the Enemy, on mobile so it&amp;#39;s troublesome to copy-paste the full title)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg7bioy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492101221.0, "created_utc": 1492072421.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 76}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652gq2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652gq2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7f9ky", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DBHT14", "parent_id": "t1_dg7f3dk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A few things are wrong with that timeline. 1 is that the timing of Nagasaki was not fixed.
