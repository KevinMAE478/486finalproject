History courses in Secondary School focus mainly on Singapore, mainly adding in European history in the context of colonization or major world events (Nazism, communism, etc.)  Very little is taught about medieval Europe or the middle East.\n\nI'm Singaporean.  In Singapore, much of our primary school social studies education from Ages 7 to 12, is intended to indoctrinate young students into better understanding the multicultural society that is Singapore.  You can examine the Ministry of Education's syllabus for Primary School Social Studies [here.](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/syllabuses/humanities/files/social-studies-syllabus-2012-110615.pdf).  Just for fun, [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/syllabuses/character-citizenship-education/files/character-and-citizenship-education-\\(primary\\)-syllabus-\\(english\\).pdf) is the syllabus for the 'Character and Citizenship Education'.\n\nAs mentioned in the syllabus, Primary Five is meant to provide an overview of several ancient civilizations and their achievements:\n\n&gt;The Sumerians - Writing, Irrigation\n\n&gt;The Egyptians - Sun-dial, The Pyramids of Giza\n\n&gt;The Greeks - The Olympics, The Temple of Artemis\n\n&gt;The Romans - Roman Aqueduct, The Colosseum\n\nHowever, there is an entire section of the syllabus devoted to \"[how] the legacies of China and India influence our lives today\", which discusses common topics like the Huang He, ways of life in Ancient and modern China, Chinese technological inventions and the same things for the Indus Valley civilizations.  \n\nThen, in Primary Six, the social studies curriculum reorientates itself around Southeast Asia more specifically.  We learn about famous kingdoms in SEA, famous UNESCO sites, present day industries, etc.  \n\nAfter twelve year olds take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and are separated into different education tracks, the syllabuses begin to vary.  'Express' and 'Normal (Academic)' track students study history (who, what, when, where) focusing mainly on Asia.  Lower Secondary focuses on Singaporean history.  For example:\n\n&gt;Singapore and Asian Trade situation before the 14th century\n\n&gt;Rise of Temasek in the 14th century\n\n&gt;How was life different for the various people in colonial Singapore before World War Two?\n\n&gt;Singapore's connections with Melaka (15th to 16th centuries)\n\n&gt;Singapore's connections with the Johor-Riau Sultanate (16th to early 19th centuries)\n\n&gt;Singapore's connections with the Portuguese and Dutch (16th to early 19th centuries)\n\n&gt;British failure to defend Singapore\n\n&gt;Life under the Japanese\n\n&gt;Views of the British as rulers of Singapore\n\n&gt;British superiority\n\nOn the other hand, Upper Secondary focuses more on Europe, but only briefly in the context of colonization, WW2, and the Cold War.

", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: In Singapore, Primary School touches on the well-known ancient civilizations.  History courses in Secondary School focus mainly on Singapore, mainly adding in European history in the context of colonization or major world events (Nazism, communism, etc.)  Very little is taught about medieval Europe or the middle East.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m Singaporean.  In Singapore, much of our primary school social studies education from Ages 7 to 12, is intended to indoctrinate young students into better understanding the multicultural society that is Singapore.  You can examine the Ministry of Education&amp;#39;s syllabus for Primary School Social Studies &lt;a href=\"https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/syllabuses/humanities/files/social-studies-syllabus-2012-110615.pdf\"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;.

We learn about famous kingdoms in SEA, famous UNESCO sites, present day industries, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After twelve year olds take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and are separated into different education tracks, the syllabuses begin to vary.  &amp;#39;Express&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Normal (Academic)&amp;#39; track students study history (who, what, when, where) focusing mainly on Asia.

There are multiple boards which can be broadly classified into state boards and central boards. While the curriculum is similar state boards have a little more of that particular state history so treatment of other nations history might differ a bit. But Central boards are nationwide and hence can be a better generalization of what the students in the country are expected to know. Also, one difference from many other countries we have is that students specialize in grade 11 and 12th. So not everyone studies history there. Hence class 6th-10th is what everyone studies. However 9th-10th is often repeat of 6th-8th in detail.\n\nHistory starts with pre-historic period and quickly moves on to early civilization. Indus valley, Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Chinese civilization are taught. Then Early Vedic period, rise of Buddhism and Jainism, Magadha empire with passing mention of Alexander. Maurya Dynasty in detail. This includes greatest Ancient Indian ruler Ashoka. Decline of Jainism and Buddhism. Shakas and Satraps, Gupta Dynasty, Southern Kingdoms, Other Hindu Kingdoms until around 800 AD with detailed mention of Harsha. All this is part of ancient civilization and is taught in one year. In some of the state boards, especially southern there is more focus on southern kingdoms and their conquests.\n\n2nd year, 7th grade, is for medieval. Starts somewhere around invasions of Mahmud of Gazhni and Muhammad Gori. Formation of the slave dynasty followed by the rise and fall of various Delhi sultanates.

There are multiple boards which can be broadly classified into state boards and central boards. While the curriculum is similar state boards have a little more of that particular state history so treatment of other nations history might differ a bit. But Central boards are nationwide and hence can be a better generalization of what the students in the country are expected to know. Also, one difference from many other countries we have is that students specialize in grade 11 and 12th. So not everyone studies history there. Hence class 6th-10th is what everyone studies. However 9th-10th is often repeat of 6th-8th in detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;History starts with pre-historic period and quickly moves on to early civilization. Indus valley, Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Chinese civilization are taught. Then Early Vedic period, rise of Buddhism and Jainism, Magadha empire with passing mention of Alexander. Maurya Dynasty in detail. This includes greatest Ancient Indian ruler Ashoka. Decline of Jainism and Buddhism. Shakas and Satraps, Gupta Dynasty, Southern Kingdoms, Other Hindu Kingdoms until around 800 AD with detailed mention of Harsha. All this is part of ancient civilization and is taught in one year.
