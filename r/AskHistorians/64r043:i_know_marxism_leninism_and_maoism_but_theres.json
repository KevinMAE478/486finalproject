Mao considered the common people under capitalism to be inherently revolutionary, even if they didn't recognize it: their strikes, protests, riots, petitions, strikes, could and did make their governments listen, and change their policy. They were capable of making governments bow to their will if they felt like it. However, due to state ideology being reproduced as society's ideology (Althusser writes extensively about how governments can reproduce ideology to influence the majority of a society), the common people, despite being unconsciously revolutionary, do not consciously believe in revolution: therefore, while they have ideas about what they would like to change, they are accordingly watered-down, doubtful, \"this would be nice but I don't see it happening any time soon\" etc. \n\nThis is what the Mass Line is for. A Communist Party goes out among the people to collect these scattered, watered-down ideas, then re-convenes to discuss them. Filtering through a class-conscious, revolutionary mindset, they produce a political platform, and then take it back to the people for approval. If they've done their work correctly, the people will LOVE it and flock to the Communist Party with great enthusiasm. In so doing, The Mass Line (in theory at least) is how a Communist Party makes itself truly democratic and representative of the whole of the people. \n\n**People's War,** or Protracted People's War, is conceived as a more effective method of revolution for a Communist Party to carry out. The general idea is that, while Lenin and the Bolsheviks were able to make an all-or-nothing insurrection work out for them, Mao considered such a thing to be extremely unlikely to happen again. People's War was thought of as a means of a communist revolutionary force being able to both preserve its numbers as well as posing a significant threat to those they were attempting to overthrow. \n\nOn the surface, People's War has similarities to other kinds of guerrilla warfare, but on a theoretical level People's War is also a means of building a revolution's popularity among the people. The general idea is that, prior to a revolution, a Communist Party's goal is to serve the people: that is, to build what Lenin would call [dual power](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm), a revolutionary government which supplants the state in some areas, taking over the role of caregiver and building its legitimacy (and destroying that of the state's) in the areas in which it is active. When a Communist Party has built enough support, and with the support and backing of the people, it can then launch into an armed campaign, attacking government offices, police, army units, etc and seizing territory to establish as a revolutionary base area. \n\nPeople's War is divided into three phases: the strategic defensive, equilibrium, and strategic offensive, which are largely self-explanatory. The first objective of a people's war is to maintain its area of operations against the inevitable counterattack of the government it is revolting against. This will, of course, primarily be a defensive role. As the war continues, the revolutionary forces continue to serve the people within the bounds of where they operate so as to continue to grow their strength and grow the rebellion. The defensive becomes the equilibrium when it is thought the revolutionary forces have enough strength to begin testing the state, launching limited offensive actions to expand their territory, crush isolated or weak state forces, etc. And finally, the strategic offensive is when the balance of power is felt to be swinging in the revolutionary forces' favor, and the main push toward the major urban areas of the crumbling state begins. \n\nThe reason it's called a people's war is because it is waged by not just a revolutionary force, but by what is known as the [people's army.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch09.htm) The people's army is not just a guerrilla force, but an army of the working people: it runs hospitals, builds roads, bridges, schools, tills fields and harvests crops, assists the people via the Mass Line in doing political work, and employs the Mass Line in newly taken areas so as to help the people there to trust them. The goal is to make the army as indistinguishable from the common people as possible, to gain the people's trust and love so the army and the people are one and the same. For a practical example of what this looks like, see the Viet Cong.\n\n**New Democracy,** similarly to the Mass Line, is a means of organizing the Party. It consists of forming a coalition between the workers, peasants, common people, and proletarianized (i.e. poor, oppressed on some level, or otherwise revolutionary for whatever reason) sections of the bourgeoisie, with the proletariat firmly in the guiding role. The idea behind this was to help China advance rapidly from its semi-feudal conditions into socialism (common doctrine was they had to fully embrace capitalism first) by keeping portions of the bourgeoisie in the loop of the governing coalition. \n\n**Cultural Revolution** I did some explanation of in that post. Basically,  the Leninist (and therefore MZT) conception of the Communist Party is that it is a mass organization linking all of society together: the state, the workplace, and the wider social areas, via an all-democratic, all-accepting body which is open to anyone (as it is the sole legal governing political body anyway). Therefore, reactionary elements from the old regime - landlords, bourgeoisie, or those sympathetic to them - will also join it. Their economic means of dominance have been stripped from them because of the revolution, so they retreat to a government position to seek out political dominance, and steer country policy in such a way as to bring back a means of them accumulating capital (i.e. being capitalists again). These people Mao described as capitalist roaders, people who sought to commandeer the Communist Party and take it on a capitalist fork in the road as opposed to a socialist one. \n\nFrom Mao's point of view, it was capitalist roaders who took control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union following Stalin's death, and capitalist roaders in the Communist Party of China were the ones calling for him to be removed in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The former were why he thought it necessary to split with the Soviet Union, the latter he considered a direct threat to Chinese socialism (or, if you're more cynical, his own role in the Party). However, the key distinction is to note that, at this point in China, all was not yet lost: there was factionalism in the Party between its right (capitalist) and left (socialist) wings, both at a local and national level. There was still hope to right the ship, but what would be needed was a vast uprising by the people to retake control of their Party. This, in essence, is the theory behind Cultural Revolution: calling upon the people and the progressive wings of the government to launch a mass insurrection, to expel and harass the capitalist roaders, to once more assert their control over what is rightfully *their* Party, *their* government, *their* country, that they and their parents and grandparents shed their blood to achieve in the people's war. \n\nFrom a MZT and MLM perspective, the dangers of not having a Cultural Revolution (as in the USSR) or having a failed one (as in China, historically) are that roaders within the Party will have strength enough to launch capitalist-oriented reforms (as Kosygin, Brezhnev, and Deng did) and begin a gradual destruction of socialism. The roaders in the Party having the necessary strength to this essentially breaks the dictatorship of the proletariat, as the proletariat are no longer in control of the governing state apparatus, and while socialist relations of production may exist on lower levels of the Party and the society, the state apparatus is effectively capitalist, and therefore capable both of destroying socialism (as is argued happened under Gorbachev and Deng) as well as acting imperialist in interactions with other socialist nations or movements (as MLMs and some MZTs claim the Soviet Union was ['social-imperialist'](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.secondwave/cfb-su.htm) in, say, Afghanistan). \n\nFor further reading on the above, if you aren't opposed to reading documents from a Communist Party currently in existence, the Communist Party of the Philippines' (which follows MLM) 1992 document *Stand for Socialism against Modern Revisionism* describes the process of capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union once capitalist roaders had taken control of the CPSU.

In so doing, The Mass Line (in theory at least) is how a Communist Party makes itself truly democratic and representative of the whole of the people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People&amp;#39;s War,&lt;/strong&gt; or Protracted People&amp;#39;s War, is conceived as a more effective method of revolution for a Communist Party to carry out. The general idea is that, while Lenin and the Bolsheviks were able to make an all-or-nothing insurrection work out for them, Mao considered such a thing to be extremely unlikely to happen again. People&amp;#39;s War was thought of as a means of a communist revolutionary force being able to both preserve its numbers as well as posing a significant threat to those they were attempting to overthrow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the surface, People&amp;#39;s War has similarities to other kinds of guerrilla warfare, but on a theoretical level People&amp;#39;s War is also a means of building a revolution&amp;#39;s popularity among the people. The general idea is that, prior to a revolution, a Communist Party&amp;#39;s goal is to serve the people: that is, to build what Lenin would call &lt;a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm\"&gt;dual power&lt;/a&gt;, a revolutionary government which supplants the state in some areas, taking over the role of caregiver and building its legitimacy (and destroying that of the state&amp;#39;s) in the areas in which it is active. When a Communist Party has built enough support, and with the support and backing of the people, it can then launch into an armed campaign, attacking government offices, police, army units, etc and seizing territory to establish as a revolutionary base area. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People&amp;#39;s War is divided into three phases: the strategic defensive, equilibrium, and strategic offensive, which are largely self-explanatory. The first objective of a people&amp;#39;s war is to maintain its area of operations against the inevitable counterattack of the government it is revolting against. This will, of course, primarily be a defensive role. As the war continues, the revolutionary forces continue to serve the people within the bounds of where they operate so as to continue to grow their strength and grow the rebellion. The defensive becomes the equilibrium when it is thought the revolutionary forces have enough strength to begin testing the state, launching limited offensive actions to expand their territory, crush isolated or weak state forces, etc. And finally, the strategic offensive is when the balance of power is felt to be swinging in the revolutionary forces&amp;#39; favor, and the main push toward the major urban areas of the crumbling state begins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason it&amp;#39;s called a people&amp;#39;s war is because it is waged by not just a revolutionary force, but by what is known as the &lt;a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch09.htm\"&gt;people&amp;#39;s army.&lt;/a&gt; The people&amp;#39;s army is not just a guerrilla force, but an army of the working people: it runs hospitals, builds roads, bridges, schools, tills fields and harvests crops, assists the people via the Mass Line in doing political work, and employs the Mass Line in newly taken areas so as to help the people there to trust them. The goal is to make the army as indistinguishable from the common people as possible, to gain the people&amp;#39;s trust and love so the army and the people are one and the same. For a practical example of what this looks like, see the Viet Cong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Democracy,&lt;/strong&gt; similarly to the Mass Line, is a means of organizing the Party. It consists of forming a coalition between the workers, peasants, common people, and proletarianized (i.e. poor, oppressed on some level, or otherwise revolutionary for whatever reason) sections of the bourgeoisie, with the proletariat firmly in the guiding role. The idea behind this was to help China advance rapidly from its semi-feudal conditions into socialism (common doctrine was they had to fully embrace capitalism first) by keeping portions of the bourgeoisie in the loop of the governing coalition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Revolution&lt;/strong&gt; I did some explanation of in that post. Basically,  the Leninist (and therefore MZT) conception of the Communist Party is that it is a mass organization linking all of society together: the state, the workplace, and the wider social areas, via an all-democratic, all-accepting body which is open to anyone (as it is the sole legal governing political body anyway). Therefore, reactionary elements from the old regime - landlords, bourgeoisie, or those sympathetic to them - will also join it. Their economic means of dominance have been stripped from them because of the revolution, so they retreat to a government position to seek out political dominance, and steer country policy in such a way as to bring back a means of them accumulating capital (i.e. being capitalists again). These people Mao described as capitalist roaders, people who sought to commandeer the Communist Party and take it on a capitalist fork in the road as opposed to a socialist one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From Mao&amp;#39;s point of view, it was capitalist roaders who took control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union following Stalin&amp;#39;s death, and capitalist roaders in the Communist Party of China were the ones calling for him to be removed in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The former were why he thought it necessary to split with the Soviet Union, the latter he considered a direct threat to Chinese socialism (or, if you&amp;#39;re more cynical, his own role in the Party). However, the key distinction is to note that, at this point in China, all was not yet lost: there was factionalism in the Party between its right (capitalist) and left (socialist) wings, both at a local and national level. There was still hope to right the ship, but what would be needed was a vast uprising by the people to retake control of their Party. This, in essence, is the theory behind Cultural Revolution: calling upon the people and the progressive wings of the government to launch a mass insurrection, to expel and harass the capitalist roaders, to once more assert their control over what is rightfully &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; Party, &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; government, &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; country, that they and their parents and grandparents shed their blood to achieve in the people&amp;#39;s war. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From a MZT and MLM perspective, the dangers of not having a Cultural Revolution (as in the USSR) or having a failed one (as in China, historically) are that roaders within the Party will have strength enough to launch capitalist-oriented reforms (as Kosygin, Brezhnev, and Deng did) and begin a gradual destruction of socialism. The roaders in the Party having the necessary strength to this essentially breaks the dictatorship of the proletariat, as the proletariat are no longer in control of the governing state apparatus, and while socialist relations of production may exist on lower levels of the Party and the society, the state apparatus is effectively capitalist, and therefore capable both of destroying socialism (as is argued happened under Gorbachev and Deng) as well as acting imperialist in interactions with other socialist nations or movements (as MLMs and some MZTs claim the Soviet Union was &lt;a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.secondwave/cfb-su.htm\"&gt;&amp;#39;social-imperialist&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; in, say, Afghanistan). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For further reading on the above, if you aren&amp;#39;t opposed to reading documents from a Communist Party currently in existence, the Communist Party of the Philippines&amp;#39; (which follows MLM) 1992 document &lt;em&gt;Stand for Socialism against Modern Revisionism&lt;/em&gt; describes the process of capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union once capitalist roaders had taken control of the CPSU. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg61f76", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492040453.0, "created_utc": 1492011653.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5jhpi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tim_mcdaniel", "parent_id": "t1_dg4xjed", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; People's War, New Democracy, the Mass Line, and Cultural Revolution\n\nYour links point at papers, which is great for sourcing but not adapted to a quick briefing.

The contention as to whether Mao Zedong Thought (MZT) is a true continuation of Marxism-Leninism, and whether Marxism-Leninism-Maoism (MLM) is a universal improvement over MZT and the rest of Marxism, is still very much debated today, the latter particularly between MLM revolutionary groups currently in existence and the Chinese government, which claims MZT-DXT (see below for explanation).** \n\nIn terms of significance to the development of Marxist theory, Mao Zedong Thought is considered by its proponents to be the true continuation of Marxism-Leninism, as Mao added four key contributions to Marxist theory which made him a veritable ideological titan: [The Mass Line,](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch11.htm) [Protracted People's War,](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch08.htm) [New Democracy,](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_26.htm) and - most critically and certainly most controversially - [the idea of Cultural Revolution,](https://www.marxists.org/subject/china/peking-review/1966/PR1966-26j.htm) and more generally, the idea that [capitalist roaders within the Communist Party will attempt to use the Party's power to reinstate capitalism.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch03.htm) The latter was Mao's entire justification both for breaking with the Soviets as well as launching the Cultural Revolution, claiming that the right-wing of first the CPSU, and then the CPC, were taking their respective countries off the path toward socialism and communism and back toward capitalism. Proponents of Mao Zedong Thought therefore consider Mao a continuation of ML as, from their point of view, he recognized the need to criticize the flaws in the Soviet government and the right-wing of the Chinese government, and was able to formulate theory for what to do in case of a revisionist take-over. Furthermore, MZT proponents point to the subsequent market-oriented reforms in the Soviet Union (Kosygin and Gorbachev) and in China (Deng) as evidence that Mao was correct in his prediction of corruption and roaderism within the Communist Parties.\n\nAnd finally, we come to more or less the contemporary situation in communist movements worldwide, with one more major split left: the split of the followers of Mao Zedong Thought after Mao's death. As mentioned, they viewed Mao as the true continuation of Marxism-Leninism because of the four major principles he added onto it. However, the sheer extent to which he was significant was soon to become a point of contention after his death. More moderate followers of MZT, as well as revisionist MLs, believed Mao was an extension of Marxism-Leninism to China's material conditions and unique situation and that was it, that many of his later decisions were errors. However, the more left wing of proponents of MZT saw something more to his contributions - believing that his additions to Marxist theory were so important that they were effectively an entirely new stage of Marxism, invalidating and outdating everything which came before it. These soon broke off from the label of MZT entirely, preferring to call their new ideology Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, or MLM. Notable proponents of MLM include Shining Path in Peru, the Naxalites in India, the revolutionaries in Nepal who won a civil war in 2006, and the New People's Army of the Philippines. \n\nConfusingly, today it is technically correct only to refer to followers of MLM as \"Maoists\", while followers of MZT prefer being called Marxist-Leninists; however, during Mao's lifetime and especially between the Sino-Soviet Split and his death, MZT and Maoism referred to the same thing. Followers of MLM uphold all of Mao's contributions (the four I listed above - People's War, New Democracy, the Mass Line, and Cultural Revolution] as universal advancements of Marxist theory which could be applied anywhere and succeed, while in addition considering the Soviet Union post-Stalin to have restored capitalism at a state level via capitalist roadery and therefore acted in an imperialist manner in opposing American imperialism, the Soviets being dubbed \"social-imperialists\". And finally, the Chinese government today claims MZT, but tacks on \"Deng Xiaoping Theory\" (MZT-DXT) as a reflection of the path they've taken since Mao's death. So there are three competitors claiming to be successors to MZT: \n\n* the Chinese government, who claim MZT-DXT; \n\n* Marxist-Leninists who claim MZT, but see the Chinese government as revisionist; \n\n* Marxist-Leninist-Maoists, who believe you cannot be MZT without being MLM, and believe non-MLMs and the Chinese government are both revisionist. \n\nSo, to do one final recap: \n\n* Marxism splits into Leninism and Left-Communism. \n* Leninism splits into Marxism-Leninism and Trotskyism. \n* Marxism-Leninism splits into Revisionist ML (ala the Soviets post-Stalin), Mao Zedong Thought/MZT, and Anti-Revisionist ML (ala Hoxha's Albania). \n* MZT splits into MZT-DXT (ala China today), ML-MZT (ala MLs today), and MLM. \n\nSo, in short, communist sub-ideologies are extremely varied. Marxist-Leninists of various varieties still make up the majority of the world's communists today, likely with Trotskyists and MLMs tied for second.

The contention as to whether Mao Zedong Thought (MZT) is a true continuation of Marxism-Leninism, and whether Marxism-Leninism-Maoism (MLM) is a universal improvement over MZT and the rest of Marxism, is still very much debated today, the latter particularly between MLM revolutionary groups currently in existence and the Chinese government, which claims MZT-DXT (see below for explanation).&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of significance to the development of Marxist theory, Mao Zedong Thought is considered by its proponents to be the true continuation of Marxism-Leninism, as Mao added four key contributions to Marxist theory which made him a veritable ideological titan: &lt;a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch11.htm\"&gt;The Mass Line,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch08.htm\"&gt;Protracted People&amp;#39;s War,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_26.htm\"&gt;New Democracy,&lt;/a&gt; and - most critically and certainly most controversially - &lt;a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/subject/china/peking-review/1966/PR1966-26j.htm\"&gt;the idea of Cultural Revolution,&lt;/a&gt; and more generally, the idea that &lt;a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch03.htm\"&gt;capitalist roaders within the Communist Party will attempt to use the Party&amp;#39;s power to reinstate capitalism.&lt;/a&gt; The latter was Mao&amp;#39;s entire justification both for breaking with the Soviets as well as launching the Cultural Revolution, claiming that the right-wing of first the CPSU, and then the CPC, were taking their respective countries off the path toward socialism and communism and back toward capitalism. Proponents of Mao Zedong Thought therefore consider Mao a continuation of ML as, from their point of view, he recognized the need to criticize the flaws in the Soviet government and the right-wing of the Chinese government, and was able to formulate theory for what to do in case of a revisionist take-over. Furthermore, MZT proponents point to the subsequent market-oriented reforms in the Soviet Union (Kosygin and Gorbachev) and in China (Deng) as evidence that Mao was correct in his prediction of corruption and roaderism within the Communist Parties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, we come to more or less the contemporary situation in communist movements worldwide, with one more major split left: the split of the followers of Mao Zedong Thought after Mao&amp;#39;s death. As mentioned, they viewed Mao as the true continuation of Marxism-Leninism because of the four major principles he added onto it. However, the sheer extent to which he was significant was soon to become a point of contention after his death. More moderate followers of MZT, as well as revisionist MLs, believed Mao was an extension of Marxism-Leninism to China&amp;#39;s material conditions and unique situation and that was it, that many of his later decisions were errors. However, the more left wing of proponents of MZT saw something more to his contributions - believing that his additions to Marxist theory were so important that they were effectively an entirely new stage of Marxism, invalidating and outdating everything which came before it. These soon broke off from the label of MZT entirely, preferring to call their new ideology Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, or MLM. Notable proponents of MLM include Shining Path in Peru, the Naxalites in India, the revolutionaries in Nepal who won a civil war in 2006, and the New People&amp;#39;s Army of the Philippines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Confusingly, today it is technically correct only to refer to followers of MLM as &amp;quot;Maoists&amp;quot;, while followers of MZT prefer being called Marxist-Leninists; however, during Mao&amp;#39;s lifetime and especially between the Sino-Soviet Split and his death, MZT and Maoism referred to the same thing. Followers of MLM uphold all of Mao&amp;#39;s contributions (the four I listed above - People&amp;#39;s War, New Democracy, the Mass Line, and Cultural Revolution] as universal advancements of Marxist theory which could be applied anywhere and succeed, while in addition considering the Soviet Union post-Stalin to have restored capitalism at a state level via capitalist roadery and therefore acted in an imperialist manner in opposing American imperialism, the Soviets being dubbed &amp;quot;social-imperialists&amp;quot;. And finally, the Chinese government today claims MZT, but tacks on &amp;quot;Deng Xiaoping Theory&amp;quot; (MZT-DXT) as a reflection of the path they&amp;#39;ve taken since Mao&amp;#39;s death. So there are three competitors claiming to be successors to MZT: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Chinese government, who claim MZT-DXT; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marxist-Leninists who claim MZT, but see the Chinese government as revisionist; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marxist-Leninist-Maoists, who believe you cannot be MZT without being MLM, and believe non-MLMs and the Chinese government are both revisionist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, to do one final recap: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Marxism splits into Leninism and Left-Communism. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leninism splits into Marxism-Leninism and Trotskyism. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Marxism-Leninism splits into Revisionist ML (ala the Soviets post-Stalin), Mao Zedong Thought/MZT, and Anti-Revisionist ML (ala Hoxha&amp;#39;s Albania). &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;MZT splits into MZT-DXT (ala China today), ML-MZT (ala MLs today), and MLM. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, in short, communist sub-ideologies are extremely varied. Marxist-Leninists of various varieties still make up the majority of the world&amp;#39;s communists today, likely with Trotskyists and MLMs tied for second. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg4xjed", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491973861.0, "created_utc": 1491945061.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 126}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64r043", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5pn81", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "orgyofdolphins", "parent_id": "t1_dg4xj69", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think Gramsci is a left-com.

That said, I'll try and present things as objectively as possible. \n\nRight, so let's start with the most basic unifying word for all these ideologies: communism itself. Communism as an ideology is divided into two main trends: the Marxist trend, and the anarchist trend. This was what split the original First International, the IWA, in the late 19th century, was factionalism between the Marxist and anarchist factions, and they are largely distinct from each other. Marxists believe that socialism (and subsequently communism) must come from a dictatorship of the proletariat, i.e. a society in which the proletariat are the dominant class, to the same extent that the bourgeoisie control society under capitalism, and all the legal and extralegal means that may imply. It should be noted that Marxism is [explicitly authoritarian,](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm) going all the way back to Marx and Engels themselves. Anarchism, meanwhile, believes that a communist revolution ought to abolish the state immediately and transition into full-blown communism with no dictatorship of the proletariat or socialism in-between, holding that all power is inherently bad (whereas Marxists see power as a tool to be used for good or for bad). \n\nAs your question is about Marxism, I'll solely address Marxism now. Marxism was largely unified pre-WWI, a largely theoretical ideology which had next to no experience being implemented on a mass scale in a revolutionary scenario. And then the Russian revolution, and international reactions to it, happened. Marxism's first major split was around the late 1910s and early 1920s: from this split we get Leninism and Left-Communism. Leninism is largely self-explanatory, based on the writings of Lenin and Trotsky (who were both leaders of the Russian revolution, but by no means similar - but we'll get to that). Left-Communism is made up of a variety of internal tendencies of its own, all loosely held together by the common belief that the Russian revolution was overall positive; that the formation of Soviets was the correct approach to make in terms of organizing the proletariat; but that the authoritarianism of Lenin's government was wrong. Lenin *detested* Left-Communists, to the extent that he wrote an entire work [essentially calling them whiny children.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/) Notable internal tendencies in Left-Communism include Luxemburgism, based on the writings of Polish-German revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg, and Council Communism, as well as the writings of Italian revolutionaries Antonio Gramsci and Amadeo Bordiga. \n\nSo, to recap, thus far Marxism has divided into Leninism and Left-Communism, and we've briefly explored the internal divisions of Left-Communism. Now, onto the divisions of Leninism. \n\nLeninism split with Lenin's death in 1924 into Marxism-Leninism and Trotskyism (some Trotskyists call themselves \"Bolshevik-Leninists\" as opposed to \"Marxist-Leninists\"). Marxism-Leninism was Stalin's tendency, and indeed would go on to become the guiding ideology of the entirety of the Eastern Bloc (and China, Vietnam, Laos, and Cuba still claim Marxism-Leninism as their guiding ideology to this day), and consisted essentially 95% of Lenin's writings as well Stalin's own comparatively minor additions: these being, Socialism In One Country, and the Marxist approach to the question of national liberation, and the right of oppressed peoples and nations to self-determination. Stalin did not ever claim to be building something new off of Lenin's ideals, but simply following Lenin's ideals. If you'd like an introduction to Marxism-Leninism, Stalin's [Foundations of Leninism](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1924/foundations-leninism/) essentially outlines Marxism-Leninism very well. Trotskyism, meanwhile, was based more off the ideals of Trotsky, who had formerly been a Menshevik before joining the Bolsheviks, whereas Lenin had always been a Bolshevik. Whereas Marxism-Leninism called for a socialist state to develop itself and build proletarian consciousness via economic development of the means of production (i.e. Five-Year Plans, collectivization of agriculture, etc), Trotskyism focused more on spreading the revolution immediately after victory in one country. A common Trotskyist critique of the Soviet Union under Stalin was that a \"bureaucratic class\" came to dominate the Soviet government rather than the workers; a Marxist-Leninist (and any derivative) rebuttal would be that bureaucracy is not an economic class, as it is not a relation to production, and that bureaucrats were still technically workers, just of a different sub-category than industrial proletarians. \n\nTo briefly tackle internal divisions of Trotskyism, well...there are *many.* An often-repeated cliche of Trotskyists is that they always split off from one another due to internal factional disputes, much as they did from the Comintern. Keeping track of Trotskyist organizations and their relations (and animosity) toward each other boggles the mind. I'll leave a [simple chart](https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/trees/trotchart2.jpg) to explain my point. Trotskyists believe the Soviet Union was only socialist while Lenin was in charge, and have a variety of terms to describe it under Stalin and onward: the most common are \"state-capitalist\", \"bureaucratic-collectivist\", and \"degenerated worker's state\". The proponents of each also disagree with the others. \n\nSo again, to recap: Marxism splits into Leninism and Left-Communism. Leninism splits into Marxism-Leninism and Trotskyism. We've explored the breakdowns of Left-Communism and Trotskyism, so let's keep going down the line here. \n\nAs mentioned, Marxism-Leninism went on to become the largest and most well-known communist ideology out there for its role as the officially listed governing ideology of the entirety of the Eastern Bloc. After WWII and into the beginning of the Cold War, to be a socialist state was to claim allegiance to Marxism-Leninism. This would change, however, after Stalin's death and the rise of Khrushchev in the 1950s. During his secret speech in 1956, Khrushchev denounced Stalin; in response, Mao soon took to calling Khrushchev [a phony communist.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/1964/phnycom.htm) By the late 1960s, the ideological gap between the Soviet Union and China was so great that they officially severed ties, thus also splitting Marxism-Leninism, to which they both claimed to be the true successors. Soviet government ideology is typically referred to (by critics at least) as Revisionist Marxism-Leninism, alternatively Khrushchevism or Brezhnevism (as your OP states), while Chinese government ideology came to be known as Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, or simply Mao Zedong Thought (or MZT for short). Enver Hoxha, leader of socialist Albania, was perhaps the most prominent third party to all this: initially aligning with Mao in the split, he soon split with Mao as well, adding a third variety of Marxism-Leninism to the mix, known as Anti-Revisionist Marxism-Leninism, or simply Anti-Revisionism. \n\n ", "edited": 1491945644.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1/2]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;ve put in my other answers regarding communism, full disclosure, I am answering this question both as a historian and a communist, and if the mods feel that there is a conflict of interest in my post, I completely understand if they feel inclined to take it down.

Enver Hoxha, leader of socialist Albania, was perhaps the most prominent third party to all this: initially aligning with Mao in the split, he soon split with Mao as well, adding a third variety of Marxism-Leninism to the mix, known as Anti-Revisionist Marxism-Leninism, or simply Anti-Revisionism. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg4xj69", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491973854.0, "created_utc": 1491945054.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 160}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64r043", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4m79l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t3_64r043", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "name": "t1_dg4m79l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491961414.0, "created_utc": 1491932614.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64r043", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4rq41", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WeAreAllGeth", "parent_id": "t3_64r043", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It seems there was a relevant [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16se3w/what_are_the_discernible_differences_between_the/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=AskHistorians) about this listed in the FAQ, and a neat reply [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16se3w/what_are_the_discernible_differences_between_the/c7z25b6/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=AskHistorians) by /u/yodatsracist.", "edited": 1491938940.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems there was a relevant &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16se3w/what_are_the_discernible_differences_between_the/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=AskHistorians\"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;
