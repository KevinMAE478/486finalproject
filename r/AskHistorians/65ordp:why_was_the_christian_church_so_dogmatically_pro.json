A complete answer would take up a book, so here are a few points that I think will help explain the phenomenon, as well as its limitations. The quick answer is that Christian thinkers are/were far from dogmatically Aristotelian, but that his appeal has a lot to do with the origins of Christianity and the questions it was facing when Aristotle was reintroduced.\n\n1. The groundwork for Aristotle as a companion to Christian thought is laid first by Platonism, or really, Neoplatonism, which we can insufficiently describe as Plato\u2019s philosophy with some mysticism attached, courtesy of Plotinus. Neoplatonism was very popular among early church thinkers, particularly Origen, Cyril of Alexandria, and the Cappadocian Fathers (Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus). Augustine of Hippo was heavily influenced by Neoplatonism, and as one of the most foundational thinkers for Western Christian thought, he is a major place where it is retained. Neoplatonism was popular for being a philosophy which held a strong view of divine unity in its notion the One, or the Good, and who had an appealing cosmology (understanding of how the universe was ordered with respect to divinity) which permitted a notion of a single, omnipotent creator and redeemer of the world. It also has a concept of the *logos* (Greek: word) which St. John applies to Christ in his gospel and letters. Of course, it was not a perfect fit, and many of its proponents could be critical as well, but it was still a philosophical school with a lot to offer a budding religion in search of intellectual *bona fides*. More could be said here (again, think of the book that I\u2019m not writing); what is important to note is that many early Christian thinkers are heavily influenced by Plato, and even though Aristotle and Plato have essential differences, much of what they share in common (well, sort of in common) is going to be what appeals to later Christian thinkers. \n\n2. The Aristotle and Plato you know are not the ones most Christians in history have known, due to large body of works which were once attributed to them but are now known to be *pseudepigrapha*, or falsely attributed writings. The problem of pseudoepigraha is not limited to Aristotle and Plato. At the time of the late Medieval period, more pseudo-Augustine than genuine was read, and biblical scholars have determined that some of the New Testament epistles attributed to Paul are not genuine. Still, it is important to recognize that the Aristotle of the Middle Ages is not the Aristotle of today is not the Aristotle that once lived, whoever he might have been. Adding to this is the fact that Aristotle and Plato were reintroduced to the West around the 12th century. So rather than being a constant, explicit influence, Aristotle comes back onto the scene as something new but also something strangely familiar. \n\n3. While early Christians found Plato appealing because of his concept of the One or the Good and subsequent cosmology, Aristotle was appealing to medieval Christian thinkers, in part, because of his metaphysics. A brief summary: Aristotle held a distinction between what we will call *essences* and *accidents*. To understand this, imagine a cup: it has a certain color, shape, height, size, etc. Maybe it has a handle, maybe a lid. Its accidents are all those things you could use to distinguish it from other cups or all those things about it which you could change without it ceasing to be a cup. For example, you could take a red cup, paint it green, and it would still be a cup. The essence of a cup is harder to define, because it is that which all cups have in common, a sort of ideal \u201ccup-ness\u201d in which all cups participate. It is that which makes the cup a cup. Now, we might think this a weird thing for Christian to get excited about, except when we remember that the Eucharist has become more and more the center of Christian worship in the West. Here we have bread and wine which are said to be the body and blood of Jesus, though they still appear to be bread and wine to every bodily sense. Aristotelian metaphysics provided a way to make sense of how the bread and wine could become the body and blood of Christ while still retaining all the appearances of bread and wine to the senses. This explanation is commonly known as *transubstantiation*, and its proponents argue that in the Eucharist the while the accidents of bread and wine are retained, the essences of bread and wine are removed and replaced with the essences of body and blood. Thus you have a substance which in accident appears to be bread and wine but in essence is the body and blood of Christ. What is great about this is that not only does it explain *how* the Eucharist is what it is, but it also explains how it is a *miracle.* For you see, in nature we never find essences changing while accidents remain the same, which is what happens in transubstantiation. You have accidents change all the time while essences remain unchanged (think about painting the cup), and you have both accidents and essences changing (think now about burning a cup to ash; it is no longer a cup in either accident or essence), but never do you have the accidents remaining unaffected when essences are changed. So, in sum, Aristotelian metaphysics allowed medieval Christian thinkers to settle the question of what happened in the Eucharist that both explained the experienced reality and retained the miraculous status. Pretty exciting, right? The thinker who is best known for this fusion the Angelic Doctor, Thomas Aquinas, best known for his systematic theology, the *Summa theologiae*. \n\n4. The place of Aristotelian thought in Christianity has been hotly disputed, often for the reason your question indicates. The doctrine of transubstantiation was always controversial, even before the Reformation, where Aristotle would find his most notable opponent in Martin Luther. Luther\u2019s philosophical background could be best described as nominalist, and he had a strong dislike of scholastic thought (chiefly Aquinas and those following him). One basic difference between a nominalist and and an Aristotelian lies in whether or not one essences have their own, independent reality. For Aristotelians, they did, while for nominalists, they did not. To understand this difference in thought, consider the difference between bullion and a banknote as currency. The value of bullion is inherent to its material: it\u2019s worth is not merely ascribed to it but inherent to the metal of which it consists. The value of a banknote, however, is not inherent to its materials: a hundred dollar bill is worth far more than the paper and ink used to print it, whereas a penny is actually worth *less* than the materials it is made with. Nominalists viewed essences is the same way as we understand the value of a banknote: they are not inherent to it but merely ascribed or named, hence *nomen* (Latin: name) -alism. Beyond philosophical differences (which were not as huge for Luther anyway), he objected to what he saw as the dependence of Christian thought on pagan philosophy which was only used to strip away what should properly be a mystery about the Eucharist. Luther\u2019s objection is part of his strong emphasis on the divine *Logos* or Word, which I won't go into here except to note ironically that the *Logos* is a Neoplatonic concept, although again it is also thoroughly Christian. There are other objects to Aristotle, but Luther is a fairly good (and important) example that is helpful to see how Christianity is not monolithic in its thought.\n\nI hope this helps!

It also has a concept of the &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt; (Greek: word) which St. John applies to Christ in his gospel and letters. Of course, it was not a perfect fit, and many of its proponents could be critical as well, but it was still a philosophical school with a lot to offer a budding religion in search of intellectual &lt;em&gt;bona fides&lt;/em&gt;. More could be said here (again, think of the book that I\u2019m not writing); what is important to note is that many early Christian thinkers are heavily influenced by Plato, and even though Aristotle and Plato have essential differences, much of what they share in common (well, sort of in common) is going to be what appeals to later Christian thinkers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Aristotle and Plato you know are not the ones most Christians in history have known, due to large body of works which were once attributed to them but are now known to be &lt;em&gt;pseudepigrapha&lt;/em&gt;, or falsely attributed writings. The problem of pseudoepigraha is not limited to Aristotle and Plato. At the time of the late Medieval period, more pseudo-Augustine than genuine was read, and biblical scholars have determined that some of the New Testament epistles attributed to Paul are not genuine. Still, it is important to recognize that the Aristotle of the Middle Ages is not the Aristotle of today is not the Aristotle that once lived, whoever he might have been. Adding to this is the fact that Aristotle and Plato were reintroduced to the West around the 12th century. So rather than being a constant, explicit influence, Aristotle comes back onto the scene as something new but also something strangely familiar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While early Christians found Plato appealing because of his concept of the One or the Good and subsequent cosmology, Aristotle was appealing to medieval Christian thinkers, in part, because of his metaphysics. A brief summary: Aristotle held a distinction between what we will call &lt;em&gt;essences&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;accidents&lt;/em&gt;. To understand this, imagine a cup: it has a certain color, shape, height, size, etc. Maybe it has a handle, maybe a lid. Its accidents are all those things you could use to distinguish it from other cups or all those things about it which you could change without it ceasing to be a cup. For example, you could take a red cup, paint it green, and it would still be a cup. The essence of a cup is harder to define, because it is that which all cups have in common, a sort of ideal \u201ccup-ness\u201d in which all cups participate. It is that which makes the cup a cup. Now, we might think this a weird thing for Christian to get excited about, except when we remember that the Eucharist has become more and more the center of Christian worship in the West. Here we have bread and wine which are said to be the body and blood of Jesus, though they still appear to be bread and wine to every bodily sense. Aristotelian metaphysics provided a way to make sense of how the bread and wine could become the body and blood of Christ while still retaining all the appearances of bread and wine to the senses. This explanation is commonly known as &lt;em&gt;transubstantiation&lt;/em&gt;, and its proponents argue that in the Eucharist the while the accidents of bread and wine are retained, the essences of bread and wine are removed and replaced with the essences of body and blood. Thus you have a substance which in accident appears to be bread and wine but in essence is the body and blood of Christ. What is great about this is that not only does it explain &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the Eucharist is what it is, but it also explains how it is a &lt;em&gt;miracle.&lt;/em&gt; For you see, in nature we never find essences changing while accidents remain the same, which is what happens in transubstantiation. You have accidents change all the time while essences remain unchanged (think about painting the cup), and you have both accidents and essences changing (think now about burning a cup to ash; it is no longer a cup in either accident or essence), but never do you have the accidents remaining unaffected when essences are changed. So, in sum, Aristotelian metaphysics allowed medieval Christian thinkers to settle the question of what happened in the Eucharist that both explained the experienced reality and retained the miraculous status. Pretty exciting, right? The thinker who is best known for this fusion the Angelic Doctor, Thomas Aquinas, best known for his systematic theology, the &lt;em&gt;Summa theologiae&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The place of Aristotelian thought in Christianity has been hotly disputed, often for the reason your question indicates. The doctrine of transubstantiation was always controversial, even before the Reformation, where Aristotle would find his most notable opponent in Martin Luther. Luther\u2019s philosophical background could be best described as nominalist, and he had a strong dislike of scholastic thought (chiefly Aquinas and those following him). One basic difference between a nominalist and and an Aristotelian lies in whether or not one essences have their own, independent reality. For Aristotelians, they did, while for nominalists, they did not. To understand this difference in thought, consider the difference between bullion and a banknote as currency. The value of bullion is inherent to its material: it\u2019s worth is not merely ascribed to it but inherent to the metal of which it consists. The value of a banknote, however, is not inherent to its materials: a hundred dollar bill is worth far more than the paper and ink used to print it, whereas a penny is actually worth &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than the materials it is made with. Nominalists viewed essences is the same way as we understand the value of a banknote: they are not inherent to it but merely ascribed or named, hence &lt;em&gt;nomen&lt;/em&gt; (Latin: name) -alism. Beyond philosophical differences (which were not as huge for Luther anyway), he objected to what he saw as the dependence of Christian thought on pagan philosophy which was only used to strip away what should properly be a mystery about the Eucharist. Luther\u2019s objection is part of his strong emphasis on the divine &lt;em&gt;Logos&lt;/em&gt; or Word, which I won&amp;#39;t go into here except to note ironically that the &lt;em&gt;Logos&lt;/em&gt; is a Neoplatonic concept, although again it is also thoroughly Christian. There are other objects to Aristotle, but Luther is a fairly good (and important) example that is helpful to see how Christianity is not monolithic in its thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps! Remember that these things are complicated, and to take each thinker in stride rather than treating Christianity or Christian thought as a monolith.
