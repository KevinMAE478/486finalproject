Equally, new political regimes, new ways of thinking, or new mediums prevent people from seeing a necessity of preserving older information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This btw is what happened to all that middle byzantine documentation.  Unlike western europe, where the medieval kingdoms had a vested interest in keeping at least some documents, namely church records, the takeover of Byzantium by the Turks meant they had no need for preserving older archives which served older purposes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The implications of all these archives are mostly not for history.  They&amp;#39;re for modern sociology, which attempts to use the massive amounts of records to create statistical models, which you can&amp;#39;t do with the selective survival of much older information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But just like the transition of mediums from the scroll to the book resulted in a massive loss of information of things that were not copied, so too will the book to digital, and the digital to next medium transition result in a significant loss of records from which to mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it&amp;#39;s that loss of knowledge, and the working between the gaps, that is something historians are extremely familiar with, and that likely won&amp;#39;t change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I used to be on AOL and AIM all the time in the mid 90s.  I have vague memories of possessing chat logs at one point.  I do not know where any of them are.
