He's taken many different names and been involved in many technological advances in history.  His driving force is that he believes in the truest sense of the words, \"Survival of the Fittest\", that the powerful deserve to continue living and the weak should die out.

When he woke up after camping near it he felt different, more intelligent.  He eventually found out that he did not age over time, used this to study and retain more and more information.  He&amp;#39;s taken many different names and been involved in many technological advances in history.  His driving force is that he believes in the truest sense of the words, &amp;quot;Survival of the Fittest&amp;quot;, that the powerful deserve to continue living and the weak should die out.
