They could have chosen any story to insert a random trans character and talk about common trans experiences, but what they &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to talk about was the Red-White-Black philosophy, and a trans character happened to be a really good way of examining that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "magicTCG", "name": "t1_dg7pmfw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126331.0, "created_utc": 1492097531.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7kcsj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg7hrzs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/magicTCG", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "magicTCG", "name": "t1_dg7kcsj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492120241.0, "created_utc": 1492091441.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7hrzs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg7fts9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/magicTCG", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "magicTCG", "name": "t1_dg7hrzs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492116614.0, "created_utc": 1492087814.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qn5f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653y8k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qn5f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653y8k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qn5f", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653y8k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7jt5h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CaptainJank", "parent_id": "t1_dg7h78h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/magicTCG", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; The line between tokenism and representation is kind of arbitrary.\n\nMarvel's declining comic sales seem to disagree.
