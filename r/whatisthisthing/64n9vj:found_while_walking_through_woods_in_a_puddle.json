Recruitment compensation is a related idea that demonstrates that removing a fraction of a population under competition allows the remaining individuals to do even better, which completely negates the population effect of the removal.\n\nAs an empirical example, let's say that you're a biologist counting adult cane toads. A pond has enough resources to allow 100 cane toads to survive their first winter and reach age-1, and 50 of those toads survive the next winter to become adults after which they die of old age.

The expected survival ratio of cane toad eggs to age-1 is 100/1,000,000 or 0.01%. The expected survival rate to age-2 is half of that, or 0.005%.

So whichever eggs you didn't remove experience 100% survival to age 1 *and* age 2 instead of 0.005% survival. You have expended an astronomical amount of time and effort to remove every single damn egg you could find, and after two years you still count 50 of the little bastards.\n\nThat's recruitment compensation. Recruitment compensation is the fundamental reason that humans can harvest fish or any wild animals sustainably - because the remaining individuals perform better and the overall population effect is mitigated.
