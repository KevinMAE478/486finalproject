[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "LetsNotMeet", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My oldest brother has a drug addiction and it has led to more than a few times meeting people I&amp;#39;d rather not ever know. Some of them are pretty harmless but weird, some of them are nice one day and not the next, and some of them... some of them are plain balls-to-the-walls-certifiable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just some background - I&amp;#39;m the eldest, my brother Age is the second eldest (but eldest brother) and Nat is the third eldest. (There&amp;#39;s four brothers and another sister but only Age, Nat and I were the ones involved this time.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time this incident occurred we were living in a house on the highway of the town I was born in. I was about 30, living with my mother, her boyfriend and Nat. I was medically unable to work at the time and Nat has a mental disability that makes it impossible for him to work, so he and I were in charge of the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Easter had just passed and Age rang up begging to be allowed to come home for a while since he&amp;#39;d just broken up with his newest ex. Mum, being a soft-touch when it comes to us kids, was all for letting him crash in the lounge, but only with the promise that there&amp;#39;d be no drugs or alcohol in the house. He gave his word, Nat and I facepalmed (Age has done this a... few times) and Age set up house in the lounge for the next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or so it was supposed to be, anyway. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A month later and several drug addicts becoming regulars at our door and Mum finally got annoyed enough to tell Age to look for a flat/caravan/anything. He wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to stay any longer. Nat and I, who had been dealing with knocks on the door every day (and a police raid of all things... yeah, fun) sighed in relief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Age found a nice flat in the next town over, we resumed our happy, quiet, knock-free lives and all was well... for a week. Then the phone calls started. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They began as a quick succession of calls around dinner time - two or three at a time, with an immediate hang-up as soon as we asked who was there. Meh, nothing too troublesome. Of course, then it escalated - they began happening at 11pm, which quickly got on Mum&amp;#39;s goat (she has no time for annoyances past 10pm, and even family knows not to call the house phone that late or suffer her wrath). So it was no surprise when after about the fifth night of phone calls we heard Mum shouting over the phone to the person on the line that if they called again she&amp;#39;d call the cops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The phone calls stopped, and we shrugged it off as someone being stupid. A few days later I was the only one at home when I heard a car revving nearby. Now, the house we lived in had no fence around the front yard, just a concrete setting where a hedge would have been planted at some point. Mum had put some cactuses there, flanking the path that led into the front yard proper. (image at bottom)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the side of the house was a nature strip where Mum sometimes parked her pride and joy, &amp;#39;Beasty&amp;#39; (a car. HSV something or rather. She&amp;#39;d be horrified to know I don&amp;#39;t know the specs since it&amp;#39;s been her obsession for years now. Sports kit, limited edition apparently. IDK.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Across the road in that direction was a car dealership who had show cars. To the right of us was house that was locked up and currently had no-one living in it. In front of the house is the highway, and our backyard contains what would also be the back-house of a block (it&amp;#39;s a big yard, as you can imagine), so the only place for a car to park and rev would be the dealership or where Mum parks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Glancing out the window I noticed a strange car pulled up on the side of our house, almost touching the cactuses and facing our front lawn, as though it were about to go driving on it (if a tree hadn&amp;#39;t been in the way). Thinking it was a friend of Mum&amp;#39;s boyfriend, I shrugged it off and waited for them to get out of the car and come up to the front door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 10-15 minutes of revving pass and I&amp;#39;m wondering what the hell is going on. I can&amp;#39;t see the driver since the tree branches (it was a low-hanging one) were in the way, but I&amp;#39;m not particularly perturbed about it at first - we&amp;#39;ve had a few people pull up on the nature strip in order to turn around, and initially I thought this might be what was going on after no-one got out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to get a bit antsy, though, and consider getting the phone and making a call to the cops when a land-rover pulls up into the dealership, just across the road from the car. It must have spooked them, because whoever was in the car reversed off and left. I shrugged it off (stupid, but it was middle of the day and they hadn&amp;#39;t blared horns or interacted in any way weird bar the revving and being on our parking area/nature strip, so I wasn&amp;#39;t feeling that worried.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mentioned it when Mum got home, she told me to call her or my aunt if it happened again and it was forgotten for a few days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was about 10pm and I&amp;#39;d been reading some manga (I&amp;#39;m a nerd, sue me) when I hear a car pull up outside. It didn&amp;#39;t really register, just something that my mind was like &amp;quot;Oh, car. Mum must be home.&amp;quot; and shrugged off. Less than five minutes later I hear this pounding on my window and a cracking sound of glass. Of course, this startles the hell out of me. I drop the book and go wide-eyed, looking at the window where the pounding came from, wondering if I&amp;#39;m imagining it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then a woman starts to scream, calling me a whore and bitch and demanding to see Age and how he&amp;#39;s fucked with the wrong woman, how she&amp;#39;s going to kill him and me and... all kinds of other craziness. I&amp;#39;m like, What the Actual Fuck? trying to process what the hell is going on and who this crazy woman is, what I&amp;#39;ve done to offend her and how she knows Age. I&amp;#39;m a bit shell-shocked and Nat comes bursting into my room looking a bit rattled, while I hear Mum&amp;#39;s voice yelling about getting the cops if the woman doesn&amp;#39;t clear out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman kept screaming and yelling and beating on the house, so the cops were called, she was warned not to come near the property again and we figured it was over. Mum rang Age who told us that she was the ex of his friend. Age had convinced his friend to dump her since she was an abusive woman who&amp;#39;d beat him up on the regular and steal his money (and drugs... of course). So apparently she tracked Age and decided to start a weird campaign of ineffectual terror before things came to a head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright, all done. Lady is given the warning to piss off and not bother us again, Age&amp;#39;s friend takes her back after another sob story, Age goes to another different town and starts dealing drugs there. Fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except no, not fine, because two weeks later the crazy woman has been broken up with again. We&amp;#39;re outside since it&amp;#39;s been a warm day, having a small bonfire around 9pm. It&amp;#39;s just past dusk, getting darker, and Nat, Mum&amp;#39;s boyfriend (Stew) and I are hanging out, just joking around and considering whether we should get some marshmallows or sausages on the bonfire, when we hear a car pull up to the fence, next to the driveway (set a ways back).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same car I saw last time, and three men climb out and come over to the fence. These are pretty bulky guys, all taller than me (I&amp;#39;m about 160cm). Nat is solidly built but not much taller than me, and Stew was at the time recovering from a motorbike accident that saw him nearly killed (he&amp;#39;s also a short-ass weed), so we&amp;#39;re watching these three come up with trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mum, unbeknownst to us at the time, was watching from a window inside the house and had gotten the phone, calling the cops just in case. I had been about to go back inside to get the marshmallows, so I was near the back steps and close to the back door, torn between watching to make sure that Stew and Nat don&amp;#39;t get all macho, looking for a weapon of some kind and tearing inside to call the cops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile The Bitch comes out of the car, happy as a lark, and starts mouthing off about how Age is gonna get his for stealing her man (wtf?) and how her friends are gonna beat everyone here up. The men start making threatening noises, demanding Age and the woman&amp;#39;s boyfriend to come out or else there&amp;#39;ll be some dead bodies laying around (for some reason they thought Age and the guy were here, even though Age was in a whole other part of the country and apparently so was the guy). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was panicking the hell to bits and ducked inside to get the phone, but Mum just shushed me, and seeing she had it, kept the back door open to watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stew and Nat keep telling them that Age and the guy aren&amp;#39;t here, that they&amp;#39;re free to check if they want to, if they come back during the day... that kind of thing. At one point Stew grabs a hammer and of course this makes the other guys more aggressive, demanding what he thinks he&amp;#39;s going to do with it. One of them tries to open the gate, which is when our dog (bull mastiff cross pit bull) starts barking like crazy (he&amp;#39;s a good dog) and the guy backs off a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, that&amp;#39;s about the time the cops showed up. That&amp;#39;s when things cool down but we watched in bewilderment as the guys greet the cops all friendly-like and start chatting them up like old buds. They leave, the cops take a few notes and head off, and we hear nothing more about the incident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the woman who incited the whole incident left town not too long after and then ended up in jail after trying to rob a jewellery store with a plastic gun. Age still has questionable tastes in friends, but doesn&amp;#39;t bring them around to the house when he visits, thankfully, and the cops, well, some of them are okay, just not the ones that came around that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, be careful of who your friends are involved with because it can cause trouble for you and your family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/SwdOtQQ\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a crudely sketched image of the property&lt;/a&gt; - the blue car at the top is the position the car was in when it was revving during the day, opposite my window.

It kills me to see parents who will forgive their kid no matter what crazy shit they pull.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LetsNotMeet", "name": "t1_dgbaw0w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492325608.0, "created_utc": 1492296808.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3t8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65knzw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc2g4q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "yellowtag", "parent_id": "t3_65knzw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LetsNotMeet", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Excellent paint skills, I've seen much, much worse at work", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excellent paint skills, I&amp;#39;ve seen much, much worse at work&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LetsNotMeet", "name": "t1_dgc2g4q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492380901.0, "created_utc": 1492352101.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3t8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65knzw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcoznl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "YouCantSaveEveryone", "parent_id": "t3_65knzw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LetsNotMeet", "controversiality": 0, "body": "fucking cops ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;fucking cops &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LetsNotMeet", "name": "t1_dgcoznl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492411210.0, "created_utc": 1492382410.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t3t8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65knzw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd0fcr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rosebudx0", "parent_id": "t3_65knzw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LetsNotMeet", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"I'm a nerd, sue me.\" Haha!!
