you know the scene with walter running at least 600 mph? that was happening to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as soon as i looked up, there was a man probably two blocks away who was sprinting full speed at me. keep in mind, it&amp;#39;s after 1 am, so i don&amp;#39;t think anyone would be going on a run that late. not only that, but this was more than some exercise running. this man was charging at me. i took a slight step back and was mumbling something along the lines of &amp;quot;what the fuck&amp;quot; and immediately ran behind one of the nearest houses. they were bushes lined against the house, so i got as far back as i could in one of the bushes. i heard him running and immediately he ran by the house. i was in full panic mode and i was too scared to get out of the bushes or even move. i took deep breaths to calm myself down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i was finally feeling better and i was about to get out of the bush, but then i heard a laugh and, oh my god, it definitely wasn&amp;#39;t a happy laugh. this shit sounded like HIM from powerpuff girls. the laugh alone scared me more than being chased. i heard footsteps and they were coming my way. he very quietly said, &amp;quot;i know you&amp;#39;re here&amp;quot;. he was walking around and i could hear him checking the bushes and trees near me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i had pretty much accepted that i was shit out of luck. to my dismay, i heard someone yelling my name. it caught the man off guard. he stopped what he was doing. i heard my name being called out again and i could see my friend walking down the street. this startled the man i&amp;#39;m guessing, because he started running again. i instantly ran out of the bush and i was calling my friend&amp;#39;s name hysterically. she told me that her sister was taking out the trash and heard a man mumbling to himself. he was saying something along the lines of, &amp;quot;i finally have you, i finally have a new fresh bitch&amp;quot; and then he started sprinting. she went out searching for me because she knew i was already almost at her house when i had called her and she had a bad feeling when i never showed up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m terrified to go on walks now. i&amp;#39;m terrified to even leave my apartment. so, man who i am convinced is walter from &amp;quot;get out&amp;quot;, let&amp;#39;s never meet. please stay the hell away from me and everyone else. i feel sick knowing that i was a &amp;quot;new bitch&amp;quot; and there were people before me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "first things first, i'm a first time poster. i've been lurking in this sub for ages, but up until a few nights ago i never had any experiences to share here. unfortunately, i do now. i'm also sharing this via mobile, so i apologize if the format looks whack. \n\nso, here's the setting: it was late - around 1 am, and i live in a small city in indiana that isn't necessarily known for its crime rate, but instead for the absurd amount of hard drugs. i moved here not too long ago and i don't know the complete area, but it's not like i was hesitant or scared to go out at night by myself for a bit. my friend and i go on late night walks as an excuse to not go to the gym - sorry summer body, maybe next year. i'm 5'3\", early 20s, and around 120/130 lbs, so i'm not very big and i probably don't look intimidating at all. i'm assuming i look like an easy target. \n\nit was a perfect night. the temperature is mid 70s with a light breeze, definitely light sweater weather. i was at my apartment waiting for my friend to call to tell me that she's ready to meet up for our walk. she finally called and we decided to meet each other halfway. keep in mind, we're trying to be healthier, at least we think we are, so walk to meet up instead of driving. it's no big deal, honestly. we live probably five blocks away from each other. \n\ni reached the halfway point and she wasn't there, so i called her to see what's up. she got caught up with something and would be a few minutes longer. yet again, not a big deal. i told her i'd just walk to her. after i hang up, a car pulled up next to me. it was a younger woman around my age and she wanted to warn me because she was leaving her house and it looked like someone was following me. the person disappeared, but she wanted to give me a heads up. a few minutes later, i was on the street that her house is near. it's pretty lit up with street lights. not the entire street, but there's a lamp post every couple of blocks. i don't know if it's just me, but i look down a lot when walking. maybe i was conditioned to try to not step on cracked cement. i'm not really sure. for some reason, i felt compelled to look ahead. i looked up and was instantly in shock. have you guys seen the movie \"get out\"?
