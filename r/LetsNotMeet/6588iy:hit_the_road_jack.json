I guess I always down played how creepy it was in my head so I didn\u2019t get too scared at the time, but thinking back it got really creepy. A side note that help the story. I lived in Massachusetts at the time, about an hour outside Boston. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met \u201cJack\u201d over the summer of 2013. I was at a local country bar. Jack was tall, skinny, bald, a little nerdy, but I liked it. At the end of the night he asked for my number and I excitedly gave it to him! He texted me almost immediately and asked if we could hang out together. I had to work the next few days so we couldn\u2019t hang out, but that didn\u2019t stop him from texting me almost 24/7. I worked at a Children&amp;#39;s Museum as a guide on a tree top walkway, so when we got busy it was hard to text back immediately. Jack was never truly understanding of this, but always hid the frustration under lots of \u201cI just like talking to you.\u201d and \u201cJust making sure you didn\u2019t fall haha.\u201d I didn\u2019t know any better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally there came 5 days where I didn\u2019t have to work at all and man did he make the best of them. I had Tuesday \u2013 Saturday off and he had a plan for each day. Clingy but I ignored it. Here was our schedule.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuesday and Wednesday: He took me out on dates. It was pretty average aside from the fact that it took a lot of convincing to get him to take me home at the end of the night. He kept saying how much he was enjoying our time together and didn\u2019t want it to end. It was at this point I noticed that he wasn&amp;#39;t just emotionally clingy, but physically clingy too. If any guy even glanced my way he would have his arm around me so firmly it would hurt. One older gentleman held the door for me once and Jack rambled on for hours about how the man was hitting on me. He declared he was lucky to have me all to himself. Creepy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thurday: It was the 4th of July and he asked if I wanted to take the train into Boston to see the fireworks. I was excited until he told me that we were going to head into the city at 10 in the morning. It was a 90 degree day, not exactly the kind of weather you want to be gallivanting around Boston in. He said he had fun things planned and I believed him. We arrive in Boston, get off the train, and start walking. Several times I ask him where we are headed and if he can slow down a little since he was speed walking, but he ignored me and said he was \u201cfiguring it out\u201d. Finally he admitted that he didn\u2019t really have any plans made and was hoping to stumble across something. I suggested a few things that I knew about, but he said no to all of them. We walked around for hours. It was so hot that I started to feel dehydrated and exhausted. I suggested we stop for water and sunscreen. He said we would \u201csoon\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until an hour later that I convinced him we needed to stop. At this point I has such bad blisters on the back of my heels that my socks were a little bloodied and I had folded the backs of my sneakers and socks down in an attempt at some relief. We stopped for 5 minutes to get water and Band-Aids, then off we went again. It was only a matter of time before I started begging him to stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: \u201cPlease! Let\u2019s just take the subway! We can sit and it\u2019ll be cooler!\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jack:  \u201cOh come on. Walking is the only way to see Boston!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: \u201cJack I need to rest! My feet are bleeding! We have been walking for hours! The fireworks start in 2 hours. Let\u2019s just find some shade and sit until then!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jack: \u201cNO! That\u2019s too much time to wait!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An hour and a half before the show started we were sitting on a bench. I had convinced him to give me 30 minutes to sit and said I felt like I would pass out if I didn\u2019t. By now I was in pain every second I was walking, and had a nasty sunburn. Suddenly Jack got very sentimental. He started going on about how amazing I was and how he had his heart broken before but I \u201cproved that love was still possible\u201d for him. He claimed that he was falling in love with me and never wanted to leave my side. Then he decided that fireworks were stupid and he demanded we immediately walk back to the train station and go home. We ended the night sitting on his friend front lawn where, despite my best efforts, he made me stay until 1am. At this point I was completely over it. It had been a miserable day!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday: He wanted to do something in the morning but I lied and said I was busy. He called me and in a desperate voice asked what I was doing that night. I told him I\u2019d be at the country bar where we had met but I was going with a friend. He acted ok with it, but kept texting me every few minutes to see what I was doing. That night I confided in my friend about how weird this was all getting. She agreed it was getting to be a bit much and bet he was going to show up at the bar tonight. Sure enough he did. Halfway through the night he came, pushed his way over to me. He greeted us and hugged me. When he let go he kept his hand on my arm, tightly. I wiggled out of his grip and asked what he was doing there. He said he had driven two hours from his house because he needed a kiss. My friend got wide eyes and I dodge him casually as he tried to hold onto my arm again. My friend faked being sick and I said I needed to take her home and we quickly left. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday I decided I needed a break from all this Jack. I needed time to plan how to get out of this relationship without a battle. I lied and told him I had to work at the last minute at the museum and I couldn\u2019t hang out. He was so upset and said that he wanted to hang out with me. Around noon I got a text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jack: Where are you? I\u2019m here to have lunch with you and YOU AREN\u2019T HERE!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: You\u2019re at the museum?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jack: WHERE ARE YOU!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was shaking. I quickly made up a lie that I had gotten a migraine headache and my boss sent me home. Suddenly his tone changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jack: Well baby! Why didn\u2019t you tell me? Let me come and take care of you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: That\u2019s ok! I need sleep! That\u2019s the best thing for me. I need to sleep it off. Looking at my phone is too bright. It hurts. I need to go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jack: ok. Get well baby! I love you! I\u2019ll check on you later!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t reply to any of his texts after that. I stayed inside the rest of the day and almost forgot about it until I woke up around midnight to my phone ringing. It was him. He told me he was near my house on the way to the country bar. He told me he was pulling down my street and to come outside. I told him it was late, and I\u2019d wake up my parents. He started begging me to let him see me. He told me he just needed one kiss. I said no. He started getting mad. He told me he had gone long enough without seeing me and that I was being very rude. He demanded I come outside. I felt sick. I crawled across the floor and peaked out my window. He was standing at my door. I hid and told him he needed to leave immediately! He told me he loved me and I didn\u2019t answer. He asked why I was being this way and I finally just came clean. I broke the whole thing off. I told him I didn\u2019t love him, that he needed to leave me alone, that I was sorry but I wasn\u2019t the one for him. He hung up, stormed to his car, and peeled away. The noise woke up my mom and I told her everything through tears. We sat in the dark living room the rest of the night, waiting to see if he\u2019d come back. He didn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I had to work. I was terrified he would show up. I told everyone at the museum who he was and what he looked like. He was not to enter the museum or the surrounding property. Thankfully I worked with three male co-workers on the tree walk that day. I was like a little sister to them and the protected me all day. One of them followed me home afterward to make sure he wouldn\u2019t be there. When I got home my mom told me Jack had done a few passes by the house and she had called police to make sure they knew. After that he just disappeared. He deleted his facebook and I never saw him at the country bar again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This happened about 4 years ago.
