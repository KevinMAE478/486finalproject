There were these electrical boxes all around the area and they were surrounded by tall evergreen shrubs making the perfect hide out for a kid... or a creep.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back then of course we all really thought we were safe. I live in Vermont and creepy people aren&amp;#39;t as common here, or maybe they just aren&amp;#39;t reported as often, and this was back in the 90&amp;#39;s anyways.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, so I used to hang out with some neighborhood kids around these boxes, it was like a cool hide out. Well one day I saw a new kid in there. I think he was about 13 years old, but I&amp;#39;m not sure, and he was a red headed kid, that I remember. He had a squirt gun and I remember he pointed it at me and said,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You wanna do something cool?&amp;quot; I was pretty naive, and I wasn&amp;#39;t really good with picking up sarcasm because I have ADHD so I typically assume that people are joking in these situations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure?&amp;quot; I said, \n&amp;quot;Okay, you should suck my peter until I pee in your mouth.&amp;quot; I thought that was really really weird. I knew my parents wouldn&amp;#39;t want me to do it, and I also knew those areas were private, so I assumed he was joking.\n&amp;quot;Oh... um... okay, well I can&amp;#39;t right now maybe tonight I&amp;#39;ll sneak out and we can do that then?&amp;quot;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know probably you all think I was a stupid kid saying that, but you have to realize I knew almost nothing about sex. Pretty much I knew that it was a private part and I shouldn&amp;#39;t talk about it to anyone other then my dad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What time are you coming?&amp;quot; He asked, again I thought he was joking around.\n&amp;quot;What about 3am?&amp;quot; I laughed a little. I remember he was pretty serious about it and told me to meet him right there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well naturally I didn&amp;#39;t sneak out at 3am, duh. I remember I forgot about the encounter and went on being a kid. I don&amp;#39;t remember how long it had been but on another day I met him again and he was pissed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where were you? I waited here at 3am for you and you never showed up!&amp;quot; He hissed at me. \n&amp;quot;I thought you were joking?&amp;quot; I said to him, I was starting to realize he wasn&amp;#39;t.\n&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to piss in your mouth right now.&amp;quot; He grabbed my hand and we walked to another box on another area. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m not really sure what was happening, but my parents were outside at this point looking for me for some reason. I think we were about to leave and I was outside playing. Thank God. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He started to unbuckle is belt when my parents called for me. He stopped dead in his tracks,\n&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t go out there.&amp;quot; He said and I could tell he was terrified. I was too, for some reason I didn&amp;#39;t want to disappoint this kid, even though he wanted me to &amp;quot;drink his pee&amp;quot;. I was freaking out though and after a few minutes I realized that my parents would call the police if they didn&amp;#39;t find me soon.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I realized that I ran out despite his angry protests. My parents welcomed me into their arms, asked me where the hell I was and why I didn&amp;#39;t answer. I lied and said I was hiding and I thought it was a game. They told me never to do it again yada yada and that was that. Sadly I didn&amp;#39;t tell my parents about it at all, but thankfully I never saw that kid again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got older, I think around 13, I realized how messed up the encounter was. I realized that when he said &amp;quot;pee&amp;quot; he meant something entirely different. It honestly shocked me and I still didn&amp;#39;t say anything to my parents about it because it was pretty embarrassing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a few things that really disturb me. Why did this kid want a 7 year old boy to suck him off? What the honest fuck? Also sometimes I worry he wasn&amp;#39;t a 13 year old boy. To me at that age, and my blurry memory I remember him as just an older boy lurking in the shadows, but maybe he was older? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly if my parents hadn&amp;#39;t called out to me when they did, I might have had a pretty scared childhood. Worse yet who knows if this kid would have done it again and again?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow I know it&amp;#39;s probably not as long and drawn out as other stories, or as interesting, but I figured it might help other guys come out with creepy f-ed up encounters. It&amp;#39;s okay to talk about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Red Headed Electrical Box Boy, lets not ever meet again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I decided to share this because I wanted to come out and say that guys can be creeped on as much as girls.  \n\nThis is one of those things that when I was a kid I realized it was wrong, but one day when I was older I had a \"What the fuck?\" moment and realized how messed up this encounter was.\n\nWhen I was about 7 years old I used to live in a condo complex.
