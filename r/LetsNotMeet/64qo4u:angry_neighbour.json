Once it was put out by a hose, the damage was severe and my dads tools were all ruined (cost was over twelve grand (he was a contractor)(the shed was brick built but the inside had flammable stuff in like fuel for equipment, white spirits etc)). We checked our CCTV and saw it was one of our neighbors from the back who flicked what looked like a cigarette through an open shed window (it was a very small window but it was right next to the separation fence (it was open because my dad was ventilating it). Sure enough, police told us that the fire brigade stated it was a cigarette but that caused the incident and they were surprised there wasn&amp;#39;t a larger explosion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the police arrested and charged one of the neighbors at the back but after searching their bungalow (the illegal build at the back) they realised that they were growing weed there and that the build was illegal to rent separately from the front bit. So it all got shut down and the landlord was fined. It wasn&amp;#39;t exactly our fault as the police arrived anyway due to the shed explosion thing. We weren&amp;#39;t going to just let the guy get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the next week, the landlord comes over, giving it the big saying that we have lost him 400 a month. My dad says that it isn&amp;#39;t our fault and to leave. He also said that it was an illegal build so it was the landlords fault. Anyway, the next morning, we wake up to some oil/tar/petrol (police told us the mix) thing splattered all over our wooden front door and stone drive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Police were called and CCTV showed it was the landlord. He pleaded guilty and was given 6 months, community service and was fined for the damages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a year later, I was home alone (15) and was revising for my GCSE&amp;#39;s. It was the Easter holiday but my parents were working and my sister was out. I was blasting music (Ha as if I was actually revising) while &amp;quot;revising&amp;quot; when I hear a knock at the door. I shit myself, turn down the music and get ready to apologize to whoever was at the door. I open it and it&amp;#39;s the landlord. I shit myself, slam the door, call my dad and sit upstairs.
