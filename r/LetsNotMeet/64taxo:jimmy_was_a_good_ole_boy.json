Kinda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dads side of the family are pretty damn country. My grandfather was a retired gunsmith and my grandma grows her own veggies. My dad played football all through high school and when he wasn&amp;#39;t doing that he was hunting and fishing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grew up used to the fact that my dad did things the country way. He went to feed stores and got vaccinations for all of our dogs and administered them himself. When they got to old to eat, he put them down and dug the graves himself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When his arch fucking nemesis shot up our house, he took justice into his own hands. Or attempted to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad&amp;#39;s first company was a pretty successful fire safety company in the area, until his best friend/co-owner ran off with all the clients. This left my family with NOTHING. We were very very poor and had to relocate 300 miles away to live with his parents. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This should have been the last we&amp;#39;d heard of his old best friend, but evil never dies. Or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forward 11 years. We&amp;#39;d been living in a small town south of Dallas for about six years now and things were okay. We were still poor, just not as poor. But we were living in a house again and the business was doing well so things were good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until Jimmy Ray Jr showed up. Jimmy was the eldest son of the dirtbag who fucked over my dad and he came to us, asking for a job so he could get away from his shitty father. He had a wife and baby on the way and he just had to get out from under the thumb of his father. My dad has a thing for taking in strays, so soon Jimmy was working for my dad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now Jimmy was a real fucking creep. He used to hit on me constantly, going so far as to pull my in his lap as often as he could and delighted in asking me if certain things turned me on. I hated him and told my parents this constantly- they wouldn&amp;#39;t believe that Jimmy was a bad guy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then things started getting really weird. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We lived just outside city limits at the time, and there was always a lot of space between you and your neighbors. This meant that lots of activity could go on and they probably wouldn&amp;#39;t notice. This also meant that the truck parked down the street all day everyday was actually pretty visible to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, we thought the old couple down at the bend had purchased a new truck and maybe there just wasn&amp;#39;t enough space in their drive way. Until my mom drove by on her way back from groceries and saw a man in the truck with binoculars in his lap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This continued on for weeks, until one day the truck just wasn&amp;#39;t there anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then other stuff started. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a Monday night and everyone was knocked out. Dad had work, mom had work, and my two brothers and I had school the next day. Imagine the terror when the backdoor sounds like someone is going at it with a battering ram. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Riley, the oldest of my two brothers was first to jump up. I was next, despite having the room furthest away from the living room. The door was pushed in, being held by the chain. Everyone else came filing in after us, confused and tired. Riley started to shout that someone had kicked in the door, but my parents wouldn&amp;#39;t hear it and said the weather must have done it. After all, it was a stormy night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Riley and I disagreed. It wasn&amp;#39;t that stormy and the nails that held the chain to the wall had been ripped nearly all the way out. The door knob was messed up. It wasn&amp;#39;t the weather.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple more weeks pass and we&amp;#39;re dealing with the same shit. Fire extinguishers going missing. Doors getting hammered on. Our dog, losing her fucking shit every night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final straw for my dad? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My stoner ass brother took a couple of his friends out to my van in the middle of the night to smoke. Our driveway was fairly long and my van was parked at the very end- it needed to be fixed up so better to have it out of the way. There was still driveway to spare as it was long and very very wide. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Riley says they heard the truck, but just assumed it had stopped at the stop sign. But then, there was gunfire. We&amp;#39;re talking sprays of bullets. And instead of ducking for cover, the dumbass busts out of the van with his friends just in time for the shooter to jump back into his truck and the driver to peel out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, my dad sure as hell believes us now. Instead of calling the cops, he called Jimmy. Asked him if he knew anyone with a truck that matched the description my brother provided. And when he said yes, it all clicked into place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see, Jimmy&amp;#39;s dad was real pissed his son went to work for the competition. He took it as a personal attack that my dad had accepted Jimmy with open arms. And he was willing to do what it took to get Jimmy to quit, or convince my dad to fire him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, my dad hatched a plan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He and Jimmy spend days shoving long nails into a thick rope. They covered the windows. They stocked the barn and the house with provisions. They sent the rest of us away for Thanksgiving, and waited. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The plan was simple. They assumed that since we were being watched, Jimmy&amp;#39;s dad would think we had all gone off for the holidays. He&amp;#39;d probably try to break in while we were away. And then, when he did he would find my dad waiting for him, gun in hand. And if he managed to get away, that&amp;#39;s when Jimmy, who had been forced to wait in the barn, would pull the nail riddled rope across the street and bust their tires. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no one ever showed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see, Jimmy had decided to go back to his dad. Told him so. Even went so far as to make copies of all of our invoices. And since he had given some to his old man, the guy decided to leave us alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Jimmy didn&amp;#39;t leave right away, no he had plans. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plans that entailed trapping a seventeen year old girl in her room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plans that involved betraying his wife. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plans that involved betraying the man who had taken him in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, he never got far with me. But he did manage to steal half of our clients and send us back into a financial tailspin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like father, like son. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Jim, let&amp;#39;s not meet. \nYou wouldn&amp;#39;t like it very much. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "First time poster, hope this fits here! \n\nI've got to preface this a bit with my fathers background, I feel like it explains things pretty well.
