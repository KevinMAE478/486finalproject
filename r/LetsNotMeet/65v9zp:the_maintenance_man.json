In a month&amp;#39;s time we had a man that committed suicide in a unit, a partial fire in a building leading to reconstruction, and a child that had been hit by a car (who later survived). Even at a younger age, I remember distinctly having a strong grasp on the bizarre events that were taking place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had to be around spring in 1997. My mother was single and raising my little sister (about 5 years old) and I. She managed a different complex and would pick us up from school and drop us off at our apartment while she returned to work for a couple of more hours. I have three older siblings (whom all moved out) that at some point had to keep an eye on each other at a young age, so this wasn&amp;#39;t really a new premise. There was no money for a sitter, the oldest just had to assume the role...which was me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the most part, we were really quiet kids in our 2nd and 3rd story unit. We played with our toys, watched a little television, and sometimes played Sega or Nintendo. On this particular afternoon I recall playing with a Dash Rendar figurine from Star Wars while my sister was doing whatever in the same living room. Suddenly, the door knob started violently shaking. My heart dropped and I remember it being the first time I had felt such terror. I rushed to the phone and paged my mom &amp;quot;911&amp;quot; and then dialed 911 to let the operator know that someone was breaking in. The operator reassured me that help was on the way. The door handle was still being messed with, but I was nervous if the deadbolt and chain would be enough. A couple of loud bangs happened, as if someone were ramming the door with their shoulder...then it all just stopped. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cops arrived shortly before my mom only to find a note from the maintenance man saying something like: &amp;quot;air filter check&amp;quot;. Now, the maintenance man claimed that he announced himself verbally, but I knew it was bullshit. Of course, the cops did nothing and my mom&amp;#39;s complaint to the office didn&amp;#39;t yield in this man being fired. Unfortunately, this wouldn&amp;#39;t be most unnerving part of the story. My mom said the guy would stare her down in the parking lot and just smile at her. The whole situation creeped us out and we wanted to move, but we couldn&amp;#39;t afford the expenses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One night a couple of weeks later I was awakened by a loud thud coming from the roof. Being so easily rattled from the previous event, I ran to my mom&amp;#39;s room to wake her up. She checked around to make sure everything was in place and reassured me that it was probably a rodent. We went to school the next morning and were dropped off at home in the afternoon as usual. Mom usually did a quick sweep of the place (even before the attempted break-in) but this time, something seemed off. It was just a very uneasy feeling the apartment had when walking in. My sister and I were ordered to stay downstairs by the front door while she investigated upstairs. We waited patiently and felt very unnerved when suddenly our mother&amp;#39;s shrieking confirmed our suspicion...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She came barreling down the stairs and ushered us out the door. We went to a neighbors and phoned the police. My mother was barking at them &amp;quot;Someone is in our apartment!!!&amp;quot;. The police responded pretty quickly and I was finally able to understand the situation: The bedroom had a walk-in closet that contained the hatch to the attic that connected the entire building&amp;#39;s AC/Heat. There were shelves that were pretty high up lining the closet walls. My mother walked in to find a dirty pair of men&amp;#39;s tighty whitey underwear laying in the floor. This was enough to send her running and phoning the police. However, the investigation revealed something more; the attic hatch had been disturbed. Just to add; the police found full handprints on the shelves in the closet. The noises I heard the previous night were more than likely this man hoisting himself back up into the crawl space using the shelves to climb on after &amp;quot;visiting&amp;quot; us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man was taken into custody but I don&amp;#39;t recall what the sentencing was.
