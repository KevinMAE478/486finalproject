I'll try to explain.\n\nThe atmosphere is layered. The layer closest to earth is called the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere) and this is where most weather occurs. It extends from the surface to about 40-50 thousand feet, depending on your latitude (it's thicker at the equator and thins towards the poles). Above it is the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere), which is separated from the troposphere by the tropopause. There are other layers above the stratosphere but they're not important for now. The troposphere and stratosphere have different properties and act like two different types of fluids, one floating atop the other, like oil on water. \n\nImportantly, temperature decreases with height in the troposphere (higher = colder), but once you reach the stratosphere, temperature starts to increase with altitude (higher = warmer). This feature is what keeps the weather in the troposphere. What causes storm clouds to build is the condensation of water vapor into clouds. This starts because warm air, being less dense than the surrounding air, rises. As it rises, it cools. As it cools, the water vapor contained within condenses into water droplets. This process of condensation releases heat, which heats the surrounding air, causing it to stay warmer than the surrounding air, and thus it continues to rise. It does this until it hits the tropopause, where suddenly the surrounding air is warmer than the rising thundercloud, and thus the storm cloud is no longer less dense and stop rising. When a storm cloud reaches this point, it spreads out against the tropopause and forms an anvil, which is what we see in the gif. \n\nEven though the rising column of air can no longer keep rising as a result of being warmer/less dense/more buoyant than the surrounding air, this column is rising relatively quickly and has momentum. It's this momentum that lets the cloud punch a short way into the stratosphere before falling back  down. This is called an overshooting top, and it's a signature of a strong storm, and it's what we see boiling and churning at the center of the anvil in the gif. \n\nRegarding the waves, remember when I said the troposphere and stratosphere act like two dissimilar fluids sitting atop each other? I said oil and water, but maybe a better example is air and water (both are fluids), because the waves are the same thing you'd see if you threw a rock into a pond (or saw a fish eat a bug on the water surface, would be a more accurate example).
