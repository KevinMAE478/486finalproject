Secondly, pay is based off of merit and experience. That blog starts off by saying that more women have bachelor's degrees than men do. But in what field? Certain jobs pay certain wages. You can not expect to make more than someone else just because you have a degree. You need skills and actual knowledge of your craft. A male who decides to major in aerospace engineering is obviously going to make more than a female who majored in education. And in the same way, a female with an aerospace engineering degree will earn more than a male with a degree in education.
