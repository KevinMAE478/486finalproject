The human being behind the wheel chooses to stop, they don&amp;#39;t have to, there is nobody twisting their arm in the passenger seat telling them to stop, they just volunteer to stop, &lt;strong&gt;of their own free will&lt;/strong&gt; every time they get to a crosswalk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is so common place for a car to stop at a cross walk that pedestrians mistake the Crosswalk as having an invisible wall, they can step out into the road without needing to look, take their kids across the road without thinking twice, push that pram into the road... because all cars &lt;strong&gt;WILL STOP&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Do they decide if a car stops?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;No.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The driver does...&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Should the car stop?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Yes, but the driver doesn&amp;#39;t have to stop.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means, in one simple act, of crossing the road without checking, a person can easily put the rest of their life or quality of life in another person&amp;#39;s hands on, possibly their worst bad day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is true of the chivalry argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A man OUGHT not hit a woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That magical OUGHT BARRIER acting as a shield, no matter how hard the man tries, his hands are tied together?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;No.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet again, we find ourselves looking at a stranger, a person who is having a shit day and down to their last speck of patience, then a woman hits him. And all of his frustration ends up vented upon her face in a single of hay-maker punch and all I can think is.
