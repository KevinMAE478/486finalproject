Notice I said &amp;quot;back&amp;quot; and not just &amp;quot;hit.&amp;quot; Or you hear, &amp;quot;what you gonna do, hit a girl?&amp;quot; Women in general seem to think they can get away with this bs because they&amp;#39;re women. Hence the term &amp;quot;pussy pass.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let me put it another way, what stops this girls own brother, much older and stronger, from walking up to this guy when hes minding his own business and putting a world of hurt on him?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If that&amp;#39;s not justified, then why?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This depends on who you ask. If it were my sister jumping people and then she got beat for it, then she deserved it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because you perceive her debt now paid, and the situation morally neutral?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not how civilized society works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world this cunt would be charged with assault (along with all of her friends), would be expelled from school, and her life would be ruined. That simply doesn&amp;#39;t happen. Read around on this sub. So many examples of women getting away with shit. Hell, it&amp;#39;s not even women only. Many people get away with shit they shouldn&amp;#39;t. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m all for taking things into your own hands.
