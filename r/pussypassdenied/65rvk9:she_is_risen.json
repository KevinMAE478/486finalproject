The Christian Testament represents sources that have become canonical for Christianity, and there are many apocryphal texts that are examples of the wide variety of writings in the first centuries AD that are related to Jesus.[26] Many scholars have questioned the authenticity and reliability of these sources, and few events that are mentioned in the gospels are universally accepted.[15]:181&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Non-Christian sources which are used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus include Jewish sources such as Josephus and Roman sources such as Tacitus. These sources are compared to Christian sources, such as the Pauline Letters and the Synoptic Gospels, and are usually independent of each other; for example, the Jewish sources do not draw upon the Roman sources. Similarities and differences between these sources are used in the authentication process.[27][28][29][29][30]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pussypassdenied", "name": "t1_dgd8l9j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492441879.0, "created_utc": 1492413079.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd8aqp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hispanica316", "parent_id": "t1_dgd82ze", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pussypassdenied", "controversiality": 0, "body": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus\n\nI'm on mobile\n\n\n* Well you deleted your previous comment that said something like\" that deals with the historicity of Jesus\"\n\nAnd so I copy pasted some of the article \"The historicity of Jesus concerns the degree to which sources show Jesus of Nazareth existed as a historical figure.\"\n\n\"An overwhelming majority of New Testament scholars and Near East historians, applying the standard criteria of historical investigation, find that the historicity of Jesus is more probable than not...\"\n\nThat's in the first paragraph which only shows you didn't even bother reading the article", "edited": 1492413265.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus\"&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on mobile&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Well you deleted your previous comment that said something like&amp;quot; that deals with the historicity of Jesus&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I copy pasted some of the article &amp;quot;The historicity of Jesus concerns the degree to which sources show Jesus of Nazareth existed as a historical figure.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;An overwhelming majority of New Testament scholars and Near East historians, applying the standard criteria of historical investigation, find that the historicity of Jesus is more probable than not...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s in the first paragraph which only shows you didn&amp;#39;t even bother reading the article&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pussypassdenied", "name": "t1_dgd8aqp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492441236.0, "created_utc": 1492412436.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3328c", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rvk9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd8wb8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "roostercrash", "parent_id": "t1_dgd82ze", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pussypassdenied", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Who was Tacitus???", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who was Tacitus???&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pussypassdenied", "name": "t1_dgd8wb8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492442696.0, "created_utc": 1492413896.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd82ze", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AlcoholicsAlarmist", "parent_id": "t1_dgd80zd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pussypassdenied", "controversiality": 0, "body": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/18/did-historical-jesus-exist-the-traditional-evidence-doesnt-hold-up/?utm_term=.54446f074445\n\n&gt; \"The first problem we encounter when trying to discover more about the Historical Jesus is the lack of early sources.
