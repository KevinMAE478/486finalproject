However,  I also believe it is the law that the person must use enough force to defend themselves; that is to stop the attack and no more.      So if a person can defend themselves by pushing the person away or grabbing their arms and holding them; which most guys can when up against most women.   It may by law seem to be not defense but an attack to full on punch them with all their force in their face fracturing their skull and causing life time brain damage.   \n\nThis is not saying women can hit men or that men have no right to defend themselves.   It is however giving a warning to men that you are much stronger and you may find that using complete force may not be seen as defense in a court of law and you could end up in jail.  If you are able to stop the stupid woman from hitting without hitting back I believe that is the best option.     If however punching her is needed to stop the attack then so be it.  However, I doubt a court will believe a 6'3 man really needed to punch a 5'4 woman to stop her. \n\nAlso to add to this.  If a woman punches a man and their are no cameras around to record it and he punches her back.  This is the reality she will most likely leave no bruise and no damage while he will at the minimum leave a bruise and possibly more damage.  So a question when she contacts the police and he has no bruises no signs of being hit and she has a broken nose,  who do you think will be arrested?  \n\nNot hitting women if it can be avoided is not just about protecting women.  It is also about protecting men and stopping them from being sent to jail when they were actually defending themselves.   Men you have a lot more options then women in defending yourself.  You have the strength and height difference to render your opponent unable to hit without hitting.  Women due to their shortness and lack of strength cannot grab a guy in a bear hug and carry them out the door.      \n\n\n\n", "edited": 1492156488.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one should hit anyone.
