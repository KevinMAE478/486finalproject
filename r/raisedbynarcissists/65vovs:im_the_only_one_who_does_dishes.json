You require food to survive, so if narcissists can control or manipulate using food people don't have a choice in the matter.\n\nMy mom complains about dishes constantly, ever since I was a child.

As such, I just wash whatever I use right after I'm done my food, that way technically she's complaining about her doing her own dishes.... She doesn't clean mine except when I'm in the middle of cooking.\n\n3) She will re-clean items I just washed, or rearrange where they're stored. Even though I was the manager of a bulk food store earlier in life, and trained people how to clean; she implies I cannot clean a couple plates and bowls. If they do for whatever reason pass her arbitrary tests, then she moves them around a bit where I put them in the cupboard. Always has to 'correct' something or imply I didn't do it right.\n\nThis is actually NORMAL behavior for a narcissist. I wish I picked up on this stuff many years back.

I can tell you from experience, living with a narcissist gets worse as time goes on not better.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently narcissists use food to pull their crap, it&amp;#39;s quite common. I thought only my mom did it, but after researching it more it makes sense. You require food to survive, so if narcissists can control or manipulate using food people don&amp;#39;t have a choice in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom complains about dishes constantly, ever since I was a child. Here are some things I noticed over the years:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) When I&amp;#39;m in the middle of cooking, she will start taking the utensils (knives, forks, plates, etc) and cleaning them aggressively in the sink &amp;amp; sighing, trying to make me think I&amp;#39;m doing something wrong. &amp;quot;Mom, I&amp;#39;m not done cooking yet...&amp;quot; &amp;quot;SOMEONE has to clean around here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) She complains that only she does the dishes. As such, I just wash whatever I use right after I&amp;#39;m done my food, that way technically she&amp;#39;s complaining about her doing her own dishes.... She doesn&amp;#39;t clean mine except when I&amp;#39;m in the middle of cooking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) She will re-clean items I just washed, or rearrange where they&amp;#39;re stored. Even though I was the manager of a bulk food store earlier in life, and trained people how to clean; she implies I cannot clean a couple plates and bowls. If they do for whatever reason pass her arbitrary tests, then she moves them around a bit where I put them in the cupboard. Always has to &amp;#39;correct&amp;#39; something or imply I didn&amp;#39;t do it right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is actually NORMAL behavior for a narcissist. I wish I picked up on this stuff many years back. Just start planning on moving out, hopefully getting a roommate or bf/gf to live with you. I can tell you from experience, living with a narcissist gets worse as time goes on not better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "name": "t1_dgdmpoq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492472067.0, "created_utc": 1492443267.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2we9n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vovs", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2we9n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vovs", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2we9n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vovs", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdqa2g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "laynecp1105", "parent_id": "t1_dgdowbl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/raisedbynarcissists", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There's definitely no winning.
