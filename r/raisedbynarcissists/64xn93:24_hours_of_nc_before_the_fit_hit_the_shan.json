But the borderlines, well, that's beyond 'regular' narcissism, if there is such a way to describe it.\n\nThe 'suicide game' is just a control tactic.  It's pretty desperate, but it usually works a few times because people don't know how to handle it.  For the record, you handle suicide threats by calling 911 and reporting it.

They'd show up, she'd be 'fine', and they'd leave.  Sometimes she'd be drunk.  Later on she'd still be upset, but in general none of her threats were taken seriously.  And obviously she's still around, so she wasn't serious either.  (That's a great way to tell, BTW...

But her drama didn't pay off for her AT ALL.  We weren't coming to get her from jail - we have a standing rule about that (an exception to EDad's usual enablement behaviors), and that includes not responding to calls from jail - so she had to call a friend in the morning to pick up her ass and make her bail.\n\nSo don't put up with the 'suicide game'.
