I&amp;#39;ve just recently found this sub and I&amp;#39;m not sure yet if my mother is a narcissist. She does some of the things that narcissists do, but not all of them. I&amp;#39;m posting here to get some advice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was 9 my father died. It was tough for my mother and I because we were all alone. Money was never an issue though. My mom had a good job that paid well and some apartments that she rented out too. I was going to a private school, she was buying luxury items, we had money. I know that now. But back then, I hadn&amp;#39;t realized how things worked and I was very afraid that we wouldn&amp;#39;t have enough money since dad wasn&amp;#39;t there anymore. My mom always told me it would be ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, when I was 10, we decided to go on a trip with some friends. I remember specifically my mom saying to me that if I wanted us to go I would have to give her my savings (about 1000 euros) so we would have enough money to afford this trip, because she could only afford half of the cost on her own. Now, I was ten, I didn&amp;#39;t have anything better to do with the money, I said yes, we went, we had a great time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t think much of it until recently. I was having a conversation with my mother and she ended up telling me how much of a bad parent her brother is because he didn&amp;#39;t invest in his kids traveling abroad and how much of a good mother she is because she never thought of the money when it came to traveling and expanding horizons. As 99% of our conversations end up in the topic of how someone is a bad parent and how she is a great parent, I wasn&amp;#39;t paying much attention. I casually answered &amp;quot;well you did think of the money. You made me pay 1000 euros for that trip when I was 10.&amp;quot; to which she looked at me shocked and then answered &amp;quot;oh yeah? I don&amp;#39;t think so, I don&amp;#39;t remember that&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have given it much thought if it wasn&amp;#39;t for her response. I&amp;#39;m a 22 year old woman and it felt like she completely invalidated my memories because they didn&amp;#39;t fit into her being the perfect mom. Because that&amp;#39;s the most important. That&amp;#39;s what she always brags about. She brags about me being a good student because of the way she taught me to do my homework and she brags that I love reading books because she gave me a book when I was 6. I mean, she has played a huge role in me turning out pretty good despite the loss of my father and she did raise me on her own. I will forever be grateful for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she&amp;#39;s not the perfect mother. She is cold and distant and sarcastic, she is cheap when it comes to anything but herself and she just invalidated my argument and my memory as if it didn&amp;#39;t matter. I wouldn&amp;#39;t even think that her making me give her my savings was a bad thing until she reacted the way she did. And that&amp;#39;s not the only time she has taken money from me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I deal with the way I feel? I feel so angry that she doesn&amp;#39;t acknowledge that this is how things actually happened but I cannot talk to her about it because she acts as if nothing happened. As if I would make such a thing up. Every time I try to express a complain (usually about her controlling behavior) she ends up snapping and crying and telling me that I think she&amp;#39;s the worst mother in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do I deal with this?
