My mother, bless her, is an enabler. \nRecently my mother left my Nstep dad after almost 25 years of marriage. She had nowhere to go so she had to stay with nsister. I live in a rental with 5 other people and all the bedrooms are on the top floor, my mom cares for my oldest sister who has severe ceribral palsy and needs a 1st floor bedroom or she would&amp;#39;ve stayed with me.\nNsister has been pretty decent helping my mom get set up with a rental house, get moved in, etc. Like I was becoming impressed with her &amp;quot;selflessness&amp;quot;. She has my mom, disabled sister, step sister, and step sister&amp;#39;s kids all living in her house. And was relatively nice...for a few weeks. You know, really raking in those favors she was doing them to hold them over their heads until they die. \nAlong with this she had been demanding all mine and my fianc\u00e9s free time. Every weekend. When asked to finish getting them all moved in, i was met with- No we can&amp;#39;t move the beds into the rental house! We have to unpack literally every box in this house before mom moves in! YOU MADE A PLAN???? HOW CAN YOU BE SUCH A HORRIBLE SELFISH PERSON?! this has gone on for a month. Fiance and I had made plans to spend two days together, he took off work just for me and it was hard as this is their busy season. She catches wind of it and boop I&amp;#39;m a lousy terrible person for even thinking of spending time not helping my poor mother (who has said she didn&amp;#39;t need help). \nSo the weekend before last she&amp;#39;s crying, screaming, just miserable- she needs these people out of her house. I tell her, hey why don&amp;#39;t we get the beds moved into the house the next weekend when her fiance is back from the oilfield and they can move into the house they&amp;#39;ve had for a month? Oh no we can&amp;#39;t do that, they are taking a trip to the beach. They&amp;#39;ll just have to wait to move into the house they have already been paying for for one more week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So flash forward to that weekend. It&amp;#39;s Friday night, I haven&amp;#39;t really talked to her. I&amp;#39;ve talked to my mom, Saturday morning they are all going to my nephews soccer game and then when that&amp;#39;s over they are leaving for the beach. OK perfect, I can make plans! Not so fast!!! Again, Friday night, I get a call from nsister &amp;quot;what time are you coming over to move the beds tomorrow?&amp;quot; - what are you talking about, you&amp;#39;re going to the beach, you said we wouldn&amp;#39;t do this until next weekend? - &amp;quot;no you&amp;#39;re coming over tomorrow morning. I need them out of my house. What time are you gonna be here. I need you here as early as possible&amp;quot; - I made plans, but I guess I can be there like around 10. - &amp;quot;no. Not around 10. I need an exact time. What time will you be here.&amp;quot; - like I said, I guess around 10 am. I mean, we didn&amp;#39;t really plan on being there since you&amp;#39;re going to the beach. -&amp;quot;no. With you and fiance around 10 is noon and I need you here as early as possible. We&amp;#39;re not going to the beach until five. You&amp;#39;re coming over early and helping&amp;quot; she then went into a tirade about how stupid, lazy, unhelpful, etc I apparently am. Then she threatened to find someone who was less lazy and whatever insert here insult that I am to help and to just forget about it. While screaming, swearing, acting absolutely crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I said,  cool.  Have fun.  And I hung up.  Of course I knew she wanted me to beg to help but her verbal abuse at this point was just too much for me to deal with. If she wanted to call me horrible names and scream in my ear, she could do this herself. I had given up the last 4 weekends  and the last weekend I still don&amp;#39;t understand what I was needed for as all we did was sort the kids toys- something that couldve been done anytime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So i ignore calls and abusive texts about what a terrible daughter I am. How selfish I am. Etc etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday, after they get back from the beach she messages me on snap chat that I&amp;#39;m the laziest, most worthless person ever. She wants nothing to do with me and she&amp;#39;s never talking to me again. (I respond &amp;quot;fucking finally&amp;quot; because I&amp;#39;ve been trying to drop her abusive self from my life since adulthood) apparently I&amp;#39;m no longer family to her and she&amp;#39;s disowning me as a sister. Then she blocked me on all social media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guys, I think I might be free. I&amp;#39;ve never been so relieved.
