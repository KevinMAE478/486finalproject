DH advised against me reading it and I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to anyway; I already have a good guess. But even DH, who&amp;#39;s seen nfather in all his n glory, was taken aback by it. He said a couple times that it was like &amp;quot;reading the youtube comment section.&amp;quot; Apparently I was called a &amp;quot;snowflake&amp;quot; and dearest nfather wants to know when I&amp;#39;ll stop blowing up the entire family. DH called it a very angry letter. He said that a handful of times. Knowing nfather, I can imagine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel bad for DH. He was ready to craft a huge response and I&amp;#39;m sure it would have been a good one but we both know (he just needed reminding) that it would be a waste. My advice was to let it die or, if he wants to respond, keep it short. Something like &amp;quot;Wow.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because really, what&amp;#39;s nfather thinking? Trying to turn my own DH, who&amp;#39;s stood up for me in the past against nfather, into a FM? And not through some carefully worded appeal that might have a snowball&amp;#39;s chance of working but instead a double-barreled N anger attack? What sort of strategy is that? And the few attacks that DH relayed - apparently my shutting out the &amp;#39;whole family&amp;#39; is deeply distressing. Cluephone - I haven&amp;#39;t shut out anyone but him and n/emom. The reason no one else has heard from me is because THEY HAVEN&amp;#39;T TRIED. GC&amp;#39;s spouse deliberately left me off a group text about their kid&amp;#39;s health issues (but left DH on ... not sure if that was intentional. If it was, it&amp;#39;s terribly petty) and no one, not GC, not a single one of my aunts or uncles, no one has reached out to me in any way. Which is how it&amp;#39;s been for pretty much my life. For people so attached to me that not hearing from me in four months can &amp;#39;devastate&amp;#39; them, they sure have a weird way of showing it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing that nfather reached out is strange - I&amp;#39;m not actually upset.
