I am not sure where to start, I am honestly overwhelmed and exhausted even thinking about trying to sum up the last year of my life but I feel so low and need perspective from people who get it. A friend told me about this group a few months ago and I wrote it down in my journal. I found it tonight at one of my lowest moments and decided that it was a sign I needed to reach out for support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a 30 year old female. My mom has been an alcoholic and narcissist my entire life, although I just recently was able to put a name to it. My dad is a classic enabler. They have a loveless, co-dependent, cold and toxic marriage. I cannot remember even one time that my mom showed affection to my dad, unless is was during a rare period of mania where she was manipulating him to get something ahe wanted. Even so, I can count those instances on one hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have two younger brothers and tried to protect them from the cycle growing up. Always the same thing- build up, explosion, period of agony, sudden and unexplained reconcilliation without resolution.. repeat. Sometimes the cycle lasted a week, sometimes months. My dad has aways been &amp;quot;my person&amp;quot; and my little brothers are more like my sons. I love them dearlt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have literally been trying to save my mom and my parents since I was 12. My family would not acknowledge reality long enough to ever do anything but continue the cycle.  To make along story short: this summer my parents got the closest they have ever cometo divorcing. My dad was almost (i thought) to a point of dealing with reality. A few things that happened over 2 months:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-my mom kind of/almost joined a super religious strange cult with a married couple, got super close to them\n-decided on a whim that she wanted to buy their condo and sell my parents house. My dad said no way.\n-mom got obsessed, started scheming. Opened a secret bank account, took money etc. \n-kicked my dad out by having the locks changed when he came home from work one day\n-accused my father of running a national prostitution ring (not joking)\n-gathered his closest friends and men in his community and held an ambush &amp;quot;intervention&amp;quot; to out him, zero proof.\n-accused him of having an affair with a teenager, zero proof.\n-had our family dog put down suddenly for no medical reason.\n-secretly recorded my dad for a month, every interaction and conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This all happened the month I got married and while I was on my honeymoon. The entire time this is happening, I am trying to support my dad and he is depending on my family. I am not interacting with my mother. This is where is gets worse:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;get a call from my brother that my my mom is now accusing my dad of molesting my 3 year old daughter. Says she has proof. I immediately call her and demand to see the proof. She makes me come to her house where I hear a tape that is literally my parents having an unrelated conversation, one that has nothing to do with my daughter and one that my mom secretly recorded. She tries to spin a story about why it is proof. I tell her that if she makes this accusation again to anyone that I will get my lawyer involved immediately. She backs down. Found out she hinted at this accusation to police officers a few days before and made them listen to the tapes. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-get a call from my uncle who says my mom called him and accused my dad of raping her. He recorded the phone call and I listened. My mom accused my dad of rape using the exact words I told her the morning after I was raped by my abusive ex husband who I left after 7 years of marriage. She used my rape story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father knows about all of this, takes her back two days later. They are on a plane to florida for a romantic vacation 1 week later and move back in together immediately. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cut off contact with my parents that week and its been almost a year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad has recently pursued a friendship with my abusive ex and father of my child- the man who raped me. Also a narcisist. Calls him his son. My parents begin visiting his fiance at work, playing the sympathy card. He has visitation with my daughter and this is now becoming a massive problem. I have told them all to stop- no one cares. They have not allowed my parents to see my daughter because I have raised so much hell and got my lawyer to send a letter to all of them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad constantly shames me either via other people or through texts from numbers I havent blocked and now is rewriting history. I am cruel for cutting my mom out of mine and my daughters life.. and dramatic- his favorite shaming technique is to claim I have always needed attention by making my mom look bad etc etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hardest part is that my brothers, who I have always been very close to, now feel the same way. I have reached out to both on many occassions. They have not spoken to me or my daughter in months. My youngest brother is now spending time with my abusive ex husband. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot cut out my ex because my daughter needs me to stay present and involved- its not an option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have lost my entire family- I feel like they died and are coming back from the grave to make sure I know just how little I matter to them. I cannot escape the reminders of my rape or my family because the worlds ate colliding and I cannot run away because of my daughter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a wonderful husband and my daughter is safe and loved. She does not feel the stress of this situation. I feel like my heart is breaking and rebreaking every minute. I cannot catch my breath. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left my abusive, rapist ex husband. I cut off my parents. They are still tormenting me and I have no idea what the hell to do anymore. I miss my dad- but the dad I loved before I realized that he has been doing some version of this to me my entire life. I miss the dad I thought I had. I really miss my little brothers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The state I live in makes it very hard to take visitation away from a father. I was able to get him to sign off on full physical custody by agreeing to not move out of the state and agreeing not to ask for child support. My parents live in the same city we do. I literally feel trapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening. I dont even know what I am asking of you guys... I think that maybe I needed to remind myself that I am not crazy, I needed to remember what happened and I needed someone else to hear me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi all.
