To me it sounds as if you getting the financial independency is indeed because of YOU and what you did. *You* made it happen. *You* made the decision to stand up for yourself and take the step to freedom. *You* then did all the work: you searched for the information, filed the application, wrote all those shitty things to the paper for others to see while sweating tears and crying sweat, I suppose. *You* came here in search for more data to use, and found what you needed. *You* reached out to the instances/people you needed letters from, asking them for what you needed, and they responded to your requests and did exactly what they should have done.\n\nNow, don't sell yourself short. You did exactly what you set out to do, and you succeeded. Sure, you needed other people to write things, but that's normal, that's how the world works: you do need other people and their inputs every now and then. You used the system as it is supposed to be used, and it worked. It's not different than inputting numbers to a calculator and pressing a button - even if the machine did the actual work, the results were reached to under your direction. \n\nI mean, do you really think this would've had happened, had you just sat on your thumbs and waited? NO. It couldn't have. YOU made things happen. *You* did all the work!\n\nAnd the things you deserve - well, as a human being you deserve a fair chance in this world, you deserve freedom and right to education and all that, and the system managed to provide that. I'm well aware that it doesn't always do that, often things go wrong - but then, again, *you* had collected so much data for the system that the system worked the way they should have. Come on, be proud of your accomplishments!

To me it sounds as if you getting the financial independency is indeed because of YOU and what you did. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; made it happen. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; made the decision to stand up for yourself and take the step to freedom. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; then did all the work: you searched for the information, filed the application, wrote all those shitty things to the paper for others to see while sweating tears and crying sweat, I suppose. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; came here in search for more data to use, and found what you needed. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; reached out to the instances/people you needed letters from, asking them for what you needed, and they responded to your requests and did exactly what they should have done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, don&amp;#39;t sell yourself short. You did exactly what you set out to do, and you succeeded. Sure, you needed other people to write things, but that&amp;#39;s normal, that&amp;#39;s how the world works: you do need other people and their inputs every now and then. You used the system as it is supposed to be used, and it worked. It&amp;#39;s not different than inputting numbers to a calculator and pressing a button - even if the machine did the actual work, the results were reached to under your direction. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, do you really think this would&amp;#39;ve had happened, had you just sat on your thumbs and waited? NO. It couldn&amp;#39;t have. YOU made things happen. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; did all the work!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the things you deserve - well, as a human being you deserve a fair chance in this world, you deserve freedom and right to education and all that, and the system managed to provide that. I&amp;#39;m well aware that it doesn&amp;#39;t always do that, often things go wrong - but then, again, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; had collected so much data for the system that the system worked the way they should have.
