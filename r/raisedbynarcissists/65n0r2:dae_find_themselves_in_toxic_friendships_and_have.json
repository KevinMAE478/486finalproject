There's more to it as I said, and it happened over a period of 2 months, but that's the gist.  Now I'm basically friendless as well.  \n\nI'm very introverted and it's hard for me to get \"out there\" in the first place...  I also struggle and I'm over careful with other people's boundaries, in effect not asking them enough about themselves so it doesn't seem like I'm prying.  And I just seem to get stuck with these dud toxics...that's the ones that like me. I have another friend, but honestly, it's such a farce (making plans and she cancels 3 times in a row, talks only about herself and pretend listens/ends call when it's my turn, calls me because her car broke down and she needs to be picked up, etc..).  I do keep that one at a distance, and don't put too much (or any) emotions into that friendship.\n\nAgain, if anyone can recommend some good reading on the subject, about setting boundaries and generally how to exist in healthy friendships, I'd love to know.  \n\nedit: my mind is still blown that you posted something so similar to my own struggle, and I think the amount of comments and upvotes can attest to how common this is among ACONs... \n", "edited": 1492407015.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh my god, your post couldn&amp;#39;t be more timely... YES.  And it just happened to me again.  I was even going to create a post like yours, because I suspected this recurring problem might be related to being RBN... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t be mad at yourself.  Look - you realized that this issue exists, it&amp;#39;s a pattern, and you can make an educated guess that it&amp;#39;s a result of growing up in a toxic environment.  That&amp;#39;s the first huge step.  NOW, how do you (and all of us) fix this?  Could somebody recommend some good reading, or resources?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the basics would start with setting boundaries right off the get-go, and generally educating ourselves in the ways and tactics of the N, so we can spot them early.  But even this didn&amp;#39;t protect me this time.  I was friends with someone for 2 years - I volunteered for her in her charity.  I was basically a slave, and very devoted to the cause.  Then (long story), the basic summary is that I finally said NO.  And all hell broke loose. Immediately she launched into gaslighting, manipulation by guilt, manipulation and covertly putting me down... the list goes on.  It was like a child having a tantrum.  I never saw it coming.
