I was trying to explain the mindset of a close minded sexist pov and how a conservative older man will insult young woman by slut shaming, using the word whore etc but will also have no awareness of their part in the situation (even though there isn&amp;#39;t really a &amp;#39;situation&amp;#39; because I don&amp;#39;t believe anyone is ever a whore or whorish etc. it&amp;#39;s just a conflated stupid issue created by the controlling father). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also by saying the only way, I was just highlighting the fact that rent is enormous and impossible to pay by an unskilled young adult (or at least it is in Australia) so it&amp;#39;s 100% necessary to have more than one person paying. And young people banding together in a roommate situation is actually pretty rare not counting uni students who have a common goal to get degrees. I was trying to explain all this more on a societal level but it was far too late to reply so I was too tired to make sure my reply was comprehensible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I in no way ever would think that anyone is a whore  or &amp;#39;whorish&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "name": "t1_dg8i7fr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492159532.0, "created_utc": 1492130732.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7mz57", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RBNtossout", "parent_id": "t1_dg7m20t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/raisedbynarcissists", "controversiality": 0, "body": "While I agree with you that this behavior is ridiculous on the part of the parents, your comment has been removed for insinuating that women treated this way become \"whores\" to escape - moving in with a boyfriend or staying at a significant other's house do not make you a \"whore\", and that is not always \"saving\" the girl but rather a natural step in a relationship that also removes the victim from the abusive environment.
