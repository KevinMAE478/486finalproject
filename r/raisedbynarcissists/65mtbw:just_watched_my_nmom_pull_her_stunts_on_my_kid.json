I have social problems and a low self esteem because I was made to believe that every other girl in my class draws better, is prettier and learns better than me and i will end up being a whore exactly like my mother (my mom is a psychologist, making more money than dad and she is taking care of the house and everything else . She is an amazing decent person and a great mother but she is a whore in my Ngrandmother&amp;#39;s eyes). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So please, cut all the contact. We have to keep answering her calls and lie to her about our lives (she doesnt agree with my future plans of studying abroad or my brother playing any sport) or we&amp;#39;ll get in other endless useless fight with my dad which worships her.  DON&amp;#39;T FORCE YOUR KID TO STAY WITH YOUR NPARENTS.  This will impact his/her life and you&amp;#39;ll continue the circle abuse. Please, cut contact. Is hard for kids to oppose to such impossible individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "name": "t1_dgbzt91", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492375946.0, "created_utc": 1492347146.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2we9n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mtbw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc2wzq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cardinalseeker", "parent_id": "t3_65mtbw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/raisedbynarcissists", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My biggest regret is not cutting my parents off sooner.
