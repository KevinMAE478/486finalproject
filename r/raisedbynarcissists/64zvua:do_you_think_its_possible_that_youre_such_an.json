Most of my interactions with people have been painful (though admittedly, 99% of the people I&amp;#39;ve interacted with over the past 30 years have been rapacious, soulless venture capitalists without any morals or ethics). I have been married for 26 years, though am becoming and feeling increasingly isolated from my wife, who does not share my feelings of wanting to run way and hide from the human race. At nearly 60, I&amp;#39;m too old, too tired, and too broken to &amp;#39;start over&amp;#39; again. 40+ years of therapy, and trying many antidepressants and anxiolytics hasn&amp;#39;t helped much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my dilemma: do I give in to my feelings, and just become a recluse, live as much as a loner as possible for whatever time I have left, potentially also at the expense of my marriage? Or do I somehow keep &amp;#39;trying&amp;#39;, and if so, how?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "name": "t1_dgcvm3m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492420185.0, "created_utc": 1492391385.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2we9n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zvua", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ia77", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "justrealizednarciss", "parent_id": "t3_64zvua", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/raisedbynarcissists", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So is boundary pushing when someone talks about YOU instead of a subject?
