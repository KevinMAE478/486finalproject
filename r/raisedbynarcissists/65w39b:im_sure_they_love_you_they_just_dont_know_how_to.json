Some parents are not capable of love. Some parents are so damaged themselves, they cannot engage in healthy behavior--at best they can mime and pretend. Some parents may actually love their children, but love alone does not make one a fit parent. A stalker may &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; its victim, but you don&amp;#39;t think stalker and victim should sit down and try to work it out, do you?
