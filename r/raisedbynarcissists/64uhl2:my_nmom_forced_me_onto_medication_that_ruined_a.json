My parents had me on medication as a kid, but on one of the worst days of my young life, they took me off of it, cold turkey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see, this was the early 80&amp;#39;s, and medical consensus was that as ADHD children entered puberty, they &amp;quot;just got over it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember my nMom saying &amp;quot;you can&amp;#39;t take that, anymore&amp;quot; before sending me off to school.  I spent the entire time waiting for the bus crying my eyes out- I had been on ritalin since I was a small child- without it, well- my life collapsed.  I slowly recovered, bit by bit, but I went from being a good student, to being one of the worst in all of my classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I grew older, I got into trouble time and time again, because I couldn&amp;#39;t think like a normal human being- I was prone to impulsive, erratic behavior.  Once, I got myself into such a bad situation that I feared for my life, and had two choices: Move back in with nMom and Dad, and admit that I fucked up yet again, or just run as far as I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I chose the latter option.  I knew a few people in California, and had a chevron credit card- I didn&amp;#39;t inform my parents until I arrived in California after an absence of four days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That plan, of course, turned out to be yet another failure.  I was able to mooch off of people on the west coast for a while, but if there is one thing an unmedicated ADHD person cannot do, it&amp;#39;s get and hold down a job.  I drifted for three years, and when I was out of options and facing homelessness, I finally called, and begged my parents for a ticket back home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents didn&amp;#39;t know what to do with the person they met, when getting to the greyhound station.  Like most unmedicated ADHD people, I had taken to self-medicating with alcohol and cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My nMom came up with the brilliant damned idea of taking me to a doctor, and telling him that her son was clinically depressed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was the early 90&amp;#39;s, and Prozac was all the rage.  The doctor that my nMom took me to was not a psychiatrist- he was a medical doctor who literally had to pull books off of his shelf, to figure out what to do.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes- I was depressed- because I had been a failure my whole life, and had failed again.  It wasn&amp;#39;t for another few years that the medical community came to the realization that ADHD didn&amp;#39;t just &amp;quot;go away&amp;quot; with puberty.  Of course, I was put on Prozac- which was the WORST DRUG I could have been put on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It did nothing for my ADHD.  Because I just kept feeling like I didn&amp;#39;t know what the hell was going on, I continued self-medicating with alcohol which, in conjunction with the prozac, caused me to behave in a manner that was downright psychotic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day, my nMom would come to me, and say &amp;quot;aren&amp;#39;t you better, yet?  Those pills are so EXPENSIVE!&amp;quot;  Understand: when the doctor realized that one prozac didn&amp;#39;t do the job, he bumped me up to two a day- and then three, and was almost about to put me on four a day.  The pills back then were five dollars apiece.  If I didn&amp;#39;t give her glowing reviews, she would berate me about how ungrateful I was, because I just &amp;quot;refused&amp;quot; to get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My life continued to spiral out of control.  I entered college again, only to drop out two months later.  I was waking up in ditches.  I got two DUIs in less than a month.  When I wound up in jail for the fourth time,  My nMom declared that I was hopeless, and demanded that I move in to a long-term rehab facility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did, because I had no other choice than homelessness.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent 16 months in that rehab- mostly because I knew that as long as I was there, my nMom wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to shove any more pills down my throat.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once day, I got a job offer in New York, and left both rehab and my nMom behind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I was finally properly diagnosed as having adult ADHD, and medicated properly.  The day I started the treatment, it was as if my entire life finally made sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, my nMom calls me &amp;quot;crazy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;delusional&amp;quot; whenever I try to explain what went on.  She refuses to acknowledge any wrongdoing.  That&amp;#39;s fine- if she has to deny her role in things to make herself feel better- so be it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What galls me, however, is how she still blames ME for what happened, during the decade that she was insisting that I take drugs that were downright POISONOUS to me, on pain of being thrown onto the street.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t choose to have this condition- and I certainly didn&amp;#39;t choose the quack treatments she forced me into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it galls me, to this day, that my mother acts as if I am still the crazy person she created, when she brought a young kid into a hick doc&amp;#39;s office to be given poison.  She is emotionally invested in the idea that I am the crazy, dysfunctional mess that she created- even though I ceased being that person, years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any evidence that contradicts her view is perceived as an insult.  She WANTS to believe I am hopeless, miserable, and unemployable- and anything that contradicts this whips her into a frenzy of recrimination and insult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;#39;s an easier thing to believe, than that she did anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I don't know if any of you have had similar experiences.\n\nI am now 46 years old, and have been severely ADHD my entire life.
