It doesn&amp;#39;t add up to much, but there are a whole bunch of legit survey sites that give you points that are redeemable for gift cards. \n&lt;a href=\"https://social.i-say.com/surveys\"&gt;I-say&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.e-rewards.com/home.do\"&gt;E-Rewards&lt;/a&gt; are two that I do on my lunch break at work...I probably redeem about $100 a year in gift cards from these things.  It&amp;#39;s not like a real job, but those points can accrue for quite a while without expiring so you can wait to redeem them until after you&amp;#39;ve gotten out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone catches sight of the things and wonders what you&amp;#39;re doing, you can tell &amp;#39;em you&amp;#39;re gonna redeem your points for special treats on &amp;quot;the honeymoon&amp;quot; (gag) or whatever they&amp;#39;re most likely to believe. Just don&amp;#39;t say Christmas presents because that could arouse suspicions if you don&amp;#39;t actually follow through.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "name": "t1_dg7l7p0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492121332.0, "created_utc": 1492092532.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6razk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Throwawayhelp5462", "parent_id": "t1_dg6r3l9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/raisedbynarcissists", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My parents have agreed to let me work with Creeper once he's healed.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents have agreed to let me work with Creeper once he&amp;#39;s healed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "name": "t1_dg6razk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492068560.0, "created_utc": 1492039760.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6r3l9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 21, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wode23", "parent_id": "t3_651qwc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/raisedbynarcissists", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Imagining it is already horrendous for me.
