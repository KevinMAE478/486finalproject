She also forced me to go brisk walking with her, which I wouldn&amp;#39;t have minded if she had slowed down a little for me since I had short legs and my stamina was terrible, but instead she shouted at me because I couldn&amp;#39;t keep up with her, and refused to ever stop for breaks.

I was devastated because he cheated on me, and, driven purely by spite, I was determined to lose a ton of weight and look hotter than ever. I started exercising every day and eating about 700 calories a day. This continued for 2 months before my mother remarked that I was looking better than ever. However, after a while, people started to remark that I was losing weight too quickly. My mother only intervened when my grandfather (her dad) asked her if I was okay. I got a LONG lecture on healthy eating and not starving myself. Little does she know I&amp;#39;m only following the example she set when I was 11 years old.
