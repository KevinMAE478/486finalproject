My Nrents are pretty insane, but at least they&amp;#39;re not motivated enough to track me down.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, yeah. Super wrong about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a performer, and Nmom gatecrashed the theater this week. She wanted to see the show. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Husband was amazing--he intercepted her, put her on hold, got word back to me before she found me, and gave me the freedom and space and support to decide what was right for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gave it a little thought, and ended up with, &amp;quot;Eh. Let &amp;#39;er stay.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had a killer show, and I chatted with Nmom for about 45 minutes after. Here&amp;#39;s how it started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: I just had to see you, and I thought this was my last hope. And I was cleaning the house before we sell it and I found all of these things I KNOW YOU&amp;#39;LL WANT, but I didn&amp;#39;t know how to reach you! Life is so short, so before I&amp;#39;m gone and you&amp;#39;re gone, I wanted to find you and reach out so we can reconnect. I have so much pain and hurt in my life--I guess it comes from always taking on other people&amp;#39;s burdens--but I just want a relationship with you again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: So...that&amp;#39;s what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want. Did you think about what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; want? Because I made it pretty clear. Can you see how you showing up here is dramatic and inappropriate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RBNers, it was amazing. I watched her jump from tactic to tactic, and I felt like Neo in The Matrix. I saw the moves and the bullets coming in slo-mo and could deflect them with calm empathy and without engaging. She&amp;#39;s gonna die soon? Cool, but guilt doesn&amp;#39;t have a home here. She doesn&amp;#39;t know where I live? That&amp;#39;s a lie. I&amp;#39;ve gotten mail from her. She has things I&amp;#39;ll &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; want? Nah, I don&amp;#39;t negotiate ransoms--she can have them. She&amp;#39;s filled with pain? That&amp;#39;s sad, but it&amp;#39;s not my problem or my fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point, after telling me how she&amp;#39;s written me 90 apology letters, her mother was a &amp;quot;little Hitler who didn&amp;#39;t know how to love,&amp;quot; and she didn&amp;#39;t even know she was &amp;quot;playing a manipulative game because other people were manipulating&amp;quot; her, I asked her about a few moments of physical/emotional abuse, neglect, and rage on her part. I said, &amp;quot;Do you remember any of that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had almost no memory. &amp;quot;I had a lot going on then,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I had so much pain that maybe I just couldn&amp;#39;t handle yours, too. Or maybe we remember things differently. I mean, you were just a kid. Are you sure they even happened?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neo moment: Gaslighting? No thanks--I know what&amp;#39;s real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Mom, if you really don&amp;#39;t remember, I&amp;#39;m seriously concerned for your mental health, and there may be a much larger physical issue. You need to talk to a licensed professional, because something is seriously neurologically wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: [beat] Well, what can I do to have a relationship with you again?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Like I said, if you seek professional help for a diagnosis, and really make a good faith effort with a real doctor--not someone you turn into a drinking/shopping buddy--I would consider a conversation on my terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: I hear you. [beat] So, what can I do to start this relationship again?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I almost laughed, but again, kept calm Neo composure. This was just confirmation that nothing has changed and nothing will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Listen. It takes an enormous amount of mental and emotional and physical energy to have a relationship with you. You said it earlier--life is short--and I just don&amp;#39;t have the time to spend it with unhealthy, negative, angry people around me. A big part of being a mother is putting your kids&amp;#39; needs in front of your own--not all the time, but enough of the time to matter. You don&amp;#39;t know how to do that, and I can see that because you&amp;#39;re here today going after what you want instead of putting me first and prioritizing what I want. If you get the help you need, I hope you&amp;#39;ll understand that we&amp;#39;re both happier not being in each other&amp;#39;s lives, and that I didn&amp;#39;t separate from you to be mean--I did it to save myself. From you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: I just want you to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I am, and I am happy without this relationship. No more of this &amp;quot;showing up.&amp;quot; Please, get help, be well, and do not contact me again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She started spinning out, so I ended the conversation, told her I wished her happiness, and went back into the theater to talk to my husband, friends, and FOC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re all calling me Season 7 Buffy right now, and I can&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;m lucky enough to have these amazing people in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time she shows--and I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;ll be a next time--I&amp;#39;ll be ready with, &amp;quot;This is inappropriate. You are not welcome here.&amp;quot; And I&amp;#39;ll consider a restraining order. But this time, the talk felt good. I used exactly the amount of energy and time I felt comfortable using, I honored my curiosity without hurting myself, and I Neo&amp;#39;d the shit out of that talk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May all your Narc conversations be so victorious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy Easter, RBN.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Wow--thanks so much for the gold, fellow warrior!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I've (mostly) lurked on RBN for a while, and after reading a lot of your posts about NC Nrents just showing up on your doorstep, I thought, \"That's horrible!

This experience haunts me to this day, I wish I could have handled it like a pro like you did :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Btw I say ENan with a question mark because this behaviour makes me think she might be a Narc but again she may have been just doing what my NDad instructed her. Also sorry if this is long I just wanted to express my admiration and share this story and also ask for advice to handle the situation if this ever arises again. I know my sister&amp;#39;s Mum was very unhappy about it at the time because her daughter was manipulated but mostly she tries to get me to break NC with my Dad to so I don&amp;#39;t get much support from her.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "name": "t1_dgduyap", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492481270.0, "created_utc": 1492452470.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
