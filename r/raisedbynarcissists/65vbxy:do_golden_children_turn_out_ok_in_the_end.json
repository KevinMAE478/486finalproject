There are, after all, multiple types. To put it in broad terms:\n\n* **The Trophy**. This GC exists, according to the Narc, *exclusively* to make them look good. The Narc will support and even pamper the GC in aspects of the GC that reflect well on the Narc and be ruthlessly critical, controlling, and scornful (or worse) in others. Any slip by the GC that reflects poorly on the Narc will be met with hostility and coercion, as though the slip was an outright betrayal of the Narc. These GCs, consequentially, feel that the Narc reduces their personhood and treats them like an object, a machine to be \"fixed\" when it doesn't perform. Serious issues are inevitable. Verdict: Doesn't end well, leads to struggles with identity and self worth.\n\n* **The Pet**. This GC is harmonious with the Narc (whether by nature or by manipulation) and generally avoids much in the way of negative fallout from their \"relationship\" with the Narc. This post is commonly, but not always, inhabited by fellow Narcs or those whose FLEAs have made them very Narc-like. This type of GC engages in a lot of mirroring of the Narc and thus typically keeps in the Narcs good graces. Unlike 'The Trophy', 'The Pet' doesn't have nearly as much expectations placed on them by the Narc -- they generally fly under the radar of the Narc's aims and ambitions because they're deemed a \"neutral\" element in the Narc's worldview (not a threat, not a conquest, not a tool). This GC is a constant, reliable source of supply for the Narc, and thus they seldom get pushed very hard by the Narc. Verdict: less traumatized, but more likely to perpetuate and thereby harm others.\n\n* **The Responsible One**. This type of GC lives a very conditional, reward-and-punishment existence where interactions with the Narc are concerned. 'The Responsible One' is actively expected to enable the Narc as well as fulfill, even **foresee**, the Narc's needs and wants. This role constantly teeters back and forth between the favored treatment afforded a GC (when they've \"done well\") and SG (forced to take the fall for anything conceivably their fault when things go wrong). In abusive families with more than one child this is traditionally the label forced onto the oldest (unless the Nparents deem them an \"irresponsible\" SG or opt for one of the other GC types). This type of GC can, consequentially, develop a dangerous degree of loyalty to the Narc, mistaking their treatment for being \"fair\", \"impartial\", or \"just\"... but discovering the truly capricious, self-serving nature of the Narc can trigger a crisis of logic and identity. Verdict: Doesn't usually end well, though whether or not the illusion of the Narc's trustworthiness gets broken leads to very different outcomes.\n\nThose are the ones that come to mind off the top of my head, but I'll bet there are at least a few more.
