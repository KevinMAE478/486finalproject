I&amp;#39;ve posted in &lt;a href=\"/r/DysfunctionalFamily\"&gt;/r/DysfunctionalFamily&lt;/a&gt; in the past about my father.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father was always strict growing up. He was the head of the house, and controlled EVERYTHING. He lost his job of 32 years in 2001. He turned to alcohol and became emotionally abusive. A few times it became physical. The same year it started I met my now husband online. He got me through the worst years of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father tried to control everything I did. If something broke, it was my fault. I was his verbal punching bag. I got bullied all through school, and some of the worst of it started when I entered high school, also in 2001. I woke up, went to school, dealt with bullying on the bus ride there, bullying in class, bullying on the bus ride home, then rounds of verbal battering once I got home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had nowhere to go. The nearest family was over 1500 miles away in another country. I stood up to him multiple times, turned into violent screaming matches. The man just never let up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was pressured into applying to university when I was 17. Dad said I was too smart for college, even though the rest of the family was pushing for me to do college instead. I went for university and struggled through my first year. I ended up flunking out. I tried to find a way not to go home, but I had no choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When my father finally found out I flunked out, he let me know every single day that I was a failure and would amount to nothing. I went back to high school partly to escape him. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be here. I worked 2 jobs and paid rent to live at home, and my Dad would get pissed that I didn&amp;#39;t help around the house. I wasn&amp;#39;t around that much and he didn&amp;#39;t tell or ask me to help, just told me off for not helping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was out of there 10 months later. I could not deal with anymore of that. Reapplied to go back for summer session at university. Dad kept saying, &amp;quot;If they let you back in&amp;quot;, and kept hounding me about it. When I got accepted he was so &amp;quot;proud&amp;quot; of me and then reminded me not to fuck it up again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though he was 4 hours away he still controlled me, manipulated me, abused me. I wanted so bad to cut him out of my life, but I didn&amp;#39;t feel it was ever an option. He kept calling me selfish. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t recognize this was abuse until 2008. I was home for a visit, and my mother and I were watching an episode of Law &amp;amp; Order. The episode talked about a mother abusing her son in much the same manner my father has abused me. It was a hard pill to swallow. Six months later, I had a mental breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been in and out of university. I keep struggling hard to get through, feeling forced to go back by him. He had an RESP for me, and he didn&amp;#39;t want it wasted. I was in no shape to deal with school, but I kept going back because I was so scared of what he would do if I didn&amp;#39;t. Visits home result in me putting my defenses up. I can&amp;#39;t let them go until I&amp;#39;m on the train home, away from him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In May of 2014 I confronted him about the abuse. He shut me down, so I cut him off for 3 1/2 months. It was the longest I&amp;#39;d ever gone not speaking to him, and it freed me of his control, or at least I like to tell myself that. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be truly free of it until he is gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a number of flaws and things I struggle with because of his abuse. I&amp;#39;ve got severe anxiety and depression. I get so angry sometimes, and it&amp;#39;s difficult to contain that anger. I have low self esteem. My usual coping mechanisms would involve extreme escapism, avoiding everything, and binge eating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have problems letting people in and keeping in touch. Sometimes this leaves me feeling like I&amp;#39;m alone when I know it&amp;#39;s not true. I can become paranoid sometimes over what I&amp;#39;ve said to others or what others might think about a particular thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate what he&amp;#39;s done to me. I&amp;#39;ve pushed a lot of distance between us over the last few years. He can no longer control my actions, manipulate me. He doesn&amp;#39;t get any input on my life decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a card today from him for my birthday next week. Included was a necklace which I&amp;#39;m never going to wear. It says: &amp;quot;To my daughter: Always remember you are BRAVER than you believe, STRONGER than you seem, SMARTER than you think, and LOVED more than you know. Love Dad.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really want to smash it with a hammer. Ugh.
