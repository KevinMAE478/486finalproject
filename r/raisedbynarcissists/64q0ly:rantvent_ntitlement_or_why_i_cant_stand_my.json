It wasn\u2019t. I had a deadline to move out of my then apartment, was struggling to find another I could afford and was preparing for the inevitable move when I successfully found somewhere. To be fair to her, she did offer to stay in a hotel. Unfortunately, any consideration she showed was spoiled when she said, \u201cI will come anyway, even if you can\u2019t see me. I can have a holiday in your city,\u201d which would have created an obligation for me to see her regardless.

I won\u2019t describe them all, but here\u2019s one incident that\u2019s notable because I was newly aware of what she was up to, although still developing a protocol to deal with it. I was in a very stressful year at uni. She knew that, although like many things in my life I don\u2019t think she bothered to understand what it meant for me. In that same year she was organising an overseas holiday to visit my aunt and uncle, whom she was going to stay with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s call my aunt \u201cJan\u201d. I love my aunt and uncle very much. They\u2019re the family I wish I\u2019d had and Aunt Jan is one of my closest confidantes. Aunt Jan emailed me because she hadn\u2019t heard from my mother for well over a month and asks if I can see where her planning is at. Aunt Jan has no idea that I\u2019ve minimised contact with my mother to the degree that I have and doesn\u2019t realise it causes me huge stress, or she wouldn\u2019t have asked. She\u2019s no flying monkey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With leaden reluctance I called my mother. To my great relief I got her answering machine and left a short message asking her to give Aunt Jan an update. I shouldn\u2019t have breathed a sigh of relief so soon. She called ME instead and rattled off a rapid fire list of things she wanted me to pass on to Aunt Jan. I was stressed as hell from uni and got cranky. I told her, \u201cMum, I\u2019m nowhere near a pen or paper and I\u2019ll never remember all that. Second, I\u2019m not your secretary. Third, if you could pick up the phone and call me, why on Earth couldn\u2019t you call Aunt Jan directly?\u201d She pulled out the manipulation. \u201cIt won\u2019t take you long,\u201d she said, a phrase I recognise as a guilt trigger. So I compromised a bit and told her \u2013 very firmly \u2013 that I\u2019d tell Aunt Jan the gist, but that in future she\u2019d need to contact my aunt directly because I wouldn\u2019t do it again. It seems to have worked because she never asked again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A part of me feels like an idiot for writing this out as if it\u2019s a big deal \u2013 but then I remember she feels entitled to favours from other people too. She once wanted to put her building manager as a contact for her monitored alarm system without asking him first.
