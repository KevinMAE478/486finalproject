Within a few months I learned about the way he thinks about and treats the women in his life. Its bad, lots of belittling and arrogance. He told me he beats one of his gfs for no reason, and enjoys calling any of them in the middle of the night just to get angry at them. Has specifically said he loves to control people, everyone.\nOne thing that kept us close was our deep conversations about touchy subjects without tension or volume elevating. But one night we had a long talk about rape and rape culture. A lot of what he had to say felt like direct quotes from the people that deny rape culture exists, victim blame, and struggle with the idea of affirmative consent. We talked about ghosting once too. He&amp;#39;s on the side that it&amp;#39;s always cowardly, and if the ghostee is abusive or dangerous, they&amp;#39;re entitled closure, explanation, or chance to redeem themselves.\nHe&amp;#39;s recorded himself having sex with girlfriends without their knowledge or permission, and I live in constant paranoia that my apartment is bugged.\nAnd to top it all off, he&amp;#39;s been questioning the reasoning behind age of consent laws a lot lately, and often makes jokes about traveling to countries with lower ages of consent. He&amp;#39;s shown me the porn he likes, extremely petite and youthful, some videos with models that look like young trafficked sex slaves.\nOur lease is up in 2 weeks. He can sense I&amp;#39;ve distanced myself from him. I&amp;#39;ve never ghosted someone I was this close with before. But in the time I&amp;#39;ve been exposed to his true nature, I just dont see the point in keeping him around. I don&amp;#39;t enjoy his company, his EXTREMELY dark and I mean fucked up dark (fucking children dark) sense of humor (if it could be called that). He always says he doesn&amp;#39;t really care about those closest to him, but gets furious when a friend of his gf leaves a smiley face emoji as a comment on her Facebook photos. \nIf he ghosted me id be relieved. I&amp;#39;m 110% over this former friend of mine. But something feels weird. I know I&amp;#39;m not responsible for this guys mental or emotional well being, but I know he might throw a fit, threaten suicide, or attempt to make me feel guilty for it. This really sucks. Sorry for the post being so long. I spent a lot of time editing it shorter.\nWhat can I do to feel more confident about ghosting? Should I at all? \nEDIT: I mentioned that his preferred porn features models that look like sex slaves, I&amp;#39;m just saying that&amp;#39;s what it looks like. He&amp;#39;s smart with computers and the law and knows better than to watch illegal stuff casually. But the fact that he prefers smaller framed performers along with his attitudes towards age, it may be safe to say this guy might have a thing for kids. And its just now surfacing.
