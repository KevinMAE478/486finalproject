My ndad was fond of making Christmas into sob stories and trying to start arguments. Hated everyone opening presents. Birthdays were similar. His birthday had to be perfect. Fathers day, oh god. The horror. My birthday was more of me and my mother. He hid all day, didn&amp;#39;t speak to me, got mad at me for existing. He still finds every reason for me not to hang out with the few friends I was able to sustain. If he has to lay around all day and be mad, so does everyone else, it seems. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists", "name": "t1_dg87wkg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492146056.0, "created_utc": 1492117256.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2we9n", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655h6h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8b5pv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "little_plum", "parent_id": "t3_655h6h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/raisedbynarcissists", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm sorry that happened to you, and you are definitely not an ingrate.\n\nYou didn't ask to be born, any more than you asked to be treated like shit.
