He would get up and watch loud movies at night (for a season, my sister was right behind the wall where the tv was) and he would laugh at us or get mad when we begged him to turn down the volume so we could sleep. &amp;quot;You won&amp;#39;t always get your beauty sleep when you&amp;#39;re an adult, &amp;quot; he&amp;#39;d reply. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, godammit, if you so much as made noise by walking to the kitchen and opening the refrigerator door while he was sleeping at midnight, he&amp;#39;d roll out of bed and come out and treat you like you were some sort of crazy loud person who was being an abnormal freak for being up so late for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He would also keep me awake for hours after dinner, ranging into the wee hours of the morning, rambling on about life lessons. If I fidgeted or tried to make indirect shows that I wanted to the end the conversation and do other things like sleep, he would take it as an affront and lecture me on being stiff-necked and rebellious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I just think back on his reprisals and think, &amp;quot;No, you control freak! Normal people don&amp;#39;t need to lock their kids in hours-long conversations for &amp;#39;lessons.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; I seriously think dad could use some therapy.
