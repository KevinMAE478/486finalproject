In fact, Jesus often called out hypocrites, so it&amp;#39;s not hard to find examples of this, but there is more that I will be adding that I hope highlights where you can take a stand biblically and how. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything contained in the bible is fulfilled and exemplified through Jesus. The point of every law, commandment, and rule is to point the way to living the honest and sincere life that Jesus did. To understand better what a rule is about, look to Jesus, and if it is not addressed there, the books following Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John clarify a lot. Ns will filter the bible through their understanding, and teach it to their end, rather than look at what Jesus was actually doing. Citing anything Jesus did that contradicts a bad statement claiming authority from faith is a great go to. After all, if Jesus isn&amp;#39;t the most important person in their Christian life, you can ask them who is? Watch them dance as they try to deflect the fact that it&amp;#39;s them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2nd letter of Peter Chapter 2 Verse 3, Peter highlights those who use greed to exploit people with false teachings will not be forgotten, but remembered among those who are condemned. It says in no uncertain terms that they will not be spared, comparing them to the angels who sinned, that even they were cast into hell. I mention this for your benefit, that, if you can get your parents to admit that they were wrong, and you feel like taking it to the next level, you can sling this verse at them for a wake up call, if they have some semblance of sanity about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the go to verses is the woman caught in adultery. People, ready to stone her, were called out big time when Jesus is like, &amp;quot;Alright, since you are all so righteous, let anyone who has never sinned be the first to stone her. No one? No takers? Yeah, I thought so.&amp;quot; -Paraphrased from John 8:1-11. Jesus highlighted that everyone has sinned, and that people were motivated by self righteousness, not love. This was not the intent of the law, since after all, Jesus, who was without sin, did not stone her, which by his words he set the standard to do so. Instead, he saw the brokenness of the woman, and sought to show her mercy, and forgiveness. Any time an N in your life has refused to show you mercy and judged you, they have opened themselves to the same judgement. Matthew 7:1-5 makes this explicit, and I recommend quoting at least the first two verses if need be, to put an N in their place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lepers and Disabled people are healed often enough in the bible that it&amp;#39;s worth looking at what follows that. People at the time had the idea that if you were born blind, your parents had sinned, and you were blind because of it. Same for lepers, and they were excluded fully from society in almost every way. In the old testament, it sets fourth rules on separating lepers from society, and also how the Jewish religious leaders were to determine if a person had been healed from leperacy. Which, had never needed to be referenced, because while 2 people were healed from leperacy before Jesus in the bible, neither went before the leaders to be evaluated. Then Jesus heals 10 at once and sends them to the leaders. The point of this is that to be healed of either would mean that you had a means to earn a living, build a life, and integrate back into society as a normal, functioning person. Jesus sought to do this in all sorts of situations. So, for an N to try to sabatoge your ability to do anything, you can call them out on the fact that Jesus sought to restore people to a life of their own, not cripple them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians Chapter 13 highlights what love really is: Patient, kind, etc. If an N tries telling you that they love you, you can rebut that they have not been patient, kind, etc, which are the basic requirements of love. This one is pretty straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Chapter 23 addresses the hypocrisy of the scribes and pharisees who will readily set high standards for people, but do nothing to actually help people achieve them. To do anything in life you need the proper tools. The tools to study effectively for school, the tools to socialize, etc. Ns will  often do the same, setting people up to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m beginning to nod off, but I hope that this at least helps confront the bad teaching that may still plague people on this sub, and give you the ability to find comfort in justice being delivered to Ns who abuse with false teaching, according to the very bible they claim to represent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy Easter, and I wish you the best.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "With Easter weekend coming up, Nparents all over the Christian world are gearing up to criticize their children's religious shortcomings.
