I started talking to my parents individually and although there was a lot of fear and fighting and them blaming me I felt like I was getting through to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then a magical week happened, both of my parents separately told me that they wanted to do whatever it took to repair our relationship. My mom promised that she would talk to me about me, communicate more and honestly.

She has also stopped with the &amp;quot;You never x&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad was wonderful. He was supportive and rational and while sometimes he looked a little bit grumpy if we were talking about something he didn&amp;#39;t like, but that was the extent of his old temper. I now realize I had a bit of a red flag, he kept blaming a lot of things on my mom. Especially childhood things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything I built up with my dad was destroyed yesterday. He wanted to hold a family meeting because my brother had done &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;2 years&amp;quot;. My brother has Autism, severe anxiety, and depression. He went to 2 different universities for 2 years, and then took a year off because he realized he had NO idea what he wanted to or could do. I told him to use the time to start therapy, make some friends, and build up skills to see what interested him. HE DID!! He even found a job (on his own) AS A FUCKING TELEMARKETER!!! He saw it as an opportunity to work on his anxiety when talking to people!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet to my dad, all of this was nothing. I know my brother still has a lot of trouble standing up to my parents, so I went into the family meeting knowing I&amp;#39;d be doing a lot of talking for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad opened up by speaking on behalf of my mother, and getting angry when she decided to speak for herself instead. He then told my brother that because &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;ve been doing nothing for 2 years&amp;quot; that he would be signing up for university near my parents house so he could live with them. That my parents would be monitoring his food, when he studied, when he was allowed to do fun things, when he was going to the gym, and what his grades and attendance were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I immediately turned to my brother and said, &amp;quot;You have the right to say no, to all of that. You don&amp;#39;t have to do any of it if you don&amp;#39;t want to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This turned into a 3 hour fight between me and my dad. I refused to lie. I refused to back down. I also refused to be ashamed of the things he wanted me to feel shame for. It was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also frustrating! Because about 50% of the argument went like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: You cannot force and push him to do things like this, it&amp;#39;s his life and his decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ndad: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not forcing him, it is his decision&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;But you&amp;#39;re saying his HAS TO do this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ndad: &amp;quot;He does have to do it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;When you say he &amp;#39;has to&amp;#39; it sounds like you&amp;#39;re trying to force him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ndad: &amp;quot;What else can I do? He doesn&amp;#39;t do it if I ask nicely or offer to help him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;So you are trying to force him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ndad: &amp;quot;NO, I&amp;#39;m not forcing him. He just has to do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Round and round and round we went. Then he kept screaming at me for nitpicking. The rest of the argument was everything from the way he treats my brother to how our childhood went. The gaslighting was ever present.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, for our closing act, I realized he was starting to wear his murder face and was completely ignoring everything I said and just kept repeating how disrespectful I was. I got emtional for about 4 seconds at some point and slammed my fist on the table before calming myself again and continuing, but he couldn&amp;#39;t let go of how &amp;quot;disrespectful&amp;quot; it was for me to lose my temper. I said &amp;quot;I think we need to stop, this isn&amp;#39;t going anywhere.&amp;quot; He says, &amp;quot;Well, I&amp;#39;m done with this conversation. I think we should stop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just happily agreed and went outside to cry. I&amp;#39;m really proud of myself. I did very well. At the same time, I&amp;#39;m devastated I believed change was possible. I don&amp;#39;t know if I can ever trust him again. I don&amp;#39;t know if I should.

Think about it. It's like if they just one day woke up and had sudden amnesia. Like that movie 50 First Dates. They would not remember **a thing** they ever did to you. But you.. You would have to live with the painful memories forever. And what's worse, is you couldn't even hate them for it anymore. Because they wouldn't understand why. \n\nTheir new feelings would get in the way of you properly hating them. They would no longer deserve it. You would be hating a ghost. Your mortal enemy replaced by some kind gentle soul who just wants to be your friend. Who just wants to love you like you always wanted them to. Could you really continue the NC/GR? Would your empathy not get in the way? Look how sad they are.. And this time it's for real. Not just a trick or a trap.\n\nI wonder how many would chose to take that chance and have the relationship they never had.

And that mask becomes known as NPD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But on another note. Given the option to have your narc abuser truly 100% change. Would you really take that option? Is that really something you would want? Think about it. It&amp;#39;s like if they just one day woke up and had sudden amnesia. Like that movie 50 First Dates. They would not remember &lt;strong&gt;a thing&lt;/strong&gt; they ever did to you. But you.. You would have to live with the painful memories forever.

Because they wouldn&amp;#39;t understand why. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their new feelings would get in the way of you properly hating them. They would no longer deserve it. You would be hating a ghost. Your mortal enemy replaced by some kind gentle soul who just wants to be your friend. Who just wants to love you like you always wanted them to. Could you really continue the NC/GR? Would your empathy not get in the way? Look how sad they are.. And this time it&amp;#39;s for real. Not just a trick or a trap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many would chose to take that chance and have the relationship they never had.
