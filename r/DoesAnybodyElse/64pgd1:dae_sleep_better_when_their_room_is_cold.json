I know in MA, central air is an option still in new construction and generally considered a luxury, as heating can be handled by room radiators and the summers are survivable, although typically you see central heating in most construction since the sixties.  But in FL new residential construction without A/C doesn&amp;#39;t meet code in many places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My property management company explicitly lists failed A/C when the outside temperature is &amp;gt;85 as a legitimate maintenance emergency.
