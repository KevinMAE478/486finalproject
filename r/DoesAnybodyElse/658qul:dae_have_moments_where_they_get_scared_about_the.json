Then again there's so many people coming out of schools so there isn't a lot of quality control on that.\n\nI went to C R England's school in Cedar Hill, TX. The school is originally three weeks but waiting on the federal driving test can take a while. Mine was I think a week and a half after I was completely done. All the school is for is to teach you what you need to know for the test. For anybody who goes through the school you have to complete 9 months of work to pay the \"free\" school off, but 6 months for veterans. But you'll get the chance to meet the people you'll be working with. Also, if you go through this company and happen to go to this location, I don't give two shits what other people say. There is no bug problem in the hotel unless you're the one leaving food out all day. \n\nThings aside. The company definitely needs more time and through put into training. My teammate didn't know a lot of macros or when to use them because his trainer was on dedicated. (The Qualcomm system is there to \"text\" whoever you need to in the company for when you arrive, have mechanical issues, etc.) In training you're either taught to use only one backing maneuver or find a pull-through spot. There will be places where either of these will not, and I say NOT, applicable. But since I have a good partner we always help each other out. The company is all about safety but there's always going to be something you'll run into that you wish was a part of training. \n\nSo aside from the company, I've seen some cool places so far. The truck is your own little house on the road. I haven't started to decorate a whole lot but unless you have to move to a different truck, you can basically do what you want with it. Sleeping while in motion - you'll be surprised what you can really sleep through. I get better sleep on the truck (when I keep the same drive schedule) than at home. Some of the shippers and customers can be really cool in looks of the place and helpful towards you. One place I went to was inside an old limestone mine. There will be some that are complete assholes and certain yards may seem like you're dodging some of the yard dogs. Its just like getting a bad customer at a restaurant. It happens. You'll definitely see the country side as well and from what I've seen in the daytime Oregon is my favorite. East Texas is nice too but then again I live in that area. \n\nBut it is one of those jobs where it may not always be for everybody but you can at least try it. And when you get your class A CDL you can drive anything in B or C classes as well. Just keep in mind not all of those are going go be truck and trailer vehicles and some other things may require endorsements, like passenger and school bus are ones you'll need if you want to go that route. You may find that if you go with 'x' company that you'll get the good side of it and you may not. Some people have gone go different companies and liked it there more. I'm just waiting to see how the rest of my contract goes before I decide to keep going with it or find something else. \n\nAnd if you do go this route, one of the first things you should purchase is a fridge. You can get them at a truck stop that plugs into the cigarette lighter and run no problem. Some of the lunch box style coolers won't work. Also there are cool apps that you should get. Trucker Path will show you all truck parking areas and if they have been noted as full, some or no spots from someone else who's there and whether or not weigh stations are open. \n\nSo feel free to try it.
