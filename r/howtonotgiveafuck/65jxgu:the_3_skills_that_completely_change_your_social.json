I feel like you&amp;#39;re judging me.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not judging you.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I said. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It was just a suggestion.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was not listening.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how I experienced it, her experience was that I was judging her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bad listener focuses on explaining his own experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good listener focuses on learning about the other person&amp;#39;s experience:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Which part makes you feel like I&amp;#39;m judging you?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Was it what I said, or how I said it?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;How would you like me to make suggestions in future? Or would you prefer it if I didn&amp;#39;t make suggestions?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good listener improves the way he relates with the other person by learning how they think. Learning what&amp;#39;s important to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bad listener learns nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At an interview for a sales job I was asked &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;How will you bring us 10 new clients in your first month?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t have an answer prepared. I panicked and blurted out the usual ways of reaching new clients. It was an empty, generic answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was not listening. Any monkey could&amp;#39;ve rattled off that list.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the interviewer asked that question what he really wanted to know was: &amp;quot;Does this guy know what he is doing?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good listener would&amp;#39;ve unpacked the interviewer&amp;#39;s question and learned what the interviewer was looking for:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You know I haven&amp;#39;t really thought about specific strategies. What&amp;#39;s your biggest bottleneck right now in getting new clients on board?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good listener aims to understand deeply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bad listener misses the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill #2 - How to quickly find common interests (not the way you&amp;#39;re thinking)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get stuck in polite conversation. There&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;skin&amp;quot; invested in it. You&amp;#39;ve got to get at least a little bit naked (so to speak) in order to make friends with someone. Here&amp;#39;s how you do it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We humans have just 4\u00ad-8 basic emotions, depending on which study you read: joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger and anticipation. Everything we experience triggers a combination of these basic emotions. There aren\u2019t that many combinations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We may not have experienced the same activities, but we have experienced the same emotions. So when I say you need to find common interests, I mean you need to find something that sparks similar emotions \u200bin both of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say Felipe is studying to be an architect, and Manuela is studying to be a doctor. Felipe doesn\u2019t care about medicine and Manuela doesn\u2019t care about Architecture. They ask each other polite questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Felipe&lt;/em&gt;: Oh I hear you have to study for a long time to be a Doctor. How many years do you have left?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manuela&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, I\u2019ve got another 2 years. 7 total. Although you never really stop learning. What do you want to design when you graduate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Felipe&lt;/em&gt;: Bridges. I mainly want to design bridges. But I guess I\u2019d be happy designing anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manuela&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah I know what you mean, I just want to graduate already as well!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is pretty boring, right? Neither of them are offering or asking for emotional information. You need to make an effort to understand\u200b them. This chit\u00adchat isn\u2019t going to cut it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this level of conversation they have to keep thinking of new topics every few seconds. The ideas will dry up pretty soon. This is why conversations often feel like hard work. It\u2019s much easier to pause and explore one topic for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here\u2019s what you do...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don\u2019t just listen to respond. You listen to understand. You go deeper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offer your own emotional information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AND dig for their emotional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep digging until you understand their way of thinking. Until you feel the emotion they\u2019re talking about. Then show them that you understand by sharing a similar experience of your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These questions are your friends:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT do you like about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT made you want that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT scares you about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially any question that uncovers \u201cWhat makes you feel that way?\u201d or \u201cWhat makes you think that way?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WHAT tends to work better than WHY because WHAT feels like you\u2019re curious and WHY can sometimes feel like an attack. \u201cWHY do you like that?&amp;quot; \u201cBecause I do. What&amp;#39;s your problem?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So back to Felipe and Manuela. Now that they know how to \u201clisten to understand\u201d, how does their conversation go?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Felipe&lt;/em&gt;: I mainly want to design bridges. But I guess I\u2019d be happy designing anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manuela&lt;/em&gt;: What do you like about designing bridges specifically?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Felipe&lt;/em&gt;: Well I haven&amp;#39;t actually designed one yet, but for some reason I keep picturing myself standing on top of a huge bridge that I designed. I don\u2019t know. It just makes me feel alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manuela&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah that sounds pretty cool. What do you mean by \u2018alive\u2019 though?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Felipe&lt;/em&gt;: Hmm, well the bridge started as an idea in my head, and now I\u2019m standing on it. It\u2019s like having ultimate control over everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manuela&lt;/em&gt;: Oh I know that feeling! That\u2019s how I feel when I think of saving someone\u2019s life at the last minute in the emergency room. Boom\u2026 Doctor In\u00adcontrol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Felipe&lt;/em&gt;: Haha. Is that what made you decide to become a Doctor? Because you like feeling in\u00adcontrol?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manuela&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, I guess it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Felipe&lt;/em&gt;: Wow. That\u2019s the same reason I decided to be an architect. So does that mean you hate it when other people boss you around too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manuela&lt;/em&gt;: OMG that\u2019s the worst!! I can\u2019t stand it when other people tell me what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fun! Turns out they\u2019re both control freaks. THAT\u2019s their common interest. Now they can geek out on that instead of churning through countless emotionless topics that they don\u2019t connect on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill #3 - How to never run out of things to say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a conversational D-pad. It gives you something to say whenever you run out of things to say. &lt;a href=\"https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e224450f4171c011a6efbb1c76115ba5-c?convert_to_webp=true\"&gt;These are the controls.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say you\u2019re in a conversation about cars, and you don\u2019t know anything about cars. You run out of things to say. What are your options? &lt;a href=\"https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-57d508d0dbb2f7dd4fecfefc555ad0f3?convert_to_webp=true\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s your conversational D-pad for cars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people prefer to &lt;em&gt;zoom out&lt;/em&gt;. They think and talk about general things: ideas and concepts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people prefer to &lt;em&gt;zoom in&lt;/em&gt;. They think and talk about specific things: details and examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ve probably had conversations with people where you just don\u2019t click with them. It could be because you prefer to zoom in and they prefer to zoom out, or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elena&lt;/em&gt;: How was your day?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pablo&lt;/em&gt;: Good. Productive. I got a lot done. How was yours?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elena&lt;/em&gt;: Well! When I woke up I made toast, with butter and vegemite. I left it in the toaster a little too long and it got a bit burnt, but I scraped it off with a knife and it was fine. Then I cycled to work. I went down Oxford Street this time instead of my usual route down Henry Cotton Drive because I wanted a change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boss didn\u2019t have anything for me to do today so I made an appointment to see the Doctor next Wednesday at 5pm and spent the rest of the day on Facebook chatting to Sofia about her baby, Ivan, who has a cold and Esteban about his new Porsche. Then I came home down Oxford Street again because it was so lovely in the morning. It wasn\u2019t as nice in the evening. And now I\u2019m talking to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pablo&lt;/em&gt;: So was your day good or not?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elena&lt;/em&gt;: I want to know what you did all day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pablo likes ideas and concepts (zoomed out). Elena likes details and examples (zoomed in).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pablo is bored senseless by Elena\u2019s details and Elena feels like Pablo doesn\u2019t want to share things with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pablo is interested in the big picture. He wants to understand the point of what Elena is telling him. What does it mean? Did she have a good day or a bad day?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elena is interested in specifics. She wants to know what made Pablo\u2019s day good or bad. What does he mean by \u2018productive\u2019? What did he get done?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in a conversation that just isn\u2019t working you might be speaking to someone who has a different zoom preference. All you have to do to connect with them is zoom in or out to match their preference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they prefer to zoom in, give them details and examples. If they prefer to zoom out, give them the meaning behind your details and examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want more info on connecting with people deeply through conversation, check out &lt;a href=\"https://beardstrokings.com/conversation-hacks-guide/?utm_source=r-htngaf&amp;amp;utm_medium=3skills&amp;amp;utm_campaign=redd\"&gt;Make Real Friends: 3 Conversation Hacks You Never Knew&lt;/a&gt;.
