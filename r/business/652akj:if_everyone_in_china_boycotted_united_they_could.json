From the model, I came to the conclusion that United could lose $2.5 billion in annual revenue if all of China boycotted United. However, since that is extremely unlikely, I came up with a few scenarios and found that they could very possibly lose $500 million per year if not more. Just wanted to share my findings. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://bananainbeijing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/United-Potential-Loss.xlsx\"&gt;Model link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology for Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used 3 public resources to do my analysis. United\u2019s own website, their 2016 Annual Report, and Google Flights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Found all the flights United has to China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each day, United has 26 nonstop flights to and from China, and 8 flights that are only offered on certain days each week. From the US, the flights fly out of Newark, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington DC, Los Angeles, and Guam. The China destinations include Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Xi\u2019an, and Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flights to and from Chengdu, Hangzhou, Xi\u2019an, and Guam are the ones only offered a few times per week (See Column C in the Excel)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapped each flight with its respective plane model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When searching for each flight on United\u2019s website, they list out the plane model. &lt;a href=\"http://bananainbeijing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Seats-United.jpg\"&gt;Exhibit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used their annual report to see how many passengers each plane model could hold. &lt;a href=\"http://bananainbeijing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Plane-Model-and-Passenger-Loads.jpg\"&gt;Picture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapped the number of First / Business / Economy + and Economy seats available for each plane model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was an extremely manual process where I counted the number of seats in each seating class (Also see &lt;a href=\"http://bananainbeijing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Seats-United.jpg\"&gt;Exhibit&lt;/a&gt;). This is important as the pricing for each class of seats will be different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Found a range of ticket prices for each class on each flight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=\"http://bananainbeijing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Google-United-Prices.jpg\"&gt;Google Flights&lt;/a&gt; to do this analysis. If I didn\u2019t use that, I probably would have given up because looking up ticket prices is a pain in the ass. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this it was pretty easy to sort through and find the highest and lowest prices to build my price range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at flight dates that were within 3 months of the day I did the analysis. Generally, I saw that if you book tickets really far in advance (6 months or more), it may not always be the lowest price. It varied by flight. Also, for a few first and business class ticket prices, they were egregiously higher than other prices, which I suspected was because they were full or almost full. I decided not to use these since they only appeared on less than 3 days per flight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baseline Assumptions and Adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Economy + Adjustment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t book Economy + tickets directly so there were no prices. You have to select Economy tickets, and then an option came out where you could upgrade (See the top right portion of &lt;a href=\"http://bananainbeijing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Seats-United.jpg\"&gt;Exhibit&lt;/a&gt;). I saw that the upgrade costs somewhere between $260 and $360. I ended up using the lower range because I had no idea what \u201cEconomy + Enhanced\u201d was, and thought it sounded like a gimmick. I added this onto all the Economy ticket prices to come up with the Economy + ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holiday Adjustment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all know it sucks to travel during the holidays because ticket prices are more expensive. Well it\u2019s even more so for these long international flights. However, I only included long holidays, because most people aren\u2019t going to fly 13 hours to China during Thanksgiving for a 5 day trip. It\u2019s not even enough time to get over your jetlag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I added a price factor of 1.5 for Christmas, New Years, Chinese New Years, and Chinese Independence Day. I assumed that the higher prices would be for around 1 week for each holiday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also included a price factor for summer vacation. When I was searching Google Flights, I noticed that July and August generally had higher ticket prices. This is because a lot of Chinese kids are on vacation during that time, so they will be traveling back and forth a lot. I added a 1.25 factor to account for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baseline Prices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used a simple average between the low and high price for each seat class in my calculation to find a daily total revenue for each flight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baseline Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I am ready to see how much United makes from their China flights. &lt;strong&gt;$4.5 Billion!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering United made $36.6 Billion in total revenues in 2016, this would be equal to around 12% of their revenues. The number seemed a bit high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made quite a few adjustments, as you can see on the second tab in the Excel. The adjustments were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;% Full&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a factor I used to account for how full each flight was. Obviously not every flight is going to be 100% full every day for the whole year. So I bumped this down to 90% for most of the flights. Since Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Xi\u2019an are all smaller cities than Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, I bumped flights to those cities down to 80%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;United\u2019s average for 2016 was around 80%, and most of the flights I\u2019ve flown on United to China were completely full. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the % full for each flight to Shanghai and Beijing was even higher than 90%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Economy + Factor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Premiere Gold members of United\u2019s rewards program, they received a free upgrade to Economy + when they book Economy tickets (see popup box in Exhibit 1).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To account for this effect on price, I made an assumption about the number of people that are Premiere Gold. I have no idea what this number is, so I just assumed that 40% were business people that didn\u2019t want to pay for business class seats or people that flew a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First Class Factor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also made an assumption about first class tickets. I assumed that these tickets were not always sold out on every flight. I assumed that because these tickets are the highest margin, United has the most leeway in giving discounts. So even though it seems like there are people sitting in first class, I assume some or most of them were upgraded from business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Adjustments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I added something called a \u201chigh price adjustment factor.\u201d I assumed most people would always try to get the best deal. By originally using a simple average to calculate the average price per seat class, the resulting prices would be skewed to the high side. This adjustment factor essentially brought the average price down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another overarching assumption I made was that if flights were not full, it was more likely that people bought economy tickets than business or first class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjustment Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all of these tweaks to the model, I ended up with China contributing about &lt;strong&gt;$2.5 billion in revenue!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what United would lose if they stopped all of their flights to and from China.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found an &lt;a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/united-airlines-could-pay-dearly-in-china-as-passenger-dragging-video-spreads-2017-04-11\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that cited Factset, a data analysis company, estimating United\u2019s China revenue to be around $2.2 billion for 2016.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looks like my new adjusted number is much more reasonable now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I took a look to see how this disaster could potentially impact United\u2019s revenues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The underlying assumption here is that demand would be negatively impacted. However, we don\u2019t know by how much, so I came up with a few scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario 1:&lt;/em&gt; If we assume that demand is impacted so much that flights cannot fly every day, and instead only flies 6 days a week instead of 7, then the impact is ~$400 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario 2:&lt;/em&gt; If demand is low, United might cut prices on their first and business class tickets. I used a price cut of 50% on these tickets. I did this because I expected margins on economy seats to already be very slim, thus there is a lot more room to cut prices in the luxury seats. The impact is ~$500 million&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario 3:&lt;/em&gt; If we assume that demand drops by 5% for all China flights, then there is already a $550 million impact. If demand drops by 10%, then the impact reaches $800 million. I made this change to the % Full assumption by dropping it 5 and 10% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This analysis only looks at United flights between the US and China. It doesn\u2019t take into account the effect from Chinese-Americans living in the US and who use United to fly to other destinations. It also doesn\u2019t take into account all non-Chinese customers who have been disgusted with United and will now refuse to fly with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, if we look at the Chinese population in the US, Chinese-Americans made up around &lt;a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/united-airlines-could-pay-dearly-in-china-as-passenger-dragging-video-spreads-2017-04-11\"&gt;1.2% of all Americans in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. Let\u2019s just round down to 1% for simplicity\u2019s sake. If we assume that Chinese-American\u2019s contributions to United\u2019s revenue is similar to their proportion of the American population, and if we assume all Chinese-Americans will boycott United, then we can do a simple calculation using 1% multiplied by $34 billion (United\u2019s 2016 total revenue excluding China). This is another ~$340 million that could be potentially impacted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think based on my 3 different scenarios, it seems very plausible that United could lose around $500 million per year in revenues from this fiasco, if not more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chinese social media (Weibo and Wechat) has been spreading this story like crazy, so there&amp;#39;s bound to be quite a bit of backlash from the Chinese community.
