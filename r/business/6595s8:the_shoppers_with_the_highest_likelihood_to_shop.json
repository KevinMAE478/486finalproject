Even though I'm not in that situation any more, I've come away from the whole thing with a very frugal mindset. I think this is because I understand that there are so many people out there that could use some help, the way I once did, that I can't get myself to 'splurge' on luxury items. I find it almost... unethical. \n\nSo, instead of walking around in fancy ass shit that I've paid a ton of money for, I wear some things that are second hand and donate money every week.
