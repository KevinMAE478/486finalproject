Lol.  Our definition of small town America seems to be vastly different here.  Also, the NYTWA (one of the aforementioned loudmouthed taxi unions with far too much power) holds a lot of sway over all of NY State, not just NYC.  It's still not indicative of, for example, middle America.\n\nAlso, such severe price difference is not necessarily because cabs are \"overpriced\" (although I'm not disputing that they can be in some areas).  It's more because Uber is severely underpriced.  This is, at this point, a widely known fact.\n\nAlso, in many jurisdictions, cabs have no say over prices.  Governments control the pricing. And no, that's not something most cabbies lobbied for.  Consumers wanted that, along with a few other things.  The biggest misconception people have is that taxis *wanted* massive overregulation.  The consumers actually drove much of that, decades ago.  \n\nAs for the cars, I can't speak to that.  I'm sure a few still run interceptors and the like.  Most that I've seen in the western US have made a conscious effort to upgrade lately, though, in spite of financial obstacles.  Keep in mind the industry has always had very thin profit margins, which is why a lot of them historically have cut a lot of corners.

Lol.  Our definition of small town America seems to be vastly different here.  Also, the NYTWA (one of the aforementioned loudmouthed taxi unions with far too much power) holds a lot of sway over all of NY State, not just NYC.  It&amp;#39;s still not indicative of, for example, middle America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, such severe price difference is not necessarily because cabs are &amp;quot;overpriced&amp;quot; (although I&amp;#39;m not disputing that they can be in some areas).  It&amp;#39;s more because Uber is severely underpriced.  This is, at this point, a widely known fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, in many jurisdictions, cabs have no say over prices.  Governments control the pricing. And no, that&amp;#39;s not something most cabbies lobbied for.  Consumers wanted that, along with a few other things.  The biggest misconception people have is that taxis &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; massive overregulation.  The consumers actually drove much of that, decades ago.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the cars, I can&amp;#39;t speak to that.  I&amp;#39;m sure a few still run interceptors and the like.
