Do folks know of any studies indicating how performance between 80/20 with rebalancing vs 100% stock portfolios has gone over long terms in times past? \n\n2) Should I be structuring asset allocation differently in taxable vs nontaxable accounts?

If there are links to good empirical data on this I'd love it.\n\nThanks!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to get a rather huge signing bonus for my next job,\n probably $125k-$175k.  I&amp;#39;m in a fairly unique position; people usually get these bonuses upon switching to new jobs each year, and one coworker who started the process early has already secured $165k.  In any event, even if it goes much more poorly for me, it&amp;#39;ll probably still be more money than I presently have altogether. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m wondering how to invest this and all future excess salary at the new job, including how to choose a stock/bond allocation and how to set up that allocation across taxable and non-tax accounts.  I&amp;#39;ve never had enough money to need a taxable account before.  Goal is to maximize returns over 20-30 year time horizon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Is there any point to bonds if I&amp;#39;m not planning on using the money for 20 years?  I have heard theorizing that periodic rebalancing can help portfolios with bonds do well, as it forces one to sell high and buy low automatically.  Do folks know of any studies indicating how performance between 80/20 with rebalancing vs 100% stock portfolios has gone over long terms in times past? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Should I be structuring asset allocation differently in taxable vs nontaxable accounts? If I do choose to hold some bonds, should I put them all in taxable accounts, or all in nontaxable, or just leave it mixed?  If there are links to good empirical data on this I&amp;#39;d love it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "investing", "name": "t1_dg805h2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492137532.0, "created_utc": 1492108732.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xp9q", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xp9q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7v3nc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kiwimancy", "parent_id": "t1_dg7u7k3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/investing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Most banks are down recently.
