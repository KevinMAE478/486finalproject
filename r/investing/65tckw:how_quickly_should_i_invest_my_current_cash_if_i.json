Even just looking at equities that aren't US based can provide a good level of diversification.\n\nYou can get as granular as you want for example:\n\nEurope - VGK - total market for Europe; HEDJ - currency hedged so you're theoretically not exposed to the fluctuating EURUSD as much. If you want to be more granular, EWG - Germany; EWU - UK; etc...\n\nAsia - FXI - China's Large Cap; EWJ - Japanese total market; DXJ - currency hedged Japan but dividend weighted construction; ALD - asian bonds in local currency;\n\nSouth America - EWZ - Brazil Total market; EWW - Mexico total market; \n\nEmerging Markets - ELD - emerging market local debt; VWO - Emerging market equities;\n\nCommodities - GLD/IAU - gold (i'll explain the considerations later); USO/OIL - oil \n\nFixed Income - AGG/BND - investment grade bonds US; JNK - corporate high yield\n\n\nOk so for GLD vs IAU, if you're going to be rebalancing often, you're better off with GLD since the trading cost is lower and the \"price\" of GLD is higher, so you're getting more exposure per share and the spread is smaller relative to GLD's price. However GLD's expense ratio is also higher (40bps-GLD vs 25bps-IAU). While IAU has lower expenses, constant trading will be relatively more expensive since the spread is higher relative to IAU's price. \nBasically, the more you rebalance, the more expensive it will be with IAU. If you have a core gold position, you should use IAU. Use GLD for the part that you'd be shifting in and out of.\n\n\nThere are a lot of ways you can construct your portfolio, how granular you wanna be is completely up to you. When you're picking your ETF's a couple things to keep in mind are:\n\n1. expense ratio - you'll have to weigh just how much you want exposure to this sector/asset class, if it's something you have strong reason to believe will appreciate, maybe the higher cost is worth it. Otherwise, you might want to look for a cheaper alternative.\n\n2. Liquidity - some ETF's trade only a few thousand shares per day, you might have a hard time getting in/out of the security when you need to. And even if you do manage to get filled, slippage might cost you extra (ie you submit a market order at 50, you get filled at 50.50 (buying)) of course you can mitigate this by using limits, but you run the risk of not getting filled at all.\n\n3. Index methodology - very important, you could be looking for exposure to Japanese equities and buy EWJ, but the exchange rate could screw you over if you're not careful, if you're anticipating shifts in the USDJPY rate, you might want to use DXJ. Likewise, VTI considers the whole market, alternatively VIG is constructed using companies that have consistently increased their dividends in the past 10 years.\n\n4. Underlying holdings - this might be overkill, but something to keep in mind nonetheless. An ETF is basically a wrapper that holds securities. This matters for two reasons: 1 - You may have oversized exposure to a particular stock such as AAPL. If you own equal parts SPY, VTI and QQQ, then you actually have a 6.09% exposure to AAPL 3.62% of SPY, 2.85% of VTI, and 11.98% of QQQ. 2 - Sometimes an ETF has very large exposure to one particular underlying I can't think of another example at the moment, but basically, buying QQQ is kinda like buying AAPL since AAPL is almost 12% of QQQ. A big move in AAPL will move QQQ. There are more exaggerated examples of this but they escape me right now. \n\nRegarding 3 &amp; 4 - make sure you read up on the ETF's you're considering using, just looking at the description of the ETF isn't enough. You want to make sure you understand at least the holdings and the logic that went into the selection of the underlying. ETF.com is a great resource.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s mostly US stocks, you might want to look at other asset classes. Even just looking at equities that aren&amp;#39;t US based can provide a good level of diversification.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can get as granular as you want for example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Europe - VGK - total market for Europe; HEDJ - currency hedged so you&amp;#39;re theoretically not exposed to the fluctuating EURUSD as much. If you want to be more granular, EWG - Germany; EWU - UK; etc...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asia - FXI - China&amp;#39;s Large Cap; EWJ - Japanese total market; DXJ - currency hedged Japan but dividend weighted construction; ALD - asian bonds in local currency;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;South America - EWZ - Brazil Total market; EWW - Mexico total market; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emerging Markets - ELD - emerging market local debt; VWO - Emerging market equities;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Commodities - GLD/IAU - gold (i&amp;#39;ll explain the considerations later); USO/OIL - oil &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fixed Income - AGG/BND - investment grade bonds US; JNK - corporate high yield&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok so for GLD vs IAU, if you&amp;#39;re going to be rebalancing often, you&amp;#39;re better off with GLD since the trading cost is lower and the &amp;quot;price&amp;quot; of GLD is higher, so you&amp;#39;re getting more exposure per share and the spread is smaller relative to GLD&amp;#39;s price. However GLD&amp;#39;s expense ratio is also higher (40bps-GLD vs 25bps-IAU). While IAU has lower expenses, constant trading will be relatively more expensive since the spread is higher relative to IAU&amp;#39;s price. \nBasically, the more you rebalance, the more expensive it will be with IAU. If you have a core gold position, you should use IAU. Use GLD for the part that you&amp;#39;d be shifting in and out of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ways you can construct your portfolio, how granular you wanna be is completely up to you.
