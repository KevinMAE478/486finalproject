I am married and a baby is on the way. I will be working over the summer, but not during the school year. My wife is not in school and works full time making $14.50/hr. We bring in total about $21-2200 a month, but about $1400 of that goes to rent, utilities, groceries, etc..  Both of our cars are paid for, and all work on them are done by us rather than a shop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have decided that we would like to take $100 a month and start learning to invest with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t looking to make this our main source of income or anything, rather just learning the game so that when we have more money to invest later on down the road, we can jump in without having to start learning then. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We really don&amp;#39;t have a timeframe for this, but I would prefer quicker type investments just so I can get as much exposure to transactions as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, our main goal is to learn more, so we are ready to start later with a proper amount to invest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only loans we are have my student loans, which after graduation, will total to about $20,000. These loans do not start coming due until 6 months after I graduate though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really know nothing at all about investing, but I love the idea of letting our money make money. I know it&amp;#39;s risky and not easy, which is why we have decided on a small amount to start with. Is thus even something reasonable to try? Where should I start?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "investing", "name": "t1_dg4cmck", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491950850.0, "created_utc": 1491922050.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qdqt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhq", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qdqt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4g3na", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "r-advice4251", "parent_id": "t1_dg49cc4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/investing", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for the advice guys.
