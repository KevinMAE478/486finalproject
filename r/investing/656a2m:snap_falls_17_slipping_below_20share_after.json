FB did the same, it went from a ~$38 share price (May 2012) at IPO to ~$18/share 3 months later in August (PEOPLE ALWAYS FORGET THIS!) of 2012.  FB has been on a literal tear ever since.   Now I don't expect SNAP to be hitting $100+ a share anytime soon, but I love the product, and users do to.  It's just so much more user friendly, engrossing, dynamic and just more fun than Twitter, to compare the two like many analysts on CNBC often do is ridiculous for so many reasons.  \n\nIf you guys watch even 5 minutes of a 50+ year old commentator comparing SNAP to Twitter you will realize just how insane it all is, these people are completely out of touch.\n\n\nHere's my forecast, over the next couple of months SNAP drops to ~$15/share before gaining investor confidence of it's expanding user base and enhanced features and ad integration.  Once people see the value in this company I foresee this pulling at least half of what FB has, think ~$50 a share within the next two years.
