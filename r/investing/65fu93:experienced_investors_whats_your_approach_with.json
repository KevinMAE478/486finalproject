In this example, the balancing between shares and cash made returns even when neither the shares nor the cash made any returns.\n\nThat is the same thing a mixed portfolio does. By re-balancing between stocks and bonds, it is buying low and selling high.  Except it is even more powerful, as when shares are going down, bonds are usually going up.  So they are negatively correlated (only in some circumstances - but those turn out to be useful circumstances) so the re-balancing returns are usually greater than those between shares and cash (which are just not correlated, rather than sometimes negatively correlated).\n\nSmart people, managing target date funds have modeled (based on history, which is not a perfect guide to future performance) that even on long durations, having at least some bonds in the portfolio will produce better returns than all equity.
