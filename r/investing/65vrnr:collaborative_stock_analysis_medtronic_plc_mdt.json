He also talks about how important it is to make the devices easy to use, easy to install, and help train doctors to use them appropriately.  Use of pacemakers in Indian amongst people that can afford them is very low, because the infrastructure to use them doesn\u2019t exist.  He says he could give away pace makers and they would be used for scrap metal.  You need to train the doctors.  The technology alone doesn\u2019t create any value.
