When you compare NVDA to other tech growth stocks a P/E of 38 doesn&amp;#39;t seem so high anymore.&lt;br/&gt;\nFor example: ANET 52, SKY 61, and then there are players like TSLA that don&amp;#39;t even have income.

Which shows that quite a bit of institutions jumped ship, but the shares were picked up by non-institutional owners. However, 75% is still a quite high ownership when compared to AMD, INTC and others. &lt;strong&gt;I am a bit worried that the drop we are seeing right now is a result of more institutions jumping ship.&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now getting to the actual interesting part:&lt;br/&gt;\nMy DD on Q1 2018 earnings:   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is an important &lt;a href=\"http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-1XAJD4/4285688894x0x927425/01843210-E2B4-4E1F-938E-17F33C305078/Rev_by_Mkt_Qtrly_Trend_Q417.pdf\"&gt;slide&lt;/a&gt; to estimate future growth:&lt;br/&gt;\nOne thing to note is that the gaming segment is historically very weak in the first quarter.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gaming:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://investorplace.com/2017/04/analysts-nvidia-corporation-nvda-stock/2/#.WPJs-ojyuUk\"&gt;Sources&lt;/a&gt; are saying that this quarters gpu sales are down 15%, which is 10% more than in the past. This sounds bad, but one has to remember that 15% down from a record $1,348M income is still a shit-load of money. That results in an income of $1,146M, which is still in line with NVDA&amp;#39;s estimated revenue for this quarter. On the other side of things, the 1080TI sales are estimated to be quite high. Additionally, it seems that NVDA has picked up quite a bit of market &lt;a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey\"&gt;share&lt;/a&gt; from its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Professional Virtualization:&lt;br/&gt;\nI don&amp;#39;t have too much to say about this segment, but I am sure that it will bring in over $200M in revenue.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Data center:&lt;br/&gt;\nThis segment seems to be exploding. NVDA&amp;#39;s revenue trippled year over year, and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to slow down. If you look at the rest of the market, you will come to the same conclusion. I would be surprised if revenue was below $300M.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Auto:&lt;br/&gt;\nTesla recently broke out, because they finally got their production up. Additionally, their pre-orders are not stopping. This translates 1:1 into NVDA&amp;#39;s revenue. NVDA currently has over 50 automated driving partners. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised to see a beat up to $175M, but since I like to be conservative I will say $140M.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly we have OEM &amp;amp; IP, which seems to be the least interesting segment. It has been declining for some time now. Maybe I am missing something here, but I don&amp;#39;t think so. We are still going to see a solid $150M of revenue in this segment.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now one last thing are the switch sales. The sales were &lt;a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/14/superdata-nintendo-sells-2-4-million-switch-consoles-worldwide-in-first-month/\"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; to be 2.4 Million units in its first month.

We might see more than $150M in revenue from the Switch.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, if we add up all the segment we are well above the estimated $1.9B in revenue.&lt;/strong&gt; I think that even if we &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; reach the estimated 1.9B we will go back up from the current $95 per share to at least $105.
