We had planned a huge trip together, out of the continent for a week or two. We were hyped for months beforehand and had been anticipating it for eternity, it felt like. We touchdown and immediately she ditches me for &amp;quot;more popular people,&amp;quot; something I knew she was capable of but never experienced. I confronted her because I was clearly shocked that she would turn on me so quickly after all we&amp;#39;ve been through. I remember the exact conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Why did you room with me if you didn&amp;#39;t want to hang out with me then?&amp;quot;\nHer: &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t WANT to room with you. I had no choice.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this isn&amp;#39;t much compared to all the other stories I&amp;#39;m seeing but I remember my heart dropping to my stomach because I felt so manipulated after giving three years of my friendship to her and getting repaid with getting brushed off like we were never anything. It also showed that even a year ago, when we were planning it, she had never been sincere to me and I wasn&amp;#39;t even her first choice. I just felt so played.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgaaupk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492260552.0, "created_utc": 1492231752.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 40}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fncd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fncd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fncd", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga8yzt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 126, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TinyTinasPsychoOtter", "parent_id": "t1_dga62zt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've gone completely no contact ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve gone completely no contact &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dga8yzt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492257320.0, "created_utc": 1492228520.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 126}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga62zt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 87, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SteveTriesToReddit", "parent_id": "t1_dga1i2b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Christ.
