I haven't flown United in over 10 years, ever since *the incident*.\n\nI used to do all of my flying on United, and had a Mileage Plus VISA to collect those sweet, sweet miles.  Of course, the miles were never useful for actual flights, because flights for miles were rarely available and the ones that were were at inconvenient times with multiple connections, but what the miles were almost always good for was first class upgrades.\n\nOne day, returning from vacation with my wife and approximately two-year-old daughter, we were connecting through Chicago and had first class upgrades for both segments.  The second segment was in a 767 with a very large first class section.\n\nWe sat around in O'Hare a lot because of various delays, and there was eventually an announcement that they were changing aircraft.  They then announced a very long list of passengers that had to visit the podium to get their seats reassigned.  We listened carefully, and our names were not called, so great, we didn't lose our upgrades!\n\nBoarding eventually starts, we stand up and get in line and eventually get to the person scanning the boarding passes.  She scans ours and tells us that our seats don't exist.  Probably should have seen that coming.  She then tells us that we need to get in line to talk to the agent at the podium.  The line at the podium, at this point, extends out of the gate area and down the hallway.\n\nI politely point out that had they called our names to tell us that our seats didn't exist anymore, we would have gotten in line then, but since they hadn't, and we had already stood in a long line to try to board, maybe they could just reassign our seats at that point and let us get onto the flight.\n\nAt this point, the agent at the podium turns to us and starts screaming at us to get in line like we're told.  I explain the situation to him, in case he didn't catch all the details about how he failed to call our names, and this results in considerably more screaming.\n\nAt some point in this whole discussion, he prints out two boarding passes, and in a break in his screaming, hands them to my wife, saying \"you and your daughter can board now\", then turning to look at me with a hateful glare, saying **not him**.  I'm running out of calm at this point and mutter \"*asshole*\" under my breath, but apparently not as quietly as I thought.\n\nAs soon as I do that, he reaches over, grabs the boarding passes out of my wife's hand, and tears them up.  I tell him that I would like to speak to his supervisor.\n\nHe screams at me that \"I don't have to let you talk to my supervisor\".  At this point I pretty much lose it, and pick up the phone on his desk.  He tells me to put the phone down or he's going to have me arrested.  I put it down, and head down the hallway to the customer service counter.\n\nAfter standing in line some more, I explain the situation to an agent there, who then walks with me back to the gate to investigate.  After asking which agent I was having the issue with, she goes off to talk to him in hushed tones away from everybody else.\n\nUpon her return, she informs me that she had a talk with the agent, and he told her that I was being unruly and called him \"an f-ing a-word\", and that I was welcome to file a complaint, but when they talked to her about it, she would hold up his story and not mine.  Then she tells me that because I'm an unruly passenger, they can't let me fly, but if I promise to be good, they *may* put me on the next flight out.\n\nAnd that is my United story.
