I told her mother as such, and said I would also like to see the girl speak up more and not be afraid of her voice. She was always volunteering in class but when she spoke, she did so in a whisper. She was confident in her knowledge but not confident in letting people hear her.\n\nThe mother said \"What can she improve?\" I laughed but the mom looked very serious so I just said, \"Honestly, nothing really. She has a 99 average. There's not much to improve on.\"\n\nThe mother said \"I understand that, but what about everything else? How is her organization?\" I replied that I didn't know of any problems with organization, seeing as she turned in all her homework on time and was obviously prepared for every test and quiz. Mom pressed me further to tell her something her daughter was doing poorly at, so I apologized for not having anything to add other than that her daughter was a model student.

A few come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was working in a kindergarten classroom, and a father had approached me and asked me if I let his son play in the kitchen center. I replied with something along the lines of, &amp;quot;yes, we allow each of the children to freely explore what interests them&amp;quot; and explained why, but dad was unhappy about it. He immediately asked me to stop this, as allowing his boy to pretend like he&amp;#39;s cooking will make him gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was teaching at a preschool, and a mother had approached me and a few other teachers as she was concerned about her 3 year old son&amp;#39;s behaviour. She was asking all these questions about who he plays with, what he likes to play with, and so on. She then expressed concern that he had an undescended testicle, which will turn him into a homosexual. She wanted us to keep our eyes on his behaviour and stop him from &amp;quot;acting gay&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I had a conference with a family regarding one of my current students who will be attending kindergarten next year. I expressed all of my concerns (and this child has many concerns... Cognitive delays, speech concerns, a few minor behaviour concerns)... And asked mom her thoughts and concerns. She had none. Absolutely none. In fact, her child is perfectly equipped to handle kindergarten next year and will not struggle one bit! Nevermind the fact that he can&amp;#39;t count higher than 3 and doesn&amp;#39;t understand the difference between letters and numbers, despite having daily exposure for 2 years now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg9amab", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492213373.0, "created_utc": 1492184573.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2827}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cwcu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cwcu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9gkyn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 546, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Random-Rambling", "parent_id": "t1_dg9doq4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh joy, _stage moms_.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh joy, &lt;em&gt;stage moms&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg9gkyn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492220122.0, "created_utc": 1492191322.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 546}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cwcu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9h5ks", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 210, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PsychicAtom", "parent_id": "t1_dg9doq4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Parents of kids involved in the performing arts can be the worst, especially when  all they're doing is trying to live through their child without regard for what they might want ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents of kids involved in the performing arts can be the worst, especially when  all they&amp;#39;re doing is trying to live through their child without regard for what they might want &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg9h5ks", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492220785.0, "created_utc": 1492191985.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 210}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9doq4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1071, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Back2Bach", "parent_id": "t3_65cwcu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The worst was when a mother of student in our music department threatened to yank her daughter out of the school if she wasn't given a solo (\"O Holy Night\") in the Christmas concert.\n\nI explained that not only did her daughter not have the skills or voice required for the part, but that she had also made it clear she didn't *want* to do it - that it was entirely her mother's attempt to \"turn her into a star.\"", "edited": 1492188285.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst was when a mother of student in our music department threatened to yank her daughter out of the school if she wasn&amp;#39;t given a solo (&amp;quot;O Holy Night&amp;quot;) in the Christmas concert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I explained that not only did her daughter not have the skills or voice required for the part, but that she had also made it clear she didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do it - that it was entirely her mother&amp;#39;s attempt to &amp;quot;turn her into a star.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg9doq4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492216819.0, "created_utc": 1492188019.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1071}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cwcu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cwcu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ganf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 472, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dalimey100", "parent_id": "t1_dg9e8qm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hey, I've seen the kind of workload teachers get.

I immediately turned the conference around and stopped talking about his behavior and started talking about his good qualities. I felt so badly for him.\n\nSecond: 7th grade English class. Smart kid but a real asshole. He was the kind of kid who made fun of other kids when they made a mistake. He would call them stupid (out in class if they answered wrong) and make them feel really low. He was also that weird kind of kid who does strange things just to weird other kids out. Like violently snapping a pencil and then jabbing the pieces at the other kids, spitting a loogie on the carpet, pretending to be deaf, etc. one day in my class he BIT another kid (yes, 7th grade) so there was a conference. The kid sat in his mother's lap (they were nearly the same size, it was so awkward) and grinned at me the whole conference. I'd say something and she'd defend him. It was sick.

He tells me that his son told him that I taped his locker shut and that's why he never brought any books home. I had to sit there, stare the man in the eyes, ask him that sounded logical or true. He finally realizes how insane that sounds and I show him his son's locker. It is a pig sty and all the books are under Piles of trash in the locker. Father apologizes to me and leaves with his son. 40 mins later school starts. In walks this kid with a bald head. His dad went home and shaved his precious braids off for lying. I was floored.
