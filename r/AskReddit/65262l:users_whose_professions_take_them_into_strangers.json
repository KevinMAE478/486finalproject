That's basically going into a house we're gonna renovate and throwing all the trash out. I'm only 17 and going into the service in May (thank god for the USAF) and these are the top weirdest things I've seen so far in the past year:\n\n1) *The Nest:* \n\nThe most recent one and horrifying. I was cleaning an eviction of people who had lived in a house for about 10(?) years. I had managed to clean out a kitchen -which had a bowl at the back of the pantry filled with animal tags (dogs) and a knife. Then I moved into the kids' room. Instead of mattresses for the young kids -there were box frames but they were junk- there was a pile of clothes on the ground on top of a couple newspapers with a teddy bear. It makes you think about how other people's lives are and we're. \n\n2) *The Couch:*\n\n One of the worst I've ever had to see the after math of and it still makes me gag to this day. It was around June 2016 and I had came to the \"office\" where my company stores supplies and cars, along with dumpsters for trash before removal. My father is the fireman and he wanted me to get experience in being careful and identifying bed bugs. He takes me to the back side of the building where there's an old 70's style couch sitting against the building. He asks if I'd take that couch home and use it. After looking at it I saw a couple cigarette burns and decided if I really needed it sure. My dad is not very happy with my inspection job so he pulls out \"the grippers\" as he calls them which are welding gloves. Pulling the seat cushion up and over onto the ground I saw a black bottomed couch which what looks like a bleach stain on it the color of foam. After a few seconds horror set in as it started to move and the foam color turned out to be the real bottom. Needless to say bed bugs a RE a real fear for me now, I also always check before touching furniture. \n\nI have more but I'm going to sleep now. I'll check this tomorrow.

That&amp;#39;s basically going into a house we&amp;#39;re gonna renovate and throwing all the trash out. I&amp;#39;m only 17 and going into the service in May (thank god for the USAF) and these are the top weirdest things I&amp;#39;ve seen so far in the past year:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;em&gt;The Nest:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most recent one and horrifying. I was cleaning an eviction of people who had lived in a house for about 10(?) years. I had managed to clean out a kitchen -which had a bowl at the back of the pantry filled with animal tags (dogs) and a knife. Then I moved into the kids&amp;#39; room. Instead of mattresses for the young kids -there were box frames but they were junk- there was a pile of clothes on the ground on top of a couple newspapers with a teddy bear. It makes you think about how other people&amp;#39;s lives are and we&amp;#39;re. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;em&gt;The Couch:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the worst I&amp;#39;ve ever had to see the after math of and it still makes me gag to this day. It was around June 2016 and I had came to the &amp;quot;office&amp;quot; where my company stores supplies and cars, along with dumpsters for trash before removal. My father is the fireman and he wanted me to get experience in being careful and identifying bed bugs. He takes me to the back side of the building where there&amp;#39;s an old 70&amp;#39;s style couch sitting against the building. He asks if I&amp;#39;d take that couch home and use it. After looking at it I saw a couple cigarette burns and decided if I really needed it sure. My dad is not very happy with my inspection job so he pulls out &amp;quot;the grippers&amp;quot; as he calls them which are welding gloves. Pulling the seat cushion up and over onto the ground I saw a black bottomed couch which what looks like a bleach stain on it the color of foam. After a few seconds horror set in as it started to move and the foam color turned out to be the real bottom. Needless to say bed bugs a RE a real fear for me now, I also always check before touching furniture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have more but I&amp;#39;m going to sleep now.
