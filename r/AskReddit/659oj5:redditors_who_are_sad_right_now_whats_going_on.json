For me, it&amp;#39;s talking to strangers and traveling alone. Talk to people. Talk to a homeless person. Turn off your phone and walk an hour in an area you don&amp;#39;t know, then use your gps to find your way back. Better yet,  take a bus somewhere without a plan and make it up as you go. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg8ses2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492174931.0, "created_utc": 1492146131.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 73}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659oj5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659oj5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659oj5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659oj5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659oj5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659oj5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8s2mx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 197, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gardenistic", "parent_id": "t1_dg8ltgj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Coming from where the op currently is, you'll feel interested for a bit but it all fades.
