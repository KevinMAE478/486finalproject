Here are some examples (metropolitan area - if someone is from Martinique or Guadeloupe or another territory, would you mind mentioning your good plans?).\n\n- Brittany: Celtic region, a lot of architecture, from the good ol' menhirs to villas of the 70's, the famous Pont-Aven School  (Gauguin, Chagall, Signac...). The regional culture is rather lively there, and Briton is taught again in school.\n- Normandy: a lot of cathedrals, WWII related sites, the architecture is general is something to see, there's also the art there (example: Money's house in Giverny, with its beautiful garden. It's a bit crowded though). Rouen is a nice city, and Jersey and Guernsey (British) aren't too far! Also, there's the Orne there (a d\u00e9partement), also known as \"Horses Country\".\n- The North: have you ever been to Amiens? Well, it's super cute and there's a lot of stuff to see. The Baie de Somme is something to see (especially if you like birds, there's also wild horses). And then there's also Lille, near the border with Belgium. And if I start mentioning every city and town there, we'll still be there tomorrow.\n- The East: Alsace and Lorraine! These regions are beautiful, and cities such as Metz, Nancy or Strasbourg really are a sight to see. During December it may be cold, but the Christmas markets are nice! And Colmar is like a little, northern Venice, full of flowers in spring and summer. \n- The Alps: I think it's pretty self-explanatory there, but you have amazing places like Annecy (and its lake), and the region is overall picturesque (around the border with Switzerland). Go down south and there's Lyon. And as you go further south, you'll be getting closer to the Mediterranean Sea, until you reach Menton (near the border with Italy). The entire region could constitute a road-trip in itself! There's a lot of things to do in both winter and summer, and the Mercantour National Park (famous for its wolves - there's a wolf center in saint-martin V\u00e9subie)! \n- The Pyrenees: it's great there because even if it's the same mountains range, from east (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Orientales) to west (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Atlantiques), the landscape and weather will be different! The first is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, and the region in general as a strong medieval history (the Cathares castles, for example). The Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales (region where my family comes from and live) has a lot of things to offer: architecture (some parts of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa can even be seen at the Cloister Museum, in NYC), history and culture (Collioure and C\u00e9ret were very popular among artists during the first part of the XXth century), a lot of possibilities for trekking... Just like other regions with their own language (such as Brittany or the North), the signs will be in two languages: French and Catalan (historically, the region was the northern part of Catalonia). From there, you can cross the border and have fun in Spain (Figueras and the Dal\u00ec Museum, Girona and its medieval streets, Barcelona...). And if you want to go to the western side of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques), use this as an excuse to do a road-trip through the entire range! You may even meet pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela. You can even make a stop a tad bit up north to Toulouse, \"The Pink City\". At the end of the trip, when you've reached the Atlantic, you'll probably enjoy  the place, where the French Basque Country and the B\u00e9arn meet.\n\nAnd I'll stop there because it's already super long, but there's also really cool regions such as Burgundy or the Loire Valley (and its many castles, as well as the Haras Nationaux)! The country has 9 National Parks and 46 Natural Parks, for the Nature lovers of Reddit. \n\nAnd that's just *one* country in Europe. There's a lot more to see everywhere else! \n\nEDIT: For further suggestions on the various regions and places to see in France, check the comments! And thanks to all of you who made said suggestions/commented, it adds a lot to this comment!", "edited": 1492081273.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people hear &amp;quot;France&amp;quot;, they tend to associate it with either Paris or the Provence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a lot of other regions that go unnoticed. Here are some examples (metropolitan area - if someone is from Martinique or Guadeloupe or another territory, would you mind mentioning your good plans?).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Brittany: Celtic region, a lot of architecture, from the good ol&amp;#39; menhirs to villas of the 70&amp;#39;s, the famous Pont-Aven School  (Gauguin, Chagall, Signac...). The regional culture is rather lively there, and Briton is taught again in school.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Normandy: a lot of cathedrals, WWII related sites, the architecture is general is something to see, there&amp;#39;s also the art there (example: Money&amp;#39;s house in Giverny, with its beautiful garden. It&amp;#39;s a bit crowded though). Rouen is a nice city, and Jersey and Guernsey (British) aren&amp;#39;t too far! Also, there&amp;#39;s the Orne there (a d\u00e9partement), also known as &amp;quot;Horses Country&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The North: have you ever been to Amiens? Well, it&amp;#39;s super cute and there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff to see. The Baie de Somme is something to see (especially if you like birds, there&amp;#39;s also wild horses). And then there&amp;#39;s also Lille, near the border with Belgium. And if I start mentioning every city and town there, we&amp;#39;ll still be there tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The East: Alsace and Lorraine! These regions are beautiful, and cities such as Metz, Nancy or Strasbourg really are a sight to see. During December it may be cold, but the Christmas markets are nice! And Colmar is like a little, northern Venice, full of flowers in spring and summer. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Alps: I think it&amp;#39;s pretty self-explanatory there, but you have amazing places like Annecy (and its lake), and the region is overall picturesque (around the border with Switzerland). Go down south and there&amp;#39;s Lyon. And as you go further south, you&amp;#39;ll be getting closer to the Mediterranean Sea, until you reach Menton (near the border with Italy). The entire region could constitute a road-trip in itself! There&amp;#39;s a lot of things to do in both winter and summer, and the Mercantour National Park (famous for its wolves - there&amp;#39;s a wolf center in saint-martin V\u00e9subie)! &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Pyrenees: it&amp;#39;s great there because even if it&amp;#39;s the same mountains range, from east (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Orientales) to west (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Atlantiques), the landscape and weather will be different! The first is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, and the region in general as a strong medieval history (the Cathares castles, for example). The Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales (region where my family comes from and live) has a lot of things to offer: architecture (some parts of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa can even be seen at the Cloister Museum, in NYC), history and culture (Collioure and C\u00e9ret were very popular among artists during the first part of the XXth century), a lot of possibilities for trekking... Just like other regions with their own language (such as Brittany or the North), the signs will be in two languages: French and Catalan (historically, the region was the northern part of Catalonia). From there, you can cross the border and have fun in Spain (Figueras and the Dal\u00ec Museum, Girona and its medieval streets, Barcelona...). And if you want to go to the western side of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques), use this as an excuse to do a road-trip through the entire range! You may even meet pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela. You can even make a stop a tad bit up north to Toulouse, &amp;quot;The Pink City&amp;quot;. At the end of the trip, when you&amp;#39;ve reached the Atlantic, you&amp;#39;ll probably enjoy  the place, where the French Basque Country and the B\u00e9arn meet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ll stop there because it&amp;#39;s already super long, but there&amp;#39;s also really cool regions such as Burgundy or the Loire Valley (and its many castles, as well as the Haras Nationaux)! The country has 9 National Parks and 46 Natural Parks, for the Nature lovers of Reddit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; country in Europe. There&amp;#39;s a lot more to see everywhere else! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: For further suggestions on the various regions and places to see in France, check the comments!
