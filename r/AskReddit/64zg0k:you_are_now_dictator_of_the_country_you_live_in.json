America is a 'democracy' so stories that mention me in a bad way must exist, but they will focus on petty things - word choice, pronunciation, missing a historical fact - rather than policy or law. People will vent frustration, but not actually rebel.\n\n2) Use the media to create localized resistances of my design (protests, marches, demonstrations, etc, against a petty topic of my choosing - such as \"the leader is an idiot\") in order to attract rebels out into the open, and then undermine the efforts with under-cover agents who turn the event into a violent demonstration. Then I will make sure that the media is saturated with how the \"peaceful resistance\" became an \"uncontrolled riot,\" so that rebels seem more dangerous than they actually are. The fact that such violence was 'organized' around something as petty as 'the leader is an idiot' further undermines the PR of the resistances. I will tally those that willingly attend, and keep tabs on them in the future.\n\n3) I will create a scapegoat. I will partner with a foreign power to have a \"war\" that is controlled and mutually beneficial, so that the anger of my people can be directed outward should I fail to control it. A mobilization of tanks and planes and troops, stories of atrocities and foreign threats, and my people will have something else to focus on. This also gives me the opportunity to \"draft\" people I suspect of running a coup, and then making sure they are a casualty. This also bolsters my economy. This also can be used to enact martial laws that would otherwise not be acceptable.\n\nOther potential scapegoats include the fear of environmental destruction, fear of foreigners in general, fear of random violence within the country. The media must continually circulate this information, so that the people will fear the added chaos of a political coup.\n\n4) Take control of the education system. Children, young adults, and employees that go to training must be taught that critical thought is bad. I will villianize the educated by making them seem arrogant, I will undermine their science with my own fabricated studies, and I will make higher-education a luxury reserved for those loyal (rich) enough to be trusted. I will make sure that the educated are in debt, so that they must work long hours to repay their debt, so that they do not have the time to organize against me. I will make manual labor the goal of the masses, so that 'unemployment' is an embarrassment and that receiving government assistance is a shame.\n\nIn America, the best way to do this is to migrate the masses into private schools that citizens can \"choose\" between while simultaneously defunding public schools (a relic of my predecessors) to make sure people accept the new system (which allows religion). I will not regulate the education industry, so that the best marker for a school is its PR firm and not the actual education received; schools will be judged by their ability to seem effective, rather than actually be effective. I will use religion within these schools to make obedience and non-violence (non-rebellion) a moral imperative.\n\n5) I will make allowances for the most elite (billionaires) within my country by stimulating the economy in a way that favors their business. I will deregulate their industry so that their influence can grow, I will levy taxes on international trade to give them a competitive edge. If they should show any sign of disloyalty, I will use the media to deface their company, turn my people against them, and watch their business shrivel. If they do not fall in line, then I will run stories of corruption, arrest them in a way that the public loves me for enforcing law, and then hand their company to someone whom I trust.\n\n6) Knowing that I will not live forever, I will set up a dynasty. I will place my family into positions of power, I will train my children in leadership and politics, and I will use my position to keep them in a favorable public view. I will ensure that power succession goes through my family (including my youngest children and grand children) in order to discourage assassination.", "edited": 1492021271.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious Answer:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Take control of the media (in a subtle way).

This would manage radio frequencies, radio power levels, draft acceptable standards for wire gauges.\n\n* There would be a not for profit, government owned corporation which competes against the private sector companies.  This company would have the mission to not only follow the letter of the regulations, but the spirit of the regulations.\n\nMail:\n\n* There would be a regulatory agency which dictates what is safe to do to mail  (you can't ship flammable stuff without marking, you cant ship livestock, you cant ship acid).\n\n* There would be a not for profit company (USPS) that would compete against private corporations.  This mail company would go above and beyond the regulations (cant ship flammable stuff even with markings, cant ship food, etc)\n\nEnvironment:\n\n* A regulatory agency would determine what is legal.  How much can be mined, how much can legally be logged, etc.\n\n* A not for profit company would mine, log, and curate land BEYOND the regulations.  regulation says you can disturb 25% of the water table, this company never does worse than 20%.\n\nPharmaceuticals:\n\n* A regulatory agency determines which drugs are legal, and safe doses.\n\n* A government company makes drugs.

There is no loophole to beating a competitor.\n\n* Wealth Inequality would go down, because not only will these government companies compete on the product side, but the employee side.  As en example, UPS and FedEx both pay well, and have good career options, because they have to compete with USPS for employees.\n\n* Litigation would reduce.  Right now if the government passes a law that a company doesn't like, they have the option to sue the government and disregard the law.  They also have the option to just pay the fine and keep breaking the law.  There is no mechanism to break the laws of economics.  If a company is falsely advertising and their competitor isn't the competitor can give them a black eye and they have no recourse.\n\n* This would almost exclusively hurt big businesses.  Often times regulations hurt small businesses, but if you are a business owner with a market share of .03%, you pretty much don't care who owns the rest of it.

Lobbying and money in politics would be massively reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endlessly complex laws, with tons of loopholes would be a thing of the past.  Laws will regulate products and services exclusively.  The government businesses will regulate the economics of business.  There is no loophole to beating a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wealth Inequality would go down, because not only will these government companies compete on the product side, but the employee side.  As en example, UPS and FedEx both pay well, and have good career options, because they have to compete with USPS for employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Litigation would reduce.  Right now if the government passes a law that a company doesn&amp;#39;t like, they have the option to sue the government and disregard the law.  They also have the option to just pay the fine and keep breaking the law.  There is no mechanism to break the laws of economics.  If a company is falsely advertising and their competitor isn&amp;#39;t the competitor can give them a black eye and they have no recourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would almost exclusively hurt big businesses.  Often times regulations hurt small businesses, but if you are a business owner with a market share of .03%, you pretty much don&amp;#39;t care who owns the rest of it.  And if one of the big players is there explicitly to give overly greedy companies a black eye, that&amp;#39;s good for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg6o15n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492064505.0, "created_utc": 1492035705.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zg0k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg713ac", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Oberon_Swanson", "parent_id": "t3_64zg0k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Government takeover of Tim Hortons.
