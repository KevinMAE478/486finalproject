But with an entire student body population, she didn't have much else she could do since he wasn't an (and I quote) \"immediate danger.\"    \nI brought it up with his former teacher (whose class he'd left) and she seemed to think that he just had issues with female authority figures (again, possibly stemming from the home; that's a red flag). She suspected it had something to do with his mother or older sister, but could never get anything out of him. \n\nAfter he'd been my student for a while, and I'd learned all of this, things were going fairly swimmingly. Until he shows up one Friday during lunch and says that he's come to say 'goodbye'.    \nThat's a red flag. \n\nGetting him to talk, he basically says that he's hit a breaking point at home and he's going to run-away. He's got a girlfriend that he can probably convince to let him sleep over for a few nights while he gets things together, but 1) that won't last long and 2) his mother will quickly find him there. His plan from there is basically to be homeless or to attempt suicide (which he rationalizes will either end the BS or at least get him a decent bed and a few meals at a hospital). \n\nI go through a bunch of mental checklists. I ask him to reconsider a few times. Eventually get him around to trying to reconcile with his mother for the sake of his younger brother and ask him if just having a few days away from home might help.     \nReluctantly, he agrees. \n\nSo... after school I took him home with me.

However, he still seemed agitated.  \n\nHis mom later wound up calling me, repeatedly, accusing me of molesting her son and grooming him for molestation and shouting and ranting. \n\nI told her that if she felt so strongly about it that she could go to the authorities, but that I had weeks of documentation about his condition in addition to his own testimony.
