I lost it all and became a stick in a few months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing about starvation is its slow, and it slowly effects you, it compromises your ability to think clearly, to focus, or even do simple math. I remember at one point I had to leave work early because I could hardly use the cash register. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s crazy though, is the hunger goes away. You get these moments where your starving so badly it hurts but you just chug some water and wait for it to pass (normally takes about 5 or 10 minutes) and once it passes it&amp;#39;s just this dull ache. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking back I should have been much more afraid than I was at the time, but I was running on auto pilot just trying to survive. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgbb0bv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492325786.0, "created_utc": 1492296986.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 122}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kyae", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kyae", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kyae", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kyae", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbigr0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 28, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SCP106", "parent_id": "t1_dgbi6ci", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Look, everyone had a good side ;)\n\nNo one noticed the name for over a year then two in a few days aha :D", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look, everyone had a good side ;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one noticed the name for over a year then two in a few days aha :D&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgbigr0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492336444.0, "created_utc": 1492307644.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbi6ci", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 36, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HezPwner", "parent_id": "t1_dgbc1oz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Weird to imagine SCP-106 saying some wholesome things.

The attic had to be around 145 degrees at this point. I don't know how many of you have used a sawzal, but it's a pain on the ass if you can't get a good leverage point. Also, galvanized pipe is fucking strong. The area i was at was about 20ft away from the exit. If you have never been in an attic, or have never had to walk through one, i will briefly explain. There is no floor or platform in the attic and if you do not step on the horizontal truss beams as you move through it, your foot will end up going through the ceiling. The beams are spaced about about 2 ft apart.\n\nAbout 20 minutes in I start feeling very claustrophobic, which normally i am not. I ignore it for a few MIR eminutes and then the anxiety kicks in and i knew something was wrong. I wiggle my way out of the corner, leaving the sawzal in place. I start to stand up and immediately know something is off. I start taking steps towards the exit and with each step i can feel my body get weaker and weaker. This is problematic becuase a miss-step could send me through the ceiling. I get to the exit and the 115 air outside the attic felt like an AC blowing directly toward my body. Also, during my walk to the exit i had been calling for help, but due to the loud noise of the tools, my dad and cousin did not hear me. At the exit, i called again and again with no response. \n\nI was scared to try and get out myself becuase i knew i was very weak and wouldnt be able to slowly pull myself down to the ladder. I felt like i was going to pass out so i had no choice, i braced my hands on each side of the exit beams and slowly pushed my feet out. I started feeling confident i could manage the task, but as soon as i became responsible to bare my full weight and lower myself down, my arms gave out and i fell. I fell onto the ladder knocking it and myself to the ground. My cousin rushed outside becuase he heard the noise it caused. He tried lifting me up but couldn't do it himself. He ran in to get my dad. \n\nMy dad is the type of hardened asshole that doesn't put up with whining. I could hear him walking towards the attic entrance through the house. As he did, he was saying \"god damnit, we cant get anything done around here becuase \" then he turned the corner and saw me. He immediately changed his tune and rushed me to the back yard. My cousin went an grabbed the hose and thought it would be a good idea to pour water on me as i was sitting in a chair. Within 45 seconds of the water being on me, i began to basically have a seizure. It was one of the scariest expiriences i have ever had. I was fully Concious from a mental standpoint, but I LITERALLY couldn't control my body. I tried so hard to stop shaking, to control my facial muscles, to just do anything. I could even speak or form words. \n\nThey both were very concerned at this point and realized that they had to do something to ensure i didnt die. My skin had turned pale, my eyes were turning dark blue, and my lack of motor function was terrifying. My cousin and dad lifted me into the swimming pool in the backyard. My cousin held me above water while my dad called 911. The water temp was exactly 98 degrees and within 20 minutes of being in it, my skin color and eyes became normal, i was able to control my body again, and i felt like $100 bucks.

He says \" yes, you are, stop bitching and finish the job\". So, i got back up there and finished cutting the line.

Eventually both my parents came in and my mother was tearing up. She said, &amp;quot;The doctors said you may still be reacting to whatever it was you inhaled. I want you to know that we love you very much.&amp;quot; ...not, &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re going to be fine&amp;quot;. My o2 rate was still dropping and was down to 50ish at one point. It was all a blur, but I remember thinking that the doctors told my parents I was going to die and to go say something. I felt fucked up, but I remember having this feeling that I wasn&amp;#39;t going to die...kind of like a &amp;quot;keep fighting&amp;quot; testament. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eventually pulled my o2 rate higher and was sent up to the icu. I spent the weekend in the hospital (it happened on Friday) and was home on Monday. I never went back to that job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: Going through this reminded me...I actually was startled up from my sleep exactly one year later (to the day) and thought about how close I was to dying and how scared everyone was around me. I started to hyperventilate...and did so for about 10 minutes. I hadn&amp;#39;t thought about it too much after that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgbhudi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492335533.0, "created_utc": 1492306733.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kyae", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kyae", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbdxbj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ma287410", "parent_id": "t1_dgb8i6h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have a friend who delivered her twins at 25 weeks.
