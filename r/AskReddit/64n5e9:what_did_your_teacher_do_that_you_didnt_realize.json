Panty-poos!&amp;quot; All the boys teased Gemma for the rest of the year and I don&amp;#39;t recall her coming back to school after that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fuck you Ms. H ya cunt &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg3vwg5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491915644.0, "created_utc": 1491886844.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 161}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64n5e9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64n5e9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64n5e9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64n5e9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4346c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 501, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fuckeverything444", "parent_id": "t1_dg3woew", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "yeah, i think this was more innocent than your making it out to be, just sounds fucked up cause you can associate it with something much creepier now as an adult", "edited": 1491906369.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;yeah, i think this was more innocent than your making it out to be, just sounds fucked up cause you can associate it with something much creepier now as an adult&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg4346c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491934633.0, "created_utc": 1491905833.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 501}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3woew", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 967, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jessha", "parent_id": "t1_dg3rm7m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I never saw him do anything else shady, so I think this may actually be a situation where even he didn't realize what he was saying.

He's always been a big dude (we both started 'developing' fairly early on and he's always been a little on the portly side, so he was taller than the other kids and a lot heavier) and at that age he was very friendly and affectionate. He was a big hugger and would hug anyone and everyone without any thought to it, but wouldn't force it on people. If they wanted a hug, he'd give them a hug. If they didn't, okay, no hugs and he's cool with that. There was no problem with it in preschool or kindergarten, never had any incidents. But basically the second he got into first grade, his teacher started in on him. I don't know if she was just old fashioned, if she came from a well meaning place, or if she just zeroed in on him 'cause she was a fucking bitch, but she did not approve of him hugging people. I'll admit, at first it was probably concerning - here's this big dude, at least half a foot taller than everyone else, holding a smaller kid? Does look a little suspicious. But even after she established that everyone was cool with his hugs, that he wasn't forcing anyone to do anything, and that he was a sweet and understanding kid who just wanted to show people that he cared about them, she would punish him for hugging someone. Yelling at him in front of the class, holding him back at lunch and recess, calls home, sending him to the principal, anything she could think of doing she would do. My mom declared fucking war on this woman and did her best to get her fired (I think she ultimately succeeded because my mom raised enough hell with the principal and school board, I don't remember hearing about that teacher being around after that), but unfortunately she couldn't be fired in the middle of the year and my brother couldn't be transferred to another class with a teacher who didn't hate his guts. There were weekly standing meetings with the principal about this teacher's behavior wherein she was told to leave my brother alone, daily phone calls (sometimes multiple), and it hit a point where my mom would go into work late most mornings to walk my brother to class and tell the teacher that if she got a phone call for something as stupid as a seven year old hugging his friend, she would NOT be happy about it (spoiler alert she got phone calls anyway). \n\nI honestly think that this bitch is why my brother hates school and learning just in general. Before that year he was always very eager to learn and a very avid reader. Afterwards, it was like pulling teeth to get him to do anything school related, and he started acting out - the biggest incident was when he stole another kid's test and wrote his name on it. My mom had a talk with his second grade teacher and she tried her best with him and honestly went a ridiculous amount out of her way to try and help him so she knew what was going on and even after the test-stealing incident he didn't get in a lot of trouble, but I don't think that anything she could have done would have fixed it. My brother is also a very shy person and never really shows any kind of affection now. He's gotten a little better in recent years, but he still hates school and is really struggling in college. I honestly don't think that he's ever going to do well in any kind of schooling because his heart is just never gonna be in it, and I place a lot of that blame on this fuckwad of a teacher.

Yelling at him in front of the class, holding him back at lunch and recess, calls home, sending him to the principal, anything she could think of doing she would do. My mom declared fucking war on this woman and did her best to get her fired (I think she ultimately succeeded because my mom raised enough hell with the principal and school board, I don&amp;#39;t remember hearing about that teacher being around after that), but unfortunately she couldn&amp;#39;t be fired in the middle of the year and my brother couldn&amp;#39;t be transferred to another class with a teacher who didn&amp;#39;t hate his guts. There were weekly standing meetings with the principal about this teacher&amp;#39;s behavior wherein she was told to leave my brother alone, daily phone calls (sometimes multiple), and it hit a point where my mom would go into work late most mornings to walk my brother to class and tell the teacher that if she got a phone call for something as stupid as a seven year old hugging his friend, she would NOT be happy about it (spoiler alert she got phone calls anyway). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly think that this bitch is why my brother hates school and learning just in general. Before that year he was always very eager to learn and a very avid reader. Afterwards, it was like pulling teeth to get him to do anything school related, and he started acting out - the biggest incident was when he stole another kid&amp;#39;s test and wrote his name on it. My mom had a talk with his second grade teacher and she tried her best with him and honestly went a ridiculous amount out of her way to try and help him so she knew what was going on and even after the test-stealing incident he didn&amp;#39;t get in a lot of trouble, but I don&amp;#39;t think that anything she could have done would have fixed it. My brother is also a very shy person and never really shows any kind of affection now. He&amp;#39;s gotten a little better in recent years, but he still hates school and is really struggling in college. I honestly don&amp;#39;t think that he&amp;#39;s ever going to do well in any kind of schooling because his heart is just never gonna be in it, and I place a lot of that blame on this fuckwad of a teacher. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg3mkfj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491902731.0, "created_utc": 1491873931.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 388}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64n5e9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3qpr4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 51, "report_reasons": null, "author": "flexiblepaper", "parent_id": "t3_64n5e9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In second grade my teacher put duct tape over my mouth.
