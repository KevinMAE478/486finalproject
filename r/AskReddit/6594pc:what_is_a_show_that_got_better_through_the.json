Sure, the first few episodes were a bit silly at times, but always keep in mind that it is a Nickelodeon show. And it has the most filler episodes that are obviously filler and nothing else.

It only gets better from there.\n\nBook Two: Earth took everything good about Book One and injected it with cactus juice. It had more episodes that focused on the characters, their relationships and personality, their strengths and weaknesses, etc. It always felt like a more personal season to me (hence its title). Some of my absolute favorite episodes are Tales of Ba Sing Se, Appa's Lost Days, and Zuko Alone. In my opinion, the only episode that I did not like was Avatar Day. That aside, I saw many similarities between general plot points between this season and The Empire Strikes Back. Very few shows end a season on such a depressing note. I love it.

I thought it started out well enough, especially for what we all knew to be its final season. I preferred that it had more one-off, filler episodes that focused on the characters rather than big arcs before the mid-season special, namely The Painted Lady, The Beach, and Sokka's Master.
