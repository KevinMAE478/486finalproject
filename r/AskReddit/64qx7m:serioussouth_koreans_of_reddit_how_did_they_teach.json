I guess Ill post to get my mind off of some things. Im on mobile so Ill just ignore all the punctuations.

It was Kim Jong Il that we were supposed to hate. This was, restrospectively, a reflection of our regime at the time; President Kim Dae Joong and President Roh Mu Hyeon (both are considered very liberal. Only liberal presidents we've ever had, in fact. Both of whom I respect and admire greatly). \n\n***\nTangent time! Pres. Kim adopted the \"Sunlight Policy\", which was loosly based on one of Aesop's Fables; The North Wind and the Sun.

Furthermore, back in 1992, when I was a second grader, I never really had the impression that South Korea was propaganda-wise particularly sympathetic to North Korea. Maybe it's a different atmosphere now and I haven't been back to South Korea since 2005, but I've heard that people are more or less sympathetic but reluctant to absorb the economic difficulties due to reunification, if it were to even happen.\n\nBack when I was living in HyoJaDong as a kid, I remember the elders saying negative things like, \"commies,\" (in a somewhat negative connotation) quite often. Not to mention, I lived 2 blocks from the Blue House at HyoJaDong, which had by that point become a ghetto with only few prominent elders who stayed behind and rest of the elites having relocated to GangNam. Granted the really rich still stayed behind in SeoChon. \n\nAs one other commentator mentioned, yes, the schools were rather benign in their portrayal of North Korea, but by no means, were the education departments sending a propagandist message of reunification. That was more or less the voice of elders who had split families or other misfortunes. \n\nFor one, my grandfather was a public official, that is until he developed alcohol dementia after years of depression and turmoil, having left behind his two oldest sons in North Korea. In addition to that, he lost two of his properties when he co-signed for a friend, who ran away after failing a business. \n\nPeople like my grandfather and my family were obviously more inclined to promote reunification, since our families had been split apart by the war, but there was also visibly a lot of commie hate back then.\n\nPersonally, I never felt like the school systems do much in South Korea to educate students on North Korea. It's almost like second nature that you just know about North Korea and feel unfortunate for the people there. \n\nFor me though, it was growing up in my family that I had to rather endure unwanted history about our family roots and history of North Korea. \n\nLike I mentioned above, my grandfather was a public official until he basically went insane. It's almost sad what kind of reality my grandfather and grandmother, or even my Dad's two older sisters (aunts) had to endure due to the Korean War. I honestly don't even know what was my grandfather's real name. He had 3 names due to fleeing to Manchuria, then from the commies, then to South Korea.\n\nFor instance, when the commies started taking power in North Korea prior to the war, my grandfather was accused of being a Pro-Japanese Collaborator and was in hiding in Manchuria. The irony about my grandfather having to live in hiding in Manchuria is rather interesting, because my grandfather if anything was a scholar, Chinese and Japanese professor, and pro-nationalist, but not a pro-Japanese Collaborator (my family hates the Japanese).\n\nUnfortunately for my grandfather, after he managed to sneak back into Pyongyang to continue his underground anti-communist movement, the war broke out in June 25th, 1950. Back then, due to his hiding from the Northern Commies, he couldn't flee the war with his wife and children, so as a result, my grandmother had to carry my younger aunt (baby) and hold her older sister by the hand and escape to the South prior to June 25th, 1950, only to leave behind their two oldest sons due to the war breaking out. My grandfather while in hiding couldn't really escape with his two sons, and if he had been in contact with his sons, our whole family line, including his sons and all relatives would have been executed for protecting a Pro-Japanese Collaborator. Either way, I heard that by dumb-luck my grandfather managed to escape, and the result of it was one of his older brothers getting shot and killed in the process. \n\nIt kind of sucks growing up in a family like mine. They are very prideful of their heritage and especially academics. Even my Dad went to Seoul National University, so there is that burden on my shoulders. What especially sucks is the fact that there is a lot of regrets in my family. Regrets of losing all our wealth that was left behind and confiscated by the Commies. Regrets about my grandfather who was a somewhat well-known figure himself, who eventually succumbed to his depression and became mentally ill. My Dad who couldn't pursue his dreams due to the family collapsing and becoming poor when he was in middle school. Hah, my Dad used to tell me when maudlin, how neighbors would call him \"\ub3c4\ub828\ub2d8\" (equivalent to Batman being called 'Master' Bruce) that is, until the family finally collapsed when my grandfather's friend ran off after failing a business and we lost everything as a co-signer.\n\nI specifically remember when I was living in HyoJaDong, some of the elders I had never met or even spoke to come to me and ask, if I was whoever's son, and addressing my grandfather with a \"sunsaengnim.\" It all comes to me now and I understand why random old people knew my grandfather and my dad, but the only part of my grandfather that I did see when I was a kid, was basically him insane most times and sane every so often. \n\nEveryone had good things to say about my grandfather. I was merely a kid back then, so I didn't really understand the implications my family history had, but I learned that my grandfather wasn't some small man, when he had passed away and about 3000 people showed up to march during his funeral ceremony. Everybody really had just one thing to say about my grandfather, and it was that as unfortunate it was for him to have passed away with regrets and sorrow, he never gave into corruption and although he didn't have to live in seclusion, he chose to distance himself from politics. \n\nAnyways, after all is said and done, nothing really matters at this point. My father passed away from a cardiac arrest last December. He was the only true blood-line I had left. I don't even know my biological mother's name, or face. I mean, I'm sure I can go to a government office in South Korea and find my birth certificate, but it all seems inane now. \n\nBefore my dad passed away, we had made a promise that we wouldn't continue the ancestor rituals beyond grandchildren who had actually seen their grandparents. My father is dead now and I definitely don't have kids (thank God) so I'm thinking I will continue the rituals for my grandparents and my dad in seclusion and end the tradition at my generation. I just don't see the point in continuing the tradition, when there are too many implications, and I certainly don't want to pass that onto my children. \n\nThe misery in our family history since the Japanese occupation is immense. Apparently our last name \"Kim\" of the \"\uac04\uc131\" tribe is minuscule with only like 50+ descendants alive in the South Korean peninsula. None of us even know each other, mainly because my grandfather was the youngest son of the main family descendant that escaped to South Korea, and his older brother and sons split off to escape to China. \n\nI heard from my living aunts and from my father and grandmother that the head family managed to escape to China and actually contacted my grandmother when she was alive in South Korea. But to be honest I don't even want to deal with it anymore. I don't even think my aunts are that happy I'm dating a 3/4 black, 1/4 white, mixed girl. Obviously, if I settle down with this girl, there is no point for them to have to deal with this family issue, I don't even know how the far relatives, if we do get in contact, would even feel about mixed children nor myself who isn't particularly prominent academically. Now granted, I am going to go back to school when I save enough money, but I already went to school twice and fucked them up both times, because I never liked the studies to begin with...lol.\n\nAll in all, for any of you who read up to this point, I commend you for having the patience to read through this comment, which deviated from the original question at hand. \n\nI just kind of wanted to let people on reddit know how foreign interests fucked over many families like mine in South Korea. \n\nI can only wish the Korean War never happened, then I'd probably be living like a chaebol with the family wealth that was confiscated by the Commies. Meh, actually, I would probably donate all the wealth, because I'd be pissed being labeled as a Pro-Japanese Collaborator. Honestly, all the Pro-Japanese Collaborator families and their wealth should be confiscated by the government and redistributed to South Korean citizens, since it was the Pro-Japanese Collaborator families who betrayed the emperor and sold the country to the Japanese for bribes.

Furthermore, back in 1992, when I was a second grader, I never really had the impression that South Korea was propaganda-wise particularly sympathetic to North Korea. Maybe it&amp;#39;s a different atmosphere now and I haven&amp;#39;t been back to South Korea since 2005, but I&amp;#39;ve heard that people are more or less sympathetic but reluctant to absorb the economic difficulties due to reunification, if it were to even happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back when I was living in HyoJaDong as a kid, I remember the elders saying negative things like, &amp;quot;commies,&amp;quot; (in a somewhat negative connotation) quite often. Not to mention, I lived 2 blocks from the Blue House at HyoJaDong, which had by that point become a ghetto with only few prominent elders who stayed behind and rest of the elites having relocated to GangNam. Granted the really rich still stayed behind in SeoChon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As one other commentator mentioned, yes, the schools were rather benign in their portrayal of North Korea, but by no means, were the education departments sending a propagandist message of reunification. That was more or less the voice of elders who had split families or other misfortunes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For one, my grandfather was a public official, that is until he developed alcohol dementia after years of depression and turmoil, having left behind his two oldest sons in North Korea. In addition to that, he lost two of his properties when he co-signed for a friend, who ran away after failing a business. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People like my grandfather and my family were obviously more inclined to promote reunification, since our families had been split apart by the war, but there was also visibly a lot of commie hate back then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I never felt like the school systems do much in South Korea to educate students on North Korea. It&amp;#39;s almost like second nature that you just know about North Korea and feel unfortunate for the people there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me though, it was growing up in my family that I had to rather endure unwanted history about our family roots and history of North Korea. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned above, my grandfather was a public official until he basically went insane. It&amp;#39;s almost sad what kind of reality my grandfather and grandmother, or even my Dad&amp;#39;s two older sisters (aunts) had to endure due to the Korean War. I honestly don&amp;#39;t even know what was my grandfather&amp;#39;s real name. He had 3 names due to fleeing to Manchuria, then from the commies, then to South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, when the commies started taking power in North Korea prior to the war, my grandfather was accused of being a Pro-Japanese Collaborator and was in hiding in Manchuria. The irony about my grandfather having to live in hiding in Manchuria is rather interesting, because my grandfather if anything was a scholar, Chinese and Japanese professor, and pro-nationalist, but not a pro-Japanese Collaborator (my family hates the Japanese).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for my grandfather, after he managed to sneak back into Pyongyang to continue his underground anti-communist movement, the war broke out in June 25th, 1950. Back then, due to his hiding from the Northern Commies, he couldn&amp;#39;t flee the war with his wife and children, so as a result, my grandmother had to carry my younger aunt (baby) and hold her older sister by the hand and escape to the South prior to June 25th, 1950, only to leave behind their two oldest sons due to the war breaking out. My grandfather while in hiding couldn&amp;#39;t really escape with his two sons, and if he had been in contact with his sons, our whole family line, including his sons and all relatives would have been executed for protecting a Pro-Japanese Collaborator. Either way, I heard that by dumb-luck my grandfather managed to escape, and the result of it was one of his older brothers getting shot and killed in the process. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It kind of sucks growing up in a family like mine. They are very prideful of their heritage and especially academics. Even my Dad went to Seoul National University, so there is that burden on my shoulders. What especially sucks is the fact that there is a lot of regrets in my family. Regrets of losing all our wealth that was left behind and confiscated by the Commies. Regrets about my grandfather who was a somewhat well-known figure himself, who eventually succumbed to his depression and became mentally ill. My Dad who couldn&amp;#39;t pursue his dreams due to the family collapsing and becoming poor when he was in middle school. Hah, my Dad used to tell me when maudlin, how neighbors would call him &amp;quot;\ub3c4\ub828\ub2d8&amp;quot; (equivalent to Batman being called &amp;#39;Master&amp;#39; Bruce) that is, until the family finally collapsed when my grandfather&amp;#39;s friend ran off after failing a business and we lost everything as a co-signer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I specifically remember when I was living in HyoJaDong, some of the elders I had never met or even spoke to come to me and ask, if I was whoever&amp;#39;s son, and addressing my grandfather with a &amp;quot;sunsaengnim.&amp;quot; It all comes to me now and I understand why random old people knew my grandfather and my dad, but the only part of my grandfather that I did see when I was a kid, was basically him insane most times and sane every so often. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone had good things to say about my grandfather. I was merely a kid back then, so I didn&amp;#39;t really understand the implications my family history had, but I learned that my grandfather wasn&amp;#39;t some small man, when he had passed away and about 3000 people showed up to march during his funeral ceremony.
