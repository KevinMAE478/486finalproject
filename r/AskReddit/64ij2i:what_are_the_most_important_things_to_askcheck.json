The last one is my own. This is an excellent thread, and I wish I had read it ages ago.\n\n**Reddit's 42 Rules of Apartment Rental**\n\n1. Check for cell reception.\n\n2. Inspect tops of cabinets, behind stove/fridge, for poop. If there are red/brown stains in the corners where the ceiling meets the walls, it's bed bugs. If there is a line of white powder along the baseboards, it can mean roaches, but more likely bedbug treatment has been performed. White powder behind fridge, stove, etc. is usually boric acid or diatomaceous earth used to treat roaches. Brown or tan kernel sized paste is also used against roaches. Check the Bed Bug Registry online and ask if the building has a history of any pest problems.\n\n3. Inspect drawer under the oven and kitchen drawers.\n\n4. Check the water pressure on cold, on hot, on both, and how long it takes to get warm.\n\n5. Bring a socket tester and test all outlets. Also make sure there are enough outlets in each room, and enough 3-prong ones.\n\n6. Ask the neighbors what the worst part of the building, street, neighborhood is.\n\n7. Request to see the exact unit you will be moving into, NOT a showcase apartment. If they refuse to at least show you an actual unit, be suspicious.\n\n8. Check to see if you have a designated parking spot (and assure its cost, if any, is satisfactory). How many visitors can you have at a time &amp; is that enough for you? On a Fri/Sat night, or any other evening/night, are there even any available spots? What happens if someone takes your spot?\n\n9. Drive through the area during rush hour if commuting via car.\n\n10. What's in close walking distance? (food, bars, stores, etc)\n\n11. If touring multiple units, take pictures of each for later comparison. When you decide on one, time-stamp photograph any damage and make sure landlord is notified of it in writing prior to move-in so you aren't blamed for it later.\n\n12. Research state tenant's rights laws.\n\n13. Make sure you're completely clear on all terms of the lease and know what utilities you'll be paying and what payment method you'll need to use.\n\n14. When driving around, take note of what kinds of cars are parked around, and if they're substantially different from yours, your potential new neighbors lifestyle may differ from your own.\n\n15. Call a pizza place and see if they deliver there after dark. If not, the place may have a history as being unsafe.\n\n16. Make sure there's an Internet provider suitable to your preferences.\n\n17. An experienced landlord is usually better to deal with than an inexperienced one.\n\n18. Get an idea of the general price range of utilities such as heat and AC for the unit. Ask neighbors in similar units the general price range for heating/cooling.\n\n19. Google your potential new landlord. Look up online property records in the county you are in. Slumlords will generally have lots of liens against them and/or have multiple properties in foreclosure.\n\n20. Assure the windows are double-paned/double-glazed and in good repair if the area is cold to avoid high heating bills. See if the windows open and close easily.\n\n21. Look up crime statistics for the area and ask the police how often they have been called to the street/complex in the last 6 months.\n\n22. An apartment with laundry facilities will save you money. If they don't have them, check the prices/quality of the nearest ones.\n\n23. www.apartmentratings.com may be a useful resource.\n\n24. Drive through the area at 10pm one day, 2am the next, and see what kind of activity is occurring, especially on Fri/Sat nights. Walk through the complex around 8pm.\n\n25. Be wary of any musty smells that could indicate water damage. Too many air fresheners may be an attempt to hide this.\n\n26. Fill all sinks/tubs. Drain simultaneously and flush each toilet during.\n\n27. Ask if they accept section 8 or convicted felons, if you care about those things.\n\n28. Find out who does the maintenance (some handyman, a legit company, the landlord?). What are their policies on work orders? Can they be submitted online? What is their response time guarantee for after hours emergencies? If it's just a single landlord and not a property management company, do they have someone you can call when they go on vacation and the hot water heater breaks?\n\n29. Make sure the building managers or owners are local.\n\n30. When scoping out potential neighborhoods, check out the local grocery stores to get a good sense of the type of people that live in that neighborhood. Also check the closest gas station late at night.\n\n31. Check your responsibilities as a tenant. After moving in many landlords require you to pay the cost of a stopped up toilet, pest infestations, and require you to shovel snow from sidewalk/mow the grass on areas around the house, or clean gutters. They may also require you to pay the cost to fix supplied appliances.\n\n32. Dress well, and ask for a discount.\n\n33. If surrounding places have belongings left sitting on the porches (toys, stoves, seating, decorations), it's a good sign for little/no theft and a kid-friendly environment.\n\n34. If the leasing agent or landlord promises to do something before you move in, it needs to be written into the lease or it may not happen.\n\n35. Assure the unit has adequate storage space for your needs.\n\n36. 1st floor apartments are most convenient for thieves, and the most frequently broken into.\n\n37. It's usually best to avoid living in the same building as your landlord, unless the other tenants vouch for them.\n\n38. If there's a homeowner's association, find out its rules.\n\n39. Find out the policy on smoking, pets, noise, and visitors.\n\n40. If you must break the lease, what are the consequences/options?\n\n41. What's the average rental time for apartments in the building? If people aren't staying long, it's a bad sign.\n\n42. Try to get a look at as many different options in the area as possible so you can see if what they're offering is competitively priced for the size/type of unit you're seeking.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=\"/u/DeaconNuno\"&gt;u/DeaconNuno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, I just went through this whole thread and compiled a summary of what I feel to be the most helpful tips you glorious interfolk have posted. The last one is my own. This is an excellent thread, and I wish I had read it ages ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reddit&amp;#39;s 42 Rules of Apartment Rental&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check for cell reception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspect tops of cabinets, behind stove/fridge, for poop. If there are red/brown stains in the corners where the ceiling meets the walls, it&amp;#39;s bed bugs. If there is a line of white powder along the baseboards, it can mean roaches, but more likely bedbug treatment has been performed. White powder behind fridge, stove, etc. is usually boric acid or diatomaceous earth used to treat roaches. Brown or tan kernel sized paste is also used against roaches. Check the Bed Bug Registry online and ask if the building has a history of any pest problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspect drawer under the oven and kitchen drawers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the water pressure on cold, on hot, on both, and how long it takes to get warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bring a socket tester and test all outlets. Also make sure there are enough outlets in each room, and enough 3-prong ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask the neighbors what the worst part of the building, street, neighborhood is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Request to see the exact unit you will be moving into, NOT a showcase apartment. If they refuse to at least show you an actual unit, be suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check to see if you have a designated parking spot (and assure its cost, if any, is satisfactory). How many visitors can you have at a time &amp;amp; is that enough for you? On a Fri/Sat night, or any other evening/night, are there even any available spots? What happens if someone takes your spot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drive through the area during rush hour if commuting via car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s in close walking distance? (food, bars, stores, etc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If touring multiple units, take pictures of each for later comparison. When you decide on one, time-stamp photograph any damage and make sure landlord is notified of it in writing prior to move-in so you aren&amp;#39;t blamed for it later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research state tenant&amp;#39;s rights laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you&amp;#39;re completely clear on all terms of the lease and know what utilities you&amp;#39;ll be paying and what payment method you&amp;#39;ll need to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When driving around, take note of what kinds of cars are parked around, and if they&amp;#39;re substantially different from yours, your potential new neighbors lifestyle may differ from your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call a pizza place and see if they deliver there after dark. If not, the place may have a history as being unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure there&amp;#39;s an Internet provider suitable to your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An experienced landlord is usually better to deal with than an inexperienced one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get an idea of the general price range of utilities such as heat and AC for the unit.

These take no time to check but will have a huge impact on your quality of life.\n\n**Plumbing:** Turn a sink on to hot when you come in to the house. Let it run for awhile and let them know you're just curious how long it takes hot water to flow. Once you get hot water, look under and around the sink to be sure there are no leaks.\n\n**Electronics:** Ask where the circuit breaker is and if you can look at it. This is an important thing for you to know about in the event of a power surge or tripping a breaker. When you open the breaker box, just make sure it isn't completely filthy and it looks like everything is capped and has functioning switches. Ask which ones are for your apartment if you have a shared breaker.\n\n**Insulation:** You can't control the weather, but if you go on a windy day be sure to run your hands around the door and window frames. This can easily be fixed with adhesive insulation if they are small cracks and you like the property but make a nasty surprise if you're caught unprepared.\n\n**Heating/air:** Ask how the unit is heated and cooled during the appropriate seasons. If it is a gas heating unit, your apartment will dry out a little more than a fully electrical one so you'll want to have a humidifier. Ask the last time the system was serviced and make sure that you have a carbon monoxide / gas detector. If you will be using window AC units, be sure they can be removed during the winter and that, when in the window, they get sun during part of the day. If not, they will fail to dry out properly and can collect mold.\n\n**Smoking:** If you are a nonsmoker you're going to want to be sure your apartment has either never had a smoker in it or has been properly cleaned since an indoors smoker lived there.

If you don't have the time or interest in doing that then you don't want to be surprised when all the stuff under your sink is damp and the wind is howling through your windows in the dead of winter when you're trying to sleep after a long day.", "edited": 1491842527.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have moved a lot and rented a lot due to the nature of both my childhood and job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a list of things I commonly encounter and that I help friends look for when I go along with them (also, always bring a friend who isn&amp;#39;t looking for housing - they are settled and likely to be looking at different things): integrity of plumbing, electronics, insulation, heating/air, and if anyone in the house has smoked before. These take no time to check but will have a huge impact on your quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plumbing:&lt;/strong&gt; Turn a sink on to hot when you come in to the house. Let it run for awhile and let them know you&amp;#39;re just curious how long it takes hot water to flow. Once you get hot water, look under and around the sink to be sure there are no leaks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronics:&lt;/strong&gt; Ask where the circuit breaker is and if you can look at it. This is an important thing for you to know about in the event of a power surge or tripping a breaker. When you open the breaker box, just make sure it isn&amp;#39;t completely filthy and it looks like everything is capped and has functioning switches. Ask which ones are for your apartment if you have a shared breaker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insulation:&lt;/strong&gt; You can&amp;#39;t control the weather, but if you go on a windy day be sure to run your hands around the door and window frames. This can easily be fixed with adhesive insulation if they are small cracks and you like the property but make a nasty surprise if you&amp;#39;re caught unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heating/air:&lt;/strong&gt; Ask how the unit is heated and cooled during the appropriate seasons. If it is a gas heating unit, your apartment will dry out a little more than a fully electrical one so you&amp;#39;ll want to have a humidifier. Ask the last time the system was serviced and make sure that you have a carbon monoxide / gas detector. If you will be using window AC units, be sure they can be removed during the winter and that, when in the window, they get sun during part of the day. If not, they will fail to dry out properly and can collect mold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoking:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are a nonsmoker you&amp;#39;re going to want to be sure your apartment has either never had a smoker in it or has been properly cleaned since an indoors smoker lived there. If a long-term resident also smoked indoors, the smell will have permeated in to the walls, carpet, and even the cabinets depending on how long they lived there and how heavy they smoked. Make sure the carpets have been professionally cleaned and open cabinets and closets and sniff for smoke smells.

Hope it helps:\n\nThe other replies bring up great points too, so take it all into consideration, and most importantly, choose what's important to you, no place is perfect, but it can be perfect for you. \n\n- Surrounding noise. Is there a nightclub/popular bar underneath the apartment/nearby? Is there a police/fire/EMT station closeby that might sound sirens in the middle of the night? A movie theater on the same block (think The Dark Knight's Han Zimmer soundtrack in IMAX vibrating your apartment at the midnight showing - assuming you're not there yourself ;) )? Is there a college campus nearby that might attract a noisier crowd to local restaurants/bars? Finally, see if there are any plans for construction projects or demolitions nearby. This could make for years where all you hear is constant bulldozers and jackhammers. \n\n- Interior noise. Are the walls thin? Are there children that make a lot of noise above you/below you/beside you? Are you going to hear the conception of your neighbor's next child to replace the one your murder because it won't stop crying? That aside, if you are a noisy person (i.e. you like to watch movies loudly, or with the subwoofer turned up, or listen to music) thin walls can also be a huge factor for you. You'd hate to move into a new place only to be told on housewarming night that your music is too loud as per by-law 19.6, subsection A - clause 32c. Back to the college crowd - is this building the type that houses college aged residents who are going to be noisy? \n\n- Inclusions. I signed for a beautiful condo that had stainless steel everything, very modern, the works. This included floor-to-ceiling windows. Awesome, right? Wrong. This place didn't have curtains included. I'm talking at least 12 ft windows, sun in my eyes, and visible from the bed. The issues here: 1. There are no curtain rods long enough for the width of the windows 2. There are no curtains long enough for the height of the windows 3. Curtains are !@#$ing expensive when you have to have them custom made, including the damn rod. 4. The building could have not allowed modifications to the walls, which means you can't put up curtains (rare, but happens). This is just a small example of the many things you can look at for inclusions. Feel free to ask for more examples(Washer/Dryer? Dishwasher?). Remember: Just because you see it during the open house/showing, doesn't mean it'll be there when you move in.\n\n- Climate. Is there an A/C unit and/or heating unit included? Is the monthly bill for these two included in the cost? How cold does it get in this area? Some areas have a history of consumption/charges for heating, gas, electricity, etc. You definitely want to check that out to estimate monthly bills for those periods. For all you know, a window has a crazy draft that nobody bothers to fix or the building refuses to pay for. You can also ask old tenants/owners for their previous utility bills.\n\n- Plumbing. How's the water pressure in the shower? How's the shower head? How fast does the hot water run out? Is there a hot water tank per unit, or is there a boiler room downstairs? How is hot water calculated? If my neighbor flushes their toilet, will my shower be ruined? Small things to consider here.\n\n- Parking. If you plan to keep a car, is there affordable parking in the building? Another option that's usually much cheaper is finding an indoor garage that does monthly parking passes. Sure, you may not be able to take the elevator to your car, but having to walk a block may save you hundreds. Is there street parking? Where will visitors park if/when they come over?\n\n- Contractual obligations. Usually (well, for leases anyway, but some condos do this too as part of \"membership\") there's a generic form that everyone uses to rent a place, but you are more than free to add \"extra conditions\" to it, as is the landlord. Be careful with this. The last thing you need is for them to throw in \"Tenant agrees to have wall patched up at his/her expense upon moving in\" and you signing without reading. You are also free to add your own conditions i.e. \"Landlord agrees to have cleaning service come in prior to move-in date of June 30th, 2017\". Condos also have ludicrous rules sometimes, so just be careful with any \"addendum\" or extra clauses.\n\n- Location for services. This may or may not be important to you but you may want to check if you're eligible for one-day shipping with Amazon or if your area gets Google Fiber, or whatever other location-based service you hold dear.\n\n- Commute time. Is it worth it to save an extra $50/month if your commute is increased by an hour each way to/from work? Is the closest public transportation some strange route that only comes once a day? Is there tons of construction around you, that will cause constant traffic?\n\n- Finally, the best time to visit a location is when you'll primarily be home (so for someone working a 9-5, visiting around 7 PM would be ideal). I want to emphasize that these are just guidelines, and whatever is important to you, make that your checklist - you can't have it all, but you can have what makes you happy, which is what counts.

Not a fun year, haha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also check around the molding and ceiling if you&amp;#39;re renting an older property. If the current tenants are there with you, &lt;em&gt;read their body language&lt;/em&gt;. Are they outgoing and happy to talk to you about the place? Great! Are they withdrawn and quiet? Scour the fuck out of that apartment. Open drawers, examine everything. My SO and I were looking at an apartment and I did not go with my gut or look things over closely. Turns out, the apartment was infested with thousands of cockroaches. We looked at the ceiling and the molding and it was encrusted with roach crud. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask how soundproof the building is. I currently live in brand new construction and the place is so thin, I can hear someone sneeze outside. So don&amp;#39;t be afraid to grill the management about how much effort they put into the walls and ceilings and floors. Nothing sucks more than living with some party bros downstairs who holler and yell for 4 hours a night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to not rush and definitely trust your gut before you sign a lease. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg2jk3g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491857382.0, "created_utc": 1491828582.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 183}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ij2i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ij2i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg2oey7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 97, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fzohh", "parent_id": "t1_dg2krqo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You can save time by listening to the police scanner while you camp", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can save time by listening to the police scanner while you camp&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg2oey7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491864022.0, "created_utc": 1491835222.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 97}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ij2i", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg2o2pe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 388, "report_reasons": null, "author": "84th_legislature", "parent_id": "t1_dg2krqo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't usually like ITTs, but...yeah.
