I'm a trans woman who lives stealth (meaning that people presume that I'm cis,) I've been on hormones for several years, and I'm post-op.\n\nOne of the largest differences is just how much nicer men are to me. I used to get bullied for being a \"faggot\" even though I was attracted to women. For the most part though, I could go about my day and enjoy my personal space without interruption. Now that I've transitioned, people are far more likely to make small talk, especially men. I used to be able to ride the elevator up to my apartment without eye contact, now I can't get in and out without my neighbors introducing themselves or making some sort of comment regarding my clothing and the weather. Last time I moved, some random guy I had never met offered to do the heavy lifting for me. He moved my bureau. Before transition, I usually had to beg people to help me. I notice a lot more people checking me out in public. These days, I can't even do something as innocent as getting an iced coffee without the barista writing a little smiley face or heart on my cup. In isolation, a single event like that can be nice and validating. When it happens frequently, it feels more like I'm an object on display. People are more likely to touch me in conversation. You know the casual reaching out to rub somebody's shoulder? That never happened before, but I get touched all the time without permission now.\n\nOn average, people perceive me to be less intelligent. It's funny, even with people who knew me prior to transition, like my step dad. Before, we'd get into political arguments and they'd be dismissed as differing opinions. Now, he's quick to be condescending and tell me that I \"don't understand.\"\n\nI got a flat tire recently and had to change it in the parking lot.

It's a welcome change, but it's eye opening to see how something so simple can fundamentally change your social interactions.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions if you have them!", "edited": 1492018596.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: I think my comment is getting hit by an auto mod, it won&amp;#39;t show up when I&amp;#39;m logged out :/&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aww yeah! I&amp;#39;m a trans woman who lives stealth (meaning that people presume that I&amp;#39;m cis,) I&amp;#39;ve been on hormones for several years, and I&amp;#39;m post-op.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the largest differences is just how much nicer men are to me. I used to get bullied for being a &amp;quot;faggot&amp;quot; even though I was attracted to women. For the most part though, I could go about my day and enjoy my personal space without interruption. Now that I&amp;#39;ve transitioned, people are far more likely to make small talk, especially men. I used to be able to ride the elevator up to my apartment without eye contact, now I can&amp;#39;t get in and out without my neighbors introducing themselves or making some sort of comment regarding my clothing and the weather. Last time I moved, some random guy I had never met offered to do the heavy lifting for me. He moved my bureau. Before transition, I usually had to beg people to help me. I notice a lot more people checking me out in public. These days, I can&amp;#39;t even do something as innocent as getting an iced coffee without the barista writing a little smiley face or heart on my cup. In isolation, a single event like that can be nice and validating. When it happens frequently, it feels more like I&amp;#39;m an object on display. People are more likely to touch me in conversation. You know the casual reaching out to rub somebody&amp;#39;s shoulder? That never happened before, but I get touched all the time without permission now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On average, people perceive me to be less intelligent. It&amp;#39;s funny, even with people who knew me prior to transition, like my step dad. Before, we&amp;#39;d get into political arguments and they&amp;#39;d be dismissed as differing opinions.
