This is a german shepherd after all, a heavy enough dog to make noises as it runs around. Possibly the dog heard the sound of the OP and friend entering the house, runs down the stairs expecting to be greeted, but was stopped by the door at the bottom of the stairs. Nobody comes to meet him and instead the house falls silent (as OP stops to listen). The dog begins to get confused and agitated (maybe thinking there are intruders in the house), and runs back up the stairs. At some point (maybe the OP misremembers and it was before it ran back upstairs) the dog probably pushed at the door to try and open it, causing enough vibration for the bell on the handle to chime. The dog then hears someone coming and jumps on the chair, shaking. OP approaches, but the dog being a dog (as clever as they often are) is stuck in the mindset that something else is also in the house. And dogs can undoubtedly sense human behaviours well enough to tell the difference between a human acting excitedly as opposed to cautiously. Both the OP and friend acting cautiously will probably have reinforced the dog's impression that there was an intruder (rather than realising the noises were them all along), causing it to carry on looking down the stairs.   \nEdit: wording", "edited": 1491854725.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what I was thinking.

Possibly the dog heard the sound of the OP and friend entering the house, runs down the stairs expecting to be greeted, but was stopped by the door at the bottom of the stairs. Nobody comes to meet him and instead the house falls silent (as OP stops to listen). The dog begins to get confused and agitated (maybe thinking there are intruders in the house), and runs back up the stairs. At some point (maybe the OP misremembers and it was before it ran back upstairs) the dog probably pushed at the door to try and open it, causing enough vibration for the bell on the handle to chime. The dog then hears someone coming and jumps on the chair, shaking. OP approaches, but the dog being a dog (as clever as they often are) is stuck in the mindset that something else is also in the house. And dogs can undoubtedly sense human behaviours well enough to tell the difference between a human acting excitedly as opposed to cautiously. Both the OP and friend acting cautiously will probably have reinforced the dog&amp;#39;s impression that there was an intruder (rather than realising the noises were them all along), causing it to carry on looking down the stairs.&lt;br/&gt;\nEdit: wording&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg3672l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491883098.0, "created_utc": 1491854298.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 267}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg2xa14", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 211, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bongokhrusha", "parent_id": "t1_dg2mg96", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sounds like the dog went down and up and then when you came to the poor thing, it was scared that it was home alone ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds like the dog went down and up and then when you came to the poor thing, it was scared that it was home alone &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg2xa14", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491873785.0, "created_utc": 1491844985.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 211}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64j73v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg2wxok", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 34, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sanscosmic", "parent_id": "t1_dg2mg96", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good old gramps was fking with you", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good old gramps was fking with you&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg2wxok", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491873431.0, "created_utc": 1491844631.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 34}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64j73v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3lo6z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 35, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Noeir", "parent_id": "t1_dg2mg96", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "May be already to late but: \n\nThis freaked me the fuck out because the only time I remember being scared of something I thought to be supernatural was when I was home alone and my dog started barking at me (kinda in an angry tone I never heard before) while I made myself a sandwich in the kitchen. \n\nMind you, this was not the typical \"give me your sandwich human bark\". \nI told him to stop and put up one finger while saying \"sit\" and he sat down, somehow back to his calm self. \n\n\nBut as soon as I came into my room and went back on the computer I could hear and see him there, now standing again.

You can see for miles and miles and miles up there. I can't remember exactly how tall the tower was, 100-150 feet I think. I was replacing a 900mhz antennae. The company I worked for was trying to start a wifi broadband business nearby and needed this antennae to transmit the signal over the mountain. We had been up there 6 or 7 times already and when on the tower, we would regularly see deer... Once I saw a black bear with 2 cubs.\n\nIt was late autumn, so there were not a lot of leaves on the trees, giving me a pretty clear view through the canopy. I had just climbed the ladder to the top of the tower and hauled up the tools and new antennae. I laid down to catch my breath and ended up just chilling for about 30 minutes, I was not in a hurry. I started hearing some noises from the woods below a bit further along the ridge. I was just looking in that direction trying to figure out what was making the racket when I noticed some animals or something coming along the ridge. A group of 4 HUGE sasquatch walked out of the woods into the clearing by the tower and followed the fence-line to the other side of the tower. I guess they didn't see me because they just kept trucking it along the ridge.\n\nI am aware that this sounds crazy, and I get that from everyone that I have told this story to. To be fair, the things could have been people in very convincing costumes.  From the top of the tower it's hard judge the size of something on the ground without anything around for scale (My car was on the other side of the small building at the base of the tower, so I couldn't use that), so maybe they were not as large as they appeared. Although I have no clue why anyone would be in the woods on the top of a mountain miles away from the nearest main road wearing giant full body costumes.

", "edited": 1491851644.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was on top of an old unused AT&amp;amp;T microwave transmitting tower that was on top of a mountain in rural Northern VA. You can see for miles and miles and miles up there. I can&amp;#39;t remember exactly how tall the tower was, 100-150 feet I think. I was replacing a 900mhz antennae. The company I worked for was trying to start a wifi broadband business nearby and needed this antennae to transmit the signal over the mountain. We had been up there 6 or 7 times already and when on the tower, we would regularly see deer... Once I saw a black bear with 2 cubs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was late autumn, so there were not a lot of leaves on the trees, giving me a pretty clear view through the canopy. I had just climbed the ladder to the top of the tower and hauled up the tools and new antennae. I laid down to catch my breath and ended up just chilling for about 30 minutes, I was not in a hurry. I started hearing some noises from the woods below a bit further along the ridge. I was just looking in that direction trying to figure out what was making the racket when I noticed some animals or something coming along the ridge. A group of 4 HUGE sasquatch walked out of the woods into the clearing by the tower and followed the fence-line to the other side of the tower. I guess they didn&amp;#39;t see me because they just kept trucking it along the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am aware that this sounds crazy, and I get that from everyone that I have told this story to. To be fair, the things could have been people in very convincing costumes.  From the top of the tower it&amp;#39;s hard judge the size of something on the ground without anything around for scale (My car was on the other side of the small building at the base of the tower, so I couldn&amp;#39;t use that), so maybe they were not as large as they appeared. Although I have no clue why anyone would be in the woods on the top of a mountain miles away from the nearest main road wearing giant full body costumes.

He was very religious and kept a rosary with him. He died of a heart attack and somehow his rosary ended up hanging next to projector 5. A few years later the theater remodeled and one of the managers took the rosary as a joke. On his way home he crashed, his car rolling down a ditch leaving him with some moderate injuries. The next day, the rosary was back hanging by the projector with no one knowing how it got there.

I would say when I was maybe 5 or 7 was when my dad ended up meeting my now step mom and they ended up living together at my step mom's place. The house that she lived in had been (I guess) owned into their family for 196 years at the time (it's an old house out in rural America) . All I knew was that it was old as shit.\n\nThe earliest memories I can recall from the first summer I ended up staying there I just had this eerily feeling over me constantly and especially during the evening/ night. Like that of a decaying feeling. The only way I could imagine describing the feeling is that of someone being told after 20 years of a what they felt was a happy marriage suddenly their spouse is divorcing them- and it's final. The sadness, hurt, anger and other emotions that would follow is what I felt in that house except it wasn't a separation of marriage that caused it but of death. something or someone had died in that house a long time ago and refused to move on, regardless if time and other factors would move on without it.\n\nThat's how it felt to me. \n\nAnyways, fast forward a few years later, my step mom becomes pregnant with my second sister and my dad's first daughter. So in preparation they end up having an addition put onto the house so they can have their own place and my future baby sister could have her own place, meanwhile my step brother and I shared a room (I didn't live there year round so it made sense).\n\nThat's when everything started.\n\nI just remember when we came back to live in the house after the addition was put in, it was immediately exciting to see the big changes that had been done to the house and see how they were going to setup the room for my future baby sister and all that jazz. The first night back there, I honestly think changed me. I used to before then, was a heavy sleeper to the point I would snore and would wake everyone else up before my self. Today I am such a light sleeper, it's disgusting. I just remember waking up one night and the room was particularly dark and instantly fear- just set over me. just to give some brief background info on me at the time, I was probably 5' something and weighing a hardy 170 lbs probably, (I was a fatty growing up. lol) and I had a confidence that at that age that made me feel that I was strong and to be reckoned with (oh god watch out world here come's the fat 7 yr old- he's dangerous. lol). That was the first time that I just felt so scared and defenseless I didn't know what to do. like something was just, there looming over me in the dark and watching me, wanting to make me feel unwanted there. Over a period of weeks this feeling would come and go every other night, and was so bothering some nights that I eventually would sprint and end up sleeping on the floor in my dad and step mom's room. They hated that. lol \n\nWell sure enough a month later I overheard my dad and step mom talking and come to find out my dad had also been having sleeping issues as well. He was telling her house he'd just have this feeling come over him like every night of someone standing right in the middle of his torso, a cold feeling, and would leave him alone. Makes sense why he suddenly started to \"forget\" to turn the tv off at night to give some sort of distraction from what HE knew and what I knew our minds would turn to when we would lay down at night. To top it off my step brother at this time began to have an imaginary friend that would play toys with him. \n\nMy step mom decided to ask my step brother one day about his \"special friend\" and wanted to know about him. I guess he was an old black man and knew my step mom somehow?? (My step mom and all of them are black- my dad is on the opposite side of that color spectrum) After trying to figure out who it could possibly be my step mom's mother said if it could have been an actual person, from the description and other random details given- it could have been her mom's grandfather. Cool. \n\nI think the most eerie thing about his \"friend\" he had too was that he had one particular toy he LOVED to play with and conveniently enough it was some electronic toy that had like a person or a creature in a box that when you pressed the button it rumbled and would make noises saying \"Let me out!!!\" and \"helpppp!!\" (I actually do remember witnessing it go off on it's own- even without batteries) I think the climax of this for me was one night I remember hearing a toy go off in my sister's room (oh ya, they had the baby and she's a couple months old at this point) and the feeling in my gut.... god help me. I thought it was soo unique that 1. only I woke up and heard this and 2. everyone was dead asleep. I figured I would ignore it and it would eventually stop and I could go back to sleep well.... it didn't. If I could have guessed the time of which this was going off, it had to have been atleast for 20 some odd minutes non stop going off. I would quietly yell to my brother from across the room to see if he would wake- nothing. So with all the fuck it's left in me, I got up and quickly ran into her room and I started throwing each toy out of that toy chest one after another till I got to the bottom and saw the toy that was making all the racket. When I grabbed it and tried to find the switch to turn it off it did that thing that would happen in some sort of cliche ghost movie- it turned off. I noped soo fast out of that room and into my bad and under the covers I was such a mess. Maybe 10 minutes after that my baby sister lets out a blood curdling scream that of something I would imagine a person would make if they were having a limb cut off against their will or their life was in danger. Luckily that woke my parents up and they ran in there to get here.

It was just just a little one, with four bedrooms and a living room and kitchen in the middle intended for college kids to live in. It was a bit off campus and right next to a gigantic cemetery, which is why I think it had the activity that it did.\n\nThere were two main ghosts, if you want to call them that, as far as I can tell. We ended up just referring to them as \"masculine\" and \"feminine.\" The main event that ticked off the activity was one night, we were all hanging in our rooms, most with the doors closed. I remember hearing what sounded like two people talking, one voice was light and feminine and the other was lower and much more masculine, coming from the main area/kitchen. They had a long conversation from the way it sounded, at first I thought it was a roommate and a girl he brought over, after a while realized that it wasn't anything like his voice. I opened that door and it was like the talking stopped mid-sentence. Not long after my roommate came from his door across the hall, said he heard it too, and we just kinda looked at each other for a bit, and decided to go for a walk cause it was just creepy.\n\nThis event set off a chain reaction of weird shit:\nAnother night, it sounded like something punched the wall as hard as it could in kitchen after some jumbled speaking. Literally, \"Blah blah, BAMMMM.\" It reverberated around the whole kitchen, scared the shit out of all of us because we were just about to sleep.\nYou would hear talking from another room on occasion. Just weird mumbles and the like, sometimes there would be more than one voice.\nYou would always see shadows moving at the periphery of your vision. More than once saw full form figures. My friend at the time and roommate moved out after he saw something dark and human shaped in his Skype window through his webcam standing in his doorway, a short while before I left. Once there was one just standing in a friends room while he was away, I just ignored it and went into my room and locked the door, I think I had some shock going on. You felt like you were being watched quite often.\nFootsteps, all the time. Ranging from hard to soft. One time I was up around 9 o'clock, and I kept hearing someone walking on the grass outside the building, back and forth, while the window was open. That unmistakable swish-swish of shoes on grass. At first I just thought it was another tenant, but after a while I looked and there was no one there, and yet I could still hear someone walking back and forth along the side of the building. What made it even more freaky was I was the only one living there at the time, and the units were mostly empty because it was summer.\n\nMy friend had a baking sheet thrown at him. It flew from the top of the fridge where we kept our pans right at his head while cooking. This happened after he was trying to communicated and was taunting the \"ghost.\" It wasn't uncommon to have things like keys, cups, etc knocked off the counters or having things move to a different spot than where you had left it.\nBut the greatest, and freakiest was the first Christmas of the two years I lived there. I had gone home for the break, and we had all left around the same time. We had locked the place up as we had left, and turned all the lights off and latched everything. While at home, there was this video card that I had left in my apt. that my friend was wanting to take a look at, we thought we could fix it for him. So we drove the hour long drive back to my apartment to pick it up. When we got there the place had the fucking worst feeling I have ever experienced. Just felt oppression walking into the place. All the lights were on, and my friends computer was playing a movie. That part freaked me out the most, because he had locked the door to his room, and had shut his computer off and he had this stupid long password.\n\nThinking that someone had broke in, I grabbed a knife and we cleared room to room. I had to jimmy open my friends room that had the computer playing a movie, but there was no one there. No sign of force entry, all the windows were locked. Wanting to get the fuck out of there, I just chalked it up to the weird apartment and we decided to both use the bathroom and get the hell out with the video card. As I'm looking for the card, my friend just shouts \"HOLY SHIT\" from the bathroom and comes out pure white, pants still unbuttoned. He says while he was peeing, something whispered in his ear from the shower. He couldn't make out what it was saying, but it was a feminine voice. He never believed me when I told him the place was weird, he didn't doubt me after that and it took him a long time before he would come visit me again in that apartment.\n\nFinally all the weird shit came to a head. It would go through phases, where things were relatively quiet for a while to batshit crazy for a month. This particular cycle was pretty bad, and my friend/roommate was really being bothered. He went to the landlady to complain, and maybe get us out of our contract and she said and I quote: \"Oh, don't worry. We have had a lot of complaints about that in the past, but no one has ever gotten hurt!\"\n\nI was and still am an atheist, I despise religion, but that situation really forced me to change my mind on ghosts and the after life. It really felt like at times something was trying to talk to us, and at times something was just trying to troll us. It really messed with my friend, he had a personality change and became quite an asshole, I don't talk to him and kinda fucking hate him. But, I think a lot of that came from this apartment we were at, and the effects it had on him mentally. As lame as the TV shows make it out to be, I really got into ghost hunting, already a passing hobby, and had some crazy experiences because of this. I think its something that we just can't prove yet, death is something beyond what we can quantify to the best of our abilities.\n\nFor anyone that asks, we had a CO detector, never alarmed us to any problem.

Then I check the last room at the end of the hall which is his brother&amp;#39;s room. He is fast a sleep no one else in there with him. The hall way is a dead end and there is no way she could have came back out without me seeing her.

It just scared the wits out of me:\n\nMy 2 year old was really sick and throwing up every half hour one night. So I stayed up with her so I could keep an eye on her. We were sitting on the couch in the family room around 11pm. I was watching TV and she had dozed off in my lap. I thought about getting up to close the blinds on the glass double-doors that lead into the backyard but I didn't want to disturb my daughter. I was kind of staring off, lost in my own thoughts when I realized I was actually staring at something odd. It looked like a face was peering back at me through the glass door. My heart started to race as I snapped to attention and realized to my horror that there *was* a face staring back at me! It looked like a man's face but because it was so dark out, it was hard to make out any features. The face didn't move but it looked like he/it had a small, creepy smile. The eyes also looked slightly red. Not glowing red but like swollen. I didn't see a body, just the face. Also, it was kind of low, as if he were crouched down. \n\nI didn't know what to do. I was frozen with fear. I glanced to the TV and pretended to be watching it as I thought up a plan. I briefly glanced back at the face and it was gone! This scared me more than if it had still been there. Eventually I began to relax though and started to convince myself that it was just some sort of illusion brought on by exhaustion and the way the lights in the room reflected against the glass. About fifteen minutes later I glanced at the glass doors again and saw something that made my blood run cold: *something* was hanging off the side of the door! It was on the outside of the door and it looked like some huge shadowy man/monkey/thing was hanging there by an arm and gently swinging to and fro, like a kid would swing on the stall doors in a public bathroom. (We used to swing on the bathroom stall doors as kids so this is the only way I could describe it.) But what really scared me was the weird smile and the red swollen eyes on the thing's head. I didn't care if this was illusion, I was done!\n\nThat was it for me! I bundled up my daughter in my arms and fled the house. I had gone over to my neighbor's and her husband offered to check around my house. He said he didn't find anything when he returned...something I figured would happen.

HDU - Started on my night shift and a patient turned to me and stated that he was going to die tonight, and that I couldn't let the shadow people take him. He ended up dying that night with the light on, and you could see shadows dancing around his bed, when no-one else could walk in that bay\n\n2. HDU - Had a patient who needed to be tubed and taken up to ITU in the end, but a couple of hours before that he had a delirious phase, and kept saying that his wife was watching him, and that there was something different about her, that she wasn't the same and that he just wanted her to go away and that he was going to visit her when he could get out of bed (at the time she was in the same hospital a floor below him for a different reason). Turns out she had died about 2 days before that, whilst he was in surgery.\n\n3. HDU - I nursed a patient who had come back from surgery with a very distinct leg ulcer (they had tried to wash it out and do a skin graft but it was too necrotic and they were going to take his leg off the next day). He was very confused over night, but the next morning his wife came in and he was a lot more with it. He told everyone that he just wanted to die and that he didn't want any more treatment. He said that he wanted to die at 4:30 that afternoon, because he could then finally relax (we later found out that that was the time he used to get in from work and relax in front of the tele). He died at 4:33, that afternoon, cue me crying with his family. A couple days later, I had to go down to the bowels of the hospital to collect some equipment from the gastro ward, when i saw that patient with the leg ulcer walking around. He turned to me and smiled before walking through a locked door.\n\n4. Respiratory - First time I saw a dead body, no one told me that when you close a person's eyes, they don't stay shut like in the movies, they can spring back open. Cue me, washing this persons chest after having closed the eyes, to turn around to see him staring at me because his eyes have re-opened, I screamed like a little girl, and everyone came rushing in.\n\n5. Community - Got called out overnight to a patient's house, when we arrived we found a paramedic crew there, because the patient was vomiting fresh blood. they ended up leaving because he was dying, and there was a DNAR in place so they legally couldn't do anything. we stayed and washed him, and comforted the brother, and watched him as he died, vomiting more blood, and pooing himself constantly. All in all it took him about an hour and a half to die from liver cancer due to alcoholism, and it was a very uncomfortable and undignified death. But as no-one had informed his brother about funeral arrangements and body pick up, he had no-one to call to collect his dead brother, and we had to leave a grieving brother with his last relative's lifeless body in the next room until a funeral parlour opened 3 hours later to sort it out.\n\n6. HDU - we had a toilet which the buzzer liked to go off on it's own but patients used to avoid that bathroom, saying they saw things in there, didn't think anything of it until i went in there to answer the buzzer (no-one in there) and the door locked itself behind me, pretty hard to do seeing as the door locks only work from the inside and you have to call the maintenance man to unlock it from the outside seeing as he's the only one with a key", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copied from another thread I replied to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;HDU - Started on my night shift and a patient turned to me and stated that he was going to die tonight, and that I couldn&amp;#39;t let the shadow people take him.

My family used to own a cabin in NW Wisconsin, I basically grew up there in the summer, I knew the woods well, but at night it was wise to stay in the cabin or at least by the bonfire by the beach, because of bears, wolves, and cougars. One of the creepiest things was if you were having a bonfire, the treeline was visible from the fire pit and beach, and at night you always felt like you were being watched from that treeline. But during the day the woods always seemed normal, not so creepy, that is until this incident. So this happened somewhere between 1200-1400. Me and my cousin were having an airsoft battle, I was in full woodland camo, he was not, I retreated onto the ATV trail into the woods for a tactical advantage and our battle took us about 200 meters in to about a third of the way up the trail. We had enough at this point and were standing at the edge of a clearing on the trail talking and he was maybe 10 feet from me, when I decided to mess with him, I shushed him and said \"we're being watched\", he froze, then I realized the woods were dead quiet and I got spooked and started scanning the treeline and the other edge of the clearing from left to right when I saw it. It's teeth gave it away, it was panting and staring at my cousin, I don't expect you to believe me, but what I saw was a wolf as big as a black bear, at least 300lbs, but it wasn't normal, this wolf was on 2 legs crouching next to tree with its arm grasping the tree, grasping with a clawed hand, it had reddish brown fur. I told my cousin that \"we have to go\" and next thing I know he is sprinting and I look back at wolfy who had locked on and sprinted a few steps on two feet and then I turned and ran when it looked like wolfy was dropping to all fours, it charged us and sounded right on our asses barreling through the brush, but for whatever reason let us go when we broke out of the tree line and headed for the cabin. What stuck with me the most was the sheer size, wolfy appeared to be nearly 7' tall when upright, and that where it should've had front paws it appeared to have large clawed hands. Now I'm not sure how to explain it away rationally, I have heard wolves will occasionally kind of walk upright but as far as I know they can't sprint on 2 legs, nor do wolves get that big, and black bears more waddle on 2 legs. The closest description is silly, a werewolf or dogman.

I was finishing up the clean out of my grandparents home after my grandpa died and grandma went into an assisted living facility. My mom was sitting on the hearth in the living room while I sat on the floor as we talked while airing the house out and taking a break, the front and back doors where open and directly across from each other across the living room, so when the back door slammed shut we thought it was just the change in air pressure. So I stood up and went to open the back door back up, as I pulled it open mom said \"the front door is closing now.\" It was slowly closing, as I walked across the room I was \"talking to grandpa\" saying \"grandpa! The powers off the ac is off and the storm doors are closed I'm not wasting any of the power I promise!\" Those where his biggest pet peeves and it was nice to joke about it. But as I reached to open the front door which was now about half way closed it stopped closing and slowly swung back open barely taping the door stop on the wall. Mom freaked out. I told her it's not the first time something like that had happened, since his passing. The night he passed, he was home in the living room. There was a decorative wind chime that hung from the ceiling next to the fireplace that had never chimed without one of us kids dusting it or bumping it, that chimed as I cried and held on to mom. Grandpa also was a handyman, not a good one, but he didn't like spending money if he could just make it work. So I was attempting to take out some wires he had run from the living room to the master bedroom by drilling through into the hall closet and then into the master bedroom, I was laying on the floor in the living room pulling the wire out of the drilled holes when it pulled back away from me, I went to the closet and the bedroom and it wasn't caught on anything, went back to doing what I was doing it jerked back again, that was when I decided gramps didn't want me messing with his wires. So I stopped and apologized to him and left for the night. I miss that grumpy old man, he was always there for me when I needed him.
