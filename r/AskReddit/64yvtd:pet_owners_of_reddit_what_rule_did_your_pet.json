I got my rabbit from my old primary school. He was in the science lab. I hated school but I would attend early to help my teacher tend to the animals. The rabbit took the longest and so, naturally, I spent more time with him. About a year or so later I was allowed to take him home for the spring break, then summer. Summer ended and my teacher noticed how happy he was to be given the space to roam around. He was stuck in that cage otherwise, when in the school lab. \n\nHe was the happiest I've seen him when I first brought him home. I swear, He jumped up about 1-2 feet and clicked his heels together the very first time I let him run in my backyard which was thriving with weeds and clovers for him to munch on. He was a good sized rabbit, not ginormous. \n\nHe used to nibble on my toes and fingers, but gently. We used to share vegetables and fruit, rarely as it was a treat, and I remember watching my first \"real\" scary movie with him and I believed my fear was affecting him because when I started to get more scared he started to try and hide behind my back and force himself into the dark tunnel which was my back and the couch haha. \n\nI was so irresponsible with him too. I walked him around my neighborhood without any tie or leash. I used to, but I noticed he would follow me around all the time. So I stopped. Looking back, I was a very lucky person that he would walk after me and never left my side. \n\nThe farthest he'd be would be around.. 5ft? If I moved away he would follow after or if he went ahead then he would wait. I could call him back and we'd walk back into the house.. My first real pet and I loved him. \n\nLived to be about 8 and a half years old. Parents put him down because he had cancer and if you pet him you could feel his spine and ribs.. hard to see because of the fur. But his body was definitely losing the battle. He could no longer keep control of his bowels and even had an accident in the house, which he NEVER did for all of his life. He urinated multiple times within a minute or two, he wouldn't even eat his favorite treat.. It was sad. \n\nI remember the morning I was at a friend's house and my parents called to say they decided to put him down. I rushed home and sat with him in the bathroom for my last day with him and basically just cried. I helped him feel comfortable, I carried him outside and lay him in the grass, but he didn't move much. I then carried him back in and slept with him on the floor.
