Page. This is a really helpful reference guide for getting a sense of which flavors go with which. So if you want to make something like a rack of lamb, you can reference the entry for \"lamb\" and see what combinations work with that. Then you can think past just seasoning for that course and think through complementary sides.\n\n*The Food Lab* by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt. The author is an active redditor, at /u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt. This book talks through technique, and the reasons why recipes call for certain things. It contains a bunch of great recipes, too, and explains why certain ingredients and certain techniques are used. That allows you to get a sense of what can be substituted, increased, or reduced, and what effect that would have for a recipe. Unlike my other two recommendations, this book can essentially be previewed by reading over Kenji's writing style over at his blog, The Food Lab, at seriouseats.com. Read through a few of his guides and see if that's the kind of reference guide you're interested in.\n\n*Ratio* by Michael Ruhlman. I have a love-hate relationship with Ruhlman's stuff, but I like this book. It gives a ton of information about the building blocks of cooking, and shows all the different combinations that work, so that you can think through where you may be creative and where you'll need to stick with an established ratio. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made the jump to being a creative cook through 3 books:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flavor Bible&lt;/em&gt; by Andrew Dornenburg,\u00a0Karen A. Page. This is a really helpful reference guide for getting a sense of which flavors go with which. So if you want to make something like a rack of lamb, you can reference the entry for &amp;quot;lamb&amp;quot; and see what combinations work with that. Then you can think past just seasoning for that course and think through complementary sides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Food Lab&lt;/em&gt; by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt. The author is an active redditor, at &lt;a href=\"/u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt\"&gt;/u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt&lt;/a&gt;. This book talks through technique, and the reasons why recipes call for certain things. It contains a bunch of great recipes, too, and explains why certain ingredients and certain techniques are used. That allows you to get a sense of what can be substituted, increased, or reduced, and what effect that would have for a recipe. Unlike my other two recommendations, this book can essentially be previewed by reading over Kenji&amp;#39;s writing style over at his blog, The Food Lab, at seriouseats.com.
