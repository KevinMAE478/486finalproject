It was a VERY large envelope.  My DI was harassing some other kid about the Justin Bieber card he was sent, so he didn't get to see the horror I had just opened.  I pulled out the biggest, most flamboyant Christmas card ever.  But wait, there's more!  As I opened the giant Christmas card, a HUGE 3-dimensional Christmas tree pops out of the center of it and the card started playing music.

The tree, in all its glory, pops out of the card and it starts playing jolly music.  Sgt. Monty stares me down and looks like he's about to lunge at me and rip my heart right out of my chest.\n\nHe finally relaxes (as much as a DI can).\n\nSgt.

[Attention to Orders](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/2g0k6b/attention_to_orders/)\n\n&gt;Way back when I was 19, I was the Honor Graduate of the Fort Carson Chemical, Biological and Radiological Warfare School. [I got a plaque](http://i.imgur.com/z3g9eVe.jpg). I still have it. What I treasure more than that is the look on that General\u2019s face. I think \u201cdismay\u201d covers it. I got a meaningless award, and he got some really bad news about the modern Army of the 1960s.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s funny how that goes. With all their experience, one would think the Army would put on a hell of an awards ceremony. We all know this is not the case. Army awards ceremonies range from merely boring all the way to [criminal absurdity](http://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/2rl4td/bushhappy_boonie_rats_command_control/). It\u2019s not that the ceremonies are not well done (they\u2019re not). It\u2019s that they don\u2019t *mean* anything - no one feels honored. Ever.\n\n&gt;But formal awards ceremony are not all the Army has. There are other awards and honors - a kind of Grass-Crown awarded only by centurions and their warrior successors that persist down the centuries. \n\n&gt;One time in deep bush in III Corps northwest of Saigon, I remember getting trampled by our ~~infantry~~ cavalry company\u2019s Chief Medic as he ran over me, then grabbed a grunt who was kneeling over his buddy yelling, \u201c*Medic! Medic! Oh god! Oh my god! Medic!*\u201d in a high-pitched panicky voice. The Doc lifted that guy bodily and tossed him about four feet away from his wounded buddy, knelt down under fire and spoke calmly and with authority, \u201cThat ain\u2019t so bad. You\u2019ll be fine. This might hurt a little.\u201d\n\n&gt;At the same time, I saw a whole infantry squad stand up and move forward under fire to cover the Doc. Doc didn\u2019t notice, but I did. No orders - they just all moved up. Even the panicky guy. *That,* I submit, was an award.\n\n&gt;The Doc came by later to apologize for knocking me over (not necessary). I told him about the grunts moving forward. He seemed puzzled. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to be out there. They shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d I disagreed. \u201cYou\u2019re the Doc. You\u2019re owed some covering fire.\u201d\n\n&gt;Doc wasn't convinced. He seemed to think that *he* was the one who owed *them*. Then he laughed. \u201cOnce they call you \u2018Doc,\u2019 they own you. You have to do everything you can.\u201d\n\n&gt;I thought I understood that at the time. Not yet. Sometime later we were on fire base duty. I had been assigned as unofficial platoon leader of the mortar platoon - all of maybe ten guys. They had been whipped into shape by an excellent NCO, an E7 who couldn\u2019t control his temper well enough not to be exiled to the field. I\u2019m not sure where SFC Murphy was that evening.\n\n&gt;We were set up in the fixed mortar position, a couple of sandbagged revetments and bunkers made out of half-culverts lined with sandbags. It was late evening and we were firing harassment &amp; interdiction fires around the perimeter. Turns out that someone was being harassed. I think the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) had a spotter in the treeline outside the perimeter who zeroed in on our muzzle flashes. Maybe.\n\n&gt;Anyway the first 82mm round landed in the ammo pit. There was a rain of rockets, but the mortar fire was all on us. Everyone scrambled for cover, me included. I had my radio on, PRC 25 with a folded fiber-glass antenna. The rounds were hitting all around us. I dived into one of those half-culvert bunkers and hooked my antenna on the outer edge. There I was on my hands and knees, stuck outside the bunker with my ass and my junk facing the enemy.\n\n&gt;Oh hell. Might as well stand up. I did. Everyone else was gone except Bear, the aptly-named large hairy guy who had what passed in mortartown for a Fire Direction Protractor Thingy (FDPT). I looked at him, he looked at me. He pointed to a spot in the treeline. I grabbed my compass and took an azimuth and shouted \u201cFire Mission!\u201d\n\n&gt;At this point, two things happened. First, a stray 82mm round hit a mule (a motorized cart) parked in an empty space about 50 meters from us. The cart was loaded with crates of trip flares which lit up the night with a hellish blue blaze. The guy in the treeline figured he\u2019d gotten something big, and shifted fire.\n\n&gt;Here\u2019s the other thing. I have to pause here, because the memory of it still leaves me a little breathless. I shouted \u201cFire Mission!\u201d And nine out of ten of my platoon of mortarmen bounced out of their hidey-holes in the bunker complex, and headed for the tubes at a run. Two of those guys jumped in the ammo pit - where the first 82mm had landed - and started unpacking rounds. Both of our 81mm\u2019s were quickly manned by their crews, who began yelling at Bear for deflection and elevation. I had already given him an azimuth and range (estimated to just inside treeline). Together we walked rounds back into the treeline until we got a secondary. Then we counter-batteried the shit out of those guys.\n\n&gt;That moment. The moment those guys heard \u201cFire Mission!,\u201d and came hooting and hollering up out of the bunkers and dove into their gun positions... that was an award. Play \u201c[Garry Owen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaPk9yYWQcM).\u201d I\u2019m done. \n\n&gt;I\u2019ve often wondered at those pictures of Civil War battles that show some captain leading a line of men into a metal storm - how they got the courage to stand in front like that. I know now. It was because those men were following them. The Doc was right. Once they do that, they own you. It is an honor worth your life.\n\n&gt;Seems kind of an ancient, knightly thing to be typing about here in the light of day in the US of A in 2014 where we all know better about honor and courage, and how neither of those things survive the gritty, nasty wars we fight in modern times.
