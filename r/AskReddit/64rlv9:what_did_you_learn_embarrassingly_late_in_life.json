Sometimes we&amp;#39;d be driving on the highway and see someone pulled over. &amp;quot;Cops caught him farting,&amp;quot; my dad would say. Or we&amp;#39;d pass a speeding-trap and my mom would say, &amp;quot;Cops! Hold in your farts!&amp;quot; and we&amp;#39;d all squeeze our butts and squeak with relief when we passed by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was seven they told me Uncle Tim was arrested for gassing a crowded movie theater. At the time I did not know he was selling weed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember being kind of interested in the law, and hearing on the news that someone important had been accused of something(which had a long and complicated name) and my dad said it meant blatantly farting out loud in public. I think it was  perjury, but it might have been embezzling or something in Latin. And this was around when the Lewinski scandal happened, so for a while I thought the President of the United States was being impeached for loudly ripping ass in front of a Federal grand jury.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I spent the next several years believing I was a Batman villain every time I ate beans. I was in the double digits before I realized they were just fucking with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg4n6xi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491962501.0, "created_utc": 1491933701.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1991}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlv9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlv9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlv9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlv9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5fdtu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 72, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Epic2112", "parent_id": "t1_dg54yis", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A big oak with a flock of ostriches in it sure is a sight to see!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big oak with a flock of ostriches in it sure is a sight to see!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg5fdtu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491997572.0, "created_utc": 1491968772.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 72}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg54yis", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 315, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Scyrothe", "parent_id": "t1_dg53alc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm pretty sure they just hang out in trees", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure they just hang out in trees&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg54yis", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491983364.0, "created_utc": 1491954564.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 315}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg53alc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 238, "report_reasons": null, "author": "xvsOPxDwUw", "parent_id": "t1_dg4pjal", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So where do they live then?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where do they live then?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg53alc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491981103.0, "created_utc": 1491952303.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 238}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlv9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlv9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlv9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5fyo3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 138, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IAmKhrom", "parent_id": "t1_dg559gf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They're as free as birds. \n\nAnd those birds you cannot change.
