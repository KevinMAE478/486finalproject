She asked me if I had a girlfriend, which I confirmed.  \n\"So, is she the one?\"  \nI don't know, I said, how do you know that, right?  \nThen she said as smugly as the could, while leaning back in her chair, \"Oh, she's probably not then\".  \n\nNow, she probably didn't know that my parents had filled me in on her misadventures. A couple of years before, she had been dating a guy from the Middle East, who she met while he was here studying. They had continued it as a long-distance thing after he went back, and then they were getting married. She flew her family and friends to his country only to have the wedding cancelled the day before!

I believe most people were like \"Uh, no, we're not going on another trip.\" Her parents didn't want to pay for it either. That caused her to estrange everyone who didn't \"even\" want to come to her wedding!  \n\nSo, a cheap jab about the seriousness of my relationship just didn't faze me at all. And that's when I realised although she did invoke shame and guilt and feeling stupid through the years, she never did hurt my feelings. She didn't know how to, she just attacked things that *she* would care about and that would be hurtful if I was like her.  \n\nNow, I could of course have done done two things: I could have addressed her behaviour, either for some answers or to help her perhaps understand everyone else's perception of her and have chance at bettering herself. But I just got my answers, and it's not my job to help shitheads stop being shitheads. And least of all by going into a conversation that would probably become aggressive and last for hours.

With a professional of course who could tell me what I was looking at exactly.

And the way it resolved is not at all the normal presentation of childhood trans. His wanting-to-be-a-girl (or not-wanting-to-be-a-boy?) had been acutely distressing and traumatic for him, but the whole thing pretty much resolved as soon as we accepted it as the new normal and accommodated it.

He damn near got himself killed more than once. He could be loving and funny with me - we had a fucked-up wicked sense of humour together - but he could also turn deeply hostile, with incidents that were basically attempts at assault, and deliberate, malicious attacks on my property. His emotional intelligence was very low - empathy wasn't completely absent, but he was chronically oblivious to the reactions of others and any connection that might exist between how he acted and how others felt. He had a cold sort of logic that could be quite chilling at times - real sociopath-in-the-making stuff.\n\nOne after another, psychologists/psychiatrists/others went through assuming he was just this way because I was young and poor and didn't know how to handle him, then watched him and us and agreed there actually was a problem, then pronounced themselves mystified about what \"it\" was and what to do about it. His school paid for him to go to a psychologist of their choosing, too - same result. He was assessed at a specialist child psychiatric unit, who came up with a list of things it could have been but wasn't, but nothing that it was.\n\nIt became clear there was not going to be the kind of help that told us what the problem was and had a plan to fix it.

I would talk him through social situations, over and over again, with the help of patient young friends. (What does her face look like? What do you think that means about how she feels about what you're saying? Why do you think she felt that way?) I talked to him about mindfulness, about questioning the judgments his mind was leading him to and questioning them again. We did natural consequences for the anger outbursts and destroyed property and all that. I occasionally did pretty shitty things because I was getting desperate and didn't know what else to do for him. At the height of the destruction-and-zero-empathy stage, I cut up a loved toy in front of him and told him that what he was feeling, was what he was making me feel when he deliberately destroyed things of mine.

He switched to destroying his own property when he was angry, and then stopped destroying it all together. He learned to manage his anger, more or less (at least to within normal kid limits). He learned to filter his reactions through rationality. He learned to interpret and analyse. He became more aware of himself and others, and developed empathy.\n\nHe's still a bit of an odd duck. He's still insanely stubborn. He still needs to school his anger. But he's learned to self-regulate enough that he can be a decent person and have genuinely good relationships, and for a long time I wasn't sure either of those things would be possible for him. He's also very smart and self-aware and thoughtful. He reflects a lot on his life and what happens in it, in his own mind and to me. He's very charming and charismatic and very well-loved by the people around him, most of whom have no clue what he was like in that period of say 5-13 years.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nMy older brother very well falls into the \"terrible person\" category. We had a pretty big age gap, and I missed a lot of what transpired between my parents and my brother, but as I'm aging, I'm starting to understand a lot more. I'm getting pieces of the story from him and our mother, as our father passed away years ago now.\n\nI heard horror stories growing up about my brother, how he hit the cat, or lit the rug on fire, or wet the bed for years and they were always sorta used as a measure for me, as the younger sibling, to do better. I didn't really register that they were really awful things as a kid, other than \"things I shouldn't do\". \n\nHe had trouble in high school, and ended up only getting a GED. He spent years jumping from job to job as he most often would end up fired from one place or another for various reasons. When I went to community college, I tried to get him to go with me. He's plenty smart enough to go to school, just terrible at attending, he dropped out shortly after.\n\nI found out later, my father had botched paying the high school where my brother was attending. He had to scrounge and work after school to stay in school and graduate. This was right around the time of Columbine and my parents were paranoid something would happen to him at a public school. \n\nMy parents had been very hard on him as a kid, every time he had screwed up. Once I showed up (younger sibling) they essentially wanted him to start being independent and they hadn't set him up for it I don't think. My entire family, parents included, would clam up if you talked about emotions other than happiness. No one ever seemed able to talk about it, or it was \"impolite\" or it wasn't to be discussed with anyone else. We were expected to process emotions by ourselves behind closed doors. Unsurprisingly, this resulting in huge arguments between my parents and eventually divorce, but that's another story.\n\nI'm not saying my parents were terrible, I don't think they were. I turned out ok, I think. I just don't think they knew how to deal with my older brother and it ruined him in a way.

What are the chances of that?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a parent, a sibling. Throwaway for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My older brother very well falls into the &amp;quot;terrible person&amp;quot; category. We had a pretty big age gap, and I missed a lot of what transpired between my parents and my brother, but as I&amp;#39;m aging, I&amp;#39;m starting to understand a lot more. I&amp;#39;m getting pieces of the story from him and our mother, as our father passed away years ago now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard horror stories growing up about my brother, how he hit the cat, or lit the rug on fire, or wet the bed for years and they were always sorta used as a measure for me, as the younger sibling, to do better. I didn&amp;#39;t really register that they were really awful things as a kid, other than &amp;quot;things I shouldn&amp;#39;t do&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had trouble in high school, and ended up only getting a GED. He spent years jumping from job to job as he most often would end up fired from one place or another for various reasons. When I went to community college, I tried to get him to go with me. He&amp;#39;s plenty smart enough to go to school, just terrible at attending, he dropped out shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found out later, my father had botched paying the high school where my brother was attending. He had to scrounge and work after school to stay in school and graduate. This was right around the time of Columbine and my parents were paranoid something would happen to him at a public school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents had been very hard on him as a kid, every time he had screwed up. Once I showed up (younger sibling) they essentially wanted him to start being independent and they hadn&amp;#39;t set him up for it I don&amp;#39;t think. My entire family, parents included, would clam up if you talked about emotions other than happiness. No one ever seemed able to talk about it, or it was &amp;quot;impolite&amp;quot; or it wasn&amp;#39;t to be discussed with anyone else. We were expected to process emotions by ourselves behind closed doors. Unsurprisingly, this resulting in huge arguments between my parents and eventually divorce, but that&amp;#39;s another story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying my parents were terrible, I don&amp;#39;t think they were. I turned out ok, I think. I just don&amp;#39;t think they knew how to deal with my older brother and it ruined him in a way.

I bit myself, blamed my brother. I was manipulative, lied constantly, and by kindergarten, my only ambition was to marry rich. I screamed so loudly the neighbors thought I was being abused whenever I didn&amp;#39;t get my way. The one time my mom spanked me (and rightfully so) I threatened to call the police. I made her cry. More than once. My brother was afraid of me. My parents didn&amp;#39;t know what to do with me. They likely thought I was going to grow up and be a serial killer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I hit an all time low. Childhood onset major depressive episode coupled with crippling anxiety. A rescue dog who helped me out of it, along with an amazing therapist. And I turned a corner. By late middle school I was just a weird, awkward young teenager. I liked death note, hot topic, and being &amp;quot;random&amp;quot;. By high school I was ambitious, had amazing grades, and a solid group of friends. Still a little weird, but I grew out of it by the time I went to college.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In college I laid low. Dated, had friends, tried to get through it. Now I&amp;#39;m a successful young adult. I&amp;#39;m happy. I volunteer. I work hard and get along well with my parents. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents through they were raising a terrible person, I&amp;#39;m sure of it. But as an adult, I have to say, they did a damn good job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I imagine that actual terrible people come about one of two ways: the first is the opposite of myself- they are perfectly fine children, who somehow just turn out bad.
