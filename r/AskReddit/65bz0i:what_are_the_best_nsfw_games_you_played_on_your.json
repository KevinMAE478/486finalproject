Every slave has pretty much a full page of attributes including appearances of individual body parts, various sexual skills, their clothing, their fetishes, and whatever behavior rules you have given them, and pretty much everything is customizable. Several art options have recently been added (if you need something visual, I recommend the vector art over the 3d renders), and the developer is really good about posting regular updates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep coming back to this game not just to get off, but also just because its fun and engaging to play, I found it has the same sort of &amp;quot;just one more turn&amp;quot; pull that AAA games like civilization have.
