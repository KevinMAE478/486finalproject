There is a bulge in Yellowstone that started this whole thing, but considering Yellowstone sits on top multiple calderas, nobody knows if that bulge is new or is just part of the landscape.

Yellowstone is constantly venting the water and steam that help pressurize magma chambers (like with geysers), so that means that there probably won't be a huge eruption. Yellowstone is not even a volcano, technically, it's a caldera, which aren't exactly known for their violent eruptions. Another thing that people who believe in the Yellowstone catastrophe point to is the earthquake swarms that have happened. Well, that doesn't really mean an eruption is happening.

A psychologists called Sperry investigated the extent to which hemispheric lateralisation occurs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hemispheric lateralisation is contralateral i.e. the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body. Anyway, Sperry used split-brain patients to investigate this. Turns out, the left hemisphere is responsible for verbal speech (IIRC the Broca&amp;#39;s area is located there) therefore if a split brain patient was to cover their right eye (which is controlled by the left hemisphere) and was told to name an object that was presented to them, they would understand what the object was but not be able to verbally name it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The separation of both hemispheres doesn&amp;#39;t mean that one of them has their own consciousness. They&amp;#39;ll be able to function fine in terms of speech, provided that both sides of the body work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve learned from biopsychology classes. But I do remember a case when it didn&amp;#39;t turn out fine for a split-brain patient. IIRC, one side of the body dominated the other because of conflicts between both hemispheres. It&amp;#39;s called &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_hand_syndrome\"&gt;Alien Hand Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alien hand syndrome (AHS) is a condition in which a person experiences their limbs acting seemingly on their own, without control over the actions. The term is used for a variety of clinical conditions and most commonly affects the left hand&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Typos.
