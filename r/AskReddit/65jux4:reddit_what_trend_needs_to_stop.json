As of now, there are literally fights going on less than a mile away from my dorm because people seem to believe that the most important thing about other people is who they voted for, and anybody who voted differently needs to be destroyed so that they can \"win.\"\n\nPolitics was never supposed to be about winning, or beating the other team. Politics is supposed to be about discovering the truth through intelligent and rational discourse. People's opinions are supposed to be respected, discussed and challenged, not silenced or shouted down. \n\nOpinions need to be kept separate from personality. When people begin to see their political views as part of who they are, they will cling to them no matter if they are valid or not. This creates the \"us-versus-them\" mentality that has been growing in the last few years, where people see a challenge to their beliefs as an assault on who they are. Opinions were always meant to be flexible and dynamic, changing as the person's understanding of the world changes. When opinions become set in stone and overvalued, polarization happens.\n\nUnfortunately, I think the way our political culture is heading is that more and more of this will occur. I sure hope I'm wrong.\n\nSorry for the rant. I'm just sick of the violence and hatred.\n\nEdit: Because this is getting some good attention, I would just like to add something. The violence is almost never caused by students at UC Berkeley. The vast majority of us just want to go to class, study hard, and live our lives peacefully. Some of us are very political, but it is done in a rational and decent manner. Most of the violence is caused by outside groups that come in and use Berkeley's long political history as a backdrop to cause trouble. \n\nAlso, looking back, I think that saying \"opinions need to be kept separate from personality\" was a poor choice of words. I'm all for people being passionate about issues that matter to them. I just can't understand why it always escalates into violence rather than debate. Even if the belief is truly vile and offensive, people should use discourse to expose it for what it is rather than just silencing it. ", "edited": 1492312181.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for posting this!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I live in Berkeley, California, which is one of the most &amp;quot;politically active&amp;quot; cities in America. As of now, there are literally fights going on less than a mile away from my dorm because people seem to believe that the most important thing about other people is who they voted for, and anybody who voted differently needs to be destroyed so that they can &amp;quot;win.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Politics was never supposed to be about winning, or beating the other team. Politics is supposed to be about discovering the truth through intelligent and rational discourse. People&amp;#39;s opinions are supposed to be respected, discussed and challenged, not silenced or shouted down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Opinions need to be kept separate from personality. When people begin to see their political views as part of who they are, they will cling to them no matter if they are valid or not. This creates the &amp;quot;us-versus-them&amp;quot; mentality that has been growing in the last few years, where people see a challenge to their beliefs as an assault on who they are. Opinions were always meant to be flexible and dynamic, changing as the person&amp;#39;s understanding of the world changes. When opinions become set in stone and overvalued, polarization happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I think the way our political culture is heading is that more and more of this will occur. I sure hope I&amp;#39;m wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the rant. I&amp;#39;m just sick of the violence and hatred.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Because this is getting some good attention, I would just like to add something. The violence is almost never caused by students at UC Berkeley. The vast majority of us just want to go to class, study hard, and live our lives peacefully. Some of us are very political, but it is done in a rational and decent manner. Most of the violence is caused by outside groups that come in and use Berkeley&amp;#39;s long political history as a backdrop to cause trouble. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, looking back, I think that saying &amp;quot;opinions need to be kept separate from personality&amp;quot; was a poor choice of words. I&amp;#39;m all for people being passionate about issues that matter to them. I just can&amp;#39;t understand why it always escalates into violence rather than debate. Even if the belief is truly vile and offensive, people should use discourse to expose it for what it is rather than just silencing it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgbbamo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492326204.0, "created_utc": 1492297404.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 611}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb3sh3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1930, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jameskippy", "parent_id": "t3_65jux4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Treating politics like a team sport", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating politics like a team sport&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgb3sh3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492315695.0, "created_utc": 1492286895.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1930}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jux4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jux4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbg0vq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 233, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MeepBorp", "parent_id": "t1_dgb7fb9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Unless it's Darude Sandstorm.", "edited": 1492312076.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless it&amp;#39;s Darude Sandstorm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgbg0vq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492332918.0, "created_utc": 1492304118.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 233}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb7fb9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 839, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wakejedi", "parent_id": "t3_65jux4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Playing music through your phone in public.
