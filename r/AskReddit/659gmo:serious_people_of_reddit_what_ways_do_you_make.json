When I first started my business, I spent so much time doing tasks that prevented me from actually building my business!  I have found ways to make passive income, but they are pretty specific to my field.  Here are some things I have done that can be applied elsewhere though, which can lead to passive income:\n\n* Install [Boomerang for Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boomerang-for-gmail/mdanidgdpmkimeiiojknlnekblgmpdll?hl=en).  You can set up emails to send for another time.  You can set recurring emails.  So, I don't have to spend time copy/pasting my weekly \"submit invoice/reports\" email.  I can set that to send every week.  If one of my contractors didn't send me a report, Boomerang would re-send reminder emails and also alert me that I haven't had a reply to this email yet.\n\n* Install Hootsuite or Buffer.  If you need to use social media for your job or business, you can spend a couple of hours setting up all your posts for weeks in advance.  Instead of going on all the time to post, you can post while you sleep.  Word of caution: keep an eye on the dashboard.  You might end up posting something very embarrassing depending on time.  One example I can think of is a politician who automated Bible verses to post.  After the Orlando night club shooting, he posted a verse that appeared anti-gay.  Oops.\n\n* Find a remote assistant that doesn't suck.  A large part of my job involves data entry.  I started using a remote assistant to do this for me, so I could focus on scaling and on training my people.  I found a really great assistant in the Phillipines.  Once I realized how good she is, I paid her twice her asking price.  She is making a monthly salary in her country for a few days a month of work.  She can schedule and do small tasks for me while I sleep.  When I wake up and log on, I have hours of work finished.\n\n* Start scheduling everything.  I used to tell people to \"feel free to call me any time tomorrow to talk about XYZ project.\" No way.  I use Boomerang Calendar.  I send someone a few time slots, and I put them in.  This lets them know that I respect their time, and they should respect mine.  Meetings are also now much more productive, because I am prepared.\n\n* Use Amazon Fresh.  For $15 dollars a month you get groceries right to your door, and the prices are pretty decent.  You can set up groceries for the next day... from ice cold things like ice cream to prepared hot foods.  I calculated my costs in time and in transportation to the store... I have saved money and time by shopping online for groceries.\n\n* Buy discounted gift cards for places you frequent.  There are a number of sites that offer e-gift cards for a cheaper price.  I buy gift cards for a chain of stores my team does a lot of work in, and save $2 on each card.  I send out a few hundred cards a month, so I save about 5% each month on operation costs.\n\n* Use ebates for online shopping to get cash back (combine this with the discount sites, usually).  Use ibotta app when doing physical shopping to get money back for things you are already buying.\n\n* Use a lockscreen on your phone that generates revenue.  The one I used to use isn't in operation anymore, but I paid for Amazon Fresh a few times with it.  They had surveys you could do for extra \"points\" that equals out to Amazon credit.  Before I started my own business I would do them in the bathroom while at work.  Might as well make money while you are in there, right?  I am now using one called \"Slidejoy\".  I am not sure how it is yet, since I just installed it a couple days ago.\n\n* Install the \"Job Spotter\" app for Indeed.  Whenever you see a help wanted sign, take a picture.  You can cash out for Amazon credit.  They used to offer a lot more points for every sign, but you can still get a good amount of credit on it.\n\n\nThese may not be the answers you were thinking, but the more time and money you can save... that adds up.
