This means there's no actual \"do this thing, and get a reward\" promise.\n\n2.  Even if it had met the strict, explicit \"perform X, automatically get Y\" requirements to be a unilateral contract, the offer was an obvious joke to any reasonable person and thus would not give rise to a contract.   \n(Side note:  The court's take-down of why the commercial is a joke is one of the best bits of dry humor you'll get in law school, and I'll reply to my own post to try to keep this post a manageable size.)\n\n3.
