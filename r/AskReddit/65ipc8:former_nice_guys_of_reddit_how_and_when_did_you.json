But I would get pissed off about girls I had crushes on dating D-bags and losers or how I &amp;quot;couldn&amp;#39;t get a girlfriend&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then as I got older, I realized it&amp;#39;s cause I&amp;#39;m shy and timid in literally every social situation. I had crappy hygiene, bad haircut, negative outlook on life, wasn&amp;#39;t a total loser, but nothing special either.. I was also too scared to make moves or actually ask a girl out to begin with.. Usually just hoping a girl expresses interest in me first so I don&amp;#39;t have to break the ice (which worked sometimes, but things usually fell apart quickly due to my low self-esteem). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also realized, most importantly.. That girl&amp;#39;s just want to have fun. Girls want to fuck too and it&amp;#39;s dumb to shame them and call them &amp;quot;slut&amp;quot; over it. Instead, be the guy she acts a slut with and have fun being a slut yourself. There&amp;#39;s no shame in asking a girl out or to hangout or something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like when you&amp;#39;re young, you&amp;#39;re just preoccupied with a ton of other angst and bullshit that revolves around growing up and getting used to the world, but as I got older dating, sex, and relationships comes a lot more naturally because you&amp;#39;re just more mindful about the world, and how your wants and needs aren&amp;#39;t the only thing in existence. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgaum8c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492303233.0, "created_utc": 1492274433.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 84}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ipc8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgarsnh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 56, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dubby324", "parent_id": "t3_65ipc8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Being rejected or unattractive makes you look for excuses.

Over the length of college I figured out by accident that I could be the &amp;quot;funny one&amp;quot; in my friend group instead of &amp;quot;the &amp;#39;smart&amp;#39; but actually pompous one nobody likes,&amp;quot; and I gradually modified my presentation.  It was still years before I worked up the nerve to start dating, and I had to learn by rote a lot of social skills I still lacked, and I also lost some weight (still fat, just less), but when I saw guys as people with thoughts and feelings I got a lot better at interacting with them.  It turns out if you&amp;#39;re chunky but easy to talk to, a lot of people will still be interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgbkutw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492339967.0, "created_utc": 1492311167.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ipc8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ipc8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaots8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 36, "report_reasons": null, "author": "deisidiamonia", "parent_id": "t1_dgaky0y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Women like that though", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women like that though&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgaots8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492294823.0, "created_utc": 1492266023.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaky0y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 48, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aclickbaittitle", "parent_id": "t3_65ipc8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "When I finished last ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I finished last &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgaky0y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492287173.0, "created_utc": 1492258373.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 48}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ipc8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgawrnk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "xxhhgg", "parent_id": "t3_65ipc8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nice guys don't finish last, boring guys do!\nStop being boring and be more than just a nice guy, have some hobbies, read and form informed opinions, be good with at least some form of dance, music, sport, cooking.\nExpand your social circle and meet more people.\nI followed this with success and I am still a nice guy and I don't see any reason to change that.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice guys don&amp;#39;t finish last, boring guys do!\nStop being boring and be more than just a nice guy, have some hobbies, read and form informed opinions, be good with at least some form of dance, music, sport, cooking.\nExpand your social circle and meet more people.\nI followed this with success and I am still a nice guy and I don&amp;#39;t see any reason to change that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgawrnk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492306184.0, "created_utc": 1492277384.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ipc8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb0h4l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shinykittie", "parent_id": "t3_65ipc8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I had a crush on some girl and I was thinking \"what can I do to make her like me?\" And so I thought if there was some girl I didn't like, was there anything they could do to make me like them?
