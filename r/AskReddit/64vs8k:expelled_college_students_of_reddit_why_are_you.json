He got, but the school decided that chaperoning the guy was NOT their responsibility, and the guy ended up stealing half my shit, to which the school was like &amp;quot;Did you have insurance? No? HAHA! Not our problem. Please get out of my office.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that everything tanked. The stress piled on, and the plurality of shittiness that exuded from the school got to me and I failed out. As I said, I was able to appeal, get back in and later graduate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bonus AIPh Drama: A few semesters after all this shit happened the school paired me up with two roommates whose previous roommate pulled a gun on them and threatened to kill them. School moved the two guys into my room, and the guy who threatened to kill them broke into our building and got into my apartment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This school was an absolute nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg5jp70", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492005538.0, "created_utc": 1491976738.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1711}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vs8k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vs8k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5pt0e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 203, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bplboston17", "parent_id": "t1_dg5jb61", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Holy fuck, all because you turned down some perv professor for drinks, you wanted to talk about a paper for God's sake, he should not be a teacher.. thus is just another reason why college is fucked, pay all this money and some creeper professor decides to fuck over your life.. and all colleges judicial systems are fucked as all hell.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holy fuck, all because you turned down some perv professor for drinks, you wanted to talk about a paper for God&amp;#39;s sake, he should not be a teacher.. thus is just another reason why college is fucked, pay all this money and some creeper professor decides to fuck over your life.. and all colleges judicial systems are fucked as all hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg5pt0e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492023062.0, "created_utc": 1491994262.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 203}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5jb61", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 429, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RobbyRock75", "parent_id": "t3_64vs8k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I got thrown out after I graduated from a Master's degree program.

I've dealt with social anxiety since childhood and it came to a head in my 3rd year when I was having panic attacks frequently. I got help but by then it was too late for my grades because I had been barely passing classes by the skin of my teeth.\n\nI was a 4th year comp sci major who didn't know how to program. At all. I tried to get back on the horse after going through therapy for my anxiety, but I felt so defeated that my grades slipped further into the hole I had dug for myself. \n\nI think the quarter I got kicked out I had 2 Fs, 2 Ds and a C. The dean sent me a letter saying I was done with engineering.\n\nI took time to get my act together, got a part time job, lived in a shithole apartment with 7 people living in a space meant for 4 people at the absolute max. I worked minimum wage and realized I needed to finish school. \n\nI saw my undergrad counselor numerous times, who very graciously helped me. I needed to write out a contract addressed to the dean with my detailed plan on how I was going to prove I was worthy of being readmitted, and the classes I would take to qualify for graduation.\n\nIt took a while but I eventually managed to get readmitted by working my ass off, taking summer school courses which counted toward my major and getting a 3.0 average, then following up by getting good grades once they let me back in.\n\nIt was tough because I needed therapy for so many years but I didn't want to accept it until my breakdown in my 3rd year. I wish I had gotten help sooner but I truly thought I could handle it all on my own and I felt ashamed that I wasn't able to.\n\nBut I'll say this, I don't regret for a second that I ended up getting help.

I&amp;#39;ve dealt with social anxiety since childhood and it came to a head in my 3rd year when I was having panic attacks frequently. I got help but by then it was too late for my grades because I had been barely passing classes by the skin of my teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a 4th year comp sci major who didn&amp;#39;t know how to program. At all. I tried to get back on the horse after going through therapy for my anxiety, but I felt so defeated that my grades slipped further into the hole I had dug for myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the quarter I got kicked out I had 2 Fs, 2 Ds and a C. The dean sent me a letter saying I was done with engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took time to get my act together, got a part time job, lived in a shithole apartment with 7 people living in a space meant for 4 people at the absolute max. I worked minimum wage and realized I needed to finish school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw my undergrad counselor numerous times, who very graciously helped me. I needed to write out a contract addressed to the dean with my detailed plan on how I was going to prove I was worthy of being readmitted, and the classes I would take to qualify for graduation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took a while but I eventually managed to get readmitted by working my ass off, taking summer school courses which counted toward my major and getting a 3.0 average, then following up by getting good grades once they let me back in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was tough because I needed therapy for so many years but I didn&amp;#39;t want to accept it until my breakdown in my 3rd year. I wish I had gotten help sooner but I truly thought I could handle it all on my own and I felt ashamed that I wasn&amp;#39;t able to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ll say this, I don&amp;#39;t regret for a second that I ended up getting help. I was a little embarrassed about it first but I soon got over that.

I had other classes to worry about finishing as well, so admittedly I didn't prioritize the paper as much as I should have. Three weeks before it was due, the professor required us to submit a rough draft so he could critique and help us. My topic was so niche that I was only able to find one text on it, but it was a really good source with a very long mathematical proof, like 3 pages worth, so obviously I was going to cite this proof as the fulcrum for my paper --- there was no way I could do this sort of math on my own. I could only find a physical copy of this source from the library, there was no digital copy, so in order to use and cite it in my paper I would have to transcribe 3 pages of mathematical proof by typing it in. That sounds easy enough, but the thing with mathematical papers is they use a *lot* of symbols, it's how the math is demonstrated. I used a language called LaTeX, which allows you to input things and make everything look nice, but it's time consuming (here's a sample cheat sheet of the codes used to generate the symbols: https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/latexsheet-0.png). This took me nearly 4 hours, but I finally had a digital copy of my proof. I didn't have time to write anything more than an abstract for my rough draft, and I cited my source in the works cited section, so I turned in this to my professor as if to say, \"I don't have much, but this proof was hard to acquire and I will be basing my paper around it\".  \n\n He calls me in the next day to inform me he has reported me to the academic affairs council for plagiarism. I am dumbfounded. I explained my reasoning for what I turned in and how I had no intention of plagiarizing work that I clearly cited, *on a rough draft no less*, to which his response was, \"That is for the council to decide\".  \n\nI appear before the Council, try to explain everything in laymen's terms, how I had no idea it's even possible to be found guilty of plagiarism for an incomplete work, how I would never try to steal intellectual work two weeks before I'm supposed to graduate, how if I had known this was possible I would I have turned in nothing, but they are having none of it. I will never forget how they asked me why I, \"didn't just photocopy the textbook and submit that\".  \n\nGiven that I had a derogatory mark on my record from my sophomore year when I (stupidly) cheated of my friend's test, they found grounds to *immediately* remove me from campus. As in, they told me I had 6 hours to pack my things and leave or they would call the police and I would be found guilty of trespassing. I cried as I had to quickly pack my things and move back in with my parents who were beside themselves. I later saw a rumor on the campus YikYak that I had been expelled for rape, which really drove the dagger into my heart. My girlfriend left me later that week and the silence I received from friends was deafening. I had been deeply involved in the campus community, at one point serving as the Vice President of the Student Body, serving on the committee that selected the new University President, and many other groups on campus. I was to be one of the three students who spoke at the graduation ceremony, and I was to carry our class banner as we entered the ceremony.  \n\nThankfully my story has a happy ending (so far). By the time my classmates were crossing the stage, I had already found a job and was gainfully employed. Where I had been myopic about my future after college, I now suddenly had a fire to regain what was taken from me. I'm on track to finish my bachelor's this year while also working at a Fortune 500. I've never shared this story with anyone who doesn't know me closely, and I'm hesitant to speak to a professional counselor about my struggles with this and an abusive ex-girlfriend, and perhaps that's something I should do. I hope someday I'm able to prove that you can lose everything and still persevere and rebuild. Every year on April 25th, the day they expelled me, I take myself out to a nice restaurant and promise not to let something like that happen again. \n\n**Edit**: The amount of support has floored me.

It was black and purple and my gf at the time was way into bondage and I was too lazy to put it away (note: I was just storing it on the pipe not hanging someone from it)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The security officers claimed it looked like a noose, despite no knots.\nThe electronics kit. They said looked like bomb parts, to which I gave them the exact name of the professor who was helping me with my project. They also took several of my tools from my toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was immediately marched to the security office and at 2am had to wait for my parents to pick me up. Talk about the worst car ride ever back home. I had no idea what had happened and I wanted to just throw myself out of the car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A day later we went back to talk to the administration. It was recognized that I was thrown under the bus, but that was the extent of any sympathy given. I was faced with a full semester suspension or leave and have any judicial records sealed. I chose the latter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That day, in front of half the dorm, my parents and I packed up the car and left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was able to apply and get into a different school for the spring semester. Though without the $35k scholarship I had previously received. But now I&amp;#39;m an employed Civil Engineer and life&amp;#39;s been going pretty well :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg5q7y5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492024166.0, "created_utc": 1491995366.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 140}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vs8k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vs8k", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5h8yl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 737, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BombsHockeynStuff", "parent_id": "t1_dg5fo5i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oddly I graduated because I read the syllabus for each class and showed up for the tests.

This only angers and confuses her bunkmate.\n\nIntruder sits up quickly and slams his head on bed above him, rolls over, and promptly shits himself.

This is the dorm room they would have designed.  It was not his room.\n\nThey argue with him for a few seconds more and he ignores them and goes to the bathroom where they both hear him puke all over the sink, toilet, and shower curtain.  Drunk wonder boy then comes back out to the room, peels off his pants but not his underwear(?!), and lays down on the futon with his ass facing up so (blessedly) no poop stains on their bright pink futon.
