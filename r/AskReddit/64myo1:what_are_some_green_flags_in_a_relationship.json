I did it. I called her this morning and apologized for all the stupid mistakes I&amp;#39;ve made. Thanks to &lt;a href=\"/u/Calabast\"&gt;u/Calabast&lt;/a&gt; and everyone for giving me the courage. I was extremely sorry, and we both started crying a bit. Turns out, though.... she is in and has been in a long term relationship for about a year now. She doesn&amp;#39;t use Facebook so I had no idea. I&amp;#39;m not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; upset, I&amp;#39;m genuinely happy for her. I could tell by the way she talked about him that she loves him a bunch. She sent me some pictures of them rock climbing and camping out and she looked like she was having a great time. I can&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m not disappointed, but at least now I won&amp;#39;t be wondering &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot;, at least for a while, that is. Maybe one day we&amp;#39;ll get back together; we&amp;#39;re gonna meet up for coffee when she&amp;#39;s back in town in the summer. So, thanks reddit. I&amp;#39;m sorry we couldn&amp;#39;t get this to work out, but I&amp;#39;m incredibly grateful for your support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg3q7ta", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491907133.0, "created_utc": 1491878333.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 611}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64myo1", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3o4qz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 325, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pinkpeony", "parent_id": "t3_64myo1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Open book.
