I was lamenting the fact that we had fostered a Siamese cat from an adoption group, that eventually got adopted, and I really missed her. At one point, we were looking through the website of the local pound, and a Siamese came up named \"Montague.\"\n\nThe photo that they took of Montague was epic. A classic Applehead Siamese, he was neutered, about five years old, and had horribly crossed eyes. Whoever took the photograph of him made him look both proud, distinguished, and adorably insane. Like some crazy dude that comes into the bar as a regular, claims he's the emperor of the United States of America, and everybody buys him a round because even though he is clearly crazy, he is also very charming.

A classic Applehead Siamese, he was neutered, about five years old, and had horribly crossed eyes. Whoever took the photograph of him made him look both proud, distinguished, and adorably insane.

When we were first married, we lived in an apartment in a converted garage attached to her parents house. Her crackhead brother came in one night while we were asleep and stole money from my wife's purse. Myself, his father, his mother, and my wife confronted him in his bedroom. He was in bed under he covers fully clothed but claimed he didn't do it. We SAW him run out of our apartment. We had a fistfight and he ended up running out of the back door. I chased him, in my underwear, in January, in the freezing rain, barefoot, for almost a mile before my body gave out. You can't catch a crackhead. I returned to the house and told my wife to pack our shit because we were moving out. The next day, we moved into a simglewide trailer we rented from my grandparents. It was a shithole that I wouldn't have lived in if I had other options. It was cheap, and crackhead free. A few months later, he got arrested for stealing checks from his boss. He stole $19,000 and when he was busted they found pills and coke in his car. He ended up with 109 felony charges and has been in prison ever since. My wife's mother was his enabler. She always defended him whenever he did shit. Fast forward 5 years. My father in law contracted a serious infection from an airborne fungus. It infected his lungs, then his bloodstream, then his spinal column. His brain swelled and he almost died before they figured out what was wrong with him. He had no health insurance because they couldn't afford any. He lost his job. They lost their house and every dime they had. Her mom always sent her brother money in jail. So did we. So did his aunt and grandmother. He milked everyone he knew for money. I assume he's still on drugs in prison, or he's paying a protection fee to keep his asshole a virgin. I was at her parents house when his mother broke the news that she couldn't send him money anymore because they didn't have any. I could hear him yelling at her through the phone. This pissed me off beyond all measure. He didn't care that his father was almost dead. He only cared about his money. I drove 2 hours to the prison on his next visitation day. I cursed him out and the guards made me leave. I'm not allowed back in, ever. That little payment we were sending him, I put a stop to. I told my wife he gets three meals and a cot to sleep on. He doesn't need money. She agreed we wouldn't send him any money. Fast forward 1.5 years and i get the mail out of our box. There's a credit card bill in there that says open immediately. My wife was late on the payment. I breeze though and see the amount owed is around $2200. The bill shows she made two payments to the prisoners payment service. When she gets home, I confront her. She spills her guts and says she's been sending her brother money because he called her bagging and crying and all this bullshit. She used her credit card because she knew I'd be mad if I found out. We both have good jobs. She's a nurse, I work for the local government. We aren't hurting for money. TBH I don't care if she sends him money, it's the hiding it from me that really pissed me off. We had money in the bank she could have sent me, and she's running a credit card bill up and paying interest on the shit like a fucking retard. She called in and made the $2200 payoff and cancelled the card. I thought that was the end of it. Fast forward almost 2 years, and I find the invoice in her car. It's a JC Penny card. She's been doing the same shit, and judging by the $1800 probably never stopped. I knew she had the card, but for some reason I wasn't thinking you could use it as a credit card, only in store purchases. I haven't confronted her about it yet. I've been putting it off. TBH I'm not even looking forward to it. I'm going to make her agree to work extra hours to pay off the $1800 so it doesn't affect our money in our bank account. I'm also going to demand she cancel every credit account she has and offer her a chance to come clean if there are more cards I don't know about.  It's not the money. We are doing spectacularly well for people our age. We started with nothing. We both come from families that weren't exactly poor, but weren't anywhere close to rich. Nobody helped us get where we are. We both worked two jobs to put her through nursing school. We ate ramen noodles. We lived in a shithole trailer. We now own our own home, we have bought land to either build a nicer home on or sell as an investment. We have plenty of money in the bank and we live well within our means. Divorce isn't an option for me. I love her and I made a commitment for life, and intend to keep it. But this can't keep happening. I understand why she does it. It's her brother and she loves him. I don't blame her. If it were my brother I'd probably do the same. They were close growing up. They were born only a year apart. He had delayed speech problems and speech issues his entire life. Even though she was younger, she always took up for him. When people made fun of him in school, she made it her fight. They have a strong bond. I can't change that. I also can't change the fact that he is a toxic person that takes advantage of everyone who loves him. Ideally, I'd like her to come to realize he just uses her and if he cared he wouldn't ask her for money. Me preaching at her won't do much. She has to come to that realization herself. He gets out in a year. Right now, my plan is to attempt to restrain myself from beating his sorry ass to death. I predict he learned nothing in prison except how to be an even shittier person. I'm going to sit back and see what happens. Maybe he will come out and be a productive member of society. Time will tell. If he goes right back to doing drugs, I'll be there to point out to my wife that he will never change and she needs to distance herself. If that doesn't work, there's always the option to kidnap him, put him in a crate with some MREs and a few bottles of water, and ship him to Mexico. \n\n\n\nEdit II- I know I already typed a book the size of a bible here, so I'll get straight to the point.

It was a shithole that I wouldn&amp;#39;t have lived in if I had other options. It was cheap, and crackhead free. A few months later, he got arrested for stealing checks from his boss. He stole $19,000 and when he was busted they found pills and coke in his car. He ended up with 109 felony charges and has been in prison ever since. My wife&amp;#39;s mother was his enabler. She always defended him whenever he did shit. Fast forward 5 years. My father in law contracted a serious infection from an airborne fungus. It infected his lungs, then his bloodstream, then his spinal column. His brain swelled and he almost died before they figured out what was wrong with him. He had no health insurance because they couldn&amp;#39;t afford any. He lost his job. They lost their house and every dime they had. Her mom always sent her brother money in jail. So did we. So did his aunt and grandmother. He milked everyone he knew for money. I assume he&amp;#39;s still on drugs in prison, or he&amp;#39;s paying a protection fee to keep his asshole a virgin. I was at her parents house when his mother broke the news that she couldn&amp;#39;t send him money anymore because they didn&amp;#39;t have any. I could hear him yelling at her through the phone. This pissed me off beyond all measure. He didn&amp;#39;t care that his father was almost dead. He only cared about his money. I drove 2 hours to the prison on his next visitation day. I cursed him out and the guards made me leave. I&amp;#39;m not allowed back in, ever. That little payment we were sending him, I put a stop to. I told my wife he gets three meals and a cot to sleep on. He doesn&amp;#39;t need money. She agreed we wouldn&amp;#39;t send him any money. Fast forward 1.5 years and i get the mail out of our box. There&amp;#39;s a credit card bill in there that says open immediately. My wife was late on the payment. I breeze though and see the amount owed is around $2200. The bill shows she made two payments to the prisoners payment service. When she gets home, I confront her. She spills her guts and says she&amp;#39;s been sending her brother money because he called her bagging and crying and all this bullshit. She used her credit card because she knew I&amp;#39;d be mad if I found out. We both have good jobs. She&amp;#39;s a nurse, I work for the local government. We aren&amp;#39;t hurting for money. TBH I don&amp;#39;t care if she sends him money, it&amp;#39;s the hiding it from me that really pissed me off. We had money in the bank she could have sent me, and she&amp;#39;s running a credit card bill up and paying interest on the shit like a fucking retard. She called in and made the $2200 payoff and cancelled the card. I thought that was the end of it. Fast forward almost 2 years, and I find the invoice in her car. It&amp;#39;s a JC Penny card. She&amp;#39;s been doing the same shit, and judging by the $1800 probably never stopped. I knew she had the card, but for some reason I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking you could use it as a credit card, only in store purchases. I haven&amp;#39;t confronted her about it yet. I&amp;#39;ve been putting it off. TBH I&amp;#39;m not even looking forward to it. I&amp;#39;m going to make her agree to work extra hours to pay off the $1800 so it doesn&amp;#39;t affect our money in our bank account. I&amp;#39;m also going to demand she cancel every credit account she has and offer her a chance to come clean if there are more cards I don&amp;#39;t know about.  It&amp;#39;s not the money. We are doing spectacularly well for people our age. We started with nothing. We both come from families that weren&amp;#39;t exactly poor, but weren&amp;#39;t anywhere close to rich. Nobody helped us get where we are. We both worked two jobs to put her through nursing school. We ate ramen noodles. We lived in a shithole trailer. We now own our own home, we have bought land to either build a nicer home on or sell as an investment. We have plenty of money in the bank and we live well within our means. Divorce isn&amp;#39;t an option for me. I love her and I made a commitment for life, and intend to keep it. But this can&amp;#39;t keep happening. I understand why she does it. It&amp;#39;s her brother and she loves him. I don&amp;#39;t blame her. If it were my brother I&amp;#39;d probably do the same. They were close growing up. They were born only a year apart. He had delayed speech problems and speech issues his entire life. Even though she was younger, she always took up for him. When people made fun of him in school, she made it her fight. They have a strong bond. I can&amp;#39;t change that. I also can&amp;#39;t change the fact that he is a toxic person that takes advantage of everyone who loves him. Ideally, I&amp;#39;d like her to come to realize he just uses her and if he cared he wouldn&amp;#39;t ask her for money. Me preaching at her won&amp;#39;t do much. She has to come to that realization herself. He gets out in a year. Right now, my plan is to attempt to restrain myself from beating his sorry ass to death. I predict he learned nothing in prison except how to be an even shittier person. I&amp;#39;m going to sit back and see what happens. Maybe he will come out and be a productive member of society. Time will tell. If he goes right back to doing drugs, I&amp;#39;ll be there to point out to my wife that he will never change and she needs to distance herself. If that doesn&amp;#39;t work, there&amp;#39;s always the option to kidnap him, put him in a crate with some MREs and a few bottles of water, and ship him to Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit II- I know I already typed a book the size of a bible here, so I&amp;#39;ll get straight to the point.
