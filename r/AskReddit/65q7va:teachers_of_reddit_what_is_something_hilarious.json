The mother, of course, didn&amp;#39;t know this was happening, so that was an awkward conversation to have with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgcso5i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492416245.0, "created_utc": 1492387445.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 302}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q7va", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q7va", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcpa88", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 256, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RaggySparra", "parent_id": "t1_dgcikbq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But you've got to give him points for mastering the sharing part.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;ve got to give him points for mastering the sharing part.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgcpa88", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492411625.0, "created_utc": 1492382825.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 256}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q7va", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcl5k4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 161, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lespudz", "parent_id": "t1_dgcikbq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Was his uncle Jerry Garcia?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was his uncle Jerry Garcia?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgcl5k4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492406116.0, "created_utc": 1492377316.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 161}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcikbq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 624, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tomfc", "parent_id": "t3_65q7va", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was babysitting a kid while his mom and dad worked one summer.
