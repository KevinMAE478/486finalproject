He used &amp;quot;animal&amp;quot; as an example base class and explained that &amp;quot;mammal&amp;quot; class could inherit from &amp;quot;animal&amp;quot; class. He then continued further that a &amp;quot;penguin&amp;quot; class could then inherit from &amp;quot;mammal&amp;quot; and thus also from &amp;quot;animal&amp;quot;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, programmers may be regarded as smart people, but don&amp;#39;t assume they know anything about animal biology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg9ab6m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492213015.0, "created_utc": 1492184215.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 69}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg973eb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 195, "report_reasons": null, "author": "froggyjamboree", "parent_id": "t3_65co3o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was talking about birds to a high-paid Deloitte consultant.
