After being married for 5 years, and shortly after finding out we were pregnant a third time, we separated - still, my daughter was my daughter - and this is how it was through our separation - we came back together to try it again after a year.  I had always loved tech, but was not in the industry.  When a big 4 tech company reached out about moving across the country to work with them I was ecstatic.  We packed the whole family up and moved West to Seattle - I took a big raise.  The kids loved their new home.  I stayed at that tech company for 5 years until I was recruited away as employee 5 of a young start-up.  We just took a monumental round of funding and have 5x'd this past year, so things seem to be going great! I'm in the 96th percentile of yearly income in the US.\n\nWe lasted about 3 years in Seattle until we separated again, and are now in a pretty messy divorce in which shes fighting to move across the country with the kids. Being a dad is my favorite thing in life, and I think where we live is amazing for them so I'm fighting for us to stay in the best city in the US.  Through this my soon to be ex has agreed that, no matter what, I am our daughters father. \n\nI shared a lot here about my life - and I know I sound a bit pompus - but I aimed to express a few things:\n\n- you can have a child as a teen, and definitely go on to live a super productive life.   \n\n- education is key.  It will be sooooo difficult, but sacrifice everything you can, and work so hard, to get through school.  This will make your life substantially easier based on what I've seen from folks who were in a similar teen parenthood situation and choose a different career path.\n\n- if you decide to be with the other parent, nurture the relationship.  I'm pretty fucking bummed about my divorce - but we neglected the relationship - and this is what that leads to.  It's easy when you have kids to worry about, to only worry about that.  Treat time to nurture the relationship like one of the most valuable things you do.\n\n- conversely, don't force a relationship.  I may not have nurtured, but I also think we both tried to make a connection between us work. I fell in love with that kid for sure and that influenced things a bit.  Also, I think she was emotionally beat from having a kid, and me from rehab, and we both wanted someone that could handle going through something.\n\n- fine any help you can.  Subsidies and government programs are made to help people have a stepping stone to become a more productive member of society - use them for this.\n\n- just work a lot and hard.  As much as you can.  You can do this, it's not impossible.  I'm not even that smart - but I'll work 100 hours/week or more  if my kids need that.  \n\n\nWhile we've almost divorced, my relationship with my kids is perhaps stronger than ever.  We're on a mini vacation right now - one is asleep on my chest - the oldest who I met at 5 months old is probably on her phone instagramming.  The middle guy is watching golf - he's a complex 9 year old.\n\nAn easy life seems so boring to me.  We have had a ton of fun, even if the first few years and divorce were tough - they made me so resilient! Love kids, work hard, remember they will learn from the example you set more than anything else.\n\nSorry for the wall of text!\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a bit different but I think relevant - I was 19 and got into a relationship with a woman with a kid.

My wife was from Argentina and here on a student visa in the US.  9 months into our relationship we were just finishing up her first year of school (my second year - I'm young for my grade).\n\nIt was early May when \"it\" took place (but we didn't know it at the time).  I took a trip back to Argentina after school was over (late May).  I spoke broken spanish and met her family, friends , etc.\n\nI was in love (as much as a 19 year old can be) and it took nearly 2 hours but asked her parents if (after school was over) if we could get married.  They agreed and all ended well.  We drank, rode roller coasters and had a blast on that 2 weeks in Argentina.  I bought and presenter her a promise ring since she was to stay in Argentina for the summer while I went back to the US to start my engineering internship.\n\n**The Event**\nI got a call Mid June with the news.  I was numb, terrified and embarrassed.  I certainly had a chance to say \"oh\" and hang up but it never crossed my mind.  I told my parents who had me when they were 17 (and my dad's mom had his brother when she was 15) so they were understandably supportive, even if mad/upset at first.\n\nWe arranged for her to come back to the US in early July to figure out options.  Should she continue to go to school?  Should I drop out of school and work at the company that I was interning with?\n\nWe decided that we would legally marry (judge, beautiful backyard garden of a family friend).  She quit school and we moved into a small apartment.  I went from an engineering intern to a technician at my company and started working.  She worked at target.  She was F'ing cute as hell in stretchy khaki pants and an overstretched red sweat shirt bursting in the belly =-)....\n\nMy boss at the company unfortunately was in a motorcycle accident and was taken off life support which lead to me taking his role which allowed me to work my ass off with overtime and rise through the ranks there eventually to engineer (without a degree).  I had my own consulting business related to computers and software during this time as well which was a great second income.\n\nAfter our daughter was born we moved into our first house which was half way between my work and where she wanted to finish her schooling.  45 minutes each direction for both of us.

My wife was from Argentina and here on a student visa in the US.  9 months into our relationship we were just finishing up her first year of school (my second year - I&amp;#39;m young for my grade).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was early May when &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; took place (but we didn&amp;#39;t know it at the time).  I took a trip back to Argentina after school was over (late May).  I spoke broken spanish and met her family, friends , etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in love (as much as a 19 year old can be) and it took nearly 2 hours but asked her parents if (after school was over) if we could get married.  They agreed and all ended well.  We drank, rode roller coasters and had a blast on that 2 weeks in Argentina.  I bought and presenter her a promise ring since she was to stay in Argentina for the summer while I went back to the US to start my engineering internship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Event&lt;/strong&gt;\nI got a call Mid June with the news.  I was numb, terrified and embarrassed.  I certainly had a chance to say &amp;quot;oh&amp;quot; and hang up but it never crossed my mind.  I told my parents who had me when they were 17 (and my dad&amp;#39;s mom had his brother when she was 15) so they were understandably supportive, even if mad/upset at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We arranged for her to come back to the US in early July to figure out options.  Should she continue to go to school?  Should I drop out of school and work at the company that I was interning with?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided that we would legally marry (judge, beautiful backyard garden of a family friend).  She quit school and we moved into a small apartment.  I went from an engineering intern to a technician at my company and started working.  She worked at target.  She was F&amp;#39;ing cute as hell in stretchy khaki pants and an overstretched red sweat shirt bursting in the belly =-)....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boss at the company unfortunately was in a motorcycle accident and was taken off life support which lead to me taking his role which allowed me to work my ass off with overtime and rise through the ranks there eventually to engineer (without a degree).  I had my own consulting business related to computers and software during this time as well which was a great second income.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After our daughter was born we moved into our first house which was half way between my work and where she wanted to finish her schooling.  45 minutes each direction for both of us.  We got help from a friend of hers, her mom (who came up here off/on) and my family while we worked our ass off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She graduated, got her dream job.  I continue to work my ass off and become a VP and now C-Level executive in banking and now healthcare.  Along the way we had a 2nd kid.  15 and 9 now and beautiful dancers and stage actors.

We did a lot of arguing that day... Fast forward a few weeks later and we have both come to terms with our situation. We knew from the start neither of us were interested in parenting, so it only felt natural to start researching adoption. We got really really lucky and the first adoption counselor we met with ended up being an absolute saint, and we knew after our first meeting with her that we wanted to work with her and her program. We were already looking at parent profiles by the time we were 3 months pregnant. Apparently it is super rare for adoption counselors to meet women who are in there first couple months of pregnancy, let alone to start considering couples. Our counselor even said that 95% of her adoptions are organized in the last 4 weeks of the pregnancy, and a really large amount actually end up calling the adoption agency for the first time *after* the baby is born. We were a case like one she had ever seen for a lot of reasons, but the main reason was that I was the first birth father her or any of her coworkers had ever met. This still blows my mind. All 8 adoption counselors at this agency, working all over the state of Montana, had never met any of the fathers of the babies they had placed. They all disappear and leave the mother to deal with the whole thing. Anyways, me and my girlfriend found a couple out of the first group of applicants that we absolutely fell in love with. We basically finished reading their profile and just stopped considering anyone else. That feeling only intensified once we started asking them questions about themselves and talking to them on the phone. We only had to talk to them twice before we decided it was a sure thing, and tell them they had been selected. This was about 4-5 months into the pregnancy, so we had a lot of time after selecting our couple to talk to them and really get to know them. We ended up hanging out with them 3 or 4 times before our daughter was born, and they felt like family to us already. In fact, I think 99% of the reason our adoption went so well was because of how amazing our adoptive parents were throughout the whole thing.

Then we come to the highschool graduation ceremony. That's all well and good, but after it, my (then) girlfriend is going with her dad's side of the family to a family reunion. I missed her greatly. \n\nThen there comes the time where i can see her during the reunion and possibly go with her for the rest of it.

My (finally) fianc\u00e9 gives birth to our daughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stays at my house once again for one month, then moves in with her great aunt (taking our daughter with her) because my mother is a witch. Luckily she&amp;#39;s only 20 minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where we are now. Me with my parents, her and our daughter with her aunt. She&amp;#39;s taking online college and I&amp;#39;m working full time. I see them both many times a week (thankfully).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re everything to me. My entire life. I never understood how much someone could love someone else until my daughter was born.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long ass story. Hopefully you think it was worth the read. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. if it seems confusing, that&amp;#39;s cause i wrote this at 3:30 in the morning. Luckily I&amp;#39;m off tomorrow. If you want clarification on the story, just ask. I&amp;#39;ll try my best to update as needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dgaispu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492281091.0, "created_utc": 1492252291.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
