The people in the club were split in two group- the nice people and the not-so-nice people. every Tuesday we would watch anime in the tiny box tv the library had. Thanks to these weeb friends, I got into other anime, like Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Hetalia a bunch of others. I got into night core and Vocaloid as well. I'm pretty sure the reason the library manga collection tripled during my time there was because of me (at least I left with some good taste, namely YuYu Hakusho). Also we nicknamed ourselves after countries, because we watched Hetalia, and I was named Poland.\n\n2, I bit people. Oh god, I bit people. I kicked this habit in Year 9, after i had a crippling realization of what a horrible person I was.

I still don't know what the fuck that was about, I just bit people.\n\n3, I was a loud, obnoxious \"LOL SO RANDUMB X3 I PLAY VIDEO GAEMS LIKE DA BOYZ\", and the only thing that kept me from wearing my Naruto/Hatsune Miku/What ever shirts was the heavily enforced compulsory school uniform, and I'm thankful for that. didn't stop me from wearing thigh socks but oh well.\n\n4, and worst of all, I wrote fanfiction. Oh boy. I wrote everything, Naruto x Hetalia, Full Metal Alchemist self insert, Gaara x Hinata, Death the Kid x Crona.... I wrote CRINGY stuff, had a fanfiction account. Instead of doing school or homework I wrote fanfiction, mostly hand written. I still have it, I've dubbed it the \"Cringe Chronicles\" because it's about 3 or so years worth of fanfiction, from years 7 through 9. It's in a folder, I brought this thing to every class and would take it home everyday. I also drew naruto characters but eh, that wasn't as cringy.\n\nFun fact- I wrote smut fanfiction. And I didn't (still kinda don't!) understand how sex works, and during class I managed to write a hand written 28 page smut between human Hinata and Demon Gaara... who was described as having really sharp claws... who fingered her with 3 digits despite her being a virgin... 28 pages of this. Also Shukaku was his dad and he wanted AT LEAST 20 GRAND KIDS. there's also a Soul Eater x The Lovely Bones story that I wrote where it was pretty much the Lovely Bones with Soul Eater characters and Crona and Death the Kid are both dead in the end but that's ok because they're together for ever now! I can't find these two stories but at least I have the Cringe Chronicles folder....\n\nChrist. 8th grade syndrome is the worst.\n\nEDIT: Wow, didn't think I'd get so many people! Here's the links to my two main cringe sites\n\nhttp://randomchickwhowrites.deviantart.com/\n\nhttps://www.fanfiction.net/~zangooseninja\n\nThere was also a FiMFiction.net account but I only uploaded 2 stories on there I think.\n\nEDIT 2: Jesus this blew up when i went to sleep lol.

I kicked this habit in Year 9, after i had a crippling realization of what a horrible person I was. I bit my (then) best friend in the middle on an English class, I bit a guy I had a crush on like 3 times. I still don&amp;#39;t know what the fuck that was about, I just bit people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3, I was a loud, obnoxious &amp;quot;LOL SO RANDUMB X3 I PLAY VIDEO GAEMS LIKE DA BOYZ&amp;quot;, and the only thing that kept me from wearing my Naruto/Hatsune Miku/What ever shirts was the heavily enforced compulsory school uniform, and I&amp;#39;m thankful for that. didn&amp;#39;t stop me from wearing thigh socks but oh well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4, and worst of all, I wrote fanfiction. Oh boy. I wrote everything, Naruto x Hetalia, Full Metal Alchemist self insert, Gaara x Hinata, Death the Kid x Crona.... I wrote CRINGY stuff, had a fanfiction account. Instead of doing school or homework I wrote fanfiction, mostly hand written. I still have it, I&amp;#39;ve dubbed it the &amp;quot;Cringe Chronicles&amp;quot; because it&amp;#39;s about 3 or so years worth of fanfiction, from years 7 through 9. It&amp;#39;s in a folder, I brought this thing to every class and would take it home everyday. I also drew naruto characters but eh, that wasn&amp;#39;t as cringy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fun fact- I wrote smut fanfiction. And I didn&amp;#39;t (still kinda don&amp;#39;t!) understand how sex works, and during class I managed to write a hand written 28 page smut between human Hinata and Demon Gaara... who was described as having really sharp claws... who fingered her with 3 digits despite her being a virgin... 28 pages of this. Also Shukaku was his dad and he wanted AT LEAST 20 GRAND KIDS. there&amp;#39;s also a Soul Eater x The Lovely Bones story that I wrote where it was pretty much the Lovely Bones with Soul Eater characters and Crona and Death the Kid are both dead in the end but that&amp;#39;s ok because they&amp;#39;re together for ever now! I can&amp;#39;t find these two stories but at least I have the Cringe Chronicles folder....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Christ. 8th grade syndrome is the worst.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Wow, didn&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d get so many people! Here&amp;#39;s the links to my two main cringe sites&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://randomchickwhowrites.deviantart.com/\"&gt;http://randomchickwhowrites.deviantart.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Ezangooseninja\"&gt;https://www.fanfiction.net/~zangooseninja&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was also a FiMFiction.net account but I only uploaded 2 stories on there I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: Jesus this blew up when i went to sleep lol. I&amp;#39;ll be buying a scanner to show you the fabled Cringe Chronicles tomorrow (printers are like 30-50 dollars atm). I didn&amp;#39;t expect this to explode lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg470tp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491943285.0, "created_utc": 1491914485.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1273}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
