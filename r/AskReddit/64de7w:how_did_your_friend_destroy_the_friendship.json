He should have been fired way before that but my boss gave him a long leash for my benefit.  Eventually I told my boss to do what he had to do.  My friend was embarrassing me and didn&amp;#39;t give one shit that I had stuck my neck out for him countless times, so fuck him!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still working for the same company and so is the other friend I got the job for.  I&amp;#39;ve been there 19 years and my other friend is going on 15 years.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s pretty cool that I get to hang with my best friend everyday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg1ti1f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491806722.0, "created_utc": 1491777922.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 411}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg1b6y8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7213, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jdoe74", "parent_id": "t3_64de7w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good friend and I work at the same place.

I need to talk to you.&amp;quot; What not. Knowing this can&amp;#39;t be good, he decided not to entertain the idea of giving this guy another chance and logs into his email. He had written a short  message about how shitty of a person he is. &lt;em&gt;(Mind you, this guy is pretty much on the bottom of the totem of friends. He&amp;#39;s pretty much an aquaintance, just a brother of another friend who invited him once and he never left. He&amp;#39;s not sure why out of everyone he chose HIM to rip apart.)&lt;/em&gt;\nThe final straw. My husband&amp;#39;s Dad died when he was 2. He wrote, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a bastard.  At least my Dad is still alive. You&amp;#39;ll never know what it&amp;#39;s like to have a Dad in your life.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reading over his shoulder and I&amp;#39;m about to go hunt this guy guy down. I&amp;#39;m irate. He goes, &amp;quot;Huh.&amp;quot; He slowly closes his laptop. He calmly said, &amp;quot;Well, I won&amp;#39;t be seeing him anymore.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He tired calling him a bunch of more times, but I&amp;#39;m sure he knew he already read it. He screwed up and stopped. Never saw him again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg1hnzr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491790775.0, "created_utc": 1491761975.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1075}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64de7w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64de7w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64de7w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64de7w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64de7w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg1pyq3", "gilded": 1, "archived": false, "score": 717, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JollyGreenJesus", "parent_id": "t1_dg1nbbz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is a sign of an abusive relationship.

He was pretty fidgety, I guess from the gear he was obviously on. He was rambling about his stint inside (not surprising), how his family had all moved back up north, and how he was clean now.

Then, we regularly spent time together and started getting close; we had a lot in common and had a LOT of fun together. \n  \n  About 6 months in, he told me he started using cocaine recreationally. One night, he called me at 10pm because he was feeling talkative. I could hear him scraping and tapping with his credit card in the background. I kept him on the phone because I didn't want him to do anything stupid. We (he) talked for 4 hours. \n\n  This set the tone for the next two years. His habit got worse. His phone calls got more frequent, my anxiety got deeper and deeper. He told me I was the only person in his life who really knew him. He told me I was amazing, that he admired me, that he truly felt close to me, that I was his best friend... \n\n  I believe it because I've never had experience with cocaine before. I didn't know that it turned him into this charming, reckless, confident person.  I believed we were emotionally close; we talked all day every day via text. And I mean ALL DAY. And on some level we were very close... I grew to care about him on a deep level. And he grew to love cocaine more and more. \n\nDuring the last 6 months, he started disappearing for 2 or 3 days. I wouldn't hear from him... I'm currently an engineering student, and I need all the focus I can get for school, but I was so invested in his well being at this point, and so scared he was going to die, that I failed two classes during that time. I lost a major internship for NASA and set myself back from graduation by two terms. But I was so scared...\n  \n  The ball dropped one weekend when he went too far. Thank god he decided to check himself into rehab; I flew across the country that weekend to be with him and make sure he was stable that weekend. \n\n  His treatment went great. He's been clean over a year now. But he also doesn't seem to understand the extent of the damage he wrought over that two year period.

Then, we regularly spent time together and started getting close; we had a lot in common and had a LOT of fun together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 6 months in, he told me he started using cocaine recreationally. One night, he called me at 10pm because he was feeling talkative. I could hear him scraping and tapping with his credit card in the background. I kept him on the phone because I didn&amp;#39;t want him to do anything stupid. We (he) talked for 4 hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This set the tone for the next two years. His habit got worse. His phone calls got more frequent, my anxiety got deeper and deeper. He told me I was the only person in his life who really knew him. He told me I was amazing, that he admired me, that he truly felt close to me, that I was his best friend... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe it because I&amp;#39;ve never had experience with cocaine before. I didn&amp;#39;t know that it turned him into this charming, reckless, confident person.  I believed we were emotionally close; we talked all day every day via text. And I mean ALL DAY. And on some level we were very close... I grew to care about him on a deep level. And he grew to love cocaine more and more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the last 6 months, he started disappearing for 2 or 3 days. I wouldn&amp;#39;t hear from him... I&amp;#39;m currently an engineering student, and I need all the focus I can get for school, but I was so invested in his well being at this point, and so scared he was going to die, that I failed two classes during that time. I lost a major internship for NASA and set myself back from graduation by two terms. But I was so scared...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ball dropped one weekend when he went too far. Thank god he decided to check himself into rehab; I flew across the country that weekend to be with him and make sure he was stable that weekend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His treatment went great.

I told him it probably wasn't the best idea, but he really pursued it. All in. Unfortunately the timing was just off - it was the summer so we were home from school and they were only talking over text and Snapchat, but they were talking non-stop. One day, though, she pretty much stopped talking to him. Found out later that she was into him originally, but by that point she wasn't anymore and figured the best way to handle that was to cut off communications. He didn't appreciate that and said that I shouldn't hang out with her or any of her friends (who also are some of my friends) anymore because they're all clearly terrible people. I disagreed with that vehemently. Sure, some things were handled poorly and maybe that girl made you feel shitty, but she's still my friend. So my friend and I fought about this for months, never able to agree to disagree or hang out around the same people. Eventually it just became too toxic to the point where I felt uncomfortable around all of my friends.

I told him it probably wasn&amp;#39;t the best idea, but he really pursued it. All in. Unfortunately the timing was just off - it was the summer so we were home from school and they were only talking over text and Snapchat, but they were talking non-stop. One day, though, she pretty much stopped talking to him. Found out later that she was into him originally, but by that point she wasn&amp;#39;t anymore and figured the best way to handle that was to cut off communications. He didn&amp;#39;t appreciate that and said that I shouldn&amp;#39;t hang out with her or any of her friends (who also are some of my friends) anymore because they&amp;#39;re all clearly terrible people. I disagreed with that vehemently. Sure, some things were handled poorly and maybe that girl made you feel shitty, but she&amp;#39;s still my friend. So my friend and I fought about this for months, never able to agree to disagree or hang out around the same people. Eventually it just became too toxic to the point where I felt uncomfortable around all of my friends.
