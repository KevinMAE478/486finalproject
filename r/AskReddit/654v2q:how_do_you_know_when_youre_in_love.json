It ended up being a lot cheaper than just drinks at a bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought we were just making the best out of being poor but now that I have money but not a lot of friends to hang out with, I realize that those were the good old days.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg7hxcp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492116845.0, "created_utc": 1492088045.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1307}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7fidx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2886, "report_reasons": null, "author": "InMaking", "parent_id": "t1_dg7f860", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. - Andy Bernard", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish there was a way to know you&amp;#39;re in the good old days before you&amp;#39;ve actually left them. - Andy Bernard&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg7fidx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492112489.0, "created_utc": 1492083689.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2886}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7f860", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1870, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IIlIlIlIllIIllIIlIll", "parent_id": "t3_654v2q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Unfortunately, I never knew that I was in love while I was in it.
