Finally something that I can relate to. After reading all of these comments from different people, I can honestly say that I don't feel alone for once. \n\nI've been struggling with depression and anxiety since 2011. Five different antidepressants later and I'm still finding myself at square one. Most people, after spending some time around me, usually figure out I'm depressed. But what they don't figure out is that it's a lot worse than they think. \n\nI get the usual from people: \"why are you depressed\", \"what's bothering you\", \"get out and enjoy yourself, that'll make you feel better\". Yeah, that's easy for you to say. I wish I knew why I was depressed. Great fucking question. And nothing. Nothing is bothering me. Everything and nothing is what's bothering me.
