One day as I was getting ready to head to a college class a lady knocked on the door and asked who I was. She had me sign a document and it was a huge packet that she handed me. It was addressed to my mom but the strangeness of it made it suspect so I called her at work and asked if I could open it. \n\nI literally shook as I peeled back the seal and for the first time got to see my sister's face. She was absolutely beautiful and had already had five children and two step kids by the time she was 23. I sort of crumpled to the floor and cried buckets of happy tears. I had nieces and nephews and a beautiful sister who looked happy! Her and I look more similar than I do with my sister that shares both parents with me. My mom wasn't sure she wanted to intrude but I have her zero choice after my sister made contact. Two days later we all met and she has been in our lives since.

Our families had growing pains as we melded them and it's really odd having someone who is really like you in tons of ways but has been raised with different values and culture. She has been in my life for 17 years now... (Wow didn't realize that) and her dad just passed away and our whole family attended his funeral, he was a loving and dedicated father and grandfather. We got used to her dad/mom (adopted) our mom and dad (our mom and my bio dad) and her bio dad died before she could meet him. It's not always been sunshine and rainbows but I would rather have what we have even when it gets weird (we have the same first name) than have her absent. \n\nI know many don't have as positive of an outcome as we have but I felt a loss in my life until she found us.

We'd been having marital problems at the time, and my husband had been super secretive about his phone (you know where this is going) and before I found out I was pregnant, I finally managed to see his phone had somewhat inappropriate pictures (not naked) of a coworker. I promptly asked for a divorce. I was pissed because for the past year that we were having issues, I had begged him repeatedly to try separating because I felt like perhaps we were just two very different people who needed partners who were more... compatible. He refused, swore up and down he wanted to be with me, and now he was having an emotional affair with a coworker (who has a history of going after only married men.) \n\nI'm going to preface this by saying that my husband is not a bad person, he's actually very kind (he fought with people who were abusing a cat, picks up injured animals to take to the vet on the side of the road all the time--including a bird the night before our wedding so we had to make a detour to a local wildlife rehab center, etc.), but because of his parents very tumultuous divorce and pitting him and his brother against one another, he had somewhat of an inability to regulate himself when it came to things he can handle and things he cannot. So I immediately understood what happened when he told me what had been going on--basically she was going through a breakup with a guy who was married and he was giving her advice on ending it, and she kept telling him her insecurities to the point where she'd text him pictures of her outfit before going out and he'd try to boost her self confidence. Before you knew it, she started sending him progressively more provocative pictures and he didn't know how to stop her because he thought she was his friend and liked the attention as well and thought he was infallible. Terrible combination.\n\nANYWAY, the past year I had also been asking him to go to marriage counseling if he was serious about making our marriage work and he never took it seriously until I found those texts. He did the research (I required that it be an older male because due to issues with his mother and his feeling like he never had a strong father figure--cliche, I know--I figured his ability to respond positively in therapy required a strong male authority figure), made the appointments, really tried to make it work. He begged me to do one session with him even though for me, I had already set my heart to leaving because how dare he, right? I asked him for all these things he refused to do but now that he was the one who messed up, all of a sudden he is totally pushing to try them?\n\nI found out I was pregnant a few days after I found the text and even though we had wanted a sibling for our daughter, I knew I would not bring another child into this cluster-fuck of a relationship. I started calling around to make appointments for an abortion, but I was only 5 weeks in and no one would take me until 8 weeks at least (I don't know why) and I'm in a super liberal metro area too.  \n\nBy 8 weeks, we had gone to 3 sessions and things were improving by leaps and bounds. By 12 weeks, we were doing much better than we had before. In the end, I made the decision to stay. My husband goes to see his own therapist once a month (and this will continue for the rest of his life as part of his promise to make our relationship work--he has tendencies for manic depression so he'll think he's on the top of the world and uncontrollable for a few weeks and then spiral into not wanting to do anything for the next few and just cycles through that but it's not extreme enough for him to receive a diagnosis) and our marriage is very strong now.\n\nI still have some residual anger but my husband has always owned up to his mistakes and makes an effort to fix it. I think he didn't realize just how flawed he was until this happened and it cut down on his recklessness by 75%. We're happy though and I learned that the world is not as black and white as I used to think it was. I thought I could never stay with anyone who cheated on me (even though it wasn't physical) but I realized that everyone makes mistakes, and it's possible to fix them (within reason.)\n\nOur second daughter is now 7 months old and life is pretty good. I don't regret making the decision not to get an abortion, but know it could have been an option if nothing improved.\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was married with a 2.5 year old and we had been trying for 6 months after a miscarriage before I got pregnant.

He refused, swore up and down he wanted to be with me, and now he was having an emotional affair with a coworker (who has a history of going after only married men.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to preface this by saying that my husband is not a bad person, he&amp;#39;s actually very kind (he fought with people who were abusing a cat, picks up injured animals to take to the vet on the side of the road all the time--including a bird the night before our wedding so we had to make a detour to a local wildlife rehab center, etc.), but because of his parents very tumultuous divorce and pitting him and his brother against one another, he had somewhat of an inability to regulate himself when it came to things he can handle and things he cannot. So I immediately understood what happened when he told me what had been going on--basically she was going through a breakup with a guy who was married and he was giving her advice on ending it, and she kept telling him her insecurities to the point where she&amp;#39;d text him pictures of her outfit before going out and he&amp;#39;d try to boost her self confidence. Before you knew it, she started sending him progressively more provocative pictures and he didn&amp;#39;t know how to stop her because he thought she was his friend and liked the attention as well and thought he was infallible. Terrible combination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ANYWAY, the past year I had also been asking him to go to marriage counseling if he was serious about making our marriage work and he never took it seriously until I found those texts. He did the research (I required that it be an older male because due to issues with his mother and his feeling like he never had a strong father figure--cliche, I know--I figured his ability to respond positively in therapy required a strong male authority figure), made the appointments, really tried to make it work. He begged me to do one session with him even though for me, I had already set my heart to leaving because how dare he, right? I asked him for all these things he refused to do but now that he was the one who messed up, all of a sudden he is totally pushing to try them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found out I was pregnant a few days after I found the text and even though we had wanted a sibling for our daughter, I knew I would not bring another child into this cluster-fuck of a relationship. I started calling around to make appointments for an abortion, but I was only 5 weeks in and no one would take me until 8 weeks at least (I don&amp;#39;t know why) and I&amp;#39;m in a super liberal metro area too.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By 8 weeks, we had gone to 3 sessions and things were improving by leaps and bounds. By 12 weeks, we were doing much better than we had before. In the end, I made the decision to stay. My husband goes to see his own therapist once a month (and this will continue for the rest of his life as part of his promise to make our relationship work--he has tendencies for manic depression so he&amp;#39;ll think he&amp;#39;s on the top of the world and uncontrollable for a few weeks and then spiral into not wanting to do anything for the next few and just cycles through that but it&amp;#39;s not extreme enough for him to receive a diagnosis) and our marriage is very strong now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still have some residual anger but my husband has always owned up to his mistakes and makes an effort to fix it. I think he didn&amp;#39;t realize just how flawed he was until this happened and it cut down on his recklessness by 75%. We&amp;#39;re happy though and I learned that the world is not as black and white as I used to think it was. I thought I could never stay with anyone who cheated on me (even though it wasn&amp;#39;t physical) but I realized that everyone makes mistakes, and it&amp;#39;s possible to fix them (within reason.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our second daughter is now 7 months old and life is pretty good. I don&amp;#39;t regret making the decision not to get an abortion, but know it could have been an option if nothing improved.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg5uvqt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492032678.0, "created_utc": 1492003878.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
