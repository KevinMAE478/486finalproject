In the summer of 2016 I decided to quit my job and use the saving I had made to travel over the summer. The only issue was that I am barely into my 20s and have very little savings. I began research on cheap ways for young people to travel and stumbled upon a program called WWOOFing. That stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms. The just of it is that you pay a membership fee to a website that puts you into contact with farms from whatever country your destination is and from there you negotiate on a case by case basis what the conditions of your services will be. Usually consisting of a bed to sleep in and at least 2 meals a day in exchange for your manual labor on their farm.\n\nIn my case I chose to stay within the country (The United States) as I couldn't quite afford to travel out of the country. I'm from the east coast so California has always been this mystical land of freedom and exploration so I set my sights on a farm out west. After combing through the website's catalog I found a few farms that looked interesting and reached out to them. The first farm to respond basically had my full attention as I was looking for any way to leave where I currently was and see more. After talking to the people a few times and video calling I decided that they seemed like very nice people and I wouldn't mind giving it a shot with them. \n\nSo about a month after I had first contacted them I boarded a flight from the east coast to the west coast for the first time traveling alone and set up to be picked up at the airport. Upon arrival I was greeted by 2 of the individuals who lived on the farm. They came in a very nice Mercedes van which was stocked to the roof with food which they were going to donate to the local population which gave me a very good feeling about the people from the start. \n\nAfter they picked me up from the airport they told me they were running a few errands in town and we would be returning to their farm afterwards, which was fine with me. Included in those errands was picking up another person from the WWOOF program who was traveling from Chile. She was a very nice girl within a year or 2 of my age and was very pleasant to be around despite her broken English. While living on the farm we became good friends as we were both \"outsiders\" and happened to arrive into this strange situation as essentially the same time. Her name is Javi. I won't go into much detail about the specifics of the group or names because I wish them no ill-will and ultimately had a pleasant experience. However, upon arrival at the farm I soon found that a few emails and video chats were not enough to understand exactly what I was getting myself into. \n\nWhen we arrived to the farm I found that there were about 12 people that actively lived in the residence which was very, VERY, far off the grid in the mountains of Northern California. It seemed strange that so many people lived in the same house but I shrugged it off as I was a stranger and these people were inviting me into their home and being very kind. Two of these people living on the farm were boys around the age of 14-15 and who introduced themselves as brothers and were very well behaved and polite for their age.\n\nAfter living their for a week and getting used to the daily routine of waking up early and tending to the livestock and crops I started to realize that there was something \"off\" about the group as a whole. The entire time I was there I only once witnessed a conflict among the members of the household. Everyone was constantly smiling and it was as if there was nothing other than benevolent kindness that existed within their spectrum of emotions. That was the first red flag.\n\nA few days later they told me that their property also doubled as a teaching institution for how to properly interact with women as a man and how to understand yourself as a woman. It is worth noting at this point that I was one of 2 males on the property, aside from the teenage boys born and raised there, and the majority of the residents were middle-aged to older women. They offered to provide me with the resources they had accrued  over their years of research if I agreed to do extra work around the property or alternatively pay a flat fee. Ultimately I decided that it wasn't for me and turned down their offer which I feel began the divide between myself and them.\n\nTo go more in depth about their culture that I experienced while living with them I will reiterate that nothing that happened ever provoked a response that was not in some way positive or said without a smile even if the content of the conversation was unpleasant. As if they were conditioned not to acknowledge any emotion other than happiness. It was strange to me, but in my head I thought \"whatever works for them and makes them happy.\"\n\nNow back to the teenage boys. Over the weeks I spent with them I slowly started to ask more and more about their organization and came to find that the (luxurious and very well maintained) property that I was staying at was only one of 3 that was owned by the group and that a total of around 30-40~ people rotated through the properties, helping out as needed. But these boys had been born and raised on the farm I was staying at, rarely leaving. Talking to them one day I asked if they were brothers and began to ask about their childhoods. I came to find out that they referred to themselves as brother and so I asked who the oldest was. He answered and then the younger of the two piped up that it was only by 6 months that he was older. After spending a puzzled minute running that information over in my head the puzzle pieces started to fall into place. This was a commune. The sort in which \"everybody loves everybody.\" There were no husbands and wives or boyfriends and girlfriends. Everyone was simply a part of the family. This was when I started to feel weird. \n\nMyself and Javi lived in tents a few dozen yards from the main residency which was very close to a mountain and had a naturally occurring, snow-melt stream that ran through their backyard which was a nice sound to fall asleep to at night. However, on the trek from the main property to our tent we peeked into the lower level of the household and found that it consisted of a single large room with about 8 beds in it. They all slept together in the same room at night. I don't judge people for their ways of life so long as they aren't hurting anyone in doing so, but I still found this unsettling at the least in the sense that this hadn't been made clear before I made the trek to the other side of the country to live with them. It was around this time that I decided another farm was probably going to be in my future and began sifting through the listed farms on the website's catalog once again until eventually settling on a farm in Oregon that Javi and I were both interested in visiting. So we arranged travel specifics and notified the group of our impending departure. While seeming a little annoyed at first, they still met us with smiles and encouragement. \n\nDuring the last week of my time there 2 new WOOFers arrived together and both picked up on the weird atmosphere rather quickly. They planned on staying for a few months after we were set to leave so while still there I gave them the run down on what I had observed and experienced so far in order to give them an idea of what they were getting themselves into. Again, I have nothing against this group of people as they were nothing but kind to me, but I still felt that they left out parts of the experience of living with them when interviewing new applicants to work on their farm.\n\nAfter leaving on a good note and being at the new farm in Oregon for about a week and a half, one of the WWOOFers that arrived near the end of my stay with the group called me and said they were around the area of Oregon that we had gone to and wanted to meet up and hang out for the day. So we arranged to hang out at the park and catch up for a few hours. Once we got there I could tell that she had picked up on the strangeness of the whole situation with the first group. She recounted a story from a few nights after I left the farm about when the presumed \"leader\" of this cult had returned from another of the residences. I never met him personally but her experiences did not paint a positive picture. She claimed that he was rude in general to the rest of the people living on the farm and commanded an unnerving atmosphere whenever he entered the room. All the other residents would reportedly change their demeanor whenever he was around. After 2 nights of staying there with him being there the 2nd WWOOFer, Chelsea, decided that things were getting weird and strait up packed her belongings in the night and left a note saying that she appreciated their hospitality but didn't think things would work on the farm. This supposed \"leader\" is who I suspect is the father of both the half brothers as when he arrived he was apparently accompanied by a harem of other members of the group. \n\nAfter hearing her experiences I realized that my initial intuitions about the group were correct. They were indeed a cult, living high in the mountains and living life by their own rules. Again, I want to emphasis that I don't think negatively of the group or their actions. There are different walks of life for all and they seemed to be happy in their isolated community and were not hurting anyone so far as I could tell. \n\nSo as far as my experiences with the cult? I had a pleasant, thought unsettling at times, experience. It was strange to see their daily life but they all seemed happy, albeit in a forced manner. And the two boys born on the farm were some of the most polite and responsible teenage boys I have ever met. They were home schooled by everyone in the group and seemed to be very comfortable where they were.\n\nTL;DR: I lived with a cult through WWOOF", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty tardy to this party, but I&amp;#39;ll give my experience anyways. In the summer of 2016 I decided to quit my job and use the saving I had made to travel over the summer. The only issue was that I am barely into my 20s and have very little savings. I began research on cheap ways for young people to travel and stumbled upon a program called WWOOFing. That stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms. The just of it is that you pay a membership fee to a website that puts you into contact with farms from whatever country your destination is and from there you negotiate on a case by case basis what the conditions of your services will be. Usually consisting of a bed to sleep in and at least 2 meals a day in exchange for your manual labor on their farm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case I chose to stay within the country (The United States) as I couldn&amp;#39;t quite afford to travel out of the country. I&amp;#39;m from the east coast so California has always been this mystical land of freedom and exploration so I set my sights on a farm out west. After combing through the website&amp;#39;s catalog I found a few farms that looked interesting and reached out to them. The first farm to respond basically had my full attention as I was looking for any way to leave where I currently was and see more. After talking to the people a few times and video calling I decided that they seemed like very nice people and I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind giving it a shot with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So about a month after I had first contacted them I boarded a flight from the east coast to the west coast for the first time traveling alone and set up to be picked up at the airport. Upon arrival I was greeted by 2 of the individuals who lived on the farm. They came in a very nice Mercedes van which was stocked to the roof with food which they were going to donate to the local population which gave me a very good feeling about the people from the start. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After they picked me up from the airport they told me they were running a few errands in town and we would be returning to their farm afterwards, which was fine with me. Included in those errands was picking up another person from the WWOOF program who was traveling from Chile. She was a very nice girl within a year or 2 of my age and was very pleasant to be around despite her broken English. While living on the farm we became good friends as we were both &amp;quot;outsiders&amp;quot; and happened to arrive into this strange situation as essentially the same time. Her name is Javi. I won&amp;#39;t go into much detail about the specifics of the group or names because I wish them no ill-will and ultimately had a pleasant experience. However, upon arrival at the farm I soon found that a few emails and video chats were not enough to understand exactly what I was getting myself into. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we arrived to the farm I found that there were about 12 people that actively lived in the residence which was very, VERY, far off the grid in the mountains of Northern California.

Even so much as speaking to a non-JW is completely frowned upon. There's no birthdays or holidays, and from the short time I was in public school, it really sucked not being able to celebrate my birthday. Going to college is completely frowned upon. The only religious books and literature (actually, any other literature even for pleasure/enjoyment is frowned upon) you are allowed is produced by JW and the Watchtower. The Watchtower tells people how to live their lives in every aspect. Mental and physical disorders can be prayed away. Only 144,000 people get into heaven. They predict the Apocalypse every 15-20 years. They think Satan fell to earth when World War I started and have pinpointed the exact day. Parents are encouraged to beat their children. No one goes to the police about abuse. Women and children are property and you cannot question the all male elders. There's a two-witness rule when dealing with abuse. You also have to study for an hour or more each night and if you don't, you get punished.

I could not sit through the mandatory 2 hour long meetings where you're stuck with the congregation and even fidgeting gets you punished. Sunday School isn't allowed. I was frequently taken to the 'book room' to be spanked and beaten.

For example, my father drank and was a lawyer, which is frowned upon.\n\nI tried to report the abuse (mental/physical/sexual) multiple times when I was little, but every time the elders didn't believe me and one time they subjected me to the two-witness rule. This is where they determine whether or not you've been abused. There's two witnesses, who are old men with no training in law or looking for abuse, and they speak to both you and the abuser and then they put you and the abuser together. Then, they make a personal judgement. If they determine you haven't been abused, then you get heavily punished. If they determine that you have been, then the abuser gets subjected to more teachings so they can be 'saved'. In both cases, going to the police is not allowed. This has allowed for prolonged abuse in both my case and historically in many other cases. \n\nMy parents pulled me out of school and 'homeschooled' me with teachings from JW when I was diagnosed with autism.

The next week was about conflict resolution (I wasn't there for that, but mom came home and told my step dad all about it). Still tame stuff. The third week it went off the rails. They were saying conflict arises because God has given up on you and your marriage. Why?  Because you've submitted your marriage to demons!  If you *ever* argue about *anything,* your marriage is being infiltrated by demons!  They went on to talk about how they overcame those demons with prayer and rituals to get back in God's good graces. At the end, people were thinking \"Oh my!  I argue with my spouse!  WE'VE GOT DEMONS!\"\n\nSurprise surprise, these evangelists had just the solution!  For $5,000, they'd come to your home and cleanse the demons!

When people would protest, the pastor, evangelists, and any other members who bought into the nonsense would basically say, \"Those are the demons trying to mess with your mind so you won't get help to banish them!\"\n\nMy step-dad (also of a different religion - the same as my father and me) was getting tired of hearing about this, so he came with us one week. Mom was starting to get on the bandwagon and after hearing these people badger others into $5,000-$10,000 demon-cleansing services, he put the kibosh on it. Mom and step-dad had a huge blowout argument (ooooh, those demons!!) and Mom finally saw the light that it was a scam. \n\nThese other members of the congregation were her friends. She started talking to others trying to get them rounded up to get rid of the evangelists. She got a few on her side, but by then, the evangelists had gotten almost everyone on their side. My mother and her little band of \"normals\" were branded as demon sympathizers. They weren't excommunicated or anything, but they all left the church. *Horrible* things were said about everyone and I remember there almost being a riot. Some of these arguments escalated into threatens of physical violence and throwing chairs. One \"demon believer\" guy tried to hit a \"this is nonsense\" guy with a vacuum cleaner.

And there was a piece of tape over the word \"Devil\" believe it or not.)\n\nAbout 2 years later, the doorbell rings and it's the pastor and his wife. They come in and apologize for everything. They eventually realized it was a scam, but not before they gave these evangelists thousands upon thousands of dollars. I don't know how much the evangelists made off with, but they collected their fee every time someone had an argument with a spouse!  When members were tapped out, the pastor and his wife would help pay the fee. The church would pay the fee sometimes. They ended up losing the church and the congregation went from a couple hundred down to about 30. And then the evangelists disappeared without a word.

One of these evangelists (with a new wife) turns up at my mother's church (the one she switched to after the evangelist debacle). There are a few members here who were part of the old church. They're all on the church council here. The pastor introduces the evangelists and they give the same speech about healthy living and say they'll be here for their month-long series. My mother gathers up the old crew that week and they all explain the story of the old church to the pastor.  When they get to the pastor, he tells them he just paid them their $5,000 fee!  They confront the evangelists who refuse to return the money, so they immediately call the police.  The evangelists disappear again and the pastor cancelled his check. I know there was police involvement, but I don't think anything ever came of it. The church printed up flyers and sent them to other area churches to warn them of these evangelist hacks. \n\nMom switched to another church because she didn't feel comfortable at this church where the pastor was so willing to pay $5,000 to strangers for demon-eradication services.
