All&amp;#39;s well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ordered, and got our food.  She started talking about how she had recently lost a ton of weight- diet and exercise... doing it right.  She ordered... I think it was chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes?  It was something very heavy.  She started eating it very happily; it was clearly an indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Man, I just &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; food.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And my reply?

We hit it off big time ended up being together 8 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR worst date of my life ended up turning into my longest relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg7rkmi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492128410.0, "created_utc": 1492099610.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1098}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655gzx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655gzx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655gzx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8ilrp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 180, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TelldeathNottoday", "parent_id": "t1_dg86e5y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This kid sounds like Ralph from the Simpsons.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kid sounds like Ralph from the Simpsons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg8ilrp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492160071.0, "created_utc": 1492131271.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 180}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655gzx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg86lk0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 105, "report_reasons": null, "author": "madisskin", "parent_id": "t1_dg86e5y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have no fucking clue tbh.

Don't bring them on the actual date.\n\n*I* was the cringe part of the date (if you could call it that).\n\nI was like 13, maybe early 14, and I met this boy on bebo (anyone remember bebo?) and I thought he was awesome. He was in the same year as me, liked the stuff I liked, had long hair (which I liked) and he'd phone me on my mobile late at night and we would talk until early hours of the morning, he did this almost every night until he got in trouble for using too much credit.\n\nWe decided to meet up. I had already kinda confirmed he was who he said he was before we started talking (he went to the same school as my friends across the road, and they knew him) but I always tried to be responsible, so I thought \"i can't meet a stranger by myself!\" and I brought my friend with me.\n\nMistake number one!

Not to make a scene, I told Rob I suddenly wasn\u2019t feeling well and probably needed to head home.\n\nOn the way home in his Cobra, he tried to hold my hand and ask me lots of questions, but I wasn\u2019t having any of it. The pain was so bad it felt like I was being stabbed with a bunch of tiny forks. Then I realized ...\n\nMy God, help me. I have a horrendous fart on deck. I\u2019m in trouble. Big trouble.\n\nThe more I held it in, the more pain would shoot through my stomach and down my legs. I was even having to raise myself off the seat, gripping on to my door and the dashboard.\n\n\u201cSeriously, you need to hurry - I\u2019m in a lot of pain.\u201d I managed to say through gritted teeth.\n\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s that bad? What\u2019s wrong? Do I need to take you to a hospital?\u201d\n\nHow do you tell a man you just started dating that the reason you\u2019re writhing in pain is because you have to fart?\n\nWell, you can either tell him, or like me, let the fart speak for itself.\n\nPeople, hear me. There was nothing I could do. As impressive as I am with sphincter control, this was out of my hands. Slowly, it eeked out. The more I tried to stop it, the more it forced its way through the door. However, to my pleasant surprise, there was no sound. I sat silently, sweat accumulating above my upper lip. Ok, maybe I got away with it. Maybe I\u2019m home free. Then it hit me. Not an idea, a cloud. A horrific, fart cloud. Not in a, \u201cAm I smelling something?\u201d sort of way. More like a \u201cIs someone dead and rotting in your trunk and am I in hell?\u201d sort of way.\n\nSuddenly, I panicked. \u201cRoll down the windows!\u201d I screamed (yes, I literally screamed it like I was in a horror movie).\n\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Rob asked, starting to freak out because I was freaking out.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t roll down the windows, unlock it!  UNLOCK IT!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Rob yells back to me, \u201cWhy are you ...\u201d then it hit him. I could see it in his eyes. Was it surprise? Horror? Water started to accumulate at the base of his eyelids, \u201cOh my God, I CAN TASTE IT!\u201d he screamed.\n\n\u201cRoll down the windows!\u201d As I screamed, the toots started to flood out uncontrollably. I scratched and clawed at the window like I was being kidnapped. Rob, unable to see either by fart cloud or panic, kept turning on the windshield wipers instead of unlocking the window.\n\nIt was chaos. We were acting like we were under siege by gun fire. We were under siege alright, just not by gun fire.\n\nFinally he was able to hit the right control and he rolled down our windows. We both gulped in fresh air. I was horrified, yet happy to be alive, then remembered I just farted on the man of dreams, then sorta wished I was dead.\n\nWe sat silently for the rest of the way home. Although the shooting pains had subsided, I now desperately needed to use the bathroom, in an urgent, explosive kind of way.\n\nHe pulled up to my apartment and before he could come to a stop I had already jumped out, \u201cOk, thanks for dinner, sorry about the fart, love the shoes!\u201d and ran in to my apartment like I was running from the cops.\n\nI burst through my door and ran straight for the bathroom, where I was finally able to unleash and make noises that no one should ever, EVER, hear coming from another person.\n\nThen I heard it. Rob\u2019s voice. Right. Outside. My. Bathroom. Door.\n\n\u201cAnna? You left your shoes in my car and your front door was open. Where do you want me to put them?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet away from the door!\u201d I screamed like Reagan from The Exorcist.\n\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m sorry. Are you okay?\u201d\n\n*toot* *toot* *splatter* *ungodly noise*\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Rob - just leave the shoes there.

I mean, I love him, but take a freakin\u2019 hint!\n\nFinally, I heard the front door shut, and the Cobra engine zoom away. I thought that was the last I\u2019d hear from him. I didn\u2019t think it was possible to ever see a man again after he screams he can taste your fart after only knowing you for 48 hours.\n\nBut, to my surprise, I did. A couple days later, actually. Now we\u2019re married and he\u2019s lying on the couch while I type this ... \u201cIt was your rack that saved you,\u201d he just lovingly reminded me.\n\nWell, thank you boobs. You saved us.

Get there, and he tells me he hates coffee. Ok... so I recommend other places in the area. He shoots down every one, then finally rolls his eyes and says he doesn&amp;#39;t want to spend any money. So, why suggest meeting at any sort of restaurant? Anyhow. I suggest we go for a walk around a nearby lake. Cause what else are we going to do on short notice that costs no money?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do one rotation around the lake (about an hour) and there is NO chemistry.

Nothing fancy but a decent place: good food, wine menu, etc. She said in her dating profile that she was shy but this was way more than I expected. Any question I asked received a one-word answer. She did not ask any questions of her own. It was wildly awkward and even though there were a few bars nearby, I ducked out after the date, said goodbye, and thought that was the end of it. Cringe numero uno.\n\nHowever, that weekend I was down in San Diego with a friend and got a text from her saying how much she enjoyed our date and would love to hang out again. This surprised me to say the least. But I figured, what the hell, let's see what happens. She didn't seem to have enjoyed the restaurant too much so I asked if there was anywhere she wanted to go.\n\nShe had mentioned in her dating profile that she liked horror movies, reading about serial killers, morbid stuff like that. I shrugged it off and didn't think much of it but I was a little taken aback when she suggested we visit the Museum of Death. But hey, I'm a modern guy, open-minded and all that jazz so I said sure. And surprisingly enough, it was a good time. It was a small but interesting museum and no cringeworthy moments occurred. I figured she was a little more comfortable with me now, had gotten over the first date jitters, and things were improving.\n\nThe next weekend I was going down to Orange County for a chili and salsa festival with my best friend and she said she loved spicy food so I asked if she wanted to come. She said yes.\n\nThe ride down was awkward. She clearly struggles with meeting new people. I figured she'd hit it off with my friend since he's very friendly, personable, gets along with everyone, etc. But she reverted back to First Date Mode -- one word answers, no attempt at dialogue. I shrugged it off.\n\nWe get to the festival, eat some good food, have a good time. There's several bars nearby so we decide to go up there and have a few rounds before driving back to LA.\n\nTo this point, she hadn't drank around me. I didn't know what her alcohol tolerance was. To my surprise, she ordered the strongest beer they had, a coffee-flavored stout. And then she *pounded* that thing! She finished it before my friend and I were halfway through ours and both of us are pretty fast beer drinkers. So she ordered another. And drank that pretty fast too. Now, naturally, she's becoming talkative. Hey, no worries, I'm thinking. We've all used booze to give us a confidence boost. Now she's engaging in conversation and we're having a good time.\n\nShe slows her pace and we have a few more. My friend stops since he's driving. We're all in a good mood. She excuses herself to go to the bathroom before we leave. I go as well.\n\nI come back to the bar and she's not back yet. Oh well, no worries. I'm hanging around, talking to my friend. A few minutes pass. Still nothing. Seems a bit odd at this point but hey, maybe she's dropping a deuce. Women gotta shit too, right? \n\nThen a few more minutes pass. Enough to be concerning at this point. The door to the women's restroom opens, some other chick walks out and goes straight to one of the hostesses. The hostess goes into the bathroom and immediately leaves. Then returns with a mop and bucket. Well at this point I've figured out what's going on in there and I'm pretty sure I know who the culprit is. My buddy and I are looking at each other like, \"this should be good.\"\n\nThe girl doesn't walk out. She half-staggers, is half-dragged by the hostess who is trying to get her to tell her who she's with. So I come forward: \"She's with me.\"\n\n\"She needs to leave now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. We tabbed out. We're going.\"\n\nShe couldn't take the stairs down so they put her into a service elevator. My friend and I dragged her to his car and drove back to LA. I dropped her off at her apartment and she stumbled out and went inside with nary a word. Cringe dos.\n\nShe texts me the next morning, all apologetic. I wasn't really annoyed because hey, I've been there too. You drink too much and it hits you harder than you expected and sometimes shit goes haywire. I wasn't gonna hold it against her. So we made plans to hang out again. I told her that since I'd chosen last time, did she have anywhere she wanted to go? No suggestions, she just wants to see me. We made plans but the day of, she cancelled them. Said she had to go do something with family. No worries, she'd said that might occur. So that night, I head off to the local watering hole.\n\nI was a regular at this bar so I'm having a good time, hanging out with a few friends, and she texts me. Says her family event wrapped up earlier than expected, could she swing by? \"Don't worry, I won't drink too much like last time.\" Sure, come on over.\n\nShe shows up. She doesn't want a drink. I introduce her to my friends. Barely says hello, doesn't give her name. Goes and sits down in a booth. Alone. So I grab a beer and come over and sit next to her, plop my arm around her. She buries her head in my chest, back to the rest of the bar, and doesn't move. Won't talk to me, won't let go, won't speak. Just clings. I mean, I'd heard that phrase Stage 5 Clinger before but I didn't think it could actually be taken *literally*. \n\nThe only time I was able to move was to grab another beer when I finished mine. She consistently refused beers. When I'd get up, she would just look back at the booth and not acknowledge anybody. After a second beer, I told her I was leaving and walked her to her car. I don't even remember how we said goodbye. Cringe tres. She drove off and I went right back into the bar. Most awkward conversation I've ever had with my friends. \n\n\"What the hell was that about?\"\n\n\"I have no idea. I don't think it's gonna work out with her though.\"\n\n\"Ya think?\"\n\nI didn't see her again after that. But I still pass by her apartment a few times a week when I'm out for a run.

As I&amp;#39;m trying to get in the car, he tries to kiss me. &amp;quot;Did you not just hear a word I said inside?&amp;quot;\nHe said he thought I was testing him because he could tell I wanted it even though I said I didn&amp;#39;t? Not sure how physically not getting near you and out right saying I don&amp;#39;t want you to kiss me means I want you to? That was my worst date haha&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "name": "t1_dg88i9k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492146771.0, "created_utc": 1492117971.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
