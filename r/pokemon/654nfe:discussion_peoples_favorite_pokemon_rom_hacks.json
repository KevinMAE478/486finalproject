I'll paste it here:\n\nThese are my favorite hacks:\n\n[Pokemon Glazed](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=292279): You'll never find a hack recommendation list without this game on it. 3 regions, 20 gyms, all legendaries, a story that's not too bad, and more features than I could be bothered to list out here.\n\n[Pokemon Liquid Crystal](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=242023): This, IMO, is the best 2nd gen remake in existence. It remakes Pokemon Crystal with the FireRed engine, and then adds on even more. It feels a bit more like HGSS due to the level of polish it has, but it's still a great game. It has the normal Crystal storyline plus an Orange Islands post-game. It's also kind of hard. Not too hard, but more difficult than the main-series games.\n\n[Pokemon Flora Sky](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=183562): This game has the same level of polish and attention to detail that you would come to expect from an official game. It has a story that's a bit darker and more detailed than an official game, and it's fairly open world. This was the first hack I've ever played and it's one of my favorites. \n\nPokemon [Outlaw](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=351283), [CAWPS](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=360860), and [Korosu](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=372483): These hacks are part of a series made by Crizzle. Outlaw follows a similar story to Firered, but it's a bit darker and funnier. Sometimes, the humor goes overboard and feels too edgy, but it's alright. CAWPS is darker than Outlaw, and isn't as edgy. It's also pretty funny, too, but it doesn't try as hard as Outlaw. Korosu was when Crizzle found his touch, however. It follows the story of a girl sold into sex slavery and how she escapes, taking down numerous gangs on the Sevii Islands on the way. It's a lot darker, and the humor isn't a main feature of the hack anymore, but it's an amazing hack.\n\n[Pokemon Emerald 2](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=386229): This hack is like Pokemon BW2 for Emeralld. it changes route progression, a bit of the story, and adds a ton of balancing changes, like making Spinda OP.\n\n[Pokemon Normal Version](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=285739): Features, features, and more features is what this hack has. It has all the features you'd find in other high quality hacks, and adds in a day/night system, new graphics, better grass animations, and even DLCs. It's not completed, but there's enough for a couple dozen hours of gameplay.\n\n[Pokemon Christmas Version](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=276298): This hack assumes that the events of GSC happened in the summer, and this takes place the Christmas after. It's a nice little hack that might get stale after a while, but will make you smile while you enjoy it.\n\n[Pokemon Snakewood](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=235371): Pokemon Ruby but with zombies and more plot twists than an M. Night Shyamalan movie. It's pretty crazy, and you'll get more and more confused as the game goes on. I honestly don't even know why this hack exists, but I'm glad it does.\n\n[Pokemon Maize](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=309293): Just another normal pokemon game, but it has a massive amount of features, like event giveaways, a nuzlocke mode, and more.\n\n---\n#Other Canon Hacks\n\n[Pokemon AshGray](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=180722): Ash Gray follows the story of the anime until the second movie. It's pretty good, and catching all of Ash's pokemon at the same times triggers certain events.\n\n[Pokemon Adventure Red](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=298920): Adventure Red follows my favorite Pokecanon: the manga. The creator quit the project a while ago, but he's started working on it again and once it's out, it'll be the best hack anyone has ever seen.\n\n---\n#Fakemon Hacks\n\n[Pokemon Clover](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=343829): This hack was made by /vp/. Obviously, it's going to be pretty offensive at times (like the fire starter,) but it's really funny. It's also a pretty well made hack, with the best soundtrack I've ever seen in any hack. Every single pokemon in the game is a fakemon, but don't let that put you off. They're pretty high quality, and the ones that aren't are low quality on purpose.\n\n[Pokemon Vega](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=365959): This is another hack with only fakemon, but it's actually serious. It's extremely difficult, but it's really rewarding. The fakemon are extremely high quality and actually feel like real pokemon (so there's nothing like Arabomb in this hack, sorry.) It's not a bad hack, actually.\n\n---\n#Difficulty Hacks ^For ^when ^you ^don't ^care ^about ^your ^sanity.\n\n[Pokemon Blue Kaizo](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=322127): Pokemon Blue, but so hard that you just want to lay your head down, fall asleep, and never wake up.\n\n[Pokemon Crystal Kaizo](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=334713): Wow, Johto, my favorite region! I can't wait to experience its rich history, the wonderful atmosphere, and th- WTF, this is my sixteenth time wiping out and I haven't even reached Whitney yet.\n\nThe Pokemon Dark Rising Series: There's a reason I haven't included a link for these. That's because you should never play them. Don't even try. There's no real difficulty, it's just grinding, grinding, and more grinding, for hours on end and a horrible story. I don't know if the later games improved on this, because I only played the first one, but I wouldn't take the risk.\n\n---\n#Short Hacks\n\nThese hacks tell a nice story, and the gameplay isn't the main point of them. These are if you just want to relax, laugh a little, and maybe have a couple of Pokemon battles without saving the world.\n\n[Holiday Hacks!](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=339585): Easter Revolution is an April Fool's prank. The other hacks are fine, they're really funny too. Except for Cursed Version, which is kind of creepy.\n\n[A Grand Day Out](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=276201): Made by Cutlerine, one of my favorite hackers, this hack is a great, funny little story that'll make you smile and want more. \n\nThere aren't too many more Short hacks like these, sadly.\n\n---\n#Mini Hacks\n\nThese are engine hacks, hacks that recreate one part of the game, and hacks that retain the same story while having a single weird feature.\n\n[Pokemon Battle Factory Red](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=317980): This adds in the battle factory from future games, but nothing else. It's pretty fun.\n\n[Pokemon Thief Red](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=353557): This hack was made by ShantyTownRed, my favorite hacker of all time. He's also the guy who made the above hack. All this does is make it so that you can't gain experience from wild battles or catch wild pokemon, so you're forced to steal opponent pokemon in order to progress. Catching Lance's Barrier Dragonite is amazing.\n\n[Pokemon Blood and Tears](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=367163): If you lack the discipline to do a nuzlocke without cheating, this hack forces it on you. That's it. It's pretty good.\n\n---\n#Unique Hacks\n\n[Pokemon Mirage of Tales](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=308704): Play through the game with a starter that has an unknown typing. As you play, you can join the researchers at the lab that you pass by, you can become a cop by catching a criminal trying to sell pokemon to you, you can become a criminal by buying it from him, and there's a lot more. You can become a gym leader, hunt legendaries, become a breeder, and customize your experience completely. It's really fun, but the creator took the old download down because he's rebooting it. you might still be able to find the old download online, though.\n\n[Pokemon Super Rising Thunder](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=195965): In a post apocalyptic wasteland where humans are no more, one Pichu is forced to leave on a journey to bring back food for his village, avenge his dead sister, and try to find out more about his world on the way. This hack is extremely dark. The gameplay is also something amazing. There are no pokecenters or pokeballs, pokemon join your team like in a JRPG. You collect berries from dungeons to heal yourself and step on healing tiles. The dungeons replace routes now, and you can only go to each dungeon once. They're littered with traps and you have to get creative to solve their puzzles. The puzzles are actually hard, unlike the strength and ice puzzles from the main games.\n\n---\n#Branching Storylines!\n\nThese are my favorite hacks. I love being able to make decisions and having them affect the story of the game.\n\n[Pokemon Cyan](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=272818): The tiles on this are beautiful, and the story is great too. It also has some of the best fakemon ever. There's not much I can say about this hack, other than \"play it.\"\n\n[Pokemon Sienna](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=202372): Incomplete, but it's close enough. There's a couple of fakemon I think, and the story was really good. The choices didn't change the story too much, though.\n\n[Pokemon Ruby Destiny: Life of Guardians](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=163154): This is a great hack. There's nothing else I have to say about it. The entire Ruby Destiny series is like this. Try them all out if you have time.\n\nEdit: Also, check out Pokemon Red DX.

It has a story that&amp;#39;s a bit darker and more detailed than an official game, and it&amp;#39;s fairly open world. This was the first hack I&amp;#39;ve ever played and it&amp;#39;s one of my favorites. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pokemon &lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=351283\"&gt;Outlaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=360860\"&gt;CAWPS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=372483\"&gt;Korosu&lt;/a&gt;: These hacks are part of a series made by Crizzle. Outlaw follows a similar story to Firered, but it&amp;#39;s a bit darker and funnier. Sometimes, the humor goes overboard and feels too edgy, but it&amp;#39;s alright. CAWPS is darker than Outlaw, and isn&amp;#39;t as edgy. It&amp;#39;s also pretty funny, too, but it doesn&amp;#39;t try as hard as Outlaw. Korosu was when Crizzle found his touch, however. It follows the story of a girl sold into sex slavery and how she escapes, taking down numerous gangs on the Sevii Islands on the way. It&amp;#39;s a lot darker, and the humor isn&amp;#39;t a main feature of the hack anymore, but it&amp;#39;s an amazing hack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=386229\"&gt;Pokemon Emerald 2&lt;/a&gt;: This hack is like Pokemon BW2 for Emeralld. it changes route progression, a bit of the story, and adds a ton of balancing changes, like making Spinda OP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=285739\"&gt;Pokemon Normal Version&lt;/a&gt;: Features, features, and more features is what this hack has. It has all the features you&amp;#39;d find in other high quality hacks, and adds in a day/night system, new graphics, better grass animations, and even DLCs. It&amp;#39;s not completed, but there&amp;#39;s enough for a couple dozen hours of gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=276298\"&gt;Pokemon Christmas Version&lt;/a&gt;: This hack assumes that the events of GSC happened in the summer, and this takes place the Christmas after. It&amp;#39;s a nice little hack that might get stale after a while, but will make you smile while you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=235371\"&gt;Pokemon Snakewood&lt;/a&gt;: Pokemon Ruby but with zombies and more plot twists than an M. Night Shyamalan movie. It&amp;#39;s pretty crazy, and you&amp;#39;ll get more and more confused as the game goes on. I honestly don&amp;#39;t even know why this hack exists, but I&amp;#39;m glad it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=309293\"&gt;Pokemon Maize&lt;/a&gt;: Just another normal pokemon game, but it has a massive amount of features, like event giveaways, a nuzlocke mode, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Other Canon Hacks&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=180722\"&gt;Pokemon AshGray&lt;/a&gt;: Ash Gray follows the story of the anime until the second movie. It&amp;#39;s pretty good, and catching all of Ash&amp;#39;s pokemon at the same times triggers certain events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=298920\"&gt;Pokemon Adventure Red&lt;/a&gt;: Adventure Red follows my favorite Pokecanon: the manga. The creator quit the project a while ago, but he&amp;#39;s started working on it again and once it&amp;#39;s out, it&amp;#39;ll be the best hack anyone has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Fakemon Hacks&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=343829\"&gt;Pokemon Clover&lt;/a&gt;: This hack was made by /vp/. Obviously, it&amp;#39;s going to be pretty offensive at times (like the fire starter,) but it&amp;#39;s really funny. It&amp;#39;s also a pretty well made hack, with the best soundtrack I&amp;#39;ve ever seen in any hack. Every single pokemon in the game is a fakemon, but don&amp;#39;t let that put you off. They&amp;#39;re pretty high quality, and the ones that aren&amp;#39;t are low quality on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=365959\"&gt;Pokemon Vega&lt;/a&gt;: This is another hack with only fakemon, but it&amp;#39;s actually serious. It&amp;#39;s extremely difficult, but it&amp;#39;s really rewarding. The fakemon are extremely high quality and actually feel like real pokemon (so there&amp;#39;s nothing like Arabomb in this hack, sorry.) It&amp;#39;s not a bad hack, actually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Difficulty Hacks &lt;sup&gt;For&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;when&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;you&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;care&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;about&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;your&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;sanity.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=322127\"&gt;Pokemon Blue Kaizo&lt;/a&gt;: Pokemon Blue, but so hard that you just want to lay your head down, fall asleep, and never wake up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=334713\"&gt;Pokemon Crystal Kaizo&lt;/a&gt;: Wow, Johto, my favorite region! I can&amp;#39;t wait to experience its rich history, the wonderful atmosphere, and th- WTF, this is my sixteenth time wiping out and I haven&amp;#39;t even reached Whitney yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Pokemon Dark Rising Series: There&amp;#39;s a reason I haven&amp;#39;t included a link for these. That&amp;#39;s because you should never play them. Don&amp;#39;t even try. There&amp;#39;s no real difficulty, it&amp;#39;s just grinding, grinding, and more grinding, for hours on end and a horrible story. I don&amp;#39;t know if the later games improved on this, because I only played the first one, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t take the risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Short Hacks&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These hacks tell a nice story, and the gameplay isn&amp;#39;t the main point of them. These are if you just want to relax, laugh a little, and maybe have a couple of Pokemon battles without saving the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=339585\"&gt;Holiday Hacks!&lt;/a&gt;: Easter Revolution is an April Fool&amp;#39;s prank. The other hacks are fine, they&amp;#39;re really funny too. Except for Cursed Version, which is kind of creepy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=276201\"&gt;A Grand Day Out&lt;/a&gt;: Made by Cutlerine, one of my favorite hackers, this hack is a great, funny little story that&amp;#39;ll make you smile and want more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;#39;t too many more Short hacks like these, sadly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Mini Hacks&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are engine hacks, hacks that recreate one part of the game, and hacks that retain the same story while having a single weird feature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=317980\"&gt;Pokemon Battle Factory Red&lt;/a&gt;: This adds in the battle factory from future games, but nothing else. It&amp;#39;s pretty fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=353557\"&gt;Pokemon Thief Red&lt;/a&gt;: This hack was made by ShantyTownRed, my favorite hacker of all time. He&amp;#39;s also the guy who made the above hack. All this does is make it so that you can&amp;#39;t gain experience from wild battles or catch wild pokemon, so you&amp;#39;re forced to steal opponent pokemon in order to progress. Catching Lance&amp;#39;s Barrier Dragonite is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=367163\"&gt;Pokemon Blood and Tears&lt;/a&gt;: If you lack the discipline to do a nuzlocke without cheating, this hack forces it on you. That&amp;#39;s it. It&amp;#39;s pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Unique Hacks&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=308704\"&gt;Pokemon Mirage of Tales&lt;/a&gt;: Play through the game with a starter that has an unknown typing. As you play, you can join the researchers at the lab that you pass by, you can become a cop by catching a criminal trying to sell pokemon to you, you can become a criminal by buying it from him, and there&amp;#39;s a lot more. You can become a gym leader, hunt legendaries, become a breeder, and customize your experience completely. It&amp;#39;s really fun, but the creator took the old download down because he&amp;#39;s rebooting it. you might still be able to find the old download online, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=195965\"&gt;Pokemon Super Rising Thunder&lt;/a&gt;: In a post apocalyptic wasteland where humans are no more, one Pichu is forced to leave on a journey to bring back food for his village, avenge his dead sister, and try to find out more about his world on the way. This hack is extremely dark. The gameplay is also something amazing. There are no pokecenters or pokeballs, pokemon join your team like in a JRPG. You collect berries from dungeons to heal yourself and step on healing tiles. The dungeons replace routes now, and you can only go to each dungeon once. They&amp;#39;re littered with traps and you have to get creative to solve their puzzles. The puzzles are actually hard, unlike the strength and ice puzzles from the main games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Branching Storylines!&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are my favorite hacks. I love being able to make decisions and having them affect the story of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=272818\"&gt;Pokemon Cyan&lt;/a&gt;: The tiles on this are beautiful, and the story is great too. It also has some of the best fakemon ever. There&amp;#39;s not much I can say about this hack, other than &amp;quot;play it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=202372\"&gt;Pokemon Sienna&lt;/a&gt;: Incomplete, but it&amp;#39;s close enough. There&amp;#39;s a couple of fakemon I think, and the story was really good. The choices didn&amp;#39;t change the story too much, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=163154\"&gt;Pokemon Ruby Destiny: Life of Guardians&lt;/a&gt;: This is a great hack. There&amp;#39;s nothing else I have to say about it. The entire Ruby Destiny series is like this. Try them all out if you have time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Also, check out Pokemon Red DX.
