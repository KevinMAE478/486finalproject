Basically in X/Y we got a Bulky Grass, Feminine Fire, And Stealthy Water starter. In Sun/Moon we got a Stealthy Grass, Bulky Fire, And Feminine Water Starter. This means that in Generation 8 we might get a Feminine Grass, Stealthy Fire, And Bulky Water Starter. Also their types are weaker with each generation for example Greninja is Water/Dark while Prismarina is Water/Fairy. This accounts for all of the starters. Based on this in Generation 8 we could get a Grass/Dark Feminine Starter (Maybe an Opossum?), A Fire/Fairy Stealthy Starter (Maybe an Ox with its horns shaped like a good or maybe a Rabbit), And a Water/Poison Bulky Starter (Maybe an Iguana or a Platypus) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next we have Diancie and Magearna. These both could be based on the Norns from Norse Mythology meaning there is three of them. So far it seems like they are starting a Type triangle as you can see &lt;a href=\"http://m.imgur.com/2VUAgcU\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;. Based on this in Generation 8 we might get a Diancie/Magearna like Pokemon that is Fire/Fairy type &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next there is the Pikachu clones.

It will have features integrated into the Switch layout/setup and we might get a Z-Crystal for Ho-Oh. Maybe they will literally be called Pokemon Sun Switch, And Pokemon Moon Switch. When the 20th movie comes out we will get a teaser showing of Necrozma&amp;#39;s many forms which will have a part in Part 2 of the Sun/Moon Anime and will be thrown into G8 just like Zygarde was. Generation 8 will come out late 2018 and will be called Pokemon Drench and Drought.
