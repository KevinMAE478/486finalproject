Since a negative catch rate does funny things to the ball formula, they set the floor to 1, prior to Gen VII, or 0 in Gen VII. Zero catch rate will always cause a ball to fail, but only ever comes into effect with the Heavy Ball, since it&amp;#39;s the only one that adds or subtracts, rather than multiplies, the catch rate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a side note, the other five Apricorn Balls, aside from the Friend Ball, which has a standard 1\u00d7 catch rate multiplier, rather than multiplying the &lt;em&gt;formula&lt;/em&gt; multiply the &lt;em&gt;catch rate itself&lt;/em&gt;, meaning a maximum of 255. Using a Lure Ball on fished Magikarp (3\u00d7) is no more effective than a normal Pok\u00e9 Ball due to its 255 catch rate, but a Net Ball would be more effective because its 3\u00d7 multiplier applied later on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pokemon", "name": "t1_dg4e79n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491952646.0, "created_utc": 1491923846.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg49ynp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BaconJunkiesFTW", "parent_id": "t1_dg48o72", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Heavy ball captures Pokemon with high weights.

Heavy Ball is the one mechanic in the game that is additive into the catch equations.  All others are multiplicative.  Use a heavy ball on a light enough pokemon, and it subtracts from the catch chance.  Have a low enough catch rate, and this can send the calculations negative.  A negative number on a catch chance makes no sense, so the next question becomes what does the game do with that negative number.  And it reportedly sets it to zero.  As in zero chance of a catch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that it was setting it to a small fractional number above zero instead of actually setting it to zero.  Some previous generations had the minimum chance at 1, not 0, so there was never no chance of success.  But the decompiled calculations reportedly show that it does set it to zero in Gen7. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beldum is the main example that is used, though the Tapus all reportedly are in the same situation.  There are lots of Heavy Ball Beldum/Metagross floating around WT/GTS.
