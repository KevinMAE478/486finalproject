Linking back in the comments section is all I can do, and what I did in the post back then ; I wanna retain MY OWN edits when posting artworks that I've edited.\n\nI know the artworks were originally made by others, and I want to respect them, but then again, if I've edited them, all I can do is linking back in the comments.\n\nI'll show you the proof of the original image versus my edited image if necessary. \n\nThe original                                                = http://thebumbleraven.deviantart.com/art/I-Never-Left-Your-Side-579919097\n\nThe edited (that I submitted here a few days ago, only to have it removed due to the 'rehost' I mentioned before) = http://imgur.com/yniGsWA\n\nIn the edited one, you can see the 'shadow' of all the variants of the pok\u00e9mon jets that used to operate. Plus, there are halos over the latios's head and all of the pok\u00e9mon jets' 'shadows', and also a writing in the sky. If you open the original one, you won't see any of the things I have just explained. From this, I hope you understand what I'm talking about.

When over 1500 people lost their lives in the RMS Titanic disaster. The tragedy, however, has changed the safety of sea voyages for the better since then, and I want to honor the victims with this, also showing my love of pok\u00e9mon at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IN THE WAKE OF ONE OF MY EDITED ARTS BEING REMOVED BY POK\u00c9MON SUBREDDIT MODERATORS DUE TO IT BEING PRESUMED AS A RE-HOST :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please remember that I NEVER UPLOAD RAW ARTWORKS FROM OTHER ARTISTS IN IMGUR ; ALL OF THEM HAS BEEN EDITED BY MYSELF FIRST IN SOME WAY. Should I ever want to upload a &amp;#39;raw&amp;#39; artwork of pok\u00e9mon from others in this subreddit, I&amp;#39;ll notify it in the comments and definitely link back in both the comments section and the referral link !&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that the rule prohibits uploading RAW, UNEDITED ARTWORKS MADE BY OTHERS to other sites to be posted here via that site ; the arts must originate from the original source ; I know that well, and if I wanna show you something &amp;#39;raw&amp;#39;, I&amp;#39;ll definitely link to the original source as the submission and in the comments section. No compromisation about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However I&amp;#39;VE EDITED THE IMAGE, MYSELF. How am I SUPPOSED TO RETAIN THE EDITS whilst uploading the original source of image in the original link when first submitting the link ? Linking back in the comments section is all I can do, and what I did in the post back then ; I wanna retain MY OWN edits when posting artworks that I&amp;#39;ve edited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the artworks were originally made by others, and I want to respect them, but then again, if I&amp;#39;ve edited them, all I can do is linking back in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll show you the proof of the original image versus my edited image if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The original                                                = &lt;a href=\"http://thebumbleraven.deviantart.com/art/I-Never-Left-Your-Side-579919097\"&gt;http://thebumbleraven.deviantart.com/art/I-Never-Left-Your-Side-579919097&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The edited (that I submitted here a few days ago, only to have it removed due to the &amp;#39;rehost&amp;#39; I mentioned before) = &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/yniGsWA\"&gt;http://imgur.com/yniGsWA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the edited one, you can see the &amp;#39;shadow&amp;#39; of all the variants of the pok\u00e9mon jets that used to operate. Plus, there are halos over the latios&amp;#39;s head and all of the pok\u00e9mon jets&amp;#39; &amp;#39;shadows&amp;#39;, and also a writing in the sky. If you open the original one, you won&amp;#39;t see any of the things I have just explained. From this, I hope you understand what I&amp;#39;m talking about. I&amp;#39;ll always abide by the rules and I won&amp;#39;t object the mods in any way, But in return I would like your understanding regarding this matter, so that this kind of thing doesn&amp;#39;t happen anymore to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best regards to all of you, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pokemon", "name": "t1_dgdh9ol", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492464817.0, "created_utc": 1492436017.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vkbk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdq7aj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Crystalitar", "parent_id": "t3_65vkbk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "controversiality": 0, "body": "jirachi and mew are adorable!\n\nalso i like how victini looks the most boyish out of all the mythos \"fairies\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;jirachi and mew are adorable!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;also i like how victini looks the most boyish out of all the mythos &amp;quot;fairies&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pokemon", "name": "t1_dgdq7aj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476020.0, "created_utc": 1492447220.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vkbk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdqex5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TehOrangeSpark", "parent_id": "t3_65vkbk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This adorable.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adorable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pokemon", "name": "t1_dgdqex5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476254.0, "created_utc": 1492447454.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vkbk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vkbk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdzqas", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "neonrideraryeh", "parent_id": "t1_dgdtvvz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I see it as not all Legends are Mythical, but Mythicals are Legends.
