Don't get me wrong, I actually do love the Eevee family but let's be honest, Eevee is probably like a second mascot at this point. \n\nEevee was the only Pokemon to get an evolution post Gen 4 last Generation, it got a special Z-Move this generation, three important characters in the anime got an Eevee (Gary, May, and Serena), Red got an Eeveelution in Adventures and in the Gen 2 games, and it constantly appears as a starter in the various spin off games. There's also quite a bit of characters in the anime (and the games) that have Eevee and its evolved forms as some sort of gimmick. The Eevee family even had its own cute little animated special to promote Sylveon and XY. Also like Pikachu they've got a lot of toys and other merchandise too.  \n\nAlso I think it's rather unfortunate that other Pokemon don't have branching evolutions as vast as Eevee because there's a lot of opportunities that could be done with other Pokemon. In fact if I'm not mistaken they haven't had any split evolutions since Gen 4 as well (Gallade and Froslass were our last split evolutions excluding the Eevee family if I'm not mistaken). \n\nTo add on this, a lot of the Eeveelutions are outclassed by other Pokemon competitively.

Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I actually do love the Eevee family but let&amp;#39;s be honest, Eevee is probably like a second mascot at this point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eevee was the only Pokemon to get an evolution post Gen 4 last Generation, it got a special Z-Move this generation, three important characters in the anime got an Eevee (Gary, May, and Serena), Red got an Eeveelution in Adventures and in the Gen 2 games, and it constantly appears as a starter in the various spin off games. There&amp;#39;s also quite a bit of characters in the anime (and the games) that have Eevee and its evolved forms as some sort of gimmick. The Eevee family even had its own cute little animated special to promote Sylveon and XY. Also like Pikachu they&amp;#39;ve got a lot of toys and other merchandise too.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I think it&amp;#39;s rather unfortunate that other Pokemon don&amp;#39;t have branching evolutions as vast as Eevee because there&amp;#39;s a lot of opportunities that could be done with other Pokemon.
