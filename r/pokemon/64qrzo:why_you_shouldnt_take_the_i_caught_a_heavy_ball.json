For example, the Ultra Ball is twice as good at catching Pok\u00e9mon as a Pok\u00e9 Ball, because it has a 2x catch rate. Some of them are more situational, like the Quick Ball having 5x but only on the first turn, or the Dusk Ball having 4x but only in dark places or at night.\n\nMeanwhile, Pok\u00e9mon also have individualized catch rates on a scale of 0 to 255. The hardest Pok\u00e9mon to catch are ones like Groudon that have 3 as their catch rate, but easier ones like Pidgey have 255 so that they can be caught easily even without being batted first.\n\nIn *nearly* all cases, the Pok\u00e9 Ball's catch rate is multiplied by the Pok\u00e9mon's catch rate - an Ultra Ball's modifier is 2x, so it will make Groudon have a catch rate of 6 and Pidgey have a catch rate of 510.\n\nHowever, the one exception to this is the Heavy Ball, which uses addition and subtraction instead of multiplication. With the Heavy Ball, heavier Pok\u00e9mon like Onix get an *increase* to their catch rates, and lighter Pok\u00e9mon like Pidgey get a *decrease* to their catch rates. This is all well and good in nearly all cases; however, there are five Pok\u00e9mon - Beldum, Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Tapu Bulu and Tapu Fini - who are *both* very light in weight *and* very unlikely to be caught. To be exact, all five of them have a catch rate of 3, like Groudon mentioned above, but they also weigh low enough that the Heavy Ball reduces their catch rate by 20, putting their final number at a catch rate of *negative 17.*\n\nGame Freak doesn't want this to be a negative number, so it's programmed to bring it up some amount. The problem here is in what amount it uses - it used to bring it up to 1 (for reference, that means using a Heavy Ball on a Beldum would be about a third as effective as a Pok\u00e9 Ball on Groudon), but that number was changed to 0 in Sun and Moon, meaning Beldum cannot be caught in a Heavy Ball at all.\n\nAnother issue here is that it's *only* the Heavy Ball that does this. Many people mistakenly think that, say, a status condition could be used to make Beldum more likely to be caught. However, *everything except the Heavy Ball* is multiplication or division - for instance, sleep is a 3x multiplier, but if it's already 0, that doesn't do anything because 3 x 0 is still 0.\n\nThe issue here is that someone is reporting a legitimate Heavy Ball Beldum - the alleged first ever - and convincing other people that it's possible if you try enough. It's similar to when Red and Blue came out and nobody knew how anything worked, so you could convince people of anything (like, as another user brought up, claiming you could find a Mew under the truck near the SS Anne); the problem is that we already have the code to prove it isn't possible, but since this person modified their game to get fake evidence, many people are liable to waste time pursuing a \"rare Pok\u00e9mon\" (the appeal of this is like Shinies - knowing something is rare makes it more valuable, like it's a cool challenge to find it, even though there is no actual benefit to being in a Heavy Ball *or* being Shiny) that actually doesn't exist and can't be legally obtained.\n\nI hope that clears up your confusion!

And if you remember math class, 0*n=0. So no matter what modifiers you use, the catch rate will always be zero if it becomes zero at any point, unless addition is used. The game actually calculates Beldum to have a negative catch rate, which is then rounded to 0. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do not know everything about how catch rates work in Gen 7, however all that we do know points to the conclusion that Beldum is impossible to catch in a Heavy Ball. There is also quite a bit of circumstantial evidence against the OP, but I won&amp;#39;t mention any of it myself as it&amp;#39;s unnecessary, and the OP of this post did a great job covering most of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pokemon", "name": "t1_dg4jou6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491958669.0, "created_utc": 1491929869.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qrzo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qrzo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qrzo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qrzo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qrzo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qrzo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg52mpu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "weatherseed", "parent_id": "t1_dg4oile", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Heavy Balls were only available in GSC, HGSS, and now S&amp;M, for anyone else wondering.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy Balls were only available in GSC, HGSS, and now S&amp;amp;M, for anyone else wondering.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pokemon", "name": "t1_dg52mpu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491980212.0, "created_utc": 1491951412.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4oile", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jugol", "parent_id": "t1_dg4i1jx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No Heavy Balls in these games either", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Heavy Balls in these games either&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pokemon", "name": "t1_dg4oile", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491963964.0, "created_utc": 1491935164.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4i1jx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nico_is_not_a_god", "parent_id": "t1_dg4hjn3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You can get wild Metang/Metagross in Gen 5 too", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get wild Metang/Metagross in Gen 5 too&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pokemon", "name": "t1_dg4i1jx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491956871.0, "created_utc": 1491928071.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4hjn3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mjangelvortex", "parent_id": "t1_dg4go47", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You could be thinking of the Friend Safari in X and Y but even then you can't get Heavy Balls legitimately there.
