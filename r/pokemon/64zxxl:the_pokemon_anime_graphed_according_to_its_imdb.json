Would Ash finally win a league? The writers certainly hinted at it. They built up Ash's pokemon team and his relationship with his pokemon like never before. There was a greater emphasis on how Ash and his team were actually good at battling and in tune with each other (so much that Greninja took on a new form when synchronized with Ash), and not winning all their battles with deus ex machina or power of friendship codswallop.\n\nThe league rival, Alain, was also built up over the course of the whole series. He got his own parallel episodes following his story. He was a Mega Evolution trainer that was stronger than Ash, someone to look up to a be a goal to reach. Alain's story was also heavily intertwined with Ash's plotline with Ash's Greninja, a non-Pikachu team member with more character focus and development than any other pokemon.\n\nThe direction of the show heading into the final buildup was that the old formula was being transformed into something new, and that all the old assumptions were being knocked down one by one. Ash had not yet managed to defeat Alain, but his pokemon were strong (ridiculously so) and he was getting ever closer to pushing the limits of his bond with Greninja. Ash even managed to reach the FINALS, something he was always prevented from doing by (Charizard being a jerk, Darkrai ex Machina).

Even the narrative build-up of overcoming the rival was thrown away. They even managed to make Ash's Greninja lose to a move with type disadvantage. They took a species beloved by the fandom, Charizard, and used its almost Mary-Sue like Mega Form to thwart the built up expectations of the fandom.
