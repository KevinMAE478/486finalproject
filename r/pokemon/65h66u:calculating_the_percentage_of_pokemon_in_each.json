It was an interesting topic, and I decided to do some calculations to find out if certain eye shapes really are more or less common in certain generations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, because there was some speculation that certain eye shapes were more or less common with certain evolutionary stages (rather than generations), I did those calculations too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started by writing down specific details about the eye shape of each Pokemon, and then I broke those down into 9 distinct categories:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;0) Uncategorizable OR Multiple eye shapes (ex: Exeggutor, Claydol, Gigalith)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Rounded top and flat bottom (ex: Charmander, Seviper, Vivillon)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Triangle shape (ex: Charmeleon, Nuzleaf, Silvally)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Flat top and rounded bottom (ex: Venusaur, Slakoth, Swadloon)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Quadrilateral/Square shape (ex: Spearow, Diggersby, Charjabug)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Perfectly round shape (ex: Pikachu, Cryogonal, Drampa)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) Tall oval shape (ex: Shinx, Uxie, Froakie)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) Wide oval shape (ex: Psyduck, Baltoy, Stunfisk)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8) No visible eyes OR Closed eyes (ex: Snorlax, Ralts, Bronzong)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specifically, I hoped to measure if there is a significant difference between the percentage of Pokemon with eye shapes 2 and 6, dependent upon generation and/or evolutionary stage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When broken down by the total number of Pokemon introduced in each generation, basic (12.58%) and stage 1 Pokemon (17.88%) with eye shape 2 are significantly more common in generation 1 than in later generations. Stage 2 Pokemon with eye shape 2 are only 0.36% more common in generation 1 (5.30%) than in the generation 7, which has the next highest percentage (4.94%). Among all generations, eye shape 6 is significantly more common in later generations than in generation 1, but this difference is only significant in regards to basic Pokemon. The difference shrinks to insignificant levels when observing later evolutionary stages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When broken down by the total number of Pokemon introduced in each generation that belong to each evolutionary stage, basic (27.94%) and stage 1 Pokemon (42.19%) with eye shape 2 are significantly more common in generation 1 than in later generations. The difference in the percentage of stage 2 Pokemon with eye shape 2 is also significant when comparing generation 1 to any generation EXCEPT generation 7. Stage 2 Pokemon with eye shape 2 are 2.33% more common in generation 7 (44.44%) than in generation 1 (42.11%). Among all evolutionary stages, eye shape 6 is significantly more common in later generations than in generation 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It appears that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a difference between the percentage of Pokemon with eye shapes 2 and 6, and this difference is primarily dependent upon generation rather than evolutionary stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s a link to the &lt;a
