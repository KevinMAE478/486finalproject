If they all stood shoulder to shoulder they would cover almost the entirety of Qatar. If they stood at an appropriate distance apart they would cover an area the size of Switzerland.\n\nWhat type, abilities, stats, and moves would the Lions have? It is almost certain they would all be Normal type, and have access to many Normal and Dark type moves such as Crunch, Body Slam, Roar, etc. I took five of the most similar Pokemon I could think of (Pyroar, Solgaleo, Raikou, Flareon, and Stoutland) and found the average stat set of Hp/Att/Def/Sp.A/Sp.d/Spe to be 93/112/81/95/93/93 for a final total of 567 and average of 94.5. \n\nIn terms of viable abilities taken from these 5 we could have Intimidate, Scrappy, Rivalry, Unnerve, Moxie, Guts, and Inner Focus. Seeing as we have a billion Lions, it wouldn't be too unreasonable to assume that they are not all in fact the same species, seeing as there is not single environment they all could have been living in. Therefore their stats would vary slightly and their abilities may be pretty widespread, but would probably average to around these 7 abilities and 6 stats.\n\nNow we have to look at the aspects of the battle. Do moves like Earthquake hit every Pokemon on the field, providing the move would need to be the size of Switzerland? I very much doubt it. A real Earthquake easily could reach that size, but is probably very dissimilar to what actually happens during the Pokemon move version of Earthquake which seems to be an intense local event that can OHKO legendary beasts (that are weak to it), rather than shaking a very large area for a period of time.\nI would say the same goes for all abilities such as Intimidate, with them affecting only those within reasonable distance. \n\nNow comes down to the battle. Considering the sheer numbers involved, it would make most sense for the Lions to be facing the Pokemon rather than unfairly surrounding them. Either way, each Pokemon would have to take down around one million Lions each on average. There are certainly no combinations of moves that give each Pokemon enough PP to be able to target this many, including PP Ups, and reasonable coverage by moves such as Earthquake and Hurricane.\n\nIn terms of stats, there are actually very few Pokemon that can OHKO the lions. Maxed nature, EVs and IVs Pokemon vs 1 single 0 IV, nature and 0 EV Lion with Intimidate, only Pheromosa, Deoxys-A, Lunala, Lucario, Mewtwo, Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, Xerneas, and Buzzwole can OHKO, and only with single-target moves. The highest area damage attack we can get is from Excadrill maxed for attack, and even then is only a guaranteed 2HKO vs 0 nature, IV, and EV. While the Pokemon could certainly slaughter large swaths of Lions, they would hardly dent the sheer number of them. Excadrill could no way reach the average of one million with an Earthquake, which would still only be a 2HKO at most.\n\nIgnoring battle rules such as PP, Speed, and turn taking, the Pokemon will still have it very difficult. The sheer amount of energy required to defeat one billion total lions would no way be achievable by around 800 Pokemon. \n\nBut that is all considering the Lions just stand there and take it on the chin. Around 0.1% of the lions only need to inflict 1hp of damage each to defeat the Pokemon. This means the Lions have enough power to kill the Pokemon 100 times over if they can only inflict 1hp of damage each.\n\n0.00008% of the Lions can each use Roar/Whirlwind to blow away the entire army of Pokemon. I'm sure if every Lion did it they could blow them into the Sun.\n\nIf Lions are waiting in the backlines in formation until they are at the front lines, they can all very easily and safely boost all their stats with Agility, Hone Claws, etc. while the Pokemon fight for their lives. The time it'd take for all the Lions to be wiped out, then they've already bred more numbers of them.\n\nLions stomp hand down in battle rules, even if my stats, abilities, moves etc. are off.\n\nOk, so what about in an environment not constrained by battle rules entirely? I did initially think that the Pokemon would have this easy but one billion Lions is very unfeasible. Regular Pokemon would simply be overwhelmed very quickly leaving only legendaries and very powerful regulars behind. If this number reaches around 80 then each of these Pokemon needs to defeat around 12.5 million each. Even with Dialga and Celebi warping time, Giratina and Palkia distorting Space, Groudon and Kyogre wreaking havoc with the weather, Jirachi and Cresselia healing allies, etc. They would never be able to do each of these things powerfully enough and for the required duration of time to fend off every single Lion. Even if a tiny fraction of these Lions use Counter and it's special equivalent then the Pokemon are done for.\n\nThe only conceivable ways I can see the Pokemon winning is either using Cryoganal as a giant magnifying glass to Uxie's eyes and Shedinja's back and every psychic Pokemon channelling those images, sacrificing those involved in the process. Or Palkia and Giratina warping their entire army to a different dimension, where Arceus can hatch new Pokemon specifically designed to defeat the Lions, while Celebi and Dialga alternate between speeding their dimension up to level up and breed the new 'mons, and slowing the Lion dimension down to hinder their progress doing the same but naturally. Then several million years later the billions of Pokemon comeback and curb stomp the trillions of Lions.\n\nOh god what am I even doing with my life\n\ntl;dr: One billion is an absurdly large number compared to 800, no matter how wonky my maths is.
