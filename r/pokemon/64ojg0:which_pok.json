I had pokemon XD, where I conquered the darkness with my espeon, shiftry, and snorlax (once I got it, since he's late game). I had a leaf green cartridge where, not knowing about the gym order at all, I picked the guy on the cover: Venusaur. I more or less solo'd the game with him (losing to Agatha SO MANY FREAKING TIMES. Lance was probably tough too, but I don't feel like it's as memorable as how many times I lost to the golbats/gengar). I also got my bronze crabby in that game, something my brother was sure was an ordinary crabby, but I, not noticing the stars at the start, noticed he didn't look normal. I caught my first shiny. Finally, I had a copy of pearl. As much as I liked turtwig, I picked chimchar. The little guy grew into my first level 100 pokemon (Venusaur getting there shortly after.) Fast forward a bit, from 2008 to 2014, I didn't play pokemon at all; in fact, I sold my pearl and leaf green cartridge on E-Bay in a bundle, XD/Colosseum (which I didn't discuss since I was about 1/2 through and hardly remember it) were sold in a garage sale with my gamecube (As a now melee/PM player, this was a *double* stupid idea). Fast forward to 2014. I hear something about an online fan game called pokemmo. I give it a shot and realized pokemon was much more than I ever thought, introducing me to the more competitve aspects of the game. I played pearl/leaf green through emulation as well and thought \"you know, I miss my old pokemon...\" BUT WAIT! I still had my pokemon ranch on my homebrewed wii, where my pokemon from my pearl cartridge were safely stored! So 2015 rolls around, I'm graduating, and I played Smash with my younger brother ALL THE TIME (Pokemon, Zelda BotW, and various smash games are all that I play anymore), and I can't just get another wii u. So what do I do? I buy a refurbished 3DS to practice on (contrary to popular belief, you can in fact learn stuff from the 3ds such as autocancels and combos as well as have fun), on which I also buy pokemon X (because I was naive and thought there was no way they'd leave out move tutors). So then I thought: I have REAL hardware now... I'm going to extract my ranch save file and rescue my old venusaur and espeon! Now, unlike the main pokemon games, there aren't great save editors for this game. There's one that wouldn't even open my save file. Still determined, I open up a HEX editor-- something I kinda know how to use thanks to my background as a SSBB and Sonic Adventure DX hacker, \"knowing\" that the data in ranch should closely match that of DP (Knowing now that XD/Colo are INCREDIBLY different from FRLG/RSE, this was also a little naive. I feel lucky though, as it is pretty much the same. There's a part at the beginning of the pokemon's data that I think states the uploader, then the mon's data, then the next mon is listed in the same manner). Now, my older brother also played pokemon, so his stuff was on there, too. That means I had to sift through *720-something pokemon* It seemed a little daunting, to be honest, but I had a plan. I can't remember exactly what I did, but I believe it was something along the lines of this:\n\nI isolated the pokemon data into a new file and used the hex editor to remove every instance of the uploader data. This way it left only the data that could be read by pokesav. But it was still one file. I needed ALL of the pokemon's data in independent files to make pokesav read it. So I searched up on ways to do this and found a way to split it into 720-something equal parts and started to drag and drop files into pokesav, searching for my venusaur and espeon.\n\n...and I didn't find them. They were gone. Did I leave them on my XD save, something I long since deleted? Depressed, I continued looking through, now more closely at things that weren't espeons and venusaurs, seeing if I can AT LEAST salvage things from my pearl save. I found my infernape, which made me happy at least. Then I found my shiny kingler (which I suspected I had on my XD save, as I loved seeing him in 3D, probably along with Venusar). My Snorlax was there, along with several other mon's from LG and XD. I then waited. You see, there wasn't a way then for me to get homebrew on my 3DS and I'm not sure if PKHEX could go from 4 to 6 immediately, so I needed a way to get them to a gen V game. Which I didn't own. Buuuut... my older brother, who had gotten back into pokemon before I did, had a copy of black and white as well as a normal 3ds and Action replay. Using the cheating device, I made a code to with Pokesav to inject my pokemon into his boxes (along with some of his own such as his vaporeon from XD and sceptile from Emerald, which I did for him in return. Still a bit jealous that he could reclaim his first starters). They weren't my favorites at the time, but I treasure everything I found and returned from that save file after all that work to get them back. I miss my Venusaur and Espeon, but I value my Infernape, Snorlax, Shiftry, and all the other pokemon that got a Kanto Championship ribbon for doing absolutely nothing except maybe take a flamethrower (Vaporeon; Rapidash with run away; Sandslash from victory road, Machoke from victory road, and Kabutops) a whole lot more. Even the less memorable ones from XD and LG that I caught and never really used have a special place in my heart now. Long live Zaprong.\n\nNowadays, while most have a suboptimal nature, I have hyper trained a few and plan to hypertrain more of them... because why not use a Bold AV Kingler with scald.

Thinking back, I think it was because I was progressing with the storyline while training it up, so I actually felt more and more attached to it.
