I can really only dream though.\n\n\n1) I would get rid of IVs. I still like the idea of EV training and natures, that allows a lot of customization and optimization. Plus they already have easy ways to get proper natures and they've made EV training a peace of cake with SOS and horde battles.\n\nBut IVs, I spend 30 minutes breeding a perfect Pok\u00e9mon (and that's after the hours I've already spent on the set up) just to be competitive. Why the hell does the entry bar for competitive play have to be so high when it really offers nothing? \n\nYou want 31 in every stat 95% of the time. Trick Room users benefit greatly from 0 in speed, but it wouldn't matter if they had 0 IVs in speed if there were no IVs. They would be just as slow as other Trick Room users.\n\nAnd Special Attackers gain marginal benefit from 0 Attack IVs because they take less damage from Confused status and Foul Play. But, seriously, that's marginal.\n\nHaving to worry about IVs makes the bar for competitive play so insanely high it's nuts. It's not even fun. Trust me, I do enjoy min/maxing. I love the chains of breeding moves onto Pok\u00e9mon and getting the right nature set up. Speccing out EVs so that I have just the right speed to outspeed my threats, just enough defense to survive a hit from my counters, while still being offensive enough to OHKO what I need. That stuff is fun to me and adds a lot of depth to the game. Adding 4 defense EVs to my Arcanine can allow him to survive a Garchomp Earthquake 100% of the time instead of 90% of the time, and I think that's awesome.\n\nIVs are just not fun. 95% of the time you just have to grind out perfect. It doesn't add depth, it's literally just pointless grinding. I'll admit it does add a little \"realism\" in that some Pok\u00e9mon are just \"naturally\" better than others, but man I don't think that's worth the price.\n\nAs for Hidden Power typing, I would either utilize stuff like the Mossy/Icy rocks and areas of electromagnetism and say if you teach your Pok\u00e9mon Hidden Power by the Icy Rock, you get HP: Ice. If you do it at the Pok\u00e9mon cemetery, you get HP: Ghost. etc. Or just allow you to select from a drop down.\n\n2) I would add in some real online capabilities. A lot of people want the PSS back, and sure, I'll agree to that. But I want some freaking Pok\u00e9mon showdown style battle rooms too. \n\nIt's crap that the only method of Singles online battle is 3v3. The whole game is about 6v6! I don't think you have too get rid of the 3v3, it serves a purpose, it's different and fun and a lot of people enjoy it. But give us 6v6 online! \n\nHow about VGC? I know Battle Spot Doubles is nearly the same, but why not give us an actual forced VGC style room to play in in addition to Battle Spot Doubles. Hell, maybe even introduce a 2v2 or 6v6 doubles mode, I don't know.\n\nNow, this next bit is really pie in the sky, but I'd love to see some endorsement of Smogon tiers as well. However, I want a caveat on it. I think Smogon, in theory, is fantastic. I love what they do for the game. In practice, I think it's kinda shit. \n\nFor anybody who plays League, can you imagine if /r/leagueoflegends was in charge of balance? And how awful it would be if a bunch of normal players with zero game design or game balance experience got to be the final word on what happened in the game? Because that's what Smogon is to me; a bunch of very skilled Pok\u00e9mon players calling all the shots but having no game balance skills.\n\nGranted, I think their balance is better than Gamefreaks currently (Hello Xerneas, hello CHALK, hello Mega Rayquaza), but I think that is easily solved by hiring the right people. In my head, it would be some of the most prominent competitive Pok\u00e9mon gamers (Ray Rizzo and Aaron Zheng for VGC, maybe grab some people from Smogon too) combined with people in the video game industry that have actual game balance experience, and create something similar to tiers and rules for online Pok\u00e9mon play. \n\n3) I think I'm going to have to agree with everyone that Ice type needs a buff. For starters, have Hail raise Defense of all Ice type Pokemon or something. Or drop speed of all non Ice types. \n\nAs for the type itself...I think if you dropped its Rock and Steel weaknesses it would be good enough to use. Particularly Rock. I know a lot of people say resisting Water and while I see some merit, I think Ice's biggest problem is being weak to so many good offensive types. Ice types don't really struggle against Water types right now other than being walled by them, but the fact that they die to Rock Slide/Stone Edge kills them. Steel is also a pretty good attacking type since Heavy Slam and Gyro Ball are so good to put on tanks and Bullet Punch is a pretty good Priority move. So I think if you drop those it gives Ice a lot more viability.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh man do I have some ideas for Pok\u00e9mon.

If you do it at the Pok\u00e9mon cemetery, you get HP: Ghost. etc. Or just allow you to select from a drop down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) I would add in some real online capabilities. A lot of people want the PSS back, and sure, I&amp;#39;ll agree to that. But I want some freaking Pok\u00e9mon showdown style battle rooms too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s crap that the only method of Singles online battle is 3v3. The whole game is about 6v6! I don&amp;#39;t think you have too get rid of the 3v3, it serves a purpose, it&amp;#39;s different and fun and a lot of people enjoy it. But give us 6v6 online! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about VGC? I know Battle Spot Doubles is nearly the same, but why not give us an actual forced VGC style room to play in in addition to Battle Spot Doubles. Hell, maybe even introduce a 2v2 or 6v6 doubles mode, I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, this next bit is really pie in the sky, but I&amp;#39;d love to see some endorsement of Smogon tiers as well. However, I want a caveat on it. I think Smogon, in theory, is fantastic. I love what they do for the game. In practice, I think it&amp;#39;s kinda shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For anybody who plays League, can you imagine if &lt;a href=\"/r/leagueoflegends\"&gt;/r/leagueoflegends&lt;/a&gt; was in charge of balance? And how awful it would be if a bunch of normal players with zero game design or game balance experience got to be the final word on what happened in the game? Because that&amp;#39;s what Smogon is to me; a bunch of very skilled Pok\u00e9mon players calling all the shots but having no game balance skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Granted, I think their balance is better than Gamefreaks currently (Hello Xerneas, hello CHALK, hello Mega Rayquaza), but I think that is easily solved by hiring the right people. In my head, it would be some of the most prominent competitive Pok\u00e9mon gamers (Ray Rizzo and Aaron Zheng for VGC, maybe grab some people from Smogon too) combined with people in the video game industry that have actual game balance experience, and create something similar to tiers and rules for online Pok\u00e9mon play. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) I think I&amp;#39;m going to have to agree with everyone that Ice type needs a buff. For starters, have Hail raise Defense of all Ice type Pokemon or something. Or drop speed of all non Ice types. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the type itself...I think if you dropped its Rock and Steel weaknesses it would be good enough to use. Particularly Rock. I know a lot of people say resisting Water and while I see some merit, I think Ice&amp;#39;s biggest problem is being weak to so many good offensive types. Ice types don&amp;#39;t really struggle against Water types right now other than being walled by them, but the fact that they die to Rock Slide/Stone Edge kills them. Steel is also a pretty good attacking type since Heavy Slam and Gyro Ball are so good to put on tanks and Bullet Punch is a pretty good Priority move. So I think if you drop those it gives Ice a lot more viability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pokemon", "name": "t1_dg7yysb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492136271.0, "created_utc": 1492107471.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6553xj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6553xj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7z9x0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AldroVanda", "parent_id": "t1_dg7nni2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Really, their decision to axe successful mechanics at all is pretty stupid.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really, their decision to axe successful mechanics at all is pretty stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pokemon", "name": "t1_dg7z9x0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492136596.0, "created_utc": 1492107796.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7nni2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kingfin128", "parent_id": "t3_6553xj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Bring back the VS Seeker!

However, I do see your point about Eevee uniquely representing multiple evolution methods.  \n\nAs a compromise, maybe Eevee can be changed to instead evolve into Espeon/Umbreon when a Sun Stone/Moon Stone is used during the daytime/nighttime (originally I had this as \"level up while Stone is held during daytime/nighttime\", but I feel like evolution via stone should be by direct exposure from the Pok\u00e9mon Trainer, even though I guess the act of \"holding a Stone\" should essentially count as the same thing as \"using a Stone on a Pok\u00e9mon from the Bag\" for exposure purposes.. -.-), which semi-preserves the original temporal evolution method (I guess this way, Eevee gets a \"double\" dose of energy for evolution..?).  \n\nAs for Leafeon and Glaceon, their evolution method can be modified to \"evolve when a Leaf Stone/Ice Stone is used on them within the vicinity of Moss Rock/Ice Rock\" rather than requiring a level-up (although if Ice Stone alone is sufficient for Alola's Ice-Ninetales and Alola's Ice-Sandslash, I feel like it should be the same for Glaceon, especially since Ice Rock makes more sense for Ninetales and Sandslash since their changes are environmentally-induced, whereas Eevee has been evolving via Stones since day 1 of the franchise).  Also, I guess this would help cut down evolution conflicts for Eevee.\n\nAs for Sylveon, I feel like it doesn't really need a change since it dually showcases the \"level up (..while knowing a certain move)\" concept and the Affection mechanic, plus there is no clear \"Fairy\"-aligned Stone; if it had to receive a Stone, I would probably make it hold the Dawn Stone/Awakening Stone as a requirement, since that seems less elementally-inclined compared to the other elemental stones (you could argue that it's light-inclined, although I feel like the Shiny Stone/Light Stone is a better fit for light/even *more* light-inclined).\n\nSo then 7 Eeveelutions evolve via Stone exposure, and the 8th one is just quirky - Flareon, Vaporeon, and Jolteon with just a Stone requirement; Espeon and Umbreon with a Stone+Happiness+time requirement; Leafeon and Glaceon with a Stone+location requirement; and Sylveon with a level+move+Affection requirement.  Consequently, more of the older elemental Stones see sensible use and multiple evolution methods are represented (item usage, standard level advancement, Happiness level, time of day, specific location, move presence, Affection level).\n\n*This is a side-note, but I would probably reserve the \"evolve when the user is traded while the user is holding a specific item\" method for a future Eeveelution, especially since I feel like there are not many evolutionary mechanics left that Eevee can borrow without seeming really forced (Sylveon's evolutionary method seems like a clone of Espeon/Umbreon without the Fairy-move requirement and essentially using 'Happiness/Friendship under a different name', and Inkay/Malamar have the gimmick of the Nintendo 3DS being inverted).\n\nEDIT: Forgot about Feebas evolving into Milotic via maximum Beauty-category condition or via level-up or getting traded while holding a Prism Scale.  So alternatively, future Pok\u00e9mon games could just retcon things and let Eevee evolve into Espeon/Umbreon either when exposed to a Sun Stone/Moon Stone or while leveled up in the daytime/nighttime with high Happiness.  Then Eevee can evolve into Leafeon/Glaceon with either exposure to a Leaf Stone/Ice Stone or leveling up when present in the vicinity of a Moss Rock/Ice Rock, and Sylveon can remain unchanged.  I mean, Eevee's canon is already a mess (I mean, it's daytime or nighttime in *Pok\u00e9mon FireRed/LeafGreen* (with daytime being more likely), so surely Eevee could have evolved into at least one of Espeon or Umbreon rather than both evolutions being disabled), so we might as well fix what we can in the future. &gt;_&gt;\n\n----\n\nAgreed with you on the Nidoran front..
