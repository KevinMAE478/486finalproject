There was a great comment in the original post that went more in detail about the difference between new and old Pok\u00e9mon designs, and it really made it clear why the different eyes are important. The basic summary of it is that in the older games you usually have cute animals evolve into intimating (but not necessarily scary) monsters, whereas the new games have cute animals evolving into humanoid creatures. The eyes are just the easiest detail to pinpoint. \n\n\nThe perfect example of this is the starters. All of the starters start out as little cute animals, but the way they evolved has changed over time. Looking at the fire starters from the first two gens you have a cute lizard and a cute mouse/porcupine/echidna thing. They eventually evolve into a big intimating dragon and a big intimating mouse/porcupine/echidna thing. Third gen was a turning point though, as you have a little chicken evolve into something that's more human than chicken. Every fire starter since then has been more humanoid than animal, with the latest two looking just like humans with animal masks.

There was a great comment in the original post that went more in detail about the difference between new and old Pok\u00e9mon designs, and it really made it clear why the different eyes are important. The basic summary of it is that in the older games you usually have cute animals evolve into intimating (but not necessarily scary) monsters, whereas the new games have cute animals evolving into humanoid creatures. The eyes are just the easiest detail to pinpoint. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The perfect example of this is the starters. All of the starters start out as little cute animals, but the way they evolved has changed over time. Looking at the fire starters from the first two gens you have a cute lizard and a cute mouse/porcupine/echidna thing. They eventually evolve into a big intimating dragon and a big intimating mouse/porcupine/echidna thing. Third gen was a turning point though, as you have a little chicken evolve into something that&amp;#39;s more human than chicken.

But for all of the complaints talking about cherry-picking, I do see logic in this and it's actually a pretty neat observation, and I'll explain my thoughts on this specifically a bit later!\n\nBut actually, I wrote a post a while back on my own thoughts on the difference between old and new Pok\u00e9mon, and since it's relevant here, this is what I came up with:\n\n&gt; [...] I wouldn't say simple (a common complaint is that they're \"running out of ideas and starting to overdesign,\" and, indeed, I do see some shift in complexity), but they're more visibly made of basic shapes, and \"segmented\" in some ways obvious and some ways subtle.\n\n&gt; This is a design choice I really like, and one of my favorite things about all of the spinoffs, manga and anime seasons is seeing how all of the older designs grow. Pikachu, for example... if you look at, say, Bulbagarden Archives - alllll of the pictures of Pikachu - or even compare its sprites through the Generations - not just first Gen to now, because everyone knows first Gen sprites were very inaccurate, but just the gradual steps - you'll see that its design is actually quite different and has been adapted over time. As a matter of fact, I quite dislike its 3DS model for not really showing this, but as far as artwork (on Global Link, for instance), I really love its current design, especially its rounded head. Have you seen the first episode of Pok\u00e9mon Generations? That's my favorite design of Pikachu. I can say this because there's a difference between that representation and its Generation IV design and its Generation I design and its main anime design and its model in the 3DS games... you get the point. And amidst all of the people clamoring about how they miss the good old days with sprites because of the art style, here I am, missing the same sprites... not because of the art style, but because those changed every Generation, while the models stay the same and can't develop along with the designs any more.\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; I actually think it's because of the change in clarity - the shift to building off of basic shapes - that the \"new\" designs are so divisive. Everyone gasps at the ridiculous Genwunners neglecting that Grimer, the pile of sludge, is just as bad as Trubbish (actuallyIdokindoflikeTrubbishanyway). But I don't think that's the point - they don't think Generation I's designs are really creative, or really unique, but after studying all of the canon designs, I do have to concede that they're a lot more dynamic. Trubbish is clearly designed, well-structured and distinctly shaped; Grimer is more amorphous, and while it's a lot more bland, it still manages some amount of character just by reshaping itself.\nThere is a certain lack of clarity in Generation I's designs that seems to add to their charm for many. Something I've seen brought up a few times as part of the appeal of the oldest sprites: \"they left more to the imagination.\" I can certainly see this - that's not my preference, because I like the attentive, shape-oriented designs, but whether one likes it or not, it's actually pretty easy to see. Take Koffing, for example - its skull pattern changed position early on. Pidgeot - its tail changed several times in the first few Generations and I'm pretty sure nobody cared. Golbat - I don't even see that prominent tongue any more. Haunter - its hands have changed numbers of fingers in different sprites (... also, its entire design is different from in Generation I). There are a lot of things about the earliest designs that were just not important, and they were left vague and inconsistent, and you were free to reimagine them, and Game Freak was free to mess around with them, and a lot of people loved it. Indeed, \"they were left to the imagination.\"\n\n&gt; Some of Alola's designs have much more of a Generation I feeling to them. Salandit, for example, is clearly not as segmented or as detailed as newer designs, but quite flexible and lithe - it would fit in perfectly with Generation I's Poison-types, in my opinion. Mimikyu's shadowy points under its costume have little reason to be consistent or exact, and the face on its costume is clearly scribbled on; there's supposed to be variance in its case because different Mimikyu make different costumes. Popplio is incredibly fluid and you can draw it several different ways, and Drampa is really puffy, curvy and soft-edged. But there are also designs like the tapu, the Ultra Beasts, Decidueye, Mudsdale... These designs seem to fit in less with the \"good old days\" and are a lot more precise.\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; [The thread author to whom I was responding had mentioned liking Talonflame.] Talonflame is one of my personal less-preferred designs, because of its more squat shape, \"needless\" details like the wide spot marks on its wings, and the lack of clarity or precision in its flame markings (I adore Fletchling and Fletchinder because they don't have these things and are more basic-shape-oriented). But when I think of it all this way, is it just me, or would Talonflame be right at home chilling in Kanto with Pidgeot? In older Generations, I could totally see its spots skipping a game, its flame patterns changing up every so often, its proportions getting shuffled around just like any older design. [...]\n\nThere are certainly still exceptions to this as well, but I think the easiest way of noticing what I mean is looking at Generation V's animated sprites and seeing how newer and older designs look in comparison to one another. That's kind of the turning point for the designs anyway, both in my point and in these eye examples, so it's entirely possible that it's the cause?\n\nIn any case, it's not exactly easy to place one single difference that defines all old designs vs all new designs, because it's quite gradual. I actually really respect this observation anyway because it definitely holds some weight [(when looking for exceptions to cite on this list, I actually realized it held truer than I initially thought even if it's not all-inclusive)](http://macuarrorro.deviantart.com/art/All-Eyes-On-Us-382552613), and it's a really interesting point! But I don't think the eyes are what make the entire design feel wrong. There are also things like shapes, precision, or colors (since I didn't mention this above, a quick summary: new designs have more colors, while old designs simply couldn't due to technical limitations, and the shift from one or two colors on an \"elaborate, awesome\" Legendary to a *frequent* 4+ on a basic stage is quite apparent)... pretty much every aspect has evolved over time. I personally welcome the new designs and really appreciate how much effort and thought goes into them, but then again, I'm of the age range that began playing with Sinnoh and grew up right at the start of this development, so I can't exactly judge anyone who's more familiar with the older Generations and didn't *have* both sides of the start for being nostalgic and missing the old.\n\nOf course, we all have different opinions and we all deserve respect for them! I may welcome the change, and someone else might dislike it, and a third party might deny there's any change at all. They're all Pok\u00e9mon, and plenty of us are okay just enjoying the game and don't really care! XP But I think that if you're regularly getting into debates over this, whether on the side of the old or the new, it's important to see the difference and know *what* you're debating, not just to think one side is better without being able to put a finger on why (and, to be fair everyone does have different reasons for the belief, so my post probably doesn't work for someone else anyway); it's not all about creativity and \"trash versus sludge\" in *everyone's* minds!\n\n[Edit: I misclicked and deleted this; too easy to do that on mobile Reddit...

As a matter of fact, I quite dislike its 3DS model for not really showing this, but as far as artwork (on Global Link, for instance), I really love its current design, especially its rounded head. Have you seen the first episode of Pok\u00e9mon Generations? That&amp;#39;s my favorite design of Pikachu. I can say this because there&amp;#39;s a difference between that representation and its Generation IV design and its Generation I design and its main anime design and its model in the 3DS games... you get the point. And amidst all of the people clamoring about how they miss the good old days with sprites because of the art style, here I am, missing the same sprites... not because of the art style, but because those changed every Generation, while the models stay the same and can&amp;#39;t develop along with the designs any more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually think it&amp;#39;s because of the change in clarity - the shift to building off of basic shapes - that the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; designs are so divisive. Everyone gasps at the ridiculous Genwunners neglecting that Grimer, the pile of sludge, is just as bad as Trubbish (actuallyIdokindoflikeTrubbishanyway). But I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the point - they don&amp;#39;t think Generation I&amp;#39;s designs are really creative, or really unique, but after studying all of the canon designs, I do have to concede that they&amp;#39;re a lot more dynamic. Trubbish is clearly designed, well-structured and distinctly shaped; Grimer is more amorphous, and while it&amp;#39;s a lot more bland, it still manages some amount of character just by reshaping itself.\nThere is a certain lack of clarity in Generation I&amp;#39;s designs that seems to add to their charm for many. Something I&amp;#39;ve seen brought up a few times as part of the appeal of the oldest sprites: &amp;quot;they left more to the imagination.&amp;quot; I can certainly see this - that&amp;#39;s not my preference, because I like the attentive, shape-oriented designs, but whether one likes it or not, it&amp;#39;s actually pretty easy to see. Take Koffing, for example - its skull pattern changed position early on. Pidgeot - its tail changed several times in the first few Generations and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure nobody cared. Golbat - I don&amp;#39;t even see that prominent tongue any more. Haunter - its hands have changed numbers of fingers in different sprites (... also, its entire design is different from in Generation I). There are a lot of things about the earliest designs that were just not important, and they were left vague and inconsistent, and you were free to reimagine them, and Game Freak was free to mess around with them, and a lot of people loved it. Indeed, &amp;quot;they were left to the imagination.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of Alola&amp;#39;s designs have much more of a Generation I feeling to them. Salandit, for example, is clearly not as segmented or as detailed as newer designs, but quite flexible and lithe - it would fit in perfectly with Generation I&amp;#39;s Poison-types, in my opinion. Mimikyu&amp;#39;s shadowy points under its costume have little reason to be consistent or exact, and the face on its costume is clearly scribbled on; there&amp;#39;s supposed to be variance in its case because different Mimikyu make different costumes. Popplio is incredibly fluid and you can draw it several different ways, and Drampa is really puffy, curvy and soft-edged. But there are also designs like the tapu, the Ultra Beasts, Decidueye, Mudsdale... These designs seem to fit in less with the &amp;quot;good old days&amp;quot; and are a lot more precise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[The thread author to whom I was responding had mentioned liking Talonflame.] Talonflame is one of my personal less-preferred designs, because of its more squat shape, &amp;quot;needless&amp;quot; details like the wide spot marks on its wings, and the lack of clarity or precision in its flame markings (I adore Fletchling and Fletchinder because they don&amp;#39;t have these things and are more basic-shape-oriented). But when I think of it all this way, is it just me, or would Talonflame be right at home chilling in Kanto with Pidgeot? In older Generations, I could totally see its spots skipping a game, its flame patterns changing up every so often, its proportions getting shuffled around just like any older design. [...]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are certainly still exceptions to this as well, but I think the easiest way of noticing what I mean is looking at Generation V&amp;#39;s animated sprites and seeing how newer and older designs look in comparison to one another. That&amp;#39;s kind of the turning point for the designs anyway, both in my point and in these eye examples, so it&amp;#39;s entirely possible that it&amp;#39;s the cause?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any case, it&amp;#39;s not exactly easy to place one single difference that defines all old designs vs all new designs, because it&amp;#39;s quite gradual. I actually really respect this observation anyway because it definitely holds some weight &lt;a href=\"http://macuarrorro.deviantart.com/art/All-Eyes-On-Us-382552613\"&gt;(when looking for exceptions to cite on this list, I actually realized it held truer than I initially thought even if it&amp;#39;s not all-inclusive)&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;#39;s a really interesting point! But I don&amp;#39;t think the eyes are what make the entire design feel wrong. There are also things like shapes, precision, or colors (since I didn&amp;#39;t mention this above, a quick summary: new designs have more colors, while old designs simply couldn&amp;#39;t due to technical limitations, and the shift from one or two colors on an &amp;quot;elaborate, awesome&amp;quot; Legendary to a &lt;em&gt;frequent&lt;/em&gt; 4+ on a basic stage is quite apparent)... pretty much every aspect has evolved over time. I personally welcome the new designs and really appreciate how much effort and thought goes into them, but then again, I&amp;#39;m of the age range that began playing with Sinnoh and grew up right at the start of this development, so I can&amp;#39;t exactly judge anyone who&amp;#39;s more familiar with the older Generations and didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; both sides of the start for being nostalgic and missing the old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, we all have different opinions and we all deserve respect for them! I may welcome the change, and someone else might dislike it, and a third party might deny there&amp;#39;s any change at all. They&amp;#39;re all Pok\u00e9mon, and plenty of us are okay just enjoying the game and don&amp;#39;t really care! XP But I think that if you&amp;#39;re regularly getting into debates over this, whether on the side of the old or the new, it&amp;#39;s important to see the difference and know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;re debating, not just to think one side is better without being able to put a finger on why (and, to be fair everyone does have different reasons for the belief, so my post probably doesn&amp;#39;t work for someone else anyway); it&amp;#39;s not all about creativity and &amp;quot;trash versus sludge&amp;quot; in &lt;em&gt;everyone&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; minds!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[Edit: I misclicked and deleted this; too easy to do that on mobile Reddit...
