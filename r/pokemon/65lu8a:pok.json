My explanation for this is that like numerous other Pokemon in Alola, Chansey isn&amp;#39;t really a native pokemon - and the SOS battle chance proves it, but unlike others that have either evolved to adapt, Chansey isn&amp;#39;t doing so hot. However, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be that bad as it helps baby pokemon thrive and Happiny, which is usually only bred or caught in select reserves, also could be caught if their friend is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So... Chansey is a Sinnoh native, unless a new region where Chansey has a higher percentage to be found is made and it&amp;#39;s not a reserve or anything similar.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pokemon", "name": "t1_dgbihnn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492336481.0, "created_utc": 1492307681.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lu8a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmeb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lu8a", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbrjvv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CountScarlioni", "parent_id": "t1_dgbq5jk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Regigigas: originally found in Hoenn, but sealed in Sinnoh.
