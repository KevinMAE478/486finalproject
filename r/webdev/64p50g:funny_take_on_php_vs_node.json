As I gained more experience I started to realize just how bad this is, and to top it off I&amp;#39;m about to start a new project that&amp;#39;s very important to me. This new project deals with a lot of data and a lot of times I find myself wanting to update multiple types of models at a time because they depend on each other but mongoose has zero support for transactions which worries me a lot.  I&amp;#39;d like to switch to SQL like Postgres but I&amp;#39;m not familiar with the syntax, libraries like bookshelf or knex, and I&amp;#39;d also be losing the existing code and knowledge I have with mongoose for things like validation, pre-save / post-save hooks etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand some basic relational concepts like joins but the thought of switching worries me even though I know it&amp;#39;s probably the right thing to do. Could you offer any advice? I&amp;#39;m a quick learner, but currently have a lot on my plate and worried I&amp;#39;ll take on more than I could handle. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "webdev", "name": "t1_dg573z3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491986237.0, "created_utc": 1491957437.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64p50g", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64p50g", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5j1oj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lostpx", "parent_id": "t1_dg43w7l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/webdev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for the url.
