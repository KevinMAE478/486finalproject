Having many screens allows me to focus on the work and not moving between programs. If you can't teach yourself to not leave Facebook open on one screen, you might have bigger problems.\n\nIf you don't have the monitors arranged to keep them a pretty uniform distance from you (roughly a semi-circle), the outside edges are harder to read/use. On three 27\" monitors, I found pulled content on which I really needed to focus away from the outer edges. I also zoomed on content more with three screens, but the overall benefit of the additional real estate was worth it.\n\nFor me, head turning wasn't really the problem. Neck strain seemed to be more prominent in two monitors because one will naturally be the primary and the other off to one side... otherwise the resting position is staring at the bezel between the useful space. That leads to holding your head to one side for a long time to use your second screen. \n\nThree monitors helped with that. `:)`\n\nEmail tends to be a \"second screen\" application, so you can spend a long time with your head turned if you focus on something that is usually a side task.

I have 3 27&amp;quot; 2560x1440 monitors, and the Mac&amp;#39;s screen itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were in a &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; shape with the three monitors on a rail and the Mac centered, below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Left: Testing \u2013 mostly browser and debugger, sometimes test VMs&lt;br/&gt;\nCenter: Work \u2013 Mostly my editor, sometimes also terminals and files&lt;br/&gt;\nRight: Reference \u2013 tickets, docs, search, mockups \u2013 or meetings and screen share&lt;br/&gt;\nMac: Comms \u2013 chat and email \u2013 but sometimes files and terminals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having chat and email &lt;em&gt;below&lt;/em&gt; my main view was great to have it available but not interrupting. the Mac remained the screen which received notifications, which kept the communications isolated to that screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Opposition&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The argument I hear against multiple screens is distractions. Having many screens allows me to focus on the work and not moving between programs. If you can&amp;#39;t teach yourself to not leave Facebook open on one screen, you might have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have the monitors arranged to keep them a pretty uniform distance from you (roughly a semi-circle), the outside edges are harder to read/use. On three 27&amp;quot; monitors, I found pulled content on which I really needed to focus away from the outer edges. I also zoomed on content more with three screens, but the overall benefit of the additional real estate was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, head turning wasn&amp;#39;t really the problem. Neck strain seemed to be more prominent in two monitors because one will naturally be the primary and the other off to one side... otherwise the resting position is staring at the bezel between the useful space. That leads to holding your head to one side for a long time to use your second screen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three monitors helped with that. &lt;code&gt;:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Email tends to be a &amp;quot;second screen&amp;quot; application, so you can spend a long time with your head turned if you focus on something that is usually a side task.

It gets quite annoying to make a change, alt tab, run a test, alt tab reload a browser window, alt tab check for a record in the database. Even having a second monitor lets you split your workflow in a way that you don&amp;#39;t have to alt-tab after every single action. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have four monitors and I could even find use for a 5th since I frequently find myself splitting my monitors into half screen applications. In my current setup I have 3 low and one high (similar to this GIS I found &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/c9LzjdD.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/c9LzjdD.jpg&lt;/a&gt; .) Lower middle is my IDE, right is my active browser. To the left is a combination of email, chat, notepad, and documentation. I use my top middle monitor for ssh connections/logs/terminals and database clients. Looking up isn&amp;#39;t too big of a deal because many times you&amp;#39;re really only looking at the bottom line on the monitor which is in peripheral vision at eye level. If I need to do any extended terminal or database work I&amp;#39;ll shift it to my primary monitor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only negative to a four monitor setup is it&amp;#39;s really easy to lose your mouse if you aren&amp;#39;t careful. I have a ping set up to draw attention to my mouse pointer on hotkey so it can quickly catch my attention if it&amp;#39;s not obvious where it&amp;#39;s at.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "webdev", "name": "t1_dg9jaud", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492223314.0, "created_utc": 1492194514.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dxzh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dxzh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dxzh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgabu5g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JWN-", "parent_id": "t1_dg9xcga", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/webdev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think it's more his mental picture of the screen.

Looking at a single screen when coding and not having to scroll as often is so awesome. Also, just to note,  I use a mac with retina and use an app to force osx to the native resolution. It doubles my realestate but a result, everything is smaller but doesn&amp;#39;t bother me in the slightest, especially if you have a 27&amp;quot; monitor or higher. I never have neck issues anymore. I highly recommend this setup. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "webdev", "name": "t1_dgah2nr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492275561.0, "created_utc": 1492246761.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dxzh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgahgcw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cueball61", "parent_id": "t3_65dxzh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/webdev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I write on my MacBook, view on my desktop (partially because I have yet to find a satisfactory solution to cleanly switching between display inputs on the fly, I'm not spending a few hundred on a device I then have to plug three or four things into when I have USB-C out of my laptop...)\n\nMy desktop usually have chrome, dev tools, maybe some reference stuff open on its two screens.
