I'll help you out a little.\n\n1. There's no need to have the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; in Codepen.  If you click the gear icon in the HTML tab, you will see options for adding external files.\n2. Since these elements will probably be used as a UI element, you should always use the semantically correct HTML tag.  To me, these are either buttons or links.  I would use &lt;button&gt; just so if people click them they aren't routed elsewhere.\n3. There's no need to have div in front of your selectors: div.orange goes to just .orange.  You will be using class selectors most often, so you are on the right path.\n4. Speaking of class selectors, they are great for keeping your CSS DRY.  I see you are repeating things often (margin, border, width, height, etc.).  Instead, put those properties into one rule set, and reuse that class.\n5. I would also practice with other Pseudo-classes.  If you use buttons, you also gain a tab index.  So you can use :focus like you would for :hover.
