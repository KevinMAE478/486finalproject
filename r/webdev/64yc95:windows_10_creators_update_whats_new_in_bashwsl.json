You could run an X server on the Win32 side and display everything from the unix side just fine. But because it had its own fingerprint, and was kind of its own hobbled incomplete Unix, it was a pain to compile things, and not everything worked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WSL is Microsoft going for (if I&amp;#39;m a conspiracy theorist...) &amp;quot;embrace, extend, &lt;del&gt;extinguish&lt;/del&gt; be the good guys, no really&amp;quot; and instead of trying to implement a fractional part of a dead Unix (sorry, netBSD, but, it&amp;#39;s time) and instead providing a nearly complete version of the Linux syscall library at the ABI level, that identifies itself as ubuntu, so you can install a large swath of precompiled Ubuntu software. So it&amp;#39;s the ultimate fulfillment of the hollow promises they made in 1992, when they said that Windows NT would run Windows 3.xx apps, Win32 apps, OS/2 apps, and &lt;strong&gt;Unix&lt;/strong&gt; apps. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d argue that Windows now does what OS X has pretended to do for years: be a Unix\u2122. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "webdev", "name": "t1_dg6gsid", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492056325.0, "created_utc": 1492027525.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 60}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yc95", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yc95", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6cta2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bch8", "parent_id": "t1_dg6b4dt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/webdev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you very much!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "webdev", "name": "t1_dg6cta2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492052229.0, "created_utc": 1492023429.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6b4dt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 28, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cwtdev", "parent_id": "t1_dg6aiy5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/webdev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's an implementation of Ubuntu bash on windows that lets you install and run a number of Linux binaries without the need for a virtual machine.
