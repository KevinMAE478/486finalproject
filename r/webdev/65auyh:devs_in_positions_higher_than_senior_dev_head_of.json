Not just meetings but collecting info from engineers, condensing it, checking the roadmap, and communicating it to non-engineers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The role responsibility shifts from being an individual contributor and writing/owning code to trusting your engineers to writing/owning the code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, a lot of engineers make the transition without having any mentor or a good mentor so they become a poor manager which typically requires another manager for them which bottlenecks communication. If you&amp;#39;re thinking that eventually you want to move to management (or want to know understand the bigger system as an engineer), here&amp;#39;s some content I recommend:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://softwareleadweekly.com/\"&gt;http://softwareleadweekly.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/managers-let-your-reports-fail-e409a096fccd\"&gt;https://medium.com/the-mission/managers-let-your-reports-fail-e409a096fccd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/unintuitive-things-i-ve-learned-about-management-f2c42d68604b\"&gt;https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/unintuitive-things-i-ve-learned-about-management-f2c42d68604b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should note that there are development oriented roles beyond senior dev (e.g. staff engineer, architect) as well as other directions to grow (e.g. expanding from a browser-only knowledge set to server-side, devops, design, or hardware). This is typically known as a T-shaped model or paint drip people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excerpt from Valve handbook on T-shaped model: &lt;a href=\"http://www.adammcfarland.com/2012/12/10/t-shaped-people/\"&gt;http://www.adammcfarland.com/2012/12/10/t-shaped-people/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/paint-drip-people/1226700000696195\"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/paint-drip-people/1226700000696195&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "webdev", "name": "t1_dg8x19f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492186056.0, "created_utc": 1492157256.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 37}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65auyh", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65auyh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8vr9p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 34, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mastermog", "parent_id": "t1_dg8v5xa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/webdev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So, more of a whip over carrot person I see", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, more of a whip over carrot person I see&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "webdev", "name": "t1_dg8vr9p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492182402.0, "created_utc": 1492153602.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 34}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8v5xa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 54, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BarelyRunning", "parent_id": "t3_65auyh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/webdev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Get back to work writing unit tests, peasant!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get back to work writing unit tests, peasant!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "webdev", "name": "t1_dg8v5xa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492180869.0, "created_utc": 1492152069.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 54}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65auyh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg976mu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Catalyzm", "parent_id": "t3_65auyh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/webdev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Generally after sr dev you pick a track, management or architect.
