GitHub is fast. Pages load much quicker than BitBucket. I remember reading a post about one of the DDOSes awhile back on GitHub's engineering blog and they have allocated 10x the bandwidth of their normal daily maximum, and when GitHub is not being DDOSed this translates into exceptionally fast loading times.\n2. BitBucket (on my hardware) loads the page, renders it, and then activates a bunch of Javascript stuff to mess the with the page again. This means that - on top of the page load time - I have to wait another ~1 second for the page to calm down before I can do anything. And I can't even anticipate where my cursor is going to go because the page gets moved around so much. And while 1 second isn't that much time, in the time I spend loading and clicking one thing on BitBucket I can have done 2 or 3 things on Github. And over time, each additional second adds up. I don't like spending time waiting for computers when I don't have to.\n3. I already pay for a GitHub account (well, really, a client of mine pays for it), which gives me unlimited private repos. That for me was really the death nell for BitBucket, because that was the only thing BitBucket had over GitHub.\n4. I can edit code right in my browser on GitHub. I use this if I'm doing a drive by pull request, usually to tweak some Markdown formatting for a project I don't have access to or to fix a typo. I haven't found similar functionality on BitBucket.\n5. GitHub lets me use a forwarding mail address, so something like iBlag@mail.users.github.com will get forwarded to me without me having to publish my address.\n6. Travis CI and Coveralls integration. I know that Travis was built specifically for GitHub and it isn't exactly a fair comparison, but the tools exist for GitHub and BitBucket doesn't seem to have equivalent functionality as far as I'm aware. And the ease of setup is unparalleled - flip a switch and add a `.travis.yml` file to your repo and you're done.\n7. Pull request and issue templates. Ever had a user create an issue like \"dont wrk.\" in its entirety? I have. GitHub lets you create issue and PR templates that users then get to fill out, so you can avoid playing twenty questions with them to get any useful information. Again, this isn't a huge deal, but it certainly saves me a lot of time so I don't have to keep ping ponging with that user while I ask for debug information.\n8. Saved replies. i have two saved replies that I have to use in almost every PR or issue that somebody opens: a primer on how to format their code with GitHub flavored markdown, and a terse-sounding one to tell people to fill out the issue template I have created because I'm not playing twenty questions with them all damn day.\n\nBasically, GitHub seems to actually give a shit about *me* and tries to make *my* life easier, and BitBucket just always seems to be like one of those early AOL users: it's just a \"me too!\" project that *might, someday* reach feature parity but will never really ever push the envelope or themselves innovate to make my life easier. Because at the end of the day, BitBucket only really exists for Atlassian to dogfood their code hosting with the coding community and it's one of many projects of theirs, whereas that's all GitHub ever does is host code. Kind of like how Bing search will never ever be as good as Google search - search is what Google frikkin' *does*, whereas Bing search is just another \"me too!\" project that won't ever be as good because it's just another Microsoft project amongst plenty of others, each one of which is fighting for its own money and attention, and Bing is simply *not* what Microsoft is all about.\n\nSo...why should I use an inferior tool when I don't have to?\n\nEdit: Oh, and another thing: the landing page for GitHub projects immediately dumps you into viewing the repository file metadata, so it's immediately useful when I'm trying to figure out when a project was last updated. It tells me the license of the project on the right of the top bar, it tells me the language makeup of the project (when I click it, but it's dynamic content not a page load), and the badge in the upper right tells me how many forks there are. So I can immediately see how updated a project is, how many other people are presumably using and developing the project, and whether or not I can use the project. Or to sum all of that up into a few abstract terms: I can immediately tell how **healthy** and **useful** the project is on the first page load, no additional page loads necessary. Can't do that on BitBucket - you have to click a few times to see what's going on there. And remember how GitHub is faster than BitBucket? Now that 1 second waiting time causes a project health check to take 5 clicks, 5 page loads, and 5 minutes instead of 5 seconds. So on top of being faster, GitHub tries to give me as much useful information as possible on the landing page so I can avoid further page loads.", "edited": 1492171450.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GitHub is fast. Pages load much quicker than BitBucket. I remember reading a post about one of the DDOSes awhile back on GitHub&amp;#39;s engineering blog and they have allocated 10x the bandwidth of their normal daily maximum, and when GitHub is not being DDOSed this translates into exceptionally fast loading times.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;BitBucket (on my hardware) loads the page, renders it, and then activates a bunch of Javascript stuff to mess the with the page again. This means that - on top of the page load time - I have to wait another ~1 second for the page to calm down before I can do anything. And I can&amp;#39;t even anticipate where my cursor is going to go because the page gets moved around so much. And while 1 second isn&amp;#39;t that much time, in the time I spend loading and clicking one thing on BitBucket I can have done 2 or 3 things on Github. And over time, each additional second adds up. I don&amp;#39;t like spending time waiting for computers when I don&amp;#39;t have to.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I already pay for a GitHub account (well, really, a client of mine pays for it), which gives me unlimited private repos. That for me was really the death nell for BitBucket, because that was the only thing BitBucket had over GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I can edit code right in my browser on GitHub. I use this if I&amp;#39;m doing a drive by pull request, usually to tweak some Markdown formatting for a project I don&amp;#39;t have access to or to fix a typo. I haven&amp;#39;t found similar functionality on BitBucket.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GitHub lets me use a forwarding mail address, so something like &lt;a href=\"mailto:iBlag@mail.users.github.com\"&gt;iBlag@mail.users.github.com&lt;/a&gt; will get forwarded to me without me having to publish my address.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Travis CI and Coveralls integration. I know that Travis was built specifically for GitHub and it isn&amp;#39;t exactly a fair comparison, but the tools exist for GitHub and BitBucket doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have equivalent functionality as far as I&amp;#39;m aware. And the ease of setup is unparalleled - flip a switch and add a &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file to your repo and you&amp;#39;re done.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pull request and issue templates.
