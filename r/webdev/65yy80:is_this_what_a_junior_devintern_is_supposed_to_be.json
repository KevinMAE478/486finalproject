But I am getting paid less than half of what a Hybrid developer would be making in my town. Most of those jobs, and the jobs for juniors mind you, start at $43k/yr, salaried, full-benefits. And as I mentioned before in an earlier comment, I&amp;#39;m not getting support from my boss. I.e. He doesn&amp;#39;t pair program, he doesn&amp;#39;t give me the specs he wants, he doesn&amp;#39;t tell me anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "webdev", "name": "t1_dged4xd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492503011.0, "created_utc": 1492474211.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgecupg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "flying_head", "parent_id": "t3_65yy80", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/webdev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This sounds a lot like how I got started in the industry.
