How many young women have to die because the State refuses to deport criminals who have been deported multiple times and been arrested for crimes? How many lives is that $180 Billion worth to you? None that's the truth. You can take your filthy money. I'll take protecting people's lives over any bribe.\n\nIf you want more immigration than change the law! You endanger everyone's lives when you promote people crossing the border illegally with nobody checking who they are and what their history is.\n\nI do not see how anyone can support illegal immigration. If you believe the system should allow for more immigration than you have the power to change the law through our democratic system.\n\nAlso plight? They came here of their own free will. I do not have a heart for some who breaks into my house and says I was told I could live here and you have to pay for it. Nobody forced them here.\n\nI have a heart for victims, people who didn't have a choice. I support giving the children, who didn't choose to break the law, a path to citizenship as they are guilty of nothing. \n\nFor those however who not only made the choice but then spent days, weeks, or months traveling then crossing the border? They had plenty of time to make their choice and knew what they would be walking into. They also have the choice every single day to go back to their native country. Nobody is keeping them here. We'll even pay for their flight or travel home.\n\nThey had the option to immigrate legally and chose instead to break in.\n\nMy heart are for those who were meet given a choice. For those who are real refugees that are running for their lives. Maybe from cartels? Maybe from hostile governments? Doesn't really matter as long as they came to the US because staying in their home country would have meant death or extreme harm. \n\nMy heart isn't for those who crossed illegally so they could make more $$$ to then send out of the US and to their home country. The US isn't the world's welfare bank. We have a large amount of debt and a huge problem with depressed wages, which is exacerbated by people (who are used to working for as little as $1 a day) willingly to work for any price no matter how below minimum wage it is.\n\nYou describe the daily threat of deportation but do you have the same feelings regarding criminals who fear arrest every day after they rob a house or commit fraud? Why should I feel pity for a criminal who willingly broke the law fearing the consequences they knew would be there?\n\nYou also describe lack of protections, meanwhile the constitution already guarantees many benefits to non-citizens that would never happen in a lot of countries such as free public education. They have many protections you are failing to mention as our constitution applies many of our rights to anyone in the US. The founders took care to phrase what rights were for citizens and what were for all persons. \n\nThey are NOT America's most vulnerable. That is a complete lie made for political purposes. America's most vulnerable are people such as the mentally impaired or disabled. People who cannot fend for themselves and require others to assist them to survive. Senior Citizens are another example as well when they are broke, have no family, and survive only on social security. They often taken advantaged of due to their failing health and minds. \n\nI do not consider men who are able to plan crossing the border illegally, cross the desert evading border agents, finding a place to live, finding a job willingly to look the other way on their status, then working day after day, and finally sending that money home to whatever relatives they have as Americans most vulnerable. They sound very capable to me, very capable in evading the law and very capable of going back home at any time.\n\nThey choose to stay here. We did not choose them that's after all why they broke the law. \n\nP.S. We do not gain \"immensely\" from their contributions.

The facts do not support illegal immigrants benefiting the US in any significant way. And they definitely do not benefit the US when they kill US citizens and/or run drugs. Because guess what? The jobs open to illegals are not many (under the hand farming jobs, cleaners, gardeners, dish washers, etc) and so a lot of the time they take up criminal enterprises such as drug running and dealing.", "edited": 1492277249.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You state $130 Billion BUT FAIL to mention how much they COST the state especially in their citizens lives. How many young women have to die because the State refuses to deport criminals who have been deported multiple times and been arrested for crimes? How many lives is that $180 Billion worth to you? None that&amp;#39;s the truth. You can take your filthy money. I&amp;#39;ll take protecting people&amp;#39;s lives over any bribe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want more immigration than change the law! You endanger everyone&amp;#39;s lives when you promote people crossing the border illegally with nobody checking who they are and what their history is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not see how anyone can support illegal immigration. If you believe the system should allow for more immigration than you have the power to change the law through our democratic system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also plight? They came here of their own free will. I do not have a heart for some who breaks into my house and says I was told I could live here and you have to pay for it. Nobody forced them here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a heart for victims, people who didn&amp;#39;t have a choice. I support giving the children, who didn&amp;#39;t choose to break the law, a path to citizenship as they are guilty of nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those however who not only made the choice but then spent days, weeks, or months traveling then crossing the border? They had plenty of time to make their choice and knew what they would be walking into. They also have the choice every single day to go back to their native country. Nobody is keeping them here. We&amp;#39;ll even pay for their flight or travel home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had the option to immigrate legally and chose instead to break in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart are for those who were meet given a choice. For those who are real refugees that are running for their lives. Maybe from cartels? Maybe from hostile governments? Doesn&amp;#39;t really matter as long as they came to the US because staying in their home country would have meant death or extreme harm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart isn&amp;#39;t for those who crossed illegally so they could make more $$$ to then send out of the US and to their home country. The US isn&amp;#39;t the world&amp;#39;s welfare bank. We have a large amount of debt and a huge problem with depressed wages, which is exacerbated by people (who are used to working for as little as $1 a day) willingly to work for any price no matter how below minimum wage it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You describe the daily threat of deportation but do you have the same feelings regarding criminals who fear arrest every day after they rob a house or commit fraud? Why should I feel pity for a criminal who willingly broke the law fearing the consequences they knew would be there?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also describe lack of protections, meanwhile the constitution already guarantees many benefits to non-citizens that would never happen in a lot of countries such as free public education. They have many protections you are failing to mention as our constitution applies many of our rights to anyone in the US. The founders took care to phrase what rights were for citizens and what were for all persons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are NOT America&amp;#39;s most vulnerable. That is a complete lie made for political purposes. America&amp;#39;s most vulnerable are people such as the mentally impaired or disabled. People who cannot fend for themselves and require others to assist them to survive. Senior Citizens are another example as well when they are broke, have no family, and survive only on social security. They often taken advantaged of due to their failing health and minds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not consider men who are able to plan crossing the border illegally, cross the desert evading border agents, finding a place to live, finding a job willingly to look the other way on their status, then working day after day, and finally sending that money home to whatever relatives they have as Americans most vulnerable. They sound very capable to me, very capable in evading the law and very capable of going back home at any time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They choose to stay here. We did not choose them that&amp;#39;s after all why they broke the law. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. We do not gain &amp;quot;immensely&amp;quot; from their contributions. If we are lucky we break even because for everything they put into the pot they also take out of it in things such as healthcare (aka emergency room), public schools, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a throwaway campaign statement meant to rally supporters.

You could work to improve yourself and make yourself more valuable but hey, it really is easier just to shit on a bunch of people who don&amp;#39;t have two pennies to rub together for warmth and can&amp;#39;t fight back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LosAngeles", "name": "t1_dgb65hu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492318915.0, "created_utc": 1492290115.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb5e46", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pliskin1999", "parent_id": "t1_dgb4wdp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LosAngeles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You are cheery picking history to suit your narrative.
