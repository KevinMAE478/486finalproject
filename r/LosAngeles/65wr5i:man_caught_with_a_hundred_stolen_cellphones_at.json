Police like the good press/optics of a big drug bust, and when they seize hundreds of pounds of bulk weed, the 'street value' (i.e. what these drugs would have sold for if they had been distributed\ndown to the street level dealer and sold) is WAY higher than the bulk price paid by by an upper level dealer.  It sounds better from a PR perspective to say \"We busted &amp; confiscated 100 lbs. of weed with the street value of 5 million dollars\"  rather than \"we confiscated 100 lbs. of weed with the bulk price of $1 million dollars.\"  Are they lying?  No.  Are they being disingenuous?  Maybe, but from a legal perspective, it doesn't matter because schedule 1 drug dealing penalties aren't based on the value of the drugs, but the amount (weight).  But a district attorney will still use that street value number to sway a jury when arguing his case for maximum impact, since his goal ( to some extent that of the police) is to secure the heaviest possible conviction.  \n\n \nIn the case of smart phones, we know the actual retail price.  So in the above example, retail price is of stolen phones $700 and as you stated, the street value is $75.  If the police bust someone with 10 stolen phones, the street value only gets them to a $750 theft charge.  Retail price gets them to a $7000 grand theft charge.  And in the case of theft, the value of the stolen property, not the amount/weight (like weed) is how the charges filed against a criminal are determined.  Since weed is illegal (until recently in certain places), there isn't a legal retail price on which a prosecutor would be be able to come up with a dollar value that is correct beyond a reasonable doubt.  So they use weight.\n\n\nAnd if the police recover 100 cell phones and decided to do a press conference like they do with drugs on the table for a big drug bust, which number---retail or street value, do you think they would use?  \"We recovered 100 stolen smartphone worth $70,000\"  vs. \"We recovered 100 stolen smart phones with a street value of $750.\"  Police gonna do what's best for police, and police look better in the public eye with the higher number in either of these examples.  \n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well since you deleted your comment while I was replying, here it is saved for posterity:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;wow that&amp;#39;s some heavily adjusted liberty on your part\npolice EVERYWHERE make huge &amp;quot;busts&amp;quot; based on the street value, including weighing the roots and shit of clones. be real&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not the one who claimed I was ok with someone robbing victims because they belong to a certain social group.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the street value thing, you seemed to be confusing 2 different crimes, as well as the police rational for putting the value of busts in &amp;#39;street value.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why are the police are motivated to use the term &amp;#39;street value&amp;#39; when assessing drug busts?
