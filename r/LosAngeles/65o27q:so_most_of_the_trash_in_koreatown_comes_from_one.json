How about this: Rat lungworm,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Rat lungworm is a parasitic nematode (Angiostrongylus cantonensis) that begins its life as an infection in rat\u2019s lungs, blood, and brains. From there, the rats defecate worm larvae that are spread to other creatures like snails, slugs, and freshwater shrimp. Humans might eat one of these infected hosts or they might eat produce that has had the worm transferred to it by a host.
