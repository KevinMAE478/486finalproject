These guys love crawling on the windows during the day and the window fly traps are perfect for catching them en masse, check this out: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/gH4VjnN.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/gH4VjnN.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That trap is three days old and within another week it&amp;#39;ll be almost covered and ready for a new one. They still fly around me a bit but this cuts down their numbers like nothing else. Look into it and if you get them, put them at the top of every window you have (they love to crawl towards the top of windows and you catch many more than putting them randomly in the middle).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LosAngeles", "name": "t1_dgatjs2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492301719.0, "created_utc": 1492272919.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qht0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hrh7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qht0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hrh7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qht0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hrh7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgagaiu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Armenoid", "parent_id": "t1_dgaecwf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LosAngeles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He said gnats, not Spurs ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said gnats, not Spurs &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LosAngeles", "name": "t1_dgagaiu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492273130.0, "created_utc": 1492244330.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qht0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hrh7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qht0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hrh7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaq04p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HelperBot_", "parent_id": "t1_dgaq00u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LosAngeles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus_gnat\n***\n^HelperBot ^v1.1 ^/r/HelperBot_ ^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Please ^message ^/u/swim1929 ^with ^any ^feedback ^and/or ^hate. ^Counter: ^56368", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Mobile link: &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus_gnat\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus_gnat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;HelperBot&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;v1.1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/HelperBot_\"&gt;/r/HelperBot_&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;am&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;bot.&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Please&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;message&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/swim1929\"&gt;/u/swim1929&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;with&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;any&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;feedback&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;and/or&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;hate.&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Counter:&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;56368&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LosAngeles", "name": "t1_dgaq04p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492296678.0, "created_utc": 1492267878.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaq00u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sleeper_town", "parent_id": "t1_dgaecwf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LosAngeles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They're likely Fungus Gnats.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus_gnat", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re likely Fungus Gnats.\n&lt;a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus_gnat\"&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus_gnat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "LosAngeles", "name": "t1_dgaq00u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492296672.0, "created_utc": 1492267872.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qht0", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hrh7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaq19q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aesche", "parent_id": "t1_dgaecwf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LosAngeles", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They may be a species of hoverfly.
