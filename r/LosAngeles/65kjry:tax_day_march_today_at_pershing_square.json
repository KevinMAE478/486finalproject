Must be Obama. Or his surrogates in the military (which is pretty anti-Obama btw). Or using the biggest non-nuclear bomb in the US arsenal on a small group of ISIS in the back country of Afghanistan. Or 59 tomahawk missiles against one airbase. Over kill seems to be the only strategy here. \n\nI'm really not against war per se, I'm a Marine combat vet, but war needs a strategy and an end game. Some kind of plan. Which I've seen no sign of yet. Just \"bomb the shit out of ISIS\" or I guess anyone else that pisses Trump off. \n\nI am most certainly against all this endless war to no purpose. I was for Bush going after al Queda in Afghanistan, but when he went after Hussein with no particular purpose, yeah, that was bullshit, and I was against all of that, and I agree in wishing that Obama did a better job of getting us out of all that. Although blaming it all on him is kind of ridiculous. Just because you don't like the guy doesn't mean everything is all his fault. At least blame the right people. \n\nI agree that we should give him some time. My timeline to my alt-right friends was this summer. That should give him time to get his feet under him. Problem I have is that I see no direction. I see no sign of a coherent over all plan. So far he seems to be wholly reactive. Of course, I'm only seeing what I can see, which aint much admittedly. Maybe there is some kind of subtle planning going on. I don't know. All I can see so far though is destruction: destroy regulation, destroy agencies that protect the environment, that regulate commerce, that aid the poor and elderly, that aid countries outside of the US,  that gather revenue to run the government with taxation.

Or his surrogates in the military (which is pretty anti-Obama btw). Or using the biggest non-nuclear bomb in the US arsenal on a small group of ISIS in the back country of Afghanistan. Or 59 tomahawk missiles against one airbase. Over kill seems to be the only strategy here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really not against war per se, I&amp;#39;m a Marine combat vet, but war needs a strategy and an end game.

Just &amp;quot;bomb the shit out of ISIS&amp;quot; or I guess anyone else that pisses Trump off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am most certainly against all this endless war to no purpose. I was for Bush going after al Queda in Afghanistan, but when he went after Hussein with no particular purpose, yeah, that was bullshit, and I was against all of that, and I agree in wishing that Obama did a better job of getting us out of all that. Although blaming it all on him is kind of ridiculous. Just because you don&amp;#39;t like the guy doesn&amp;#39;t mean everything is all his fault. At least blame the right people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree that we should give him some time. My timeline to my alt-right friends was this summer. That should give him time to get his feet under him. Problem I have is that I see no direction. I see no sign of a coherent over all plan. So far he seems to be wholly reactive.
