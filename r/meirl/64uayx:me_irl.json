In order to accommodate the engine you would need to make so many alterations that it wouldn't be a golf cart anymore. \n\nFirst off, the frame of the golf cart and it's suspension system would not be able to hold the incredible weight of a large Ferrari engine or any super car engine for that matter. In order to do so you would need to weld in a custom frame. That's a lot more weight, build a whole new suspension system to hold it which means more alterations to handle the car's new weight. Also those engines are big, your new welded on frame would need to add length to hold the engine, and get the golf cart the clearance underneath to run a drive train. \n\nThen you have drive train issues. Those don't have true transmissions, they have a gearbox hooked right to an electric motor. If you found enough adapters to some how hook the crankshaft to the that gear box it would fucking explode. So you need basically a matching Ferrari transmission since the engine and tranny are built to match. \n\nAfter the drive train is taken car of, the sheer power going to the axles would shred them to pieces, so upgrade those, that's a lot of new weight. Then you have too much power to the wheels. Those tires would  rip apart instantly if you floored it. So now you need full sized rims and tires, and a better breaking system. \n\nFuel issues.
