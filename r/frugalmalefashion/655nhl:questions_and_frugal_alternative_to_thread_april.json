You'll have dozens to go through, and can find any number of widths, materials, patterns, and designs. Sure, there are plenty that are far too wide and others that ostentatious in the worst way.

And they'd certainly be of better quality than some internet \"WE REIMAGINED THE PROCESS!\" dealer.\n\nSome buying tips: \n\n* Hold them up to the light. Stains on silk are difficult to see. \n\n* Check inside. You'll often find rips and tears that can't be seen but may effect how the tie lies on your front. \n\n* Get a good eye for width or bring a favorite with you. Half an inch could make a big difference. \n\n* Get a sense of length. On more than occasion I've picked up a thin tie with an awesome pattern only to discover its 10 inches too short. This isn't just a youth vs adult thing (though that's bit me.) Vintage ties are often shorter because pant waists were much higher.\n\n* Get a sense for materials and construction. I've never found a true seven fold, but I find grenadines, hand-blocked prints, and ancient madders dyes with some regularity.\n\n", "edited": 1492173821.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who is in thrift stores half a dozen times a week and who buys and sells a good deal of vintage clothing, I understand why someone wouldn&amp;#39;t want a vintage t-shirt, vintage shoes, or even jackets.

Sure, there are plenty that are far too wide and others that ostentatious in the worst way. But if you took a Saturday morning to go to three or four thrift stores, you&amp;#39;d walk out with at least half a dozen quality neck ties for any situation. And they&amp;#39;d certainly be of better quality than some internet &amp;quot;WE REIMAGINED THE PROCESS!&amp;quot; dealer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some buying tips: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hold them up to the light. Stains on silk are difficult to see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check inside. You&amp;#39;ll often find rips and tears that can&amp;#39;t be seen but may effect how the tie lies on your front. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a good eye for width or bring a favorite with you. Half an inch could make a big difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a sense of length. On more than occasion I&amp;#39;ve picked up a thin tie with an awesome pattern only to discover its 10 inches too short. This isn&amp;#39;t just a youth vs adult thing (though that&amp;#39;s bit me.) Vintage ties are often shorter because pant waists were much higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a sense for materials and construction. I&amp;#39;ve never found a true seven fold, but I find grenadines, hand-blocked prints, and ancient madders dyes with some regularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "frugalmalefashion", "name": "t1_dg83jzg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492141220.0, "created_utc": 1492112420.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s8e9", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655nhl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7lc43", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "artie_fresh", "parent_id": "t1_dg7l93q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/frugalmalefashion", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Have you hit up a Marshalls or TJMaxx.
