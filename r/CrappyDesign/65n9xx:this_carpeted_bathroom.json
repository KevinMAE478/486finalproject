So you use a backslash &amp;quot;\\&amp;quot; before each asterisk to show that you really did mean to just have the asterisk and not to have an italic word. When you do this, it&amp;#39;s called an &amp;quot;escape character&amp;quot; because you let it escape from becoming formatting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course if a backslash showed up before every asterisk it would be weird, so they are automatically hidden. So the left arm of the shruggie becomes hidden since it&amp;#39;s a backslash. However, you can escape the escape character, by putting a double backslash like &amp;quot;\\\\&amp;quot;, which turns into a single backslash like &amp;quot;\\&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CrappyDesign", "name": "t1_dgbv58x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492361720.0, "created_utc": 1492332920.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 78}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbuvca", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BeePuncherAnon", "parent_id": "t1_dgbu0ih", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CrappyDesign", "controversiality": 0, "body": "So why does this happen?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CrappyDesign", "name": "t1_dgbuvca", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492360813.0, "created_utc": 1492332013.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbu0ih", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 142, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Healer_of_arms", "parent_id": "t1_dgbu05v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CrappyDesign", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CrappyDesign", "name": "t1_dgbu0ih", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492358087.0, "created_utc": 1492329287.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 142}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbu05v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 41, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HeavingEarth", "parent_id": "t1_dgbtbk3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CrappyDesign", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "CrappyDesign", "name": "t1_dgbu05v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492358057.0, "created_utc": 1492329257.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbtbk3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 211, "report_reasons": null, "author": "herzelied", "parent_id": "t1_dgbs7ig", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CrappyDesign", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Mine don't always bounce off the water first.
