That&amp;#39;s a narrow perspective based upon limited information from a book written when people didn&amp;#39;t know where the sun went at night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for another perspective, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYGxZL870ZE\"&gt;here&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; a (&lt;em&gt;non-stigmatizing&lt;/em&gt;) look at a North American Indigenous third gender/intersex identity called &lt;em&gt;two-spirited&lt;/em&gt;. After watching that, you can say you know something about the perspective of a non-European, non-Abhramic gender identity. Most other cultures have a thirdsex/thirdgender cultural identity, one can search wikipedia for some basic introductions from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jordan Peterson has some great points about freedom of speech and civil liberties, as well as some interesting ideas on human nature, but he uses his clout in psychology to push a Abrahamic narrative. And he won&amp;#39;t change his view because it&amp;#39;s a binary man-woman view of gender, the same binary Abrahamic view that Iran has, which &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.ca/#q=iran+forces+gays+to+get+sex+change\"&gt;forces gays and lesbians to get sex changes&lt;/a&gt; because that reinforces the gender binary in their opinion. Peterson arrives at the same conclusion when he&amp;#39;s spoken with transgender women in debates who have transitioned over to a very/fully feminine, hetero-normative kind of identity who agree with him that they (individually) do not identify as very masculine at all despite their birth sex, but this totally misses the point of non-binary individuals and intersex humans. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Jordan Peterson is so Christian, he&amp;#39;s Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re actually criminalizing what amounts to being rude.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Christopher Hitchens speaking on &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyoOfRog1EM\"&gt;free speech&lt;/a&gt; is my golden standard on this subject. I don&amp;#39;t agree with the legislation either, if you care to know my opinion. I am a firm believer that true freedom of speech, to carry on the conversation, is the only real way to get at the heart of humankinds problems and resolve what divides us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "name": "t1_dgcdyy9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492396715.0, "created_utc": 1492367915.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbry2g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "super_ag", "parent_id": "t1_dgbr0l9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Libertarian", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;then here in this video gives his express right to hate and dehumanize others. \n\nI think this is a bit of a straw man.
