Many districts provide aides to as few as one or two students who are very high needs.  This can chew up significant resources.  Beyond that, even moderate needs.  My kid got to see a specch pathologist for 3 years paid for by our district; it would have cost us $60k out of pocket.  She&amp;#39;s a smart kid and does great in school and is very social, but she needed this and the district provided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, poverty.  Kids in poverty are more likely to be special needs, but even ignoring that, it costs far more.  Whether its providing food, eating up teacher time because classes are hungry, tired, and scared - educating poor kids is expensive.  We have among the highest childhood poverty rates among peer nations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also have tremendous social services provied by schools to immigrant families - English as a second language is big.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "name": "t1_dg5trri", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492031039.0, "created_utc": 1492002239.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4gz3v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "praxulus", "parent_id": "t1_dg4f56q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Libertarian", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was not aware of this, mind expanding?
