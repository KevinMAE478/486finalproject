Below is, as far as I can tell, an objective, but easily read financial analysis on why no one in the entire country benefits from this program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s begin our analysis by discussing the current numbers for social security:\nEvery paycheck you receive is taxed at 6.2% of your gross pay.  Your employer must match that as well so the total being paid into your social security benefit is 12.4% of your income.  That number is actually a very good number to invest each paycheck if you want to retire healthy so I have to give credit where it is due there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s assume that instead of you and your company paying that amount into social security, a law was created that says you must take that same 12.4% and invest it in a pre-tax retirement account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-miller-socialsecurity-idUSBRE89H0YG20121018\"&gt;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-miller-socialsecurity-idUSBRE89H0YG20121018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to the analysts at the SSA the lowest income individuals did the best in Social Security Returns seeing a 6.79% annual return. The higher up you go the worse off it gets going as low as 2.5% for middle income earners.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s literally take the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; case scenario of someone working for minimum wage their entire life from the age of 21 until the retirement age of 67. We will assume 15k annually as minimum wage income.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using the benefit calculators on their own website the SSA says you will see about $1,132 per month working out to roughly $15000 in income per year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sounds great right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see what happens if someone took that money over the same time frame and invested it in the S&amp;amp;P 500 pre-tax and then reinvested the dividends continuously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those who are not investment savvy, stocks sometimes pay owners of the stock a small amount of cash.  This payout is called a dividend.  When you see most performance numbers on stocks or funds it usually does not factor in reinvesting the dividend, just simply the performance of the stock or fund itself. Reinvesting the dividends causes a substantial increase in the long term performance of any investment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets start by calculating how much you are now required to invest. 15000/12*.124 = 155 per month of your pre-tax pay.  Now the assumed annual rate of return on a 40 year investment in the S&amp;amp;P is roughly 7%.  However, that number does not factor in reinvesting dividends which substantially raises that number. I am going to take an assumption and say that factoring in dividends you will see an average annual 9% return over the 46 year period I outlined from 21 until 67.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A quick future value analysis says you will have saved a total of $1,257,362.28.  At that point, if you invest in a very secure fund that returns 1.5% per year you will have $18,000 in income per year. Of course, you can probably keep that same amount in the S&amp;amp;P safely at that point and continue to just live off an income level well below the average return of the market per year and keep watching it grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The REAL HUGE PART about this is that even factoring in stuff like higher tax rates on an investment compared to social security is that you now have a 1 MILLION DOLLAR NEST EGG for your family after you die.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if the market did not return as well as social security did, you don&amp;#39;t own any of the investment you made into social security.  You literally just piss it away and there is nothing you can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could even go into more detail about how if you take 2% of that 12.4% and spent it on a term life insurance policy you could easily factor in for events such as death or disability but I think you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do we need social security?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: Some typos fixed&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Edit: Someone smartly pointed out below SS is not strictly a retirement plan but an age based social welfare program and I agree.
