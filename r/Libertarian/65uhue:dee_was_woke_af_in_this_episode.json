You agree that people would individually and privately fund things that they considered valuable, like law enforcement and security. So remind me why we need a coercive state that steals money from people by force?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which makes me think the best way to get proper /theft/ is to decide democratically, but with some protections to ensure that people don&amp;#39;t just /steal/ by envy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;democratic theft is still theft. Just like democratic socialism is still socialism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from emotions, I saw nothing in your post which would argue against real estate taxes.

I didn&amp;#39;t make any emotional argument. I simply said that you shouldn&amp;#39;t get to steal shit from someone else just because you don&amp;#39;t like what they&amp;#39;re doing with their property. Hey, I think you&amp;#39;re wasting your car when you could be biking to work, I&amp;#39;m gonna come steal your car because I could totally use it better than you can, what about muh dreams of owning a car?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think you have to see all sides here, not just a land owner, but also the wannabe land owner who already has to work harder to get enough money than someone who inherited it, and then is left without any chances to fulfil his ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;complaining about how a parent giving money to their child &amp;#39;isn&amp;#39;t fair&amp;#39; to other people&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;you are literally regurgitating Marxist socialist gripes now. congrats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All taxes hurt people. There&amp;#39;s no need to give land owners a free pass&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;how is not stealing from them a &amp;#39;free pass&amp;#39;? I don&amp;#39;t think anyone should be stolen from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;especially when the tax doesn&amp;#39;t harm anyone who uses the land normally, only the ones who waste its potential. Taxes should be made so that they encourage economic behavior and discourage waste. Or at least cause the least possible harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;you know how you encourage economic behavior? You don&amp;#39;t steal people&amp;#39;s money. And who gets to decide if the land owner is &amp;quot;wasting&amp;quot; it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or in other words, if you own something, you also carry according responsibilities. If you own a car, you also need a car insurance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;yeah, and that responsibility only extends to &amp;quot;you don&amp;#39;t get to hurt other people&amp;quot;. So I don&amp;#39;t get to take my car and run you over. But if I buy a brand-new Ferrari and let it sit in my garage, you don&amp;#39;t get to decide that I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;wasting it&amp;quot; and then come steal it from me.
