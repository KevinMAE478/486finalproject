These same political parties who attacked the water charges advocated for higher and higher upper income taxes though, to pay for social benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is, when the government introduced a scheme that was designed to spread the tax burden evenly throughout society, people literally marched the streets. Instead, water charges came out of the income tax of middle class and upper class earners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s merely about raising tax revenue to pay for services, then why don&amp;#39;t we tax low income earners a bit more, and spread the cost evenly? The answer is because those who advocate for higher taxes are not interested in the most equitable means by which  to pay for public services, but are in fact swayed by simple human selfishness: &amp;quot;I agree with higher taxes, so long as I&amp;#39;m not paying them!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "name": "t1_dgeax04", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492500169.0, "created_utc": 1492471369.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wy6z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgehzui", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "super_ag", "parent_id": "t1_dgdy3q5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Libertarian", "controversiality": 0, "body": "We already have plenty of services and are running deficits every year to pay for them.
