Why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are practical (and even moral) reasons why in a capitalist system you need wealth redistribution. Why wouldn&amp;#39;t we put those ahead of some moral imperative that rich people must keep every penny even if they don&amp;#39;t use it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially when you consider the fact that everyone is a product of the society they grow up in and work in. There are many privileges that living in, say, the US, provides to allow people to accumulate wealth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why is it okay for them to pay their employees a wage that they can&amp;#39;t survive on while they have millions sitting in the bank?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the vast wealth inequality in the world and the problems it creates, I would say it&amp;#39;s very reasonable (even if not heroic) to say that we need to redistribute and produce a better society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Socialism goes further and nips that problem in the bud so you don&amp;#39;t need welfare or wealth redistribution, but unless you have that, you are going to need to redistribute and tax and steal from the rich at least somewhat. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "name": "t1_dg8dqtc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492153478.0, "created_utc": 1492124678.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656m80", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg93njo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "throwitupwatchitfall", "parent_id": "t1_dg841ai", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Libertarian", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ant anti-welfare top comment on /r/libertarian??? \n\nWhat ***IS*** goinnnng oonn!?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ant anti-welfare top comment on &lt;a href=\"/r/libertarian\"&gt;/r/libertarian&lt;/a&gt;??? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;IS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; goinnnng oonn!?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "name": "t1_dg93njo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492203945.0, "created_utc": 1492175145.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh63", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656m80", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8m4z7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RP_Student", "parent_id": "t1_dg841ai", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Libertarian", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're misinterpreting the picture.
