I grew up broke as a joke and let me tell you, my poor ass mom? She deserves to be poor. She had kids while she was poor. For that? Double fuck her. She deserves indefinite poverty. Most of my neighbors? They sit on their front porch and smoke black and milds and drink alllll day. My mom sits in her room and drinks allll day. My youngest brother, he sits in the living room playing PlayStation allll day. Sixteen years old, dropped out in ninety grade, no GED, no school, no driver's license. I won't even say it's the majority of my area, but easily a third of all these poor mother fuckers behave this way. If you're voting to steal from productive people to enable these lazy mother fuckers to breed and bring more poor kids up into that horseshit, then fuck you. Until I made it to adult hood and got the fuck out of there, for nearly my entire childhood, I'd wished I'd have been aborted than had to grow up with my piece of shit mom and our shitty house and our shitty neighborhood. I didn't mind the poverty, but I minded what comes with it, the hunger, the chaos, the uncertainty. My mom is healthy, able, and even has a college degree. She could have gotten even a part time job at any time, but she didn't. \n\n\nWe often would miss the power bill or have an empty fridge or some bullshit like that, lemme tell you, when I was a kid, I thought she tried hard and just couldn't make it work, but as an adult, I see how easy it is to just get up and get to work. She just was an irresponsible, lazy piece of shit. She made enough money to pay the bills, but she'd drink and/or gamble it away. What a piece of shit she is. Still is. \n\n\n When I was first working as an adult, I used to leave a card at home for her to pay her bills. When I took a closer look to see why I was so broke, it turns out she was drinking and gambling away MY money, and not paying MY bills, and ruining MY credit. Fuck her to death. Fuck her, fuck most poor people, and fuck you for thinking that shit isn't their fault or that it's okay to subsidize those people bringing kids into this world to have to live with their shit ass parents. \n\n\nPoor people outbreed higher earners, too... which is crazy. It's crazy that people with sentiments such as yours will vote to \"help\" these people, then be surprised when there are suddenly more poor people next generation... Duh! You made it happen. \n\nI'm not debating, all of this is anecdotal, none of it is scientific, it's just my experience and I wanted you to know, on a personal level, there is another side to your point of view. Most poor people are too dumb and ignorant to realize the forces at work, but through a roll of the dice, I was born with some sort of obsessive personality and I took strong notice, over time, of all of the factors that led to my childhood poverty.

I grew up broke as a joke and let me tell you, my poor ass mom? She deserves to be poor. She had kids while she was poor. For that? Double fuck her. She deserves indefinite poverty. Most of my neighbors? They sit on their front porch and smoke black and milds and drink alllll day. My mom sits in her room and drinks allll day. My youngest brother, he sits in the living room playing PlayStation allll day. Sixteen years old, dropped out in ninety grade, no GED, no school, no driver&amp;#39;s license. I won&amp;#39;t even say it&amp;#39;s the majority of my area, but easily a third of all these poor mother fuckers behave this way. If you&amp;#39;re voting to steal from productive people to enable these lazy mother fuckers to breed and bring more poor kids up into that horseshit, then fuck you. Until I made it to adult hood and got the fuck out of there, for nearly my entire childhood, I&amp;#39;d wished I&amp;#39;d have been aborted than had to grow up with my piece of shit mom and our shitty house and our shitty neighborhood. I didn&amp;#39;t mind the poverty, but I minded what comes with it, the hunger, the chaos, the uncertainty. My mom is healthy, able, and even has a college degree. She could have gotten even a part time job at any time, but she didn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We often would miss the power bill or have an empty fridge or some bullshit like that, lemme tell you, when I was a kid, I thought she tried hard and just couldn&amp;#39;t make it work, but as an adult, I see how easy it is to just get up and get to work. She just was an irresponsible, lazy piece of shit. She made enough money to pay the bills, but she&amp;#39;d drink and/or gamble it away. What a piece of shit she is. Still is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was first working as an adult, I used to leave a card at home for her to pay her bills. When I took a closer look to see why I was so broke, it turns out she was drinking and gambling away MY money, and not paying MY bills, and ruining MY credit. Fuck her to death. Fuck her, fuck most poor people, and fuck you for thinking that shit isn&amp;#39;t their fault or that it&amp;#39;s okay to subsidize those people bringing kids into this world to have to live with their shit ass parents. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poor people outbreed higher earners, too... which is crazy. It&amp;#39;s crazy that people with sentiments such as yours will vote to &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; these people, then be surprised when there are suddenly more poor people next generation... Duh! You made it happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not debating, all of this is anecdotal, none of it is scientific, it&amp;#39;s just my experience and I wanted you to know, on a personal level, there is another side to your point of view. Most poor people are too dumb and ignorant to realize the forces at work, but through a roll of the dice, I was born with some sort of obsessive personality and I took strong notice, over time, of all of the factors that led to my childhood poverty.

I'm certain there are people out there who would be pissed off about that. But as I've said, I'm totally for government assistance and social programs when they're meant to help kids. I don't really care if people resent me.\n\n&gt; Someone with one child barely has time for school. Someone with two children to raise by themselves barely has time to even hold down a job. I think you may be out of your element here.\n\nSorry about that. I should have specified exactly what I was talking about. \"Three,\" in this instance, was merely an arbitrary number. What I was trying to say is that, a lot of the time, I see people *choosing* to live an uncomfortable life, rather than being a victim of circumstance. Someone who has kids and then complains that they don't have enough time for school was an example I was using. In that particular instance, the issue isn't that school is time consuming (well, maybe that's part of the issue), the issue is that someone had a kid before they were ready to do so. I mean, it's not rocket science. Don't have the time our money to have a kid? Don't have one. It's one thing if your partner breaks up with you and you can't afford the kid. It's another if you're already not well off and *then* have a kid.\n\n&gt; There is enough to go around without taking people's kids away from them for **purely financial reasons**. That's...crazy.\n\nThe part of the above text that I've made bold is the part that you and I seem to be having miscommunication about.\n\nI don't think kids should be taken away from their mothers purely for financial reasons. I'm sure there are many good mothers who don't have lots of money. If a mother is still able to go to work and provide for her kids, that's great. Kids don't need a new game console every Christmas. I understand that.\n\nAll I'm saying is that if someone is unfit to be a mother for whatever reason, I'm for spending tax dollars on getting them to a good home. Whatever. Wrong word choice, but the only point I was trying to make was \"I'm for some social programs, especially when they're meant to help those under the age of majority.\" But hey, we all fuck up our words sometimes.\n\n&gt;  You can't be on welfare your whole life.\n\nSorry, I keep forgetting that every native-English speaker is assumed to be American until otherwise specified.\n\nAnyways, maybe that's how things work in your country, but not in mine. I've seen people spend many, many years on welfare. And they're not grinding every day looking for jobs or upgrading their skills. Those people I've met tend to sit around and do nothing.\n\nAs for your last paragraph, you may be right. If we can come to a place in time where tax dollars are spent in a way that can increase everybody's quality of life unanimously, then perhaps I'll reformulate my views on the matter. I'm not as stuck in my ways as you may think. If someone can present a way to spend our taxes that is fair and doesn't reward poor behaviour, then I'll definitely take a look. Who knows, they may even get my vote.\n\nHowever, as for right now, all I'm saying is that I'm not into letting people live however they want at my expense. I choose to live in a way that means I'm independent. It's a lot of work and sometimes I feel like I don't get enough time to relax. I entered early adulthood with a pretty shitty hand. Homelessness, mental illness, lack of education and addiction issues are all things I've had to deal with. In the case of addiction, I'm *still* dealing with it, but I'm still able to go to work. Meanwhile, there's someone out there who chooses to live irresponsibly - as opposed to actually *fixing* their problems - and they demand that *I* be held accountable. That *I* be the one to help them when they're not even willing to help themselves.\n\nPeople have kids they can't afford, do drugs they can't afford, do dangerous shit that racks up health bills they can't afford and then they expect me to pay for them. I'm no more privileged than your average person. The only difference between me and these people is that I choose to do the right thing, and then, as a reward for doing a bunch of shit I don't like doing to begin with, I get to give my money away to people who *won't* do the right thing.\n\nIf you're a victim of circumstance and need help getting on your feet, that's fine. I'm not totally against government programs and assistance. If the kid you can't afford was a result of rape, if the drug habit you can't afford was brought on by your parents who gave you drugs before you knew any better, or if you do dangerous shit because you're mentally ill, then I'm cool with my tax dollars helping you out. Hell, maybe you've done everything you can possibly do but just can't get a job. That's not your fault, and I have no issue spending my tax dollars to help you upgrade your skills and keep yourself afloat until you *do* get a job. Otherwise, people who purposely make bad decisions and then accept assistance are just jerks. It's no different than stealing from your neighbour to pay for drugs. Your bad decision, my money.\n\nI shouldn't have to pay for the kid you had before you were stable enough to be a mother or father. I shouldn't have to pay your rent because you'd rather get high than work. I shouldn't have to pay for your medical bills because you refuse to count your calories and lose weight. I shouldn't be punished for other people's mistakes.

Someone with two children to raise by themselves barely has time to even hold down a job. I think you may be out of your element here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry about that. I should have specified exactly what I was talking about. &amp;quot;Three,&amp;quot; in this instance, was merely an arbitrary number. What I was trying to say is that, a lot of the time, I see people &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to live an uncomfortable life, rather than being a victim of circumstance. Someone who has kids and then complains that they don&amp;#39;t have enough time for school was an example I was using. In that particular instance, the issue isn&amp;#39;t that school is time consuming (well, maybe that&amp;#39;s part of the issue), the issue is that someone had a kid before they were ready to do so. I mean, it&amp;#39;s not rocket science. Don&amp;#39;t have the time our money to have a kid? Don&amp;#39;t have one. It&amp;#39;s one thing if your partner breaks up with you and you can&amp;#39;t afford the kid. It&amp;#39;s another if you&amp;#39;re already not well off and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; have a kid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is enough to go around without taking people&amp;#39;s kids away from them for &lt;strong&gt;purely financial reasons&lt;/strong&gt;. That&amp;#39;s...crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The part of the above text that I&amp;#39;ve made bold is the part that you and I seem to be having miscommunication about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think kids should be taken away from their mothers purely for financial reasons. I&amp;#39;m sure there are many good mothers who don&amp;#39;t have lots of money. If a mother is still able to go to work and provide for her kids, that&amp;#39;s great. Kids don&amp;#39;t need a new game console every Christmas. I understand that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I&amp;#39;m saying is that if someone is unfit to be a mother for whatever reason, I&amp;#39;m for spending tax dollars on getting them to a good home. Whatever. Wrong word choice, but the only point I was trying to make was &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m for some social programs, especially when they&amp;#39;re meant to help those under the age of majority.&amp;quot; But hey, we all fuck up our words sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t be on welfare your whole life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I keep forgetting that every native-English speaker is assumed to be American until otherwise specified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, maybe that&amp;#39;s how things work in your country, but not in mine. I&amp;#39;ve seen people spend many, many years on welfare. And they&amp;#39;re not grinding every day looking for jobs or upgrading their skills. Those people I&amp;#39;ve met tend to sit around and do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your last paragraph, you may be right. If we can come to a place in time where tax dollars are spent in a way that can increase everybody&amp;#39;s quality of life unanimously, then perhaps I&amp;#39;ll reformulate my views on the matter. I&amp;#39;m not as stuck in my ways as you may think. If someone can present a way to spend our taxes that is fair and doesn&amp;#39;t reward poor behaviour, then I&amp;#39;ll definitely take a look. Who knows, they may even get my vote.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, as for right now, all I&amp;#39;m saying is that I&amp;#39;m not into letting people live however they want at my expense. I choose to live in a way that means I&amp;#39;m independent. It&amp;#39;s a lot of work and sometimes I feel like I don&amp;#39;t get enough time to relax. I entered early adulthood with a pretty shitty hand. Homelessness, mental illness, lack of education and addiction issues are all things I&amp;#39;ve had to deal with. In the case of addiction, I&amp;#39;m &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; dealing with it, but I&amp;#39;m still able to go to work. Meanwhile, there&amp;#39;s someone out there who chooses to live irresponsibly - as opposed to actually &lt;em&gt;fixing&lt;/em&gt; their problems - and they demand that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; be held accountable. That &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; be the one to help them when they&amp;#39;re not even willing to help themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People have kids they can&amp;#39;t afford, do drugs they can&amp;#39;t afford, do dangerous shit that racks up health bills they can&amp;#39;t afford and then they expect me to pay for them. I&amp;#39;m no more privileged than your average person. The only difference between me and these people is that I choose to do the right thing, and then, as a reward for doing a bunch of shit I don&amp;#39;t like doing to begin with, I get to give my money away to people who &lt;em&gt;won&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a victim of circumstance and need help getting on your feet, that&amp;#39;s fine. I&amp;#39;m not totally against government programs and assistance. If the kid you can&amp;#39;t afford was a result of rape, if the drug habit you can&amp;#39;t afford was brought on by your parents who gave you drugs before you knew any better, or if you do dangerous shit because you&amp;#39;re mentally ill, then I&amp;#39;m cool with my tax dollars helping you out. Hell, maybe you&amp;#39;ve done everything you can possibly do but just can&amp;#39;t get a job. That&amp;#39;s not your fault, and I have no issue spending my tax dollars to help you upgrade your skills and keep yourself afloat until you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get a job. Otherwise, people who purposely make bad decisions and then accept assistance are just jerks. It&amp;#39;s no different than stealing from your neighbour to pay for drugs. Your bad decision, my money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to pay for the kid you had before you were stable enough to be a mother or father. I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to pay your rent because you&amp;#39;d rather get high than work. I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to pay for your medical bills because you refuse to count your calories and lose weight. I shouldn&amp;#39;t be punished for other people&amp;#39;s mistakes. I&amp;#39;m already dealing with the consequences of my own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "name": "t1_dg65q3l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492045022.0, "created_utc": 1492016222.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5v2lq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ElectricBlumpkin", "parent_id": "t1_dg5u57t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Libertarian", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Did I receive government assistance?
