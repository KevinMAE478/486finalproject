Finally, considering the immaturity and insecurity you&amp;#39;ve shown here, I had assumed you were relatively young, but according to your post history, you&amp;#39;re actually a 38 year old man with a wife and seven kids, and it saddens me that instead of spending time with them you&amp;#39;ve wasted most of your Sunday posting 16 separate comments arguing with internet libertarians about a meme. I&amp;#39;d like to take this opportunity to apologize to your family for instigating your pathetically obsessive behavior.
