Imagine:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stab a woman, and hit a cancerous tumor as well.  Sure, I violated the NAP by stabbing the woman and should be punished for that, but there&amp;#39;s no judge in the world who would elevate the charges on the grounds that I violated the rights of the tumor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stab a woman, and hit a 3 month old baby in her womb as well.  Now I&amp;#39;m getting charged for two crimes even if that woman was walking to an abortion clinic to have the baby removed even though many pro-abortion people (including a bunch of those on this sub) will argue that the baby is little more than a tumor during early pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It either is legally a human (in which case the abortion laws need to be revised), or it is not legally a human (in which case the fetal homicide laws need to be revised).  You can&amp;#39;t have one and the other.  Either the baby has rights (in which case stabbing and abortion violates the NAP for it) or it does not (in which case neither do).  The fact that the mother wants to or doesn&amp;#39;t want to keep it does not change whether or not it has rights, because the fact that the mother wants or doesn&amp;#39;t want it doesn&amp;#39;t change a damn thing about the current status of the baby inside her.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "name": "t1_dg9o5ro", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492229169.0, "created_utc": 1492200369.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ibg7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg9hrgv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Libertarian", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1492193570.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "name": "t1_dg9ibg7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492222147.0, "created_utc": 1492193347.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9hrgv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bertcox", "parent_id": "t1_dg9bybr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Libertarian", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That statement is accurate when applied to drugs.
