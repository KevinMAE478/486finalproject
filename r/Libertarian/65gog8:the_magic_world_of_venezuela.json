It's why the government shouldn't take too much taxes: it's economically better to skim a bit off the top a million times rather than syphon everything just once. Taxation is not a moral issue, it's an economic one.\n\n&gt;To them, the amount of pleasure they gain by eating ice cream outweighs the health risks. That's not inefficient, that's called opportunity cost.\n\nThe amount of pleasure we gain from collective projects far outweigh their cost. Do you really think the moon landing affected anyone in the US financially? Do you think it was a bad idea to fund such a profound experience?\n\n&gt;So that everyone can get the best bang for their buck. Would you rather get 1 pint or 2 pints of ice cream for $5. I know the answer.\n\nUnfairly, I can say how the moon landing didn't double the price of ice cream.\n\nI'll say this instead: a flat tax on every human wouldn't change the relative price of ice cream one bit; (if you could buy 1000 pints with one paycheck before the tax then you'll be able to buy 1000 again after).\n\n&gt;No, collectively, we don't. Ice cream does not bring as much pleasure to my life as something like football of video games does. Individually, you are free to enjoy all the ice cream you want, while I enjoy all the football I want. I do not want to pay for your enjoyment of ice cream when I get none from it. Likewise, you would probably not want me to take your money so that I can watch more football.\n\nThen vote for a collective net-negative project that you do approve of. If I give 10% of my profits and you give 10% of your profits then I'm happy. Even if your project gets twice as many votes and therefore twice as much funding as mine I am happy that my project gets any funding at all! In fact, I would feel guilty if my project that no one approved of got funding because it means I'm a tyrant and going against your will with your money.\n\n___________\n\n&gt;How is my breathing affecting you???\n\nI take my ideologies to their logical extremes. If a powerplant *breathes* a trillion times the oxygen I breathe and expels a trillion times the pollution I do then why shouldn't the powerplant be taxed a trillion times more than I am for its economic impact? Now wait, if I'm taxed 0 dollars for my biological pollution\u200b and 0 times a trillion equals 0.... that means that powerplant that's exhausting a cloud so dark it's blocking out the sun doesn't have to pay anything!\n\nIt's only logical that I pay something no matter how small my impact is. This will incentivize people to keep in better shape and also use less impactful technologies (cars, boats, computers, etc). Of course, a human's economic impact biology-wise will cost pennies a year but it's the principle that matters. Consistency.\n\n&gt;you chose the one thing in so much abundance that it has absolutely zero impact on you\n\nFresh water ysed to be abundant. Clean air used to be abundant. **Land** used to be abundant!!\n\n&gt;Should I also have to pay for stepping on the ground, because you may, at some point in your life step on the same spot\n\nAs long as you do not take God-given resources (water, air, space, oil, gold, land) then you're fine. But if you do then it's only logical that you pay for the stuff you use. The funds would go to collective projects and everyone gets a vote on how to distribute the funds; which projects get how much funding. \n\n&gt;You've clearly fallen hook line and sinker for the Al Gore talking point that there is no hope for Earth. That we've already irreparably damaged the environment beyond repair and we will cause the demise of the entire world by raising surface temperatures 2 degrees Celsius. [Yet today even Al Gore says that we are on the right track because of advances in clean energy in the market, and that we should be optimistic about the climate going forward](https://youtu.be/u7E1v24Dllk).\n\nI wasn't talking about climate change (I actually don't care about it because I won't be affected). I was saying that on an Earth with no humans/intelligence then all life will eventually go extinct anyway because the Sun will die out and the Earth with it. With humans, all life should now rejoice because we are their ticket to the future. Until 1969, all life had an expiration date (4 billion years from now). Now, it's pretty much guaranteed life will exist past that date. I'm surprised the Voyager Probe didn't have some seeds on it just for the message that the Earth has finally hit puberty.\n\nSo it actually doesn't even matter if we have a nuclear war because life is still better off with humans existing than not. Think about how wolves literally bred out their aggressive instincts just to be our slaves. And the population of dogs far...far exceeds that of wolves. Just like cows; we literally eat them but the number of cows today is so ridiculous that never in the bovine history has that evolutionary branch ever had as much success as today as our food!\n\n&gt;You need to take economics, logic, and grammar classes.\n\nI'll refrain from attacking you.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the reply; I&amp;#39;ll attempt better grammar from here on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because I don&amp;#39;t enjoy working.

I know the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfairly, I can say how the moon landing didn&amp;#39;t double the price of ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll say this instead: a flat tax on every human wouldn&amp;#39;t change the relative price of ice cream one bit; (if you could buy 1000 pints with one paycheck before the tax then you&amp;#39;ll be able to buy 1000 again after).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;No, collectively, we don&amp;#39;t. Ice cream does not bring as much pleasure to my life as something like football of video games does. Individually, you are free to enjoy all the ice cream you want, while I enjoy all the football I want. I do not want to pay for your enjoyment of ice cream when I get none from it. Likewise, you would probably not want me to take your money so that I can watch more football.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then vote for a collective net-negative project that you do approve of. If I give 10% of my profits and you give 10% of your profits then I&amp;#39;m happy. Even if your project gets twice as many votes and therefore twice as much funding as mine I am happy that my project gets any funding at all! In fact, I would feel guilty if my project that no one approved of got funding because it means I&amp;#39;m a tyrant and going against your will with your money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How is my breathing affecting you???&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take my ideologies to their logical extremes. If a powerplant &lt;em&gt;breathes&lt;/em&gt; a trillion times the oxygen I breathe and expels a trillion times the pollution I do then why shouldn&amp;#39;t the powerplant be taxed a trillion times more than I am for its economic impact? Now wait, if I&amp;#39;m taxed 0 dollars for my biological pollution\u200b and 0 times a trillion equals 0.... that means that powerplant that&amp;#39;s exhausting a cloud so dark it&amp;#39;s blocking out the sun doesn&amp;#39;t have to pay anything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only logical that I pay something no matter how small my impact is. This will incentivize people to keep in better shape and also use less impactful technologies (cars, boats, computers, etc). Of course, a human&amp;#39;s economic impact biology-wise will cost pennies a year but it&amp;#39;s the principle that matters. Consistency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;you chose the one thing in so much abundance that it has absolutely zero impact on you&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fresh water ysed to be abundant. Clean air used to be abundant. &lt;strong&gt;Land&lt;/strong&gt; used to be abundant!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Should I also have to pay for stepping on the ground, because you may, at some point in your life step on the same spot&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as you do not take God-given resources (water, air, space, oil, gold, land) then you&amp;#39;re fine. But if you do then it&amp;#39;s only logical that you pay for the stuff you use. The funds would go to collective projects and everyone gets a vote on how to distribute the funds; which projects get how much funding. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve clearly fallen hook line and sinker for the Al Gore talking point that there is no hope for Earth. That we&amp;#39;ve already irreparably damaged the environment beyond repair and we will cause the demise of the entire world by raising surface temperatures 2 degrees Celsius. &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/u7E1v24Dllk\"&gt;Yet today even Al Gore says that we are on the right track because of advances in clean energy in the market, and that we should be optimistic about the climate going forward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t talking about climate change (I actually don&amp;#39;t care about it because I won&amp;#39;t be affected). I was saying that on an Earth with no humans/intelligence then all life will eventually go extinct anyway because the Sun will die out and the Earth with it. With humans, all life should now rejoice because we are their ticket to the future. Until 1969, all life had an expiration date (4 billion years from now). Now, it&amp;#39;s pretty much guaranteed life will exist past that date. I&amp;#39;m surprised the Voyager Probe didn&amp;#39;t have some seeds on it just for the message that the Earth has finally hit puberty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it actually doesn&amp;#39;t even matter if we have a nuclear war because life is still better off with humans existing than not. Think about how wolves literally bred out their aggressive instincts just to be our slaves. And the population of dogs far...far exceeds that of wolves. Just like cows; we literally eat them but the number of cows today is so ridiculous that never in the bovine history has that evolutionary branch ever had as much success as today as our food!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You need to take economics, logic, and grammar classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll refrain from attacking you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Libertarian", "name": "t1_dgabua5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492262378.0, "created_utc": 1492233578.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaajzk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "alpengeist19", "parent_id": "t1_dga9laz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Libertarian", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ok...wow...just....wow.
