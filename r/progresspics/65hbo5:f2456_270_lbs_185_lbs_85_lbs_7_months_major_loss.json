I\u2019m a looooong time lurker, first time contributor. Despite putting these images on Instagram I\u2019ve been waiting until the right moment to post here as this community has served as such a huge inspiration for me! I have struggled literally my entire life with disordered eating. Mostly in the form of severe restriction followed by ginormous binges. That, lumped with my PCOS, the type 2 diabetes I developed, and some other mental health issues made for a lifetime of fighting my weight. \n\nI had lost weight previously but regained it all back and then some, seriously doing a number on my body and how it handles fat loss and energy use. I was absolutely miserable in my body and it affected every aspect of my life \u2014 I was in an unhappy and incompatible relationship; I was physically incapable of riding my bike or going for a walk along the beach; I was savagely depressed really had stopped looking forward to waking up each day. \n\nThe stress and health issues got so bad in early 2016, my hair started falling out and I had to shave my head. At this point I thought I wouldn't live to see 30.  But after losing my Grandmother, who was my entire world (and only real family), I realized I absolutely had to change and make myself a life worth living, for her memory if not myself. \n\nBecause I absolutely wanted to make the most drastic change possible to help with the severe medical issues I was having, and create another obstacle to regaining any weight, my medical team decided the best route for me would be surgery to help with the weight loss. \n\nI had a vertical sleeve gastrectomy about six months ago. Now I can walk. I can run. I ride my bike and I am training to become a road racing cyclist. Plus, I\u2019m in a much healthier and more compatible relationship now too! Also important to note that my blood pressure is normal again, the severe lower back pain I struggled with is gone, I have an actual menstrual cycle again, and I am no longer having to track my blood sugars. \n\nI know surgery gets the rap of being the \u201ceasy way out\u201d and as someone who has done it BOTH ways (having lost 60 pounds with lifestyle modifications several years earlier), let me tell you that\u2019s not the case. I still get cravings, I can still over eat (I track everything and if I want to have a 2000-3000 calorie day I still could), and exercise still requires me working my ass off. \n\nHaving my VSG was the best decision I have ever made. I still have another 25-35lbs to go, but I have no doubt I\u2019ll reach my goals.
