I never got the shakes from desire for food alone. What I did notice was that my attempts to clean up my diet, uneducated, left me to eat extraordinarily poorly. My blood sugar would drop or I felt weak because I would not eat enough good nutritious foods. Like just lettuce or vegetables because I thought that's what you needed to do. I never attributed it to a desire for bad food, I realized it was because you do need nutrients and calories to sustain yourself. If your TDEE is 2200 because you're obese dropping down to 800 calories is going to make you feel crappy. You'll end up craving what you're used to- because that's what satisfied your living requirements. \n\nIt's why calorie counting was so important for me- I saw how food worked into how I felt. \n\n2. It was a series of logical choices. I still remember the day I sat down, with MFP open to log in dinner. I was logging a meager 1200 calories, and when I saw a can of coke was 140 I realized that more than 10% of my diet cannot come from sugar if I was going to do this right. I stopped drinking soda that day. I have a diet occasionally, but I started buying unsweetened tea, and I always liked black coffee. I also chugged water like I was constantly running a marathon. I'm not kidding. More than a gallon a day. I recently went back to it- my skin never looked better. \n\nThe rest was a series of choices that pushed me to be better at athletics. I felt bad on fast food, and not filled. I don't eat it anymore. It physically makes me sick and it's not worth it. I learned that veggies were filling (fiber) and fruit was fast energy. I felt tired without proteins, and fats and carbs were sparing, not because they're not good for you- but because they're the most calorically dense. \n\nMy diet was rounded, I ate anything I wanted, but started to get stricter when I realized how food affected me. I don't really like going out to eat, even if calories are pointed on a menu. If you count long enough- you know pretty much how much is in your food. And it's not what they say it is. \n\nI still enjoy sweets- and pizza, sometimes. I had mcdonalds once last year because I was on a road trip and I actually felt like I was going to die. You start craving bad food less, and good food more. \n\nIt depends on your goals, I eat anything I want, but I work out twice a day, so I look for energy and nutrition. I make all my food from scratch each weekend. It's delicious, fulfilling, and I know exactly what I'm eating. I don't feel hindered by that at all, it's super cheap, and I've learned to manipulate my favorite foods into healthier versions that I eat regularly.
