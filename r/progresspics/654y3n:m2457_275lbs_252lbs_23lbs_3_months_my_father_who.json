In order for me to qualify I believe I needed\u200b a BMI lower than 30. I was around 270lbs at the time. I had to lose over 60lbs in order to even qualify. My Dad wasn&amp;#39;t given \u200blong left to live. I was his care taker for a couple of years before this. His health was so bad that he had developed symptoms similar to dementia. He had forgotten who I was and thought I was my brother who lived far away. I was shocked at how much control the liver had over the brains functions. I coordinated with the VA and the University hospital in hope of finding him some help. He had less than 6 months. They matched him with a donor. A prison inmate who had died in jail. I had to drive him over 100 miles in less than 2 hours in rush hour traffic. It was the most stressed I had ever been. He has since recovered fully and is doing very well, better than I have seen him in at least a decade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that offers\u200b no solace from your experience. I&amp;#39;m truly truly sorry for your loss. I really hope you are in a good place.
