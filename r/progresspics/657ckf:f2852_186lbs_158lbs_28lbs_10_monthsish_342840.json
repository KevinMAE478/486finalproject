I didn't use the fattest pics of me from the past couple of years, though--I probably oughta update it to be more accurate, but it's still pretty interesting, IMO.

I had a rough few years in elementary school. :P  Anywho...  \n\n*******\n\nAbout the OP:  The pic on the left was taken after a loooong day of working at my table in artist alley at New York Comicon, so that's why I'm a little rough-looking, there.  Despite being quite overweight/obese (well, I'm still overweight--just less so now) at 186lbs, I at least still made an effort to look put together in the hair and makeup department--but twelve hours of sweating did me no favours! Now that I've lost about half of what I want to lose, it's insane how much easier it is to work conventions and not be exhausted as fuck afterwards!  Everything is so, so much easier.  Aside from being much more confident due to my improvement in appearance, losing weight was worth it for simply making conventions 10x easier to handle!  I actually really enjoy them now, and I like being able to go to things (hanging out with friends, checking out the city I'm in, etc.) after artist alley closes instead of just going back to my hotel and *immediately* collapsing because I'm so sweaty and exhausted and unable to move. \n\nI'm so, so much happier now.  It's helped a lot with my depression, as well!  Though, my initial weight gain was spurred on by my first experience with deep depression--that shit is such a vicious cycle:  started out in the best shape of my life, suddenly fell into a deep depression (undiagnosed health issues), ate to feel good, got fat, felt depressed because I got fat, ate more to feel better about being fat, got fatter, etc :P)!  This is actually my second time losing weight--the first time I lost a bit over 100lbs in high school with CICO and daily DDR.  :)  It stuck for eight years until the depression kicked in and I gained back about 50lbs total. Ugh.  At least I'm starting to manage that slightly better now.\n\nMy boyfriend actually lost weight with me, too, which was extra motivating!  Especially since he's totally kicked my ass and has lost over 50lbs!  I need to get him to take some good after photos and then we'll have to do a post for him/the both of us. :D  We both lost it with the tried and true CICO (using Fitbit and MFP), but I've recently added cardio and weight-lifting, which feels great.  :D  \n\nI'm posting this because I need the extra motivation to really start hitting it hard--I've been pretty low-key about it the whole time (the first time I lost weight in high school, I lost almost all of it within 8-10 months!) and would really like to ramp it up and quickly knock out the last 30lbs-ish that I'd like to get rid of.  I'm actually really happy with my body as it is now, but I know it can be better, and it will. :) \n\nAnd, not related to weight loss, but I'm so in love with this dress and am thrilled that it fits!  I didn't think I'd be able to get back into a small again for a long time.  I probably even could have squeezed into the XS but the small fits perfectly.  For anyone who might want to buy the dress, it's from 'For Love &amp; Lemons' in the style \"Ayla.\" It's expensive as hell, but I found it on Ebay NWT for a reasonable price.  :) \n\nOh, and I just added my name to the image so that companies peddling lose-weight-quick bullshit won't try to use my pics to sell their products since I've seen that happen to a few others on here.\n\nEdit:  I was nervous to post here, because I was worried I might get some mean or nasty comments (not because this sub has a problem with that, but just because it's the internet, hah) and all I've received are really lovely comments and messages so far, and I really appreciate the support and kindness.
