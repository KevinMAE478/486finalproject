The first issue is that even when its supposed to end up with a thick sauce the sauce always ends up very liquidy. Ive tried adding cornstarch and maybe Im not using enough (dont have a lot of experience with Cornstarch thickening) but it doesnt seem to help and I dont know if the liquid would boil on high setting or if that would help. Ideas?\n2. A few of the recipes Ive tried say that at the end it should be easy to shred if you want. Thing is mine never are, tender falling off the bone yes, able to shred no. I cook mine according to the directions and ensure that the meat is properly cooked but I feel like I would end up with a gelatinous blob before I ended up with something I can shred (the gelatinous blob is something Ive come close to before).\nSo any tips or pointers on these two issues? Anything I might be doing wrong? If need be I can link the two recent and saved recipes Ive followed both of which had the same two problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi,\nHope someone might be able to give me some guidance about two issues Ive ran into when slow cooking meat.\n1.
