Here are a few tips.\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\n**BEAN COOKING BASICS**\n\n**Slow soak:**  Soaking dry beans in water overnight isn't really necessary.\n\n**Fast soak:**  Boil dry beans for a couple of minutes and let them soak for one hour before cooking.\n\n**Faster soak:**  Boil dry beans over medium heat for 10 minutes. Soak, covered, for 30 minutes. Cook.\n\n**Super fast:**  Use canned beans! They're already cooked, just drain and rinse.\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\n**Cooking:**  Drain well. Add 2 cups water per 1/2 cup presoaked dry beans. Cook for about 1 hour. If the beans aren't presoaked, lengthen the cooking time by 1 hour. Skim off the scum that surfaces during cooking.\n\n**Exceptions:**  Lentils and split peas don't need presoaking; they take only 1-1.5 cup beans and cook in 20-35 minutes.\n\n**Crockpot Method:**  This is a great method to cook beans. No soaking necessary! Place washed and sorted beans in the crockpot with enough water to cover the beans by at least three inches. For all day cooking, cook on low. For half day cooking, cook on high. Season the beans before you cook them (if desired) but do not add tomatoes (or any other acidic ingredients) until the beans are cooked.\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\nOK.

Once the veggies are soft, drain the mix and throw in your crockpot along with your cooked beans and all your other ingredients.
