Reallll cute girl just broke up with her boyfriend, I haven&amp;#39;t gotten laid in 3 years, she&amp;#39;s putting up the signs-fuck yea I&amp;#39;m about to get some pussy. So we go on 2-3 dates that have gone great, I&amp;#39;m making her laugh until she cries and throwing some sexual undertone in, strong eye contact, she&amp;#39;s digging it. Problem is I literally can&amp;#39;t escalate any further. Have no home to bring her back and fuck, I keep dragging out the dates clearly not even enjoying her company and just wanting to fuck and lose her. Now I know she&amp;#39;s fucking the tatted up, long haired, no college credit, druggie delinquent only because he can barely afford to have a place to bring her back to (oml this is happening). I am no longer invited to any events because in the past I have now developed the reputation as a prude and wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to hang anyways. Basically just having no social prospects whatsoever has driven me to the point of just up and leaving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found TRP when I was talking to that girl; after being out the game for a while I somehow came across this sub asking some beta question and have been reading ever since. It has gotten me finally past that wall to become my own man and leave my parents house. No more getting dragged along to family events I don&amp;#39;t enjoy, no more fulfilling obligations, no more tip toeing around my parents, fuck that I&amp;#39;m a man. TRP has finally given me courage to keep bettering myself and maintain a balanced lifestyle. I want to thank you guys so much for the words of wisdom, my move out date is going to be May 5th in a super nice 1 bedroom apartment and I feel like I&amp;#39;m escaping a prison sentence.
