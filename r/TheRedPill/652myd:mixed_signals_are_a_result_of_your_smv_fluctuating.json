If you do, this is what you work on. Once you quell your inner demons, you'll find that being cool is merely a by-product of being a guy who has no anxiety.

Personally, I think working on yourself without regarding others is the best way. The urge to fit in is there for everyone. People literally mold themselves into other people&amp;#39;s boxes. But if you work on yourself you&amp;#39;ll be able to go about your life without concern for other people&amp;#39;s perception. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the difference between a cool kid and a lame kid? The biggest difference is probably that the lame kid is nervous, full of anxiety when doing something public. He thinks, &amp;quot;if i say this, how will they view me? Whats going to happen&amp;quot; on both a conscious and subconscious level. The cool kid on the other hand, doesn&amp;#39;t think at all, but says whatever he thinks is fun for himself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you find yourself overthinking about certain things? Overthinking is a sign of anxiety. Its a sign that your thoughts are working against you. I transition into this topic because it was my biggest problem and I had no idea it was a problem. I thought everybody overthinks- not true. If you do, this is what you work on. Once you quell your inner demons, you&amp;#39;ll find that being cool is merely a by-product of being a guy who has no anxiety. If you want, I can point you to some tools and exercises you can use to make your inner as strong as a fort. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dg7lwoz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492122170.0, "created_utc": 1492093370.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7e3h3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NothingIsPermanent64", "parent_id": "t1_dg72mt6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've had my fair shares of what you've experienced as well.\n\nI noticed how the charismatic kids in class can interrupt anyone, say offensive stuff and still get positive reactions even from those that were the subject of his jokes, they can give a commentary when we're watching a movie and we, even I, would enjoy it as if what they say has any real contribution to making the movie funnier, but it does.\n\nWhen the loser kid points out a spelling mistake in the subtitle he is immediately told to shut up the second his lets out 3 words, but the charismatic guy can then chime in and exaggerate to taking the film company to court over that one spelling mistake and we'll all laugh.\n\n...I was the loser kid.\n\nNow?
