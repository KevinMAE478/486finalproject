We're not claiming to be saints, we are setting the record straight about *women*.\n\nYour point that \"hey, men cheat too\"..... well noone is saying they don't.  What we're saying is that women lie, cheat and exploit men for emotional and financial support.  Only the deluded or the crazy would disagree with this.\n\n&gt; So to say that only women are manipulative isn't fair.\n\nI never said that, don't make things up if you want a sensible discussion here.  Read again what I wrote, because if you're going to start misquoting me and reacting to what you think I said rather than what I actually said this conversation is over.\n\nIt's very much my experience with women in general and discussions on this subreddit that they will literally make up things I said in order to argue against me.  You're welcome to go down that road and I'll happily ignore you.\n\n&gt; Secondly, every single one of my exs cheated on me.\n\nWhy do you think that was?  Are you blameless in this?  Or are you choosing the wrong men?\n\nSee how I  make this your fault and your responsibility?  This is what women do to us *endlessly* and it's why this sub exists.\n\nIf we're talking personal experiences: I never cheated on any of my girlfriends, *ever*.  They all still tried to exploit me, lied to me, manipulated me, and ultimately they all let me down.  I never cheated and I am very, very unimpressed with female behaviour.  TRP explained exactly why all this was happening.  You don't like it, but this place is telling the truth about men and women.\n\n&gt; So I really don't think it is fair to say it's a one way street so and so fucking Chad.\n\nOf course it's a one way street.  As a woman you have literally NO IDEA what it's like for men dealing with women.  You don't know, you don't care.  You don't notice everything men do for you, and you don't see how little you put back in.  You are biologically designed to exploit men, and you are almost certainly very good at it.\n\nYour comments here are designed to add a further smokescreen to this.\n\n&gt; Bc guys joke all the time about having side chicks when they are in a relationship.\n\nIt's not a joke.\n\n&gt; But I do understand what you say when marriage benefits women more than men. \n\ngood.\n\n&gt; But let me ask you this... is there an ideal marriage model for men?\n\nNo.  Marriage 1.0 was a major compromise.  Exclusivity is a major compromise.  Men and women simply want different things.\n\nMarriage confers no obligation on women, so what's the benefit to us?  It's an expensive obligation for us that is based on the idea that women will in some way appreciate or repay our devotion.  It's always too late when men find out that it is a trap rather than a gift, that it is exploitation rather than equality.\n\n&gt; And if so what would you say it is. How would you change how marriage works today? I'm trying to be open minded with you.\nAnd I agree completely about divorce. \n\nGet rid of alimony, let the man keep everything he's earned.  Equal split on the kids.\n\n&gt; But think from a woman's perspective for a minute. You get married and you decide to have children. You look at finances and decide one parent has to stay home with the kids. Typically it's the woman. So she gives up her career\n\nShe doesn't give up her career.  She takes 5 years out from it.\n\n&gt; and isn't in the work field for years. Suddenly divorce and now she has to get back on her feet.\n\nRight.  And the man loses the support he's paid for.  He puts everything into his marriage and loses everything he's paid for.  No refunds on supporting the woman for the last 20 years.  He gets nothing out of it through no fault of his own.  It sucks and it destroys men, and I always advise men not to marry because of it.\n\n&gt; It could got he other way if the husband stayed home and gave up their career. \n\nsure, but then alimony isn't paid.  97% of alimony is paid by men to women.  that's the reality of today's courts.\n\n&gt; While alimony is unfair, I think it's the only way to make it so the other isn't in the shitter for awhile.\n\nSo you think that after alimony is paid, he should get a refund for all the money he spent paying for the wife he no longer has?\n\nNo, didn't think you'd agree to that.\n\nIn the old days it was \"I have no career, you must pay\" now it's \"I had a career, you must pay\".  The one person never paying is the woman herself.\n\nYou want kids, save some money first.  Or come to a fair contract with your husband.  Modern marriage is not it.  It is so anti-male that only an idiot man would get married in the current climate.  It's great for women though.  It's a great retirement plan, I highly recommend it if you can find a man stupid enough to agree to it.\n\n&gt; If you have an alternative idea to how that flawed system could be fixed let me know.\n\nI don't.  Women should have to pay if they fuck up their marriage.  They shouldn't benefit from divorce.  They shouldn't benefit from breaking up their marriage.\n\nChildren deserve better than a system that literally pays mothers to evict fathers from the children's lives.\n\nMuch fairer would be:  no compensation for lost career or lost earnings.  She gets supported while at home, and don't forget the father doesn't get contact with his children.  Where's the compensation for that?  There is none.  Call it quits.  Yeah, she's got to get her career back on her feet.  Get a loan.  Stop depending on men.  Stop trying to use every possible excuse to be dependent on us and to extract resources from us.

What we&amp;#39;re saying is that women lie, cheat and exploit men for emotional and financial support.  Only the deluded or the crazy would disagree with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So to say that only women are manipulative isn&amp;#39;t fair.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never said that, don&amp;#39;t make things up if you want a sensible discussion here.  Read again what I wrote, because if you&amp;#39;re going to start misquoting me and reacting to what you think I said rather than what I actually said this conversation is over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very much my experience with women in general and discussions on this subreddit that they will literally make up things I said in order to argue against me.  You&amp;#39;re welcome to go down that road and I&amp;#39;ll happily ignore you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, every single one of my exs cheated on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do you think that was?  Are you blameless in this?  Or are you choosing the wrong men?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See how I  make this your fault and your responsibility?  This is what women do to us &lt;em&gt;endlessly&lt;/em&gt; and it&amp;#39;s why this sub exists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;#39;re talking personal experiences: I never cheated on any of my girlfriends, &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;.  They all still tried to exploit me, lied to me, manipulated me, and ultimately they all let me down.  I never cheated and I am very, very unimpressed with female behaviour.  TRP explained exactly why all this was happening.  You don&amp;#39;t like it, but this place is telling the truth about men and women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I really don&amp;#39;t think it is fair to say it&amp;#39;s a one way street so and so fucking Chad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course it&amp;#39;s a one way street.  As a woman you have literally NO IDEA what it&amp;#39;s like for men dealing with women.  You don&amp;#39;t know, you don&amp;#39;t care.  You don&amp;#39;t notice everything men do for you, and you don&amp;#39;t see how little you put back in.  You are biologically designed to exploit men, and you are almost certainly very good at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your comments here are designed to add a further smokescreen to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bc guys joke all the time about having side chicks when they are in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a joke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But I do understand what you say when marriage benefits women more than men. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But let me ask you this... is there an ideal marriage model for men?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No.  Marriage 1.0 was a major compromise.  Exclusivity is a major compromise.  Men and women simply want different things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marriage confers no obligation on women, so what&amp;#39;s the benefit to us?  It&amp;#39;s an expensive obligation for us that is based on the idea that women will in some way appreciate or repay our devotion.  It&amp;#39;s always too late when men find out that it is a trap rather than a gift, that it is exploitation rather than equality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And if so what would you say it is. How would you change how marriage works today? I&amp;#39;m trying to be open minded with you.\nAnd I agree completely about divorce. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get rid of alimony, let the man keep everything he&amp;#39;s earned.  Equal split on the kids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But think from a woman&amp;#39;s perspective for a minute. You get married and you decide to have children.

So she gives up her career&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She doesn&amp;#39;t give up her career.

A few key points:\n\nWith attractive men, women try to weasel their way into a relationship by behaving like boyfriend/girlfriend and then guilting/shaming/demanding that this is how it is.  I don't know your situation, but this is what it appeared to be from your post.\n\nFrom her point of view.... she's had sex with you on 3rd date, she's seeing you often and having lots of contact.  This *feels* like bf/gf to her.\n\nFrom your point of view.... you think you never verbally agreed exclusivity therefore you're not.  You think she's totally cool you seeing other women because she's never said otherwise.  You think because you never said \"let's be exclusive\" that you're spinning plates (of which she is the first) and she's cool with this.\n\nBut deep down you know this isn't the case.  You know you can't say \"I'm seeing Julia on Saturday\" without a shitstorm of questions and possibly losing her.\n\nLook... this is your first rodeo.  You need to accept you're going to royally fuck this up and either get too involved, get her too involved, or lose her.  Unless you accept this, she's not a plate she is \"this one girl that I am scared to be honest with in case I lose her\".\n\nWith plates (I hate that expression).... let's say ...... FWB.  With FWB's if you're not clear from the start that this is what they are, they'll fall into bf/gf with you.  Then they will HATE that you see other women.  Why?  Because while you see yourself as all alpha playboy, she sees you as a bad beta.  You promised her everything and then *cheated* on her... in her head.  And you'll get all the recriminations that go along with it.\n\nYou need to set the frame earlier that you are seeing other women.  Not directly....but most of all you need to not slip into bf/gf mode with her.\n\nHow to do this:\n\n* Don't see her every day.  Don't see her every other day.  See her max once per week, and no expectation of daily contact (texts, calls, etc).  If she tries this, she gets ignored for a day or two.\n\n* Sometimes be inexplicably unavailable\n\n* Don't agree to all dates instantly, be \"maybe\" and \"see how it goes\" a lot of the time, be aloof and mysterious and busy.  Don't say what you're doing, don't say what you've done.\n\n* She's looking for \"is he committed to me\".  Don't placate her on this, don't reassure her that there are no other women by explaining away all your time.\n\n* Most of the time don't have an agreed future date time.  *THIS IS CRITICAL*.  If you have a perpetual rolling next-date, you are dating.\n\n* Every meeting should involve sex.  If she tries to see you without sex, or complains \"you just want me for sex\" or \"we don't have to always have sex\" or anything remotely like that she is trying to beta you, is losing attraction, and is trying to shame you into being a beta boyfriend.\n\nIf you don't do the above, she'll slip into bf/gf mode and put you in that position *without you agreeing*, and you'll be forever dancing between what you want and what she expects, never fully being honest.\n\nYou need to maintain some emotional distance.  LOTS of emotional distance.\n\nAs I said, you'll fail at this.  This IS your first rodeo, you WILL fall off and one of you WILL get hurt.  Accept this.\n\nIf you were seeing five women, this would come naturally.  But this is your first.  The first is the worst ... because you don't naturally have the protectiveness of the rest of your life and the rest of your options that you don't want to lose.\n\nI speak from experience on this.  First FWB: I was too vague, too placating, too much allowing her to believe what I thought she needed and she got hurt in the process.  Things blew up.  This is I think where you are at.\n\nMy second FWB: I was too honest, too blunt, too \"I'm fucking other women\".  (I said this even though I wasn't, but I acted like I was so that I kept the option to).  She was actually really great, but I handled it badly.\n\nAfter that I learned to take a middle road of *avoiding boyfriend behaviours* while also not overtly telling her I'm fucking other women.  This is like boiling a frog.  And women let you do this because they don't try and get exclusive until after sex (unless provider hunting in which case they try and either extract resources or demand commitment pre-sex which just gets them dropped).  So women kind of \"angle for\" commitment while having sex with you, and if they hope-for-it but never-quite-expect-it then you can keep this going for months and sometimes years.  By the time they give up hope of locking you down, you're already regular FWB's.\n\nPartly also they lie to themselves.  Pretending the sex is \"to try and keep him\" but really they just love the sex.  And sometimes of course women know their own nature and are happy being polyamorous.\n\nNot sure I can tell you where to go exactly from here, other than to try and imply you're not monogamous by not being so available all the time and not having a perpetually planned rolling date.\n\nOh..... most of all.... line up a few more girls ASAP.  That should sort most of it out.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, big subject.

Don&amp;#39;t placate her on this, don&amp;#39;t reassure her that there are no other women by explaining away all your time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time don&amp;#39;t have an agreed future date time.  &lt;em&gt;THIS IS CRITICAL&lt;/em&gt;.  If you have a perpetual rolling next-date, you are dating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every meeting should involve sex.  If she tries to see you without sex, or complains &amp;quot;you just want me for sex&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;we don&amp;#39;t have to always have sex&amp;quot; or anything remotely like that she is trying to beta you, is losing attraction, and is trying to shame you into being a beta boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t do the above, she&amp;#39;ll slip into bf/gf mode and put you in that position &lt;em&gt;without you agreeing&lt;/em&gt;, and you&amp;#39;ll be forever dancing between what you want and what she expects, never fully being honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to maintain some emotional distance.  LOTS of emotional distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, you&amp;#39;ll fail at this.  This IS your first rodeo, you WILL fall off and one of you WILL get hurt.  Accept this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you were seeing five women, this would come naturally.  But this is your first.  The first is the worst ... because you don&amp;#39;t naturally have the protectiveness of the rest of your life and the rest of your options that you don&amp;#39;t want to lose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I speak from experience on this.  First FWB: I was too vague, too placating, too much allowing her to believe what I thought she needed and she got hurt in the process.  Things blew up.  This is I think where you are at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My second FWB: I was too honest, too blunt, too &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fucking other women&amp;quot;.  (I said this even though I wasn&amp;#39;t, but I acted like I was so that I kept the option to).  She was actually really great, but I handled it badly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that I learned to take a middle road of &lt;em&gt;avoiding boyfriend behaviours&lt;/em&gt; while also not overtly telling her I&amp;#39;m fucking other women.  This is like boiling a frog.  And women let you do this because they don&amp;#39;t try and get exclusive until after sex (unless provider hunting in which case they try and either extract resources or demand commitment pre-sex which just gets them dropped).  So women kind of &amp;quot;angle for&amp;quot; commitment while having sex with you, and if they hope-for-it but never-quite-expect-it then you can keep this going for months and sometimes years.  By the time they give up hope of locking you down, you&amp;#39;re already regular FWB&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Partly also they lie to themselves.  Pretending the sex is &amp;quot;to try and keep him&amp;quot; but really they just love the sex.  And sometimes of course women know their own nature and are happy being polyamorous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure I can tell you where to go exactly from here, other than to try and imply you&amp;#39;re not monogamous by not being so available all the time and not having a perpetually planned rolling date.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh..... most of all.... line up a few more girls ASAP.
