My muscle mass increased at a rapid rate, I dedicated myself to literally building my body with heavy weights and a clean, but still calorific diet. Sure, the benefits were there to be seen... but the benefits for me was the way I felt in myself. I felt like animal. No girl was out of reach, none were too good for me, if anything they would be lucky to even have a chance with me... of course, in reality, this wasn&amp;#39;t the case I&amp;#39;m sure but in my mind that was the reality.  I went from a slender 15 stone to 19 stone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through the use of steroids, I went from a &amp;quot;nice guy&amp;quot;, to an animal... and I liked it. I went from being the guy you would be happy to take your girlfriend home to meet your parents... to a bit of a cunt, in truth, but I still liked it. Steroids changed my mindset, everything was there for the taking... promotions at work, girls in clubs, nothing was out of my reach. My sex drive was through the roof, if I wasn&amp;#39;t having sex I was masturbating at least 5x a day out of necessity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The side effects? I developed acne on my back and across my shoulders, but this was down to using poor brands of steroids in the early days. I&amp;#39;m guessing I had a reaction to the oil, but unfortunately it never really disappeared. I snapped a few times at my partner, I smashed glasses against the wall and threw a mirror across the room in anger once during a row. I&amp;#39;m not proud of this by the way, I&amp;#39;m just sharing my experience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, I took steroids to gain muscle but found the effect the high levels of testosterone had on my brain was far more beneficial. I felt like I became the man I always wanted to be. A genuine alpha male... but take the gear away, and I was the same person I had always been. Which was so depressing and I developed a reliance and dependency on the drug, more for the psychological effect that physical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, I have my use of steroids far more under control.

Gained a substantial amount of muscle mass, and now I'm cutting down. Steroids aren't a magic pill if you have shitty training and a shitty diet you will not get good results especially if you're just on Test. And lets not get this confused steroids are hard on your body, and they can fuck a lot of things to do with your hormones and require a lot of knowledge to do correctly and safely. So in saying that, you need to be serious with yourself about the risks and if its really worth it, if you haven't exhausted your natty limits. A lot of guys are impatient and want results NOW, they want that instant gratification society has taught you to crave, I'd much rather work my ass off and have a good body naturally then spend hundreds of dollars on roids and blood tests and have my anxiety at all time highs during my cycle, but that's just me...
