I agreed with very few things, disagreed with a lot, and then moved on to another reddit page, and forgot about this subreddit. A few days ago at my school (I am in last year of high school, beginning college soon), we had different speakers talking to us about adult life. There were a few female speakers talking about difficulties and hinders that girls will face as they go from girls to women. My girlfriend and I decided to go to one of the talks. The speakers gave a good talk about how women should speak up for themselves/stand up for themselves), and peruse their goals in workplace/educations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the talk, they were selling books at a very reduced price for the students. My girlfriend decided to buy a book written by the chief operating officer of Facebook \u2013 Sheryl Sandberg. The name of the book was \u201cLean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I continue, I should mention that Sheryl Sandberg is one the most successful businesses women in history, and she is considered one of the most powerful female on the surface of the earth. I did not read the whole book, I just flipped between the chapters and read a few pages her and there. Most of what I read was pretty good, just general life advice to women in college.  I then came over this quotes by her when she was talking about the importance of having a equal partner for your career goals:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When looking for a life partner, my advice to women is date all of them: the bad boys, the cool boys, the commitment-phobic boys, the crazy boys. But do not marry them. The things that make the bad boys sexy do not make them good husbands. When it comes time to settle down, find someone who wants an equal partner. Someone who thinks women should be smart, opinionated and ambitious. Someone who values fairness and expects or, even better, wants to do his share in the home. These men exist and, trust me, over time, nothing is sexier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reading this made me sick to the stomach. Imagine Elon Musk or Bill Gates advising men to party and date the \u201cbad girls\u201d, and then in the end marry a \u201cgood girl\u201d. What type of backlash would they receive? But for some reason Sheryl Sandberg is praised in several newspapers and journals for this book, and it even has dozens of recommendation. This book is even given as a \u201cmust read\u201d for many college girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice how the first groups of boys (the bad boys, the cool boys, the commitment-phobic boys, the crazy boys) are for dating (but do not marry them), while the equal, nice guy is for marriage (she even mentions in another interview that a nice guy for marriage is someone who changes the diapers half of the time). Or this wonderful sentence \u201cThe things that make the bad boys sexy do not make them good husbands\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read more on her website, and websites she promoted on Twitter and organization page, and found an article written by an author (I won\u2019t name her or link to it. You can find it if you desire trough google). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now let\u2019s talk about adulthood, how I have redefined the meaning of \u201cnice guy\u201d and what it has actually meant in my life. For most of us, maturity will (or should) set in at some point. With a full-time job, two children to raise and a mortgage, it\u2019s safe to say my priorities changed significantly over a 12-year period&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, after partying and having fun from 18-30 (12 years as she mentioned above), she needs someone to raise the children (of another man) with and pay the mortgage. In addition to the mortgage, you also need to cope with her insecurities and the abuse her former relationship gave her. What a gift, what a catch!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lol, fuck me. I have never been misogynistic or had bad will towards women, but if this is shit that is preached to them, then fuck them. This has also made me disgusted at my mom. A few years back, I remember she mentioning that the she used to date a lot of men who were not good for marriage but very fun, but then (in her mid-30s) she meet my dad (who had almost zero dating experience), and decided to marry him because he was good for marriage. Back then I didn\u2019t know what it meant (too young). My father is a surgeon for reference. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fuck this world, how messed is this world up.
