Just recently I&amp;#39;ve taken up with a girl in an LTR who confessed to me after I fucked her for the first time that her long term boyfriend was a typical video game playing loser who never fucked her.  This girl just lost 60 pounds and her body is now banging (turned from a 5 to an 8) and sexually she is off the charts good because she&amp;#39;s been repressed for so long.

She left voluntarily but disclosed to him a bunch of things that when she told me almost sounded cruel.  Details  about things we had done that were really dirty.  Think every repressed woman you&amp;#39;ve ever been with dirty.  Think about a fairly hardcore anal porn movie you&amp;#39;ve seen and that would be a good start.
