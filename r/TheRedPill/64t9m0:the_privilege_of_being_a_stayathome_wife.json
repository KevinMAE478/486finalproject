If you are a stay at home-whatever, the feeling I get emanating from some women, is like, you could've done 'something' with your life but you threw it away to be lazy and be someones wife, nothing else. That's not true for me, I see a lot of value in the man I married, my partner, financially taking care of his family (roof over your head, food on the table), and women providing at home support (raising the kids, making life at home run smooth). It's like a well-oiled machine. But it depends on what the couple wants, they decide together. You asked what does a woman want? I can only answer for me. But the crooked feminism now a days shows a bit of whats going on i think...me and my husband talk about this all the time. Us women, we got what we wanted...under the law we are equal. I don't know what some other women out there are fighting for, but I think its more something that is missing on the inside.

My Husband works full time and he&amp;#39;s glad to do it(he teaches and watches over special needs adults). We are working towards this future, right now I&amp;#39;m in my last year of school (horticulture) and work part time while hubby works full time, no kids yet, we are saving up $. We are both 30. I&amp;#39;ve noticed that some women out there DO put down other women (in not so many words) who are stay at home mothers/wives or want to be. They do not say this verbatim but it is implied. It is a product of our current cultural climate (USA) and OTHER WOMEN telling us that we have to be self reliant and shouldn&amp;#39;t rely on anyone else. You are &amp;quot;worth&amp;quot; more if you have a career. If you are a stay at home-whatever, the feeling I get emanating from some women, is like, you could&amp;#39;ve done &amp;#39;something&amp;#39; with your life but you threw it away to be lazy and be someones wife, nothing else. That&amp;#39;s not true for me, I see a lot of value in the man I married, my partner, financially taking care of his family (roof over your head, food on the table), and women providing at home support (raising the kids, making life at home run smooth). It&amp;#39;s like a well-oiled machine. But it depends on what the couple wants, they decide together. You asked what does a woman want? I can only answer for me. But the crooked feminism now a days shows a bit of whats going on i think...me and my husband talk about this all the time. Us women, we got what we wanted...under the law we are equal. I don&amp;#39;t know what some other women out there are fighting for, but I think its more something that is missing on the inside. People get like that sometimes, when they feel bad inside they look for something external to give there lives some meaning or to give them a reason why they feel bad, always something external. Anyway I don&amp;#39;t want to go to deep down that road.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dg66wle", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492046224.0, "created_utc": 1492017424.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t9m0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64t9m0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5tneo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KeithRSRedPill", "parent_id": "t1_dg5qiiy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A woman wants what she doesn't have.
