How do you think the world will respond when corporations are making the majority of their profit on these women? That\u2019s right! They\u2019ll create more and more avenues for women to consume.

Have expectations for others and better yet, have expectations for yourself. Work on your SMV everyday and sweat out your pain in the gym. You attract what you\u2019re working towards.
