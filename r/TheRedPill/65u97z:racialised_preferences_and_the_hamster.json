However, with well over 100 million dating age girls in the country, there are plenty to go around.\n\nAsian chicks in North America are a different story.  White guys outnumber Asian guys 10 to 1, even in a cosmopolitan city like Toronto or Vancouver.  Even in specific places like Richmond or Markham, the Asian population barely cracks 50%.  Just as a matter of statistics, it is rather likely that an Asian girl will end up dating a white guy.\n\nHowever, there are Chinese girls who I personally know who a) specifically did not want a white guy and ended up with a Chinese guy and b) specifically did not want to marry a Chinese guy and chose a white guy. In both cases it was a matter of culture and whether they preferred traditional Chinese culture or Western culture.\n\nParents are a huge factor.  In Canada I was dating a Chinese girl: her brothers all dated/married white chicks and her sisters dated/married white guys.  Her parents seemed cool with it. We had a family dim sum event and you had mom and dad, but then as you went around the table it went:white, Chinese, white, Chinese, white, Chinese. . .\n\nOn the other hand, most parents in China don't want their daughters canoodling with white guys.  There was one girl I was getting serious with and her mother made it clear that she did not approve.  Another simply didn't tell her family about us because they would have disowned her.  There was another who was more open-minded and apparently her parents didn't have an issue with it; they just wanted a rich son-in-law (which leads into an amusing story).\n\nEDIT: I read the whole article and response and a few points came to mind.  I would posit that most guys who date Asian girls do not have an Asian fetish: they like slim/petite girls with pleasant faces.  In my 20s I had 3 LTRS: one dark chick, one white chick and one Chinese chick. It was another 15 years before I dated another Chinese girl.  But the presumption seemed to be : white guy, Chinese girl, ergo *fetish!* For the last few years I have only dated Chinese girls BECAUSE I LIVE IN CHINA.  The weirdness is that my current LTR is not Chinese but rather Filipina.\n\nThe average BMI for American women is what, 26? 28?  I think China is like 23 and Viet Nam is 21.  In any event, my last three girlfriends were 18, 19, and 20.\n\nOn the flip side, basic TRP theory is that women like tall men with broad shoulders and who are well-muscled. Most Chinese guys don't have those genetics on their side.  Here in China, the diet tends to be so low in protein that guys simply can't pack on muscle.  In places like Viet Nam and Thailand, the average male height has jumped by something like 2\" because of improved diet across the board, but they have a long way to go.\n\nBut just as a thought experiment, think of yourself as a North American travelling to Scandinavia.  The average American is 5'9\"; the *average* Dutchman is a full 6 feet. The average Chinese guy is 5'6\" so there is a 3\" difference going both ways.\n\nI never had some master plan to move to China and slay Asian pussy, it just sort of worked out that way.  But think about it for a minute: if you are an average guy who wants to get out of America to get laid, where would you go? And no pay-for-play.  Would you go to the Netherlands, which has really hot babes but you are the shortest man in the room? Or would you go to Asia where - by sheer numbers - there are hot babes and you are the tallest man in the room?", "edited": 1492423048.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in China and I can state definitively that most Chinese girls do not want to date or marry a white guy.

We had a family dim sum event and you had mom and dad, but then as you went around the table it went:white, Chinese, white, Chinese, white, Chinese. . .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, most parents in China don&amp;#39;t want their daughters canoodling with white guys.  There was one girl I was getting serious with and her mother made it clear that she did not approve.  Another simply didn&amp;#39;t tell her family about us because they would have disowned her.  There was another who was more open-minded and apparently her parents didn&amp;#39;t have an issue with it; they just wanted a rich son-in-law (which leads into an amusing story).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I read the whole article and response and a few points came to mind.  I would posit that most guys who date Asian girls do not have an Asian fetish: they like slim/petite girls with pleasant faces.  In my 20s I had 3 LTRS: one dark chick, one white chick and one Chinese chick. It was another 15 years before I dated another Chinese girl.  But the presumption seemed to be : white guy, Chinese girl, ergo &lt;em&gt;fetish!&lt;/em&gt; For the last few years I have only dated Chinese girls BECAUSE I LIVE IN CHINA.  The weirdness is that my current LTR is not Chinese but rather Filipina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The average BMI for American women is what, 26? 28?  I think China is like 23 and Viet Nam is 21.  In any event, my last three girlfriends were 18, 19, and 20.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, basic TRP theory is that women like tall men with broad shoulders and who are well-muscled. Most Chinese guys don&amp;#39;t have those genetics on their side.  Here in China, the diet tends to be so low in protein that guys simply can&amp;#39;t pack on muscle.  In places like Viet Nam and Thailand, the average male height has jumped by something like 2&amp;quot; because of improved diet across the board, but they have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But just as a thought experiment, think of yourself as a North American travelling to Scandinavia.  The average American is 5&amp;#39;9&amp;quot;; the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; Dutchman is a full 6 feet. The average Chinese guy is 5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot; so there is a 3&amp;quot; difference going both ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never had some master plan to move to China and slay Asian pussy, it just sort of worked out that way.  But think about it for a minute: if you are an average guy who wants to get out of America to get laid, where would you go? And no pay-for-play.  Would you go to the Netherlands, which has really hot babes but you are the shortest man in the room? Or would you go to Asia where - by sheer numbers - there are hot babes and you are the tallest man in the room?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dgda7se", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492446841.0, "created_utc": 1492418041.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65u97z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65u97z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65u97z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65u97z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65u97z", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65u97z", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge22bs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dudet23", "parent_id": "t1_dge1wmx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Again, they can enjoy their mongral kids and I will enjoy my white ones.\n\nLet me guess, you are some butthurt asian guy that tried to mateguard his asian women and then threw a fit when evil white men thought to respond the same way?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, they can enjoy their mongral kids and I will enjoy my white ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me guess, you are some butthurt asian guy that tried to mateguard his asian women and then threw a fit when evil white men thought to respond the same way?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dge22bs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492489297.0, "created_utc": 1492460497.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge1wmx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "blue_dover", "parent_id": "t1_dge1pwf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Don't worry they don't want you either", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry they don&amp;#39;t want you either&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dge1wmx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492489120.0, "created_utc": 1492460320.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge1pwf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dudet23", "parent_id": "t1_dgdybuw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nah, any white girl that consistently dates blacks fits  a certain mold that most white men do not want.
