Yes, women are women, and you will always get the shit testing and the illogical behaviour, but nonetheless a good woman can provide real value. But feminism means there are far fewer women that have anything to offer beyond a damp hole, because they have no relationship skills, have been taught from an early age to have a deep distrust, if not hatred, of men, and to think only of themselves. They are also rewarded for destroying any deeper relationship you may wish to have with them.

So, women go searching for the most attractive mates possible, and they are more scarce since more men are lied to about what women want.\n\nThis is very true. A huge percentage of men are sexual non-entities now, even just comparing to three or four years ago. Even beyond this though- and this is what I find incredibly worrying and what makes me think this *isn't* a good thing: more men are becoming 'polluted' and don't even know what they want sexually anymore. I have a friend in my social circle who is the perfect representation of this. I'm almost certain he watches a lot of cuckold/sissy porn, maybe even that scary-af hypno shit, because I can visibly see him getting turned on more by *me* flirting with a girl then doing it himself. This isn't a rare thing either. I've noticed a significant portion of IRL men and even more online who get off on vicariously living through me, who get off on the idea that *I* am going to fuck a girl they wanted instead of trying themselves. This shit just feels *wrong* but it happens constantly now. The first night I met my main girl this other guy tried to hook up with her afterwards. I was like \"PSA bro, I ruined this girl tonight.\" The guy said to me \"Yeah that's fine she's still a girl.\" \n\n&gt;This means that the \"secret society\" of people who understand this will reap the most rewards, for as we know, women would rather share an alpha than have a beta to herself. This is why in days of old one man could have a harem of 100 women all to himself.\n\nThey're stronger than we are. That's the reality. They have advantage of numbers, technology and resources. The absolute truth is that if society *wanted* to eradicate TRP, it would be gone. If society wanted to eliminate masculinity, it would be gone. Instead they're trying to prune it back to a small subset and pretend that's the 'natural order'. It isn't. I see it everywhere though, from cucking being a common theme in movies/TV these last two or three years, to interracial porn being the only thing in the suggested on PH, to the sporting/music world and their pretending that black guys are the ideal for men. IRL so far I've rarely seen girls choose black over white, but I have heard chicks say shit like \"only for black.\" This shouldn't be anymore than a fringe fetish, but the reason it is so main stream is because they're equating alpha with black. I've had girls tell me I'm \"such a black guy.\" What they mean is that alpha, dominant and sexual are all *black traits* because that's what media has sold them.\n\n\"But BJT, it's not that bad, it just means there are more cucks and thus more pussy for the rest of us!\"\n\nNo. **The scary thing is, the longer the archetype is set this far from the reality, the more the reality will have to reflect the archetype for common acceptance.** So if another 10 years go past with this BS predominating and chewing up more and more men, then eventually it will be the norm and *most white guys will actually be cucks*.\n\n&gt;We are that secret society gents.

Men can be pushed off the card for not looking right. Yes this can actually happen to white men, it has already happened to other races where only the absolute top 1% is alpha enough now. Society can and has done this before. Obviously biology is still a huge influence, but it might make it harder. I've already noticed that more and more over the last two years or so I've been getting picked up by girls because I look dark. I'm mixed race, but that's never been an advantage over being white until recently. I have a friend who is Aryan, slightly better looking and taller than me. I was out with him last weekend and some girls came up to us, literally ignored him and asked where I was from. They didn't even give him a chance to get in, so he ended up walking off while this girls tried to fulfill their jungle-fever.\n\nFor the record I'm actually white, just very dark skinned for a white dude because of my background.", "edited": 1492244093.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More men are led to believe their sexuality is disgusting and &amp;quot;oppressive&amp;quot; while women are told it&amp;#39;s empowering. So, women go searching for the most attractive mates possible, and they are more scarce since more men are lied to about what women want.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is very true. A huge percentage of men are sexual non-entities now, even just comparing to three or four years ago. Even beyond this though- and this is what I find incredibly worrying and what makes me think this &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; a good thing: more men are becoming &amp;#39;polluted&amp;#39; and don&amp;#39;t even know what they want sexually anymore. I have a friend in my social circle who is the perfect representation of this. I&amp;#39;m almost certain he watches a lot of cuckold/sissy porn, maybe even that scary-af hypno shit, because I can visibly see him getting turned on more by &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; flirting with a girl then doing it himself. This isn&amp;#39;t a rare thing either. I&amp;#39;ve noticed a significant portion of IRL men and even more online who get off on vicariously living through me, who get off on the idea that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am going to fuck a girl they wanted instead of trying themselves. This shit just feels &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; but it happens constantly now. The first night I met my main girl this other guy tried to hook up with her afterwards. I was like &amp;quot;PSA bro, I ruined this girl tonight.&amp;quot; The guy said to me &amp;quot;Yeah that&amp;#39;s fine she&amp;#39;s still a girl.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This means that the &amp;quot;secret society&amp;quot; of people who understand this will reap the most rewards, for as we know, women would rather share an alpha than have a beta to herself. This is why in days of old one man could have a harem of 100 women all to himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re stronger than we are. That&amp;#39;s the reality. They have advantage of numbers, technology and resources. The absolute truth is that if society &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to eradicate TRP, it would be gone. If society wanted to eliminate masculinity, it would be gone. Instead they&amp;#39;re trying to prune it back to a small subset and pretend that&amp;#39;s the &amp;#39;natural order&amp;#39;. It isn&amp;#39;t.
