I used to be big into PU, and I got pretty good at it. Let me use me as an example.\n\nPhysically, I'm nothing special. In fact, on paper, I'm unattractive: short, skinny and losing my hair. Because of this, I was never successful in bars and clubs. I held no value in environments where value was predicated on looks. \n\nHowever, I also taught ESL classes in NYC at that time. Put me up in front of a room and let me run my smooth-talking mouth, and suddenly BAM! I had women throwing themselves at me. I had Italian beauties and Japanese rich girls inviting me out for drinks and fucking me discreetly. \n\nThose are the extreme ends of my spectrum: zilch in bars and clubs, abondanza when I was the front man in my own little ESL rock show. \n\nIf we're talking average, I do *ok* in environments like parks on a nice day. I do *well* on vacations in foreign countries when chatting up strangers is more usual. In terms of physical fitness, I found that women have a *much* stronger response to fashion than they do to musculature - in other words, my meager physical gains got me way less attention than learning how to dress, which got me a significant boost in female attention.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, in my experience the ol' PU precept that feminine attraction is more complex than male attraction has absolutely held true. \n\nA wise PUA once said: it only takes one hook to catch a fish. For some guys, that hook happens to be looks. Which, let's not kid ourselves, is a pretty great hook to have in the water.

OK Cupid has some intetesting research on this. \n\nHowever, let me give you some hope. A lot of hope actually. \n\nLike you, I spent a lot of time at the gym with no results in the women department. I had an excellent job and all my clothes were custom tailored Jos A Banks. Zero fucks given by women. \n\nAround 2010 I lost just about everything. Which turned out to be amazing. I started reading some PUA articles and began to focus on my body language and attitude. And things started changing. \n\nCurrently, I have a rather menial dirty job in a very low income bracket. More women approach and flirt with me than EVER. The women I date are WAY over my head. How do I do it?  Pure confidence. \n\nWhen you are knocked down and everything is taken from you; and then you get back up, brush yourself off and say \"Is that the best you got?\" - that attitude is palpable. \n\nSeal, Mick Jagger and Billy Joel and Lyle Lovett are all uglier than sin dipped in shit; yet, are married to supermodels and actresses. Yeah, they are rich - but they are confident too. \n\nYou say you are depressed. Women can smell that a mile away. See a psychologist/psychiatrist and get some medication. Until then, you need to \"fake it until you make it\".  Really, confidence is a feedback system. Watch your posture, walk slower, move more gracefully, take up more space, act as if you own wherever you are and are amused by your surroundings. When you look at men, think \"I can kill you\" and when you look at women, think \"I could fuck you.\" Stare everybody down. Talk slower and lower. Do that for three months and you will notice a difference.

OK Cupid has some intetesting research on this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, let me give you some hope. A lot of hope actually. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like you, I spent a lot of time at the gym with no results in the women department. I had an excellent job and all my clothes were custom tailored Jos A Banks. Zero fucks given by women. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around 2010 I lost just about everything. Which turned out to be amazing. I started reading some PUA articles and began to focus on my body language and attitude. And things started changing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, I have a rather menial dirty job in a very low income bracket. More women approach and flirt with me than EVER. The women I date are WAY over my head. How do I do it?  Pure confidence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you are knocked down and everything is taken from you; and then you get back up, brush yourself off and say &amp;quot;Is that the best you got?&amp;quot; - that attitude is palpable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seal, Mick Jagger and Billy Joel and Lyle Lovett are all uglier than sin dipped in shit; yet, are married to supermodels and actresses. Yeah, they are rich - but they are confident too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You say you are depressed. Women can smell that a mile away. See a psychologist/psychiatrist and get some medication.

Watch your posture, walk slower, move more gracefully, take up more space, act as if you own wherever you are and are amused by your surroundings.

At the time, their computer model even predicted the trend seen in the latest study. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His team found a reduced carb diet (29% carbs) resulted in less fat loss than a reduced fat diet (7.7% fat). At the time, their computer model even predicted the trend seen in the latest study (4). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although the reduced carb diet (29% carbs) was not quite \u201clow carb\u201d, it still lowered insulin levels considerably. Despite this change there was no fat loss advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next study: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a series of tightly controlled clinical studies, 15 subjects were fed a diet that shifted greatly in the amount of carbs or fat it contained over a 13-week period. The calorie amount was for weight maintenance (no gain or loss), and was kept the same regardless of the carbohydrate-to fat ratio (7, 8).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is how one subject\u2019s weight tracked throughout the study. The first 38 days were high carb (75% carbs), the remaining were low carb (15% carbs).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded, \u201cThe carbohydrate-to fat ratio could vary widely with little or no alteration in the energy requirement for weight maintenance.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if you aren\u2019t consuming excess calories, weight stays the same regardless of the amount of carbs you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dge9toq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492498726.0, "created_utc": 1492469926.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge2jzv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "trex005", "parent_id": "t1_dge27bn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can you please explain to me the chemical process of fat storing?
