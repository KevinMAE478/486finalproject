Their search for a mate, independent of morality, is an instinctual need to track down specific genes, and it&amp;#39;s a great example of our cold, indifferent universe that is completely at odds with the &amp;quot;win the girl by being nice!/yourself!&amp;quot; sentiment the emotional world of movies teaches us as children. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the thing though, us men are also slaves to our biology. Maybe some of you have had long-running female friends that have been extremely good to you.

Sure, starting off a bit angry might help you with weights, but when that motivation fades it&amp;#39;s just a useless emotion holding you back from being the type of stoic man that attracts women.

Well hating women is going to make that a hell of  a lot harder. How are you meant to make interesting/engaging conversation with someone you hate?

As long as you are aware of AWALT and not taking women seriously. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I had never been exposed to such dishonesty, vindictiveness and casual cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;yes, part of me wishes that as well but think of it in a positive way, the amount of emotional abuse I went through in my developmental years made be extremely immune to emotional bs of women and helped me a lot in not giving a fuck, this bitching and moaning had become a daily thing by the time I was 10 so I eventually stopped giving a shit about what my mom thought of me or what her trollop friends thought of me. It made me suspicious of women in general and I pretty much lost any respect I had for those trollops. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It saved me from years of emotional pain that other men would have faced during their late teens-30 or even later if they didn&amp;#39;t find red pill. I was red pilled through my experiences, I just didn&amp;#39;t know some techniques that just made me more efficient with women. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Point is, women are not men, don&amp;#39;t trust them blindly and give your all to these trollops, even if one of them ends up loving you a lot and gives her everything to you. Women are impulsive by nature so never give them anything that they may use against you. That means don&amp;#39;t over invest emotionally in her, don&amp;#39;t trust her too much, don&amp;#39;t love her too much. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dg7dq7n", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492107956.0, "created_utc": 1492079156.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7d0cv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "openoids", "parent_id": "t1_dg7bh76", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "yes....Maybe alot of this is about \"poor boundaries.\"Sorry to hear you had t o go through this.

People feel vulnerable to just being their natural self, especially when they're dependent on an outcome. Because of that, they try to control everything. Forcing it like that, searching for ways to be better than your current self *in the moment*, causes anxiety and fucks you up when you're trying to execute. It shows others that you feel that you're too inexperienced for what you're facing. Of course, in the moment, all you can be is yourself. There's a time for planning and a time for action. A guy made an awesome quote in a post here recently (paraphrase): It might seem like chess at the start, but in reality it's just checkers.\n\nIt's like, if you're on Omaha beach, what's going to be better: Hesitate because you're afraid of being killed, or do what you know needs to be done? People need to accept the reality that *the risk of being shot will always be there*, and your best chance at getting out alive and getting your job done is to confront the situation head-on with no fear. Let go of the dependence, accept the vulnerability, do what needs to be done in the moment, and take time for figuring things out later. You can't force yourself beyond what you are, so have some goddamn faith in it.\n\nedit: Back to directly talking about hating women: The only reason you'd hate them is if you expected something from them and/or are depending on them for something. First off, you should not be allowing yourself to have insecurities that cause that dependence. Fight them. Second, hating someone for traits they have no reasonable control over is pathetic. Do you hate kids for doing dumb shit? No, you learn when to assert authority and call them out and when to laugh about their tantrum or let them go do dangerous shit. You should never have had expectations of equality or balanced appreciation. They shouldn't either. You shouldn't even care in that way about being appreciated because you're so damn okay with yourself that you're not depending on it. So fuck it, girls can be terrible, but they can still be nice to hang out with and fun to fuck. And when she fucks someone else, guess what? She was never yours in the first place. Just your turn. She's just there as an opportunity for what she is, so don't be upset about what she's not, because that's aaaalllll your own bullshit that you'll be much happier getting rid of.", "edited": 1492098410.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, I think you&amp;#39;re talking about this concept that I&amp;#39;ve become much more aware of lately. People feel vulnerable to just being their natural self, especially when they&amp;#39;re dependent on an outcome. Because of that, they try to control everything. Forcing it like that, searching for ways to be better than your current self &lt;em&gt;in the moment&lt;/em&gt;, causes anxiety and fucks you up when you&amp;#39;re trying to execute. It shows others that you feel that you&amp;#39;re too inexperienced for what you&amp;#39;re facing. Of course, in the moment, all you can be is yourself.
