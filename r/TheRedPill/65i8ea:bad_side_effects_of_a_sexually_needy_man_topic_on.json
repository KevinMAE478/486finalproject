I&amp;#39;m still &amp;quot;hungry&amp;quot; to find girls, I still have my frame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to me, all of this &amp;#39;fapping kills your game&amp;#39; seems like correlation and not causation. Just a coincidence that most guys masturbate quite often and most guys don&amp;#39;t get much pussy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When fapping is just an excuse not to improve your game, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; it is an issue. But I don&amp;#39;t agree that fapping alone will kill your game and turn you into a beta loser in itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dgaik9d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492280350.0, "created_utc": 1492251550.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i8ea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i8ea", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i8ea", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb34tm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anabolic92", "parent_id": "t1_dgb2za4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nah I jack off once a week and sometimes not even to porn", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nah I jack off once a week and sometimes not even to porn&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dgb34tm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492314777.0, "created_utc": 1492285977.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb2za4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DB1116", "parent_id": "t1_dgaip42", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Bro you're balding because you watch too much porn", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bro you&amp;#39;re balding because you watch too much porn&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dgb2za4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492314568.0, "created_utc": 1492285768.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaip42", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anabolic92", "parent_id": "t3_65i8ea", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Everything when abused is bad.\n\nAs well as for some men quitting pornography would help them to reach real sex, to some is actually the last resort.\n\nTo me get real sex is almost impossible, being bald white and young, and I don't have much free time between work and studying.\n\nSo porn is nothing but the best I can get to real sex given the actual times and sexual revolution we have experienced within the last decades.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything when abused is bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As well as for some men quitting pornography would help them to reach real sex, to some is actually the last resort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me get real sex is almost impossible, being bald white and young, and I don&amp;#39;t have much free time between work and studying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So porn is nothing but the best I can get to real sex given the actual times and sexual revolution we have experienced within the last decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dgaip42", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492280774.0, "created_utc": 1492251974.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65i8ea", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb23av", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Red_Shirt_Blue_Pants", "parent_id": "t3_65i8ea", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is this srsly a fucking meme now? \"Long story about why masturbating is wrong.
