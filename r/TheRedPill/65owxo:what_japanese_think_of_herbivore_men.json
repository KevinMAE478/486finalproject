giving a bonus for buying the same CD several times and every one of them having the chance of containing a ticket to a special live concert (AKB48, Love Live, etc) &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wide variety and availability of escort and sex services, see soap lands, Host/ess bars, sex-toy industry, love hotels &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;General problems that are a mix of everything: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;People can&amp;#39;t move out from home, because it&amp;#39;s expensive and they don&amp;#39;t have a good enough job and they don&amp;#39;t have a romantic partner to live with so they end up pursuing their personal hobbies / interests =&amp;gt; logistical problems for casual sex &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The trains stop at midnight in Tokyo and earlier in other places =&amp;gt; more logistical problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Social anxiety, bullying and similar problems are dealt with turning inward and the family just accepts it or is unable to effectively deal with it =&amp;gt;
