You will have to accept the fact that for long term aesthetic gains, you will have to sacrifice your short-term aesthetics and just bulk up whilst lifting. The only way you can realistically achieve this goal is through the use of steroids, which I am assuming you don't want to do.\n\n&gt; The bloated look that you see every morning could be due to a high sodium diet which forces your body to retain a lot of water which gives most people the bloated look. With regards to what diet you should be following, that is completely up to you as long as you track your calories/macro's. When you are bulking, it doesn't really matter what you are eating as long as it is not complete shit and you eat enough (which is more than you would think, so force yourself to over-eat if you really want to commit to a bulk). When you are cutting, you will be eating at a caloric deficit so each calorie is precious. Each calorie really should be from clean sources of food (i.e. chicken breast, brown rice, lean beef etc) with little to no sugar because they are considered \"empty\". It seems highly unlikely that you are actually putting a disproportional amount of fat in your facial area, but if it is true, it simply out of your control. If you could target area's for fat loss through exercise, I would recommend excessive smiling for facial cardio, which is absurd. You are just going to have to lose weight overall.\n\n&gt; From the looks of it, your workout plan seems stupid; there is no reason to do that many reps of a single exercise. I'm assuming you've done this for a while and you would have gotten everything you could have out of these exercises. The only way to improve is to add more weight or do more reps. To do more reps when you are already doing 100 is plain stupid. I highly recommend you start lifting with actual weight so you can *overload* and track your progress and see actual gains. Also, ditch pushups and start doing pushing movements that you can easily overload i.e. barbell bench press, dips etc. I hate cardio and never do it but if you want to do it for health purposes you can keep doing it but it is absolutely not necessary for either muscle gain or fat loss, just make sure you account for it in your training so you don't tire yourself out. Training to failure often is retarded; it causes injury and is counterproductive as you are not giving your body enough time to recover. If you don't know what type of training you should be doing, start off with any cookie cutter strength program and do some reading on training principles. Once you grasp the concept of *progressive overloading* and *periodization*, you can start to make your own training programs that will target your weak points or focus on what you want to improve on.\nOff the top of my head this is all I can come up with, hope this helps.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a repost but contains information that noob lifters may find useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, you cannot simultaneously lose fat and gain muscle apart from your early stage of a lifting career. You will have to accept the fact that for long term aesthetic gains, you will have to sacrifice your short-term aesthetics and just bulk up whilst lifting. The only way you can realistically achieve this goal is through the use of steroids, which I am assuming you don&amp;#39;t want to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bloated look that you see every morning could be due to a high sodium diet which forces your body to retain a lot of water which gives most people the bloated look. With regards to what diet you should be following, that is completely up to you as long as you track your calories/macro&amp;#39;s. When you are bulking, it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter what you are eating as long as it is not complete shit and you eat enough (which is more than you would think, so force yourself to over-eat if you really want to commit to a bulk). When you are cutting, you will be eating at a caloric deficit so each calorie is precious. Each calorie really should be from clean sources of food (i.e. chicken breast, brown rice, lean beef etc) with little to no sugar because they are considered &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot;. It seems highly unlikely that you are actually putting a disproportional amount of fat in your facial area, but if it is true, it simply out of your control. If you could target area&amp;#39;s for fat loss through exercise, I would recommend excessive smiling for facial cardio, which is absurd. You are just going to have to lose weight overall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the looks of it, your workout plan seems stupid; there is no reason to do that many reps of a single exercise.
