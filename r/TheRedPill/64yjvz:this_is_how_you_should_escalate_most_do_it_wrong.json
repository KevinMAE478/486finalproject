Having gotten very good at it, I barely do anything else. The rest is all icing on the cake; so long as you can already open, are attractive and have a vaguely presentable house, etc, etc. The other stuff I&amp;#39;ve been over before so go and read that if you are weak there. Escalation comes &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; these, not before. If you&amp;#39;re only good at escalation you are what is called a &amp;#39;sex offender&amp;#39; so make sure you start improving yourself before you try something like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m assuming this will be used for one-night stands and the like so I\u2019m writing for that. If you\u2019re using this during the day, just move slower but do the same things. The fundamentals are unchanged, I used ONS\u2019s because I can write it out as one interaction. Obviously meet-ups add extra steps, I\u2019ll go over those later. These are the fundamentals of escalation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key to good escalation is gradually ramping the sexual tension. Everything is about building it up, making it palpable and letting it be the force which drives the interaction. Touch is great, but it isn\u2019t the king as commonly thought. The most important point is to &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; build that sexual tension, even if that means &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; touching the girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing you want to do is &lt;strong&gt;never break the sexual tension when you open.&lt;/strong&gt; You don\u2019t want to walk up and make the girl think with a logical question like \u201cWho lies more, midgets or ethnics?\u201d You want a low-to-no context opener, something that doesn\u2019t add pressure. The pressure should be coming from the sexual tension, anything in addition to that can cause too much and blow the whole thing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is good to establish touch from the outset. The quicker you start touching them, the quicker you know if they\u2019re interested or out for other reasons. It also stops it from becoming awkward later and will make them more bold in touching you. Just a hand on the waist, a hug or something similar is fine. Keep it basic. You don\u2019t need 10000 advanced kino techniques and secret PUA \u2018incidental undercover seduction sequences\u2019 or whatever is the rage now. Mostly anything is fine- the exception being aggressive stuff- because timing is the main thing. The \u2018wrong\u2019 touch is more often due to being too early or late to fit the moment. It\u2019s all about reading that vibe and slowly- or more accurately, gradually- increasing the level of intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last, after you open hold strong eye contact &lt;em&gt;and wait for them to reply.&lt;/em&gt; This is big: a huge part of creating sexual tension is just waiting for the girl to reply instead of trying to crush silence with witty banter. You want the girl to be giggling and saying &lt;em&gt;\u201cWhat? Why are you staring at me?\u201d&lt;/em&gt; or some such. It\u2019s a thin line from here to \u201cWhy is this creep staring at me?\u201d but it isn\u2019t hard to learn where it is. To give an idea, you want to be looking away from eye-contact with a girl 2/10 times and staring her down 8/10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note please that you will usually have to do 60%+ of the talking for the first few minutes. I&amp;#39;ve found there is a general correlation between how hot the girl is and how much you&amp;#39;ll have to over-talk to start, but it hooks the same and they end up speaking ~80% after a few minutes. I&amp;#39;ve heard Krauser call it &amp;quot;the Russian minute&amp;quot; because apparently Russian girls lord it, but that doesn&amp;#39;t jibe with my experience. I&amp;#39;ve found if I don&amp;#39;t approach overly focused or zoned-out looking girls I just don&amp;#39;t get this as much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Order of Importance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Proximity. Nothing beats proximity. Gradually \u2018floating\u2019 towards the girl; or pulling her towards you will do all the work. If ONE thing is responsible for my success it would just be being closer to the girls. If  ever 1v1ing for a girl and the l33t Am0g tactix don&amp;#39;t work good, just be closer to her. If there is a group of guy friends who want to take her away, just be closer to her (and befriend another girl). You can literally turn your back on the competition if you\u2019re the one in her face. Plus it turns girls on immensely, for a lot of reasons that should be common sense here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Eye contact. You want to be the centre of her world; at least for tonight. You want her to be guessing about what you\u2019re thinking, because here is the thing: She will &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; in terms of raw intuition exactly what you\u2019re doing. She will know you want to fuck her and you\u2019re acting this way to turn her on. But 99.99% of guys can\u2019t keep a secret for shit and &lt;em&gt;even worse&lt;/em&gt; can\u2019t keep their cool while sexual tension builds. Just not breaking it puts you ahead of all of them. Holding eye contact and saying \u201cnothing, just thinking about my cat\u201d or LITERALLY ANYTHING but mentioning that elephant in the room &lt;strong&gt;is game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sticky eyes:&lt;/strong&gt; When you must break eye contact, try to do so as &lt;em&gt;slowly&lt;/em&gt; as possible. You look away, but it takes 2-3 seconds to not be eye-to-eye anymore. You start turning your head first, leting your eyes linger and then slowly moving them away. This will &lt;em&gt;melt&lt;/em&gt; girls. It makes them feel incredibly desired and I\u2019ve had girls comment that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; was the reason they fucked me. It also serves to build tension without risking creepy as much, because you aren\u2019t just staring at bitches like an axe murderer sizing up their neck. The writer I heard it from referred to it as having honey connecting your eyes, so it makes them move slowly apart. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Voice. You want to be talking low most of the time. When you open speak up, but start to talk quieter and more intimately as soon as possible. Your voice gives you control over the tempo of the interaction. Occasionally you\u2019ll want to spike it. Sometimes it\u2019s right to do that before you pull them by excitedly talking about the after-party. Other times you\u2019ll need to entertain her friend for a minute so she knows you\u2019re not a psycho. On the other hand, it is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; strong in louder bars with a quiet area to start whispering into her ear and turn your ear for her to do the same. A whispered conversation is super-sexy (seriously try it: feels awesome) as long as your breath is good. Buy some fucking mints, don\u2019t screw this up because whispering is boss and you should probably be doing it more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Touch. I put this late because I think the importance of touch is exaggerated. It is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important, don\u2019t get me wrong, but focusing on it &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; is a bad idea. It is what touch does for the interaction, not the touch itself, that matters. Basically you just want to be maintaining proximity, gradually getting closer to the girl and letting your touch grow naturally off that. At first it might be occasional light brushes of her arms and body. Then you might be sitting next to each other and you pull her legs over yours. Then your arm is around her\u2026. Etc. You are gradually growing closer physically so of course touch comes off that. Proximity is the basis of escalation partly because it is the foundation for touch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Pacing. This is kind of a nebulous concept and really you need experience to gauge this. Keep the above in mind first, work on them, then over time you will start to see sometimes you can shift up a gear and escalate &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; whereas other times you need to go slower than usual. It also changes as you go along. For example, beginners should try to open every girl and kiss any girl who likes them. For intermediates and advanced, I would say only open interested girls and &lt;em&gt;don\u2019t&lt;/em&gt; kiss the girl in public. In my experience, it offers a release of sexual tension to the girl and takes away the sense of urgency that drives her to needing to fuck you. Instead she has a nice little ending for her story of the night, she goes home with your number and you go home with your hand. The point where I used to think \u201cI should kiss her now\u201d is where I say \u201cIt\u2019s hot in here, let\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escalating to the Pull&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting the girl home is pretty simple. Usually I two step it: I\u2019ll make an excuse to leave the bar/event and then try to figure out her logistics. At this stage I\u2019ll decide whether to pull home, go for a public pull or go to her place. Sometimes you realize here that it\u2019s a lost cause but that\u2019s pretty rare and you learn to avoid those girls very quickly- they usually respond well to everything up to kissing, but always try to be the first to disengage, hesitate to leave with you and aren&amp;#39;t comfortable with sexual touch, like ass-grabbing etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say something like \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, the music is too loud to talk.\u201d A lot of the time she\u2019ll bring up friends, just say \u201cLet\u2019s go tell them we\u2019re going for a walk.\u201d She just wants you to take responsibility and let her friends know she is safe with you. It\u2019s often a good idea to take one of the friends numbers here- make a joke about chicks phones always dying from Facebook or something. This sets their minds at ease and if you say this before they bring up excuses why she can\u2019t go, they usually won\u2019t. You\u2019re also subtly saying \u201cI do this a lot, don\u2019t worry she\u2019s in good hands\u201d without seeming like an asshole. The more often you can slyly communicate this the better, though overtly saying \u201cI get so much pussy I\u2019m drowning\u201d will backfire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Determine where you are pulling: ask her what her plans are for the rest of tonight. She might be staying with a friend and therefore you have an hour to have sex in public. She might have work early; you can go to her house but have to be quick. No matter where you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; pull, walk somewhere semi-private, start hooking up passionately and then suddenly stop. Say \u201cDo you want to come see my (macaroni art collection)?\u201d IE some excuse to go to your house. Or walk past a potential sex-location and say \u201cHey, let\u2019s go explore that golf course.\u201d I obviously don\u2019t know where you will be having sex in public, so you should figure out your own here. Where I live most of the good bars and clubs are in suburbs, so I generally go for golf courses, football fields and the like. I\u2019ve done construction sites a few times, once a hospital (didn\u2019t know, accidentally), a few schools, a national monument\u2026 just anything nearby, secluded and with an allure. Don\u2019t obsess over the perfect location, the girl doesn\u2019t give a fuck. I vividly remember one of my first public pulls being up a staircase of a condemned building at university where the maths students could see us They had a second-story view of me pounding this girl from behind. I said \u201cWe have an audience\u201d and she said \u201cI don\u2019t care, let them watch.\u201d This has been repeated multiple times with about as much paraphrasing as I just used. For the most part girls don\u2019t seem to care about being seen having sex because the moment has taken over. What she cares about is being seen in the lead-up to that sex, so you just should be in private enough for the foreplay to be secret. Weird but true, at least in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the girl again after public sex, the best thing to do is either walk her back to her friends and hang out for a bit or get her home safely. You should be maintaining a conspiratorial vibe, never break it and hi-five your bros afterwards. Just smirk now and again, maybe make a few jokes like \u201cYeah, we just went and played some golf.\u201d Everyone knows so don\u2019t be crude, that just makes you seem like this isn\u2019t something you\u2019re used to. You want her to wonder how often this happens for you, while you want to present the \u2018wow how crazy that this happened\u2019 face to her. She should have suspicions you\u2019re a player, not have you telling her that or seeming like you genuinely don\u2019t get this very often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you take a girl to your house, make sure you have it fairly presentable. I\u2019ve said this to death so I won\u2019t go over it again. Putting in even 5% extra effort here is immense by the way: Having a candle, some nice music or a stuffed animal is often the difference between her letting loose and her feeling uncomfortable. The main goal is to make her comfortable so definitely do these things. &lt;em&gt;Actually do the thing you said you would do&lt;/em&gt;. Don&amp;#39;t drop the game yet. It becomes a conspiracy, she knows you didn&amp;#39;t bring her back to see your etch-n-sketch self portrait, but you haven&amp;#39;t made a move yet and you&amp;#39;re actually showing it to her... Usually the girl starts just complimenting whatever you show her and lots of touch as you talk about sock-puppets is enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;re hooking up, just make out and stay relaxed. Maybe grope her tits and ass if she&amp;#39;s cool with that. Then hold her neck for a bit, pull her hair a little, trace circles on her thighs/stomach, breathe into her ear/neck (&amp;#39;oohs&amp;#39;=cold, &amp;#39;ahhs&amp;#39;=hot)... eventually you&amp;#39;ll do something and the response is &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than before. That&amp;#39;s when you flick the switch and start going for sex. Start kissing hard, squeezing and pulling apart her ass cheeks, grinding into her, biting or choking &lt;strong&gt;softly&lt;/strong&gt; etc. Put her hand on your dick, start teasing her pussy and eventually she will start pulling your dick towards her pussy. She is telling you to put it in. Do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The above is how the vast majority of bedtime shenanigans go these days. I wish I could have seen that paragraph in 2011 and known what I actually had to do to go from the clothes on kissing on the bed to the clothes off penetration stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also if you want ideas for new things to do that turn girls on and get them to &lt;em&gt;need you&lt;/em&gt;, ask them. They&amp;#39;re usually pretty open about it because they enjoy being turned on. I wish I started doing that earlier as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To rehash escalation is thus:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t make her overtly uncomfortable, don\u2019t rock the boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do make her feel \u2018on edge\u2019 by ramping up the sexual tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It honestly is more about not fucking up then it is doing anything in particular right. Time and proximity will do all the work for you, she will fill in the blanks to turn herself on. Just talk the minimum amount, you should listen intently to her and keep getting closer. I say \u201cdon\u2019t talk much\u201d because the less you say, the less chance you can say the wrong thing. Again- that is more important. This will work if you give it time, just give yourself that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**PRELIMINARY**\n\n\nClickbait title is a joke, I spend way too much time thinking of titles that don't even matter. \n\n\nEscalation is not my strongest point in game... it is my game.

I vividly remember one of my first public pulls being up a staircase of a condemned building at university where the maths students could see us They had a second-story view of me pounding this girl from behind. I said \u201cWe have an audience\u201d and she said \u201cI don\u2019t care, let them watch.\u201d This has been repeated multiple times with about as much paraphrasing as I just used. For the most part girls don\u2019t seem to care about being seen having sex because the moment has taken over. What she cares about is being seen in the lead-up to that sex, so you just should be in private enough for the foreplay to be secret. Weird but true, at least in my experience.\n\n\nIf you want to see the girl again after public sex, the best thing to do is either walk her back to her friends and hang out for a bit or get her home safely. You should be maintaining a conspiratorial vibe, never break it and hi-five your bros afterwards. Just smirk now and again, maybe make a few jokes like \u201cYeah, we just went and played some golf.\u201d Everyone knows so don\u2019t be crude, that just makes you seem like this isn\u2019t something you\u2019re used to. You want her to wonder how often this happens for you, while you want to present the \u2018wow how crazy that this happened\u2019 face to her. She should have suspicions you\u2019re a player, not have you telling her that or seeming like you genuinely don\u2019t get this very often.\n\n\nWhen you take a girl to your house, make sure you have it fairly presentable. I\u2019ve said this to death so I won\u2019t go over it again. Putting in even 5% extra effort here is immense by the way: Having a candle, some nice music or a stuffed animal is often the difference between her letting loose and her feeling uncomfortable. The main goal is to make her comfortable so definitely do these things. *Actually do the thing you said you would do*. Don't drop the game yet. It becomes a conspiracy, she knows you didn't bring her back to see your etch-n-sketch self portrait, but you haven't made a move yet and you're actually showing it to her... Usually the girl starts just complimenting whatever you show her and lots of touch as you talk about sock-puppets is enough.\n\n\nWhen you're hooking up, just make out and stay relaxed. Maybe grope her tits and ass if she's cool with that. Then hold her neck for a bit, pull her hair a little, trace circles on her thighs/stomach, breathe into her ear/neck ('oohs'=cold, 'ahhs'=hot)... eventually you'll do something and the response is *more* than before. That's when you flick the switch and start going for sex. Start kissing hard, squeezing and pulling apart her ass cheeks, grinding into her, biting or choking **softly** etc. Put her hand on your dick, start teasing her pussy and eventually she will start pulling your dick towards her pussy. She is telling you to put it in. Do so.\n\n\nThe above is how the vast majority of bedtime shenanigans go these days. I wish I could have seen that paragraph in 2011 and known what I actually had to do to go from the clothes on kissing on the bed to the clothes off penetration stage.\n\n\nAlso if you want ideas for new things to do that turn girls on and get them to *need you*, ask them. They're usually pretty open about it because they enjoy being turned on. I wish I started doing that earlier as well.\n\n\n**Summary**\n\n\nTo rehash escalation is thus:\n\n1.\tDon\u2019t make her overtly uncomfortable, don\u2019t rock the boat.\n\n2.\tDo make her feel \u2018on edge\u2019 by ramping up the sexual tension.\n\n\nIt honestly is more about not fucking up then it is doing anything in particular right. Time and proximity will do all the work for you, she will fill in the blanks to turn herself on. Just talk the minimum amount, you should listen intently to her and keep getting closer. I say \u201cdon\u2019t talk much\u201d because the less you say, the less chance you can say the wrong thing. Again- that is more important. This will work if you give it time, just give yourself that time.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "", "id": "64yjvz", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 942, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bigjohnthug", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64yjvz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.TheRedPill", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "unflaired", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/TheRedPill/comments/64yjvz/this_is_how_you_should_escalate_most_do_it_wrong/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492036829.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/64yjvz/this_is_how_you_should_escalate_most_do_it_wrong/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "This is How You Should Escalate (most do it wrong!)", "created_utc": 1492008029.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 124, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 942}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjvz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjvz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjvz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjvz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjvz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjvz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8r7f2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeeDeeDa", "parent_id": "t1_dg8mkym", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well if you meet someone like Buck Angels and think \"trans\" you have a better perception than 99.99% of the population.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well if you meet someone like Buck Angels and think &amp;quot;trans&amp;quot; you have a better perception than 99.99% of the population.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dg8r7f2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492172742.0, "created_utc": 1492143942.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8mkym", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jeezydasnowman", "parent_id": "t1_dg8lsso", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Hard\" lmao.

Your ex was amazing!

You don't want to bring girls up, or treat it like you \"get a lot of girls\" because you don't, they just throw themselves at you.\n\nHere is a really good example of the difference in attitude: Last year I went on this date to a restaurant/bar with a girl I was semi-serious with. We were eating when another girl came over, complimented her a bunch then cold ignored her and got really touchy with me. I'd fucked this girl about a year before, we'd stopped talking but obviously seeing me out with another hottie stoked her passions. I was polite, I was nice but not really flirty. She did things like lean over the table to hug me instead of walking around- thus huge load of boob in my face and my date was staring at her back- and the other typical flirty laughing too loud, etc. I would hug her back, but not squeeze like she was. I would let her touch my chest, but not reciprocate. I occasionally looked at my date as if to say \"What's up with this chick?\"\n\nThen the girl left. \"Who was that?\" Me: \"I'm not sure.\" I went back to my meal, she now believed that girls just come up to me and do this shit.\n\nThat sums up the vibe perfectly. She wants to imagine you going out, being nice to people and doing your own thing at the bar. She wants to imagine you sitting there talking to your boys when some hottie just throws herself at you. This makes you seem like a ludicrously good catch; whereas seeming like a guy who can pickup any girl is a sexfiend and she will always blame you for any flirting, even if the girl initiates. She also won't feel the need to 'compete' because it's you who is the dirty sex rat. She won't stick around... you get the picture. Try to seem like a lot of girls want you vs you get a lot of girls.

I&amp;#39;m trying to gauge whether this is too much what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the last period of time I&amp;#39;ve challenged myself to be as open as possible about my thoughts and ofc i&amp;#39;m seeing progress. I was also holding back some low-key replies about my open, polygamous attitude with women and right now i&amp;#39;m deciding up to which point i&amp;#39;m controlling it. thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dg94jy8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492205419.0, "created_utc": 1492176619.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjvz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjvz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjvz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yjvz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6wayu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bigjohnthug", "parent_id": "t1_dg6q2i4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "To be honest I don't drive, however I know the absence of touch and eye contact can build sexual tension very well so I'd focus on my conversational pacing and tonality to turn her on.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest I don&amp;#39;t drive, however I know the absence of touch and eye contact can build sexual tension very well so I&amp;#39;d focus on my conversational pacing and tonality to turn her on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dg6wayu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492074658.0, "created_utc": 1492045858.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6q2i4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RickNiccello", "parent_id": "t1_dg6lndp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't mean cold approaching, I mean when I've set a date up via tinder or whatever.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean cold approaching, I mean when I&amp;#39;ve set a date up via tinder or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dg6q2i4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492067029.0, "created_utc": 1492038229.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6lndp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bigjohnthug", "parent_id": "t1_dg6gq7z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's probably better to pick up girls on foot and lead them to your car then try to get them from your car.
