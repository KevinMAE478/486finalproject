But at this point I&amp;#39;m just talking to her because I&amp;#39;m actually having fun. My state carried over and I&amp;#39;m just shooting the shit with her having a fun convo. Her body language was positive and welcoming. We talk until she leaves to meet her boyfriend. My mission to stay until the girl leaves or rejects me completely had given me a new grasp on outcome independence. I&amp;#39;m now staying and having fun instead of staying to push the convo towards a number or insta date. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a little late right now and I&amp;#39;m meeting a girl from okcupid soon so I&amp;#39;m going home to prepare.
