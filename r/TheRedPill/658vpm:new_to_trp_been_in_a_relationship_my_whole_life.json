I have had a girlfriend (who is 23) for the past 7.5 years. That&amp;#39;s right, I started dating her when I was 15 or so. I want to first describe the background to how I got with her to better frame this entire thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was in early middle school, I had ONEitis bad; I was the typical nice guy beta who tried so hard to get this one chick. And what a surprise, she LJBF&amp;#39;d me and never got with me. After going after her for literally 2 years, I was super distraught and angry. Although I was only like 12 or something, it really hit home. So, then I started not giving a fuck with women, and started working on my flirting game. By the end of middle school and the beginning of high school, I was kind of spinning plates. I was too much of a pussy (I was just scared and nervous at the time) to actually get with any of them, but I flirted with many girls who flirted back, and a few offered to fuck me or give me a bj. I can&amp;#39;t explain why I didn&amp;#39;t (again, I had never done it before and I was like 13 or 14) so I declined. I was really working my game though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of my freshman year, one of those spinning plates was my current gf. I flirted with her for a bit, and when she stopped flirting back, I dropped the plate. After I started flirting and getting with some other girl, my gf wanted me BAD. I told her to wait a few weeks, and maybe I would change my mind. Now, this sounds pretty alpha (and it was), I just had no idea I was doing it. Well, a few weeks went by, and I didn&amp;#39;t get with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward about a year later, she still wants to get with me, and I am still not letting her. This was mostly because I wasn&amp;#39;t really sure I wanted a relationship. Anyway, after another few months (and not being aware of TRP at the time coupled with me being a naive 15 year old) I started dating her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few concluding thoughts from the background are that I was pretty alpha without knowing it and she was a plate. I think I have always had some of the TRP principles in me, I just never knew I used them or had them. Also, she was a plate, which I think is a good thing, but I&amp;#39;m not sure. Anyway, let me progress to summarizing the past 7 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Relationship for the Past 7 Years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, only being 15, and her being 16, we really didn&amp;#39;t know what the fuck we were doing. However, I definitely held all the power in the relationship-she first offered to give me a handjob (I had never done it before). Then, the next week a blowjob. And, after the first year, sex. Now while this seems like it is moving very slowly, please keep in mind our age at the time. Things were going alright, but there were definitely shit tests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember very vividly there were times where she would try to stop me from seeing my friends, or subtly get upset at the fact that I was spending time with other people. She would do the same thing when I mentioned my female friends. Again, not being aware of TRP, I started doing one of two things to keep from upsetting her: 1) I would lie to her. I have lied to her so many times about things that are so mundane, especially when we were teens. I went to my female &amp;#39;friend&amp;#39;s&amp;#39; house and lied to her saying I went to a male friend&amp;#39;s. I have lied to her and said that I am home alone when I am out with my friends, etc. Or 2) I would give in, and just hang out with her instead of my friends. I didn&amp;#39;t make it a big deal, but it definitely annoyed me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The past 6 years was the typical relationship shit, with us calling each other pet names, saying how much we love each other - ONEitis shit. While this all happened, though, I definitely kept a relatively strong frame, or at least I still had the power in the relationship in the sense that she needed me MUCH more than I needed her. The biggest changes happened in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year, she started becoming distant from me after some arguments over religion (I&amp;#39;m an atheist, she is not), children (she wants them, I&amp;#39;m not sure), and other things. There was a dead bedroom for literally 4-5 months, and she rejected all of my initiations. I wish I could say I dropped her ass, but I beta-ed out. I cried like a bitch, wrote her love notes, bought her shit, etc. The rationale for me was that I was going to try everything in my power to keep her as my gf, and if she didn&amp;#39;t come back to normal by X date, I was going to break up with her. The motivation was more out of making sure that I was not to blame for this failing relationship than anything. Well, it almost came to the point where I broke it with her, but she came back apologizing and making up to me etc. While that was a year ago, it still fuels emotions in me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over that past year, I really healed a lot. I realized that this relationship - a 7 year &amp;#39;sure thing&amp;#39; as I had thought it - is not permanent nor destined. I am MUCH more reserved in showing too much affection to her, and try not to repeat my past mistake. She sometimes gets frustrated with how I am act now (more conservative with loving her I suppose you could say). I remember just in February she claimed &amp;quot;I wish it was the way it was before.&amp;quot; It hurt me, but at the same time I was okay with her being upset. I have some anger in me now that&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;Bitch, do you have any idea what you put me through those 4-5 months last year? Get the fuck out of here.&amp;quot; But I still respect her and I do love her. I just want to make sure I am on the right track with everything. I want to make sure that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am happy and that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am getting the most out of life. So, I want to talk about where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Position&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I literally just started reading the Rational Male book, so I am no expert in TRP (if that&amp;#39;s obvious enough). I want to describe my very recent experiences so that you can make sense of them for me and also give me some suggestions. In regards to my relationship, I am still with her, and I am being more alpha in regards to doing what I want (most of the time). I think it is still important to compromise, but I do what I want if it is important to me. I have recently been hitting up strip clubs, but I don&amp;#39;t know why. Like this week I hit one up by myself, flirted with some chicks, etc. I don&amp;#39;t get to flirt with girls often at all because I never go out (I have work, grad school work, or I am with the gf or friends). I don&amp;#39;t know why I am hitting up strip clubs, but I think I am done with that since all they want is my money, and there not fucking worth it. I am hiding the fact that I went to strip clubs from my gf, as she is super jealous and would freak out if she knew. If she asked me if I have ever been to one, I would probably lie. Part of me feels like that&amp;#39;s beta though? What are your thoughts with this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have taken up hobbies such as guitar and MMA, which I consistently have practiced 3-4 times per week for a few months now. I don&amp;#39;t go to the gym because of the cost, but I might soon (I used to 2 years ago, but it got pretty expensive). I am trying to develop more professionally, but as a teacher, it is hard - there is no merit based promotions in the typical sense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She, however, is putting pressure on me to marry her. I don&amp;#39;t really answer her, but she will - every few months or so - make a &amp;#39;joke&amp;#39; about getting married. I&amp;#39;m not necessarily against getting married to her, in fact I&amp;#39;m not against it at all, I just want to wait. I&amp;#39;m not in a position to lose much of my shit, she makes more than me; but I am NOT getting married now. She got us rings to wear on our wedding finger, which I typically do and she does too. Again, this might be the wrong move, idk. It would definitely hurt her if I didn&amp;#39;t wear it. What should I do with this? I have already worn it for the past 6-7 months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So where do I go from here? What am I still fucking up on, and what should I be doing? I already plan on finishing the Rational Male, but what should I actually be &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; to get the most out of my life and relationship? Please ask questions if you need more info, I want to get something out of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I think this is going to be a long post, because I want to get as much as I can out of this; therefore, I think it is best to say everything so that responses can be as precise and helpful as possible. \n\n**Intro**\n\nI am currently 22 years old, a recent graduate of college, and I started a job as a high school teacher this year.

It doesn&amp;#39;t sound like you did this at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you are treating her badly to punish her for what she supposedly did to you. I do not think that&amp;#39;s the right way to treat a loved one and it&amp;#39;s unproductive too. Why not just break up with her? Sounds like she&amp;#39;ll be better off without you and this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flirting with strippers/waitresses at a strip club? They likely have 0 interest in you and just want your money so don&amp;#39;t take these experiences as any sort of info on how well you&amp;#39;ll do with women whom you don&amp;#39;t have to pay for their time/attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you are too wrapped up in calling certain behaviours &amp;#39;alpha&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;beta&amp;#39; and that only &amp;#39;alpha&amp;#39; behaviour is the way to go. I think that&amp;#39;s a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think you should lie to your partner about where you are and what you are doing. If you think she won&amp;#39;t approve, maybe talk to her about it. Find out why you feel the need to go to strip clubs, ask her if/why she has a problem with it and take it from there. Would you be happy if she goes to see male strippers?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like she&amp;#39;s looking for a committed relationship and looking to marry soon (perhaps start a family). It sounds like you are not at all looking for this as you come across as selfish and unsure about what you want. It&amp;#39;s not uncommon for people who start dating at such a young age to find out that years later, they really no longer have much in common and/or want (very) different things. I think you are wasting her time by still &amp;#39;being with her&amp;#39; and you are wasting your own time too. I don&amp;#39;t think you are doing her any favours by being with her. She could be single now and looking for a man with more similar views and ambitions and so can you (maybe you don&amp;#39;t want to be seeing anyone at the moment and just want to work on yourself?).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you should ask yourself if you want what she wants and if those aren&amp;#39;t the same, if you could find a middle ground or perhaps just go your own ways. I honestly do not think you are bringing anything to her and it sounds like she&amp;#39;s a bad match for you. Just break up so she can still find a better match and you are free to find out who you are and what you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dg9x19i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492240526.0, "created_utc": 1492211726.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658vpm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga4ff2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Godskook", "parent_id": "t3_658vpm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "One question that, imho, must be answered a certain way for a chick to be worth marrying:\n\nDo you believe in moral absolutes, or are they relative?\n\nAsk her in a playful time when she's not expecting you to be serious.
