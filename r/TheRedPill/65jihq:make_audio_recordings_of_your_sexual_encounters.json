This week, it paid off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one girl I met through Bumble was throwing out suspicious signs. She was a 20-year-old single mom and steered our initial conversation to my career. She definitely seemed like she was looking for a sugar daddy and her profile said she &amp;quot;wanted a guy who has his life together and would treat her like a princess&amp;quot;. She drove in from a town over an hour away to do drinks with me so I knew that she was planning on staying the night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for some background about myself, I&amp;#39;m finishing up my master&amp;#39;s degree, and in about a month, I&amp;#39;ll be permanently leaving the city I currently live in to start medical school in another state. I didn&amp;#39;t mention this fact to her until after we&amp;#39;d already had sex because I knew it would throw everything off. I ended up casually mentioned this to her the morning after, and she predictably flipped out. She started screaming about how she was drunk the night before and I took advantage of her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept my cool and didn&amp;#39;t mention anything about the recording device. Last thing I needed was for her to fuck with it in any way. I just needed her to keep talking to dig herself into a hole. Note that the recorder was still recording from last night so everything she was saying during her tantrum was all on tape. I let her do most of the talking, but I steered the conversation to her basically admitting that she wanted to have sex the night before but was now upset about it because she found out I was leaving. Bingo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No accusations yet, but I&amp;#39;m confident I&amp;#39;ll be covered if, on the off chance, she does try.

I simply set the recorder to record before I go out and let it run throughout the night. The battery life is almost 24 hours so doing this isn&amp;#39;t an issue. If you have one with lower battery life, get a cheap external USB battery pack which can extend the battery life of the recorder to days/over a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a phone/computer for recording is also an option but you&amp;#39;ll likely need a special external microphone because the microphones built into these devices aren&amp;#39;t built for capturing audio in a room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When things are getting hot and heavy, I say in a joking way that the girl has to ask for it nicely if she wants my dick.

The situation doesn&amp;#39;t always lead to this, but I make an effort to usually do this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s much better if you live in a one-party recording consent state. These states require that only one person in the conversation knows that a recording is taking place for it to be legally admissible. Other states are two-party states and require that both parties are aware if a recording is taking place. Even if you live in a two-party state, I still suggest you make a recording because it can&amp;#39;t hurt. It won&amp;#39;t be admissible in court, but it&amp;#39;ll be a useful tool to deter the girl if she tries pulling something later. If you live in a two-party consent state, do not reveal that you have a recording to her over any traceable means. Only mention it or play it for her in person after you&amp;#39;ve made a copy for safekeeping. As far as I know, it&amp;#39;s a felony if you record a conversation without the other person&amp;#39;s knowledge in a two-party consent state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After having sex, think of a reason to have the girl send you a text message later in the day.

Now a first generation immigrant to Sweden on the other hand is both less likely to affirm consent the Swedish way (because he either doesn&amp;#39;t know to or thinks it&amp;#39;s fucking stupid) and more likely to be accussed (i.e. if the girl is embarrassed / regretful after the fact and the guy is less likely to be able to legally articulate himself in court) and convicted  (because racism). So while you could argue this law is anti men in that it inconveniences / degrades all men I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if in practice and from a legal (conviction rate) perspective it ends up disproportionately disadvantaging honest dark men.

If you leave it on all the time nonstop like that and have proof of that you may be able to argue something in your favor, but I truly do not know. Fact is, a good lawyer could probably argue that this situation is not much different than home surveillance. Plus, you may be able to put up a sign that says there is home video/audio surveillance on your door to cover that disclosure. You don&amp;#39;t have to tell them where it is and if it is recording or not usually. Just that you may be recorded at any time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may even be able to argue that you record yourself having sex and that different intent may recategorize all of it sinking as that wasn&amp;#39;t illegal. May bring it down to making any part of the recording that isn&amp;#39;t a conversation admissible. It&amp;#39;s obvious which sex sounds consensual or not. Of course how any of this conjecture plays out depends on the state, the county, the judge etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like this post. This is the shit we have to do these days.
