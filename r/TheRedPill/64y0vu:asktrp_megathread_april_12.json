Text Game is extremely easy to improve. I used to use Yik Yak to hit on girls. Sometimes I was straightforward, sometimes I'd make a joke about her post and proceed getting more information about her. It helped me to learn how to text-escalate and handle shit tests. \n\nGame on the other hand is more difficult to improve. You'll have to fail a lot of times and then learn from your own mistakes. Whenever I cold or warm approached and didn't convert, I analyzed to see what I did wrong. I made a lot of mistakes soon after I swallowed the Red Pill last year. \n\nWith the first girl I approached at a social gathering I made a mistake by becoming too focused on her and not paying attention to other girls, and staring at her eyes all the time. It made me look too needy which is a turn off for a girl. Next mistake I made with a girl I cold approached is that we talked for too long, 30 minutes or so, and she ended up flaking, and then ghosted me. Third girl I approached was sitting by herself by the river and looked quite emotionally distressed. I approached her and tried to start a conversation, but she was constantly repeating that she doesn't want any company and that I should leave, but I held onto \"you should never leave, but wait for her to leave\" and I assumed those were shit tests and proceeded escalating. It just annoyed the shit out of her and after several minutes she told me she has three kids and a husband and asked me again to leave, so I left.\n\nAll in all, when you start approaching, prepare yourself for a lot of rejections, ghosts and flakes.

Text Game is extremely easy to improve. I used to use Yik Yak to hit on girls. Sometimes I was straightforward, sometimes I&amp;#39;d make a joke about her post and proceed getting more information about her. It helped me to learn how to text-escalate and handle shit tests. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Game on the other hand is more difficult to improve. You&amp;#39;ll have to fail a lot of times and then learn from your own mistakes. Whenever I cold or warm approached and didn&amp;#39;t convert, I analyzed to see what I did wrong. I made a lot of mistakes soon after I swallowed the Red Pill last year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the first girl I approached at a social gathering I made a mistake by becoming too focused on her and not paying attention to other girls, and staring at her eyes all the time. It made me look too needy which is a turn off for a girl. Next mistake I made with a girl I cold approached is that we talked for too long, 30 minutes or so, and she ended up flaking, and then ghosted me. Third girl I approached was sitting by herself by the river and looked quite emotionally distressed. I approached her and tried to start a conversation, but she was constantly repeating that she doesn&amp;#39;t want any company and that I should leave, but I held onto &amp;quot;you should never leave, but wait for her to leave&amp;quot; and I assumed those were shit tests and proceeded escalating. It just annoyed the shit out of her and after several minutes she told me she has three kids and a husband and asked me again to leave, so I left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, when you start approaching, prepare yourself for a lot of rejections, ghosts and flakes. Even if you manage to convert only 1 or 2 out of 10 approaches into dates, consider yourself successful. Just keep on improving your Game and learn from your past mistakes and never give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dg6pprm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492066582.0, "created_utc": 1492037782.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6dxc0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ShindyCool", "parent_id": "t3_64y0vu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In a book about depression I have read that when you are in a bad mood, focusing on what you do not have in an attempt to improve your state of mind only worsens the problem.\n\nIn regards to lack of women in my life, when should I actively approach, and when should I create abundance and happiness indirectly through (social) hobbies or engaging in self-improvement, even monk mode?\n\nI am at a point in my life where I have gone from 146 lbs to 177 lbs(6 ft 3) and gained self-confidence through lifting, had a very successful semester after slacking for one year, landed my first side job at university and met new people through extracurricular activities.
