You become boxed and filed away to whatever you let life dictate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Life does its best to box you from the very start.  Your entire life from the moment you are born people will categorize you.  Your parents will, your friends will, your school will, your teachers will, your job will, YOU will. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-This isn&amp;#39;t inherently a bad thing.

You do this because you've let them help define your image and you're afraid to step out of that box when you are around them (read: when you are in their frame).\n\nFor those having trouble with this, here's what worked for me: I had to spend some time away from the people (family, friends) who helped define my old image. If I didn't spend enough time away from them, I would inevitably regress back to my old self around them because I was worried I might seem \"fake\" by acting like a totally different person, or that they might see through my new image and think I was putting on a big act.\n\nIf this is how it is for you, you probably need to spend more time in monk mode (read: more time away from these people) until you are confident and comfortable enough in your new skin. Once you reach that confidence level, you won't feel as pressured to regress to your old self around these people.\n\nAlso, in regards to women, ideally you should be able to achieve abundance mentality on your own (with or without women). You can fake it til you make it if you need to, it really only takes **one plate** to really achieve that mentality. \n\nIf you can just get 1 consistent plate that you **know you can fuck any time you want**, you will approach new women with a genuine abundance mentality. When talking/gaming her, you will actually not really care if you close her or not (read: you will be outcome independent) because in the back of your mind you're thinking \"I'm just gonna go bang plate1 later if this doesn't work out.\"\n\nThis is exactly where you want to be mentally in all situations. The hardest part is faking it in order to get your first plate. Getting from 0 to 1 is 1000 times harder than getting from 1 to 3.

He&amp;#39;d tell the congregation to say things like &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m rich&amp;quot; in the mirror when you&amp;#39;re massively in debt, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m cured&amp;quot; when you&amp;#39;re terminally ill, etc. Abundance mentality is not lying about how dire your situation is. It is about being brutally honest in your estimate of what you have or don&amp;#39;t have, and believing against all temporary obstacles and naysayers that your hard work and focus &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; pay off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay away from positive energy mumbo jumbo stuff that bluepillers and women get into when they read books like &lt;em&gt;The Secret&lt;/em&gt; or anything by Joel Osteen. Redpill abundance mentality is staunch positivity in view of backbreaking and focused hard work and study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, OP isn&amp;#39;t saying the above, but I have good reason to believe some tubby would read what he wrote and twist it for his own lazy agenda. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hint: I was once that tubby. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "TheRedPill", "name": "t1_dg9tnom", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492236006.0, "created_utc": 1492207206.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o6tm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o6tm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o6tm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o6tm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o6tm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ve1u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64o6tm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5v8bu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "maybethistimeyes1", "parent_id": "t1_dg584p1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheRedPill", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If I make one person realize that red pill isn't a strategy, but a support group for men who either don't get laid or married a terrible woman, my work is a success.
