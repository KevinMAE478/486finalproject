Each brief time we hung out, I left her &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; when the conversation was sinking deeper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cute Japanese girls walk by a fountain at the restaurant with a camera, looking around for someone to take a picture for them. I make eye contact with the one holding the camera and smile. She walks over. &lt;em&gt;Notice: I did NOT approach her.&lt;/em&gt; She starts to try putting the phrase together, but instead, I ask her in Japanese if she wants me to take a picture of her and her friends, how her camera works, and even some joking around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Miss Korea is shocked. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Oh my GOD&lt;/em&gt;, what was that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What was what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You speak Japanese?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I speak enough, yeah.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why didn&amp;#39;t you tell me?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shrug with one eyebrow raised, looking at her like she&amp;#39;s odd for being surprised.

It looks rehearsed and forced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DO NOT create opportunities to show how smart you are. Patiently wait for them and prepare in the meantime. This also just makes you a better man. No one likes an airhead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid trivia-like situations. She doesn&amp;#39;t care that you know that John Tyler was the 10th President. Wait instead for a situation where your knowledge helps someone or adds substance to your time together.

Science and foreign language create the most opportunities for practical, situational demonstrations of knowledge. Fiction is dope as hell, but only talk books she&amp;#39;s read so you steer clear of nerding out. History requires you to talk a ton and sound brainy and potentially arrogant. Technical skills like making a good drink don&amp;#39;t hurt, but don&amp;#39;t be that mixology douchebag. Stay away from musical talents. Yes you may get the pink, but it&amp;#39;s a beta thing to do and you&amp;#39;ll be the &amp;quot;sweetheart&amp;quot; in no time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demonstration of intelligence should have NOTHING TO DO WITH HER. Imagine it was a Korean lady whose photo I took. Then I look like a cornball for speaking Korean because for all this hoe knows, I picked up a phrasebook to impress her.

On strolls through the night, knowing the constellations and being able to talk about stories related to that is like catnip for some chicks. Everybody loves a story and stargazing and being able to demonstrate your interest and intelligence in that way is not a detriment. \n\nWith a quick poke around at my post history, you'll see that I find the idea of needing always to be 'alpha' is silly, in the way some people mean it, in certain behaviours and rules that alphas participate in. I find the stories interesting and they entertain the people around me and so I have no problem relaying them to people, women and men alike, especially since that's what I'd _like_ to be talking about. How on Earth is that beta? Do you see that by trying to conform to this ideal and removing yourself from your interest and passions, and telling yourself you're not allowed to go there because a woman might not like it or you might not get laid, you are in fact a massive beta pussy who still hasn't learned how to be himself? \n\nExcuse my being abrupt; The forcing of yourself to do, act and be a certain way just for girls is especially what we try to rid ourselves of and your post in some parts smacks right in the face of that.\n\nI'd echo what others have said about musical talent too: Being the Wonderwall guy who does it to gain approval sucks but there is nothing wrong with sharing with company a talent you have and a hobby you love, just as it isn't 'beta' to play football and work hard on the field for the guys, if that's your thing. I also contest that playing something intimately for somebody, and sharing that with them, is not something anybody here should be afraid of doing, for fear of being less of a man -- If that's your thing, carry it.

I find the stories interesting and they entertain the people around me and so I have no problem relaying them to people, women and men alike, especially since that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;d &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to be talking about.
