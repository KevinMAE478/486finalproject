I&amp;#39;m a friend who wishes to remain anonymous. I\u2019m remaining anonymous because some of these tips, though effective, are very politically incorrect. For the same reason, please don&amp;#39;t share these tips with anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Be her man.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women will never admit this, but they\u2019re nowhere near as good as most men at fixing things around the house. You will need to do this for her, while not reminding her of her weakness in this area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s a hilarious video that illustrates this point nicely. (Please ignore the misogynistic language; only anti-feminists seem to make videos like this.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/SurvivorUKMenVsWomen\"&gt;http://bit.ly/SurvivorUKMenVsWomen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men are also generally more capable than women at managing the household investments; so you\u2019ll need to take charge of those, while making her feel like an equal partner. Again to drive home this point for you, here\u2019s a misogynistic article that illustrates how female CEOs perform versus their male counterparts: &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/PerformanceOfWomenCEOs\"&gt;http://bit.ly/PerformanceOfWomenCEOs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Don\u2019t cheat on her.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Staying faithful is relatively easy in the United States, but far more difficult abroad. As you become successful, you\u2019ll probably travel abroad for business or pleasure, where sex is cheap and plentiful, and Americans are treated like rock stars. Below are some countries where you\u2019ll need to be &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; careful not to cheat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;German-speaking countries \u2013 Prostitution is legal in the German-speaking countries of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. In these countries, businessmen sometimes conduct business in \u201cFKKs,\u201d or sauna clubs. These clubs are lavish spaces, with unique d\u00e9cor and all-day buffets. There are large numbers of very young, very attractive women in these clubs, completely naked except for high heels. You can have sex with any of them for $50, and cum in her mouth (ick!) for another $50. Here&amp;#39;s a NSFW pic of the women at an FKK: &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/FKKGirls\"&gt;http://bit.ly/FKKGirls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a German business associate invites you to an FKK to talk business, just tell him you\u2019re married, and suggest an alternate venue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Philippines \u2013 In the Philippines, Americans can hit on virtually any woman successfully. White men are treated like rock stars; high school girls giggle and take selfies with them and, outside the major cities, they\u2019re mobbed on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll need all your willpower not to cheat. If your friends do succumb, remind them to wear a condom; the local women dream of having an American baby, even if the father doesn\u2019t stick around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(If you want to encourage your single friends to have the maximum amount of fun, suggest Cialis, which is cheaply available at any pharmacy, even without a prescription in poorer countries. They\u2019ll need to experiment with the dosage, but it\u2019s quite a wonder drug when juggling multiple girlfriends. Also, they\u2019ll find that they don\u2019t need to lie about having multiple girlfriends; telling the truth about this just makes women compete with each other!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Paid sex is also cheap and plentiful in the Philippines, which brings me to\u2026 Thailand, Ukraine, Poland, Colombia, The Dominican Republic, etc. People in these countries are too familiar with Americans to treat them like rock stars. But they\u2019ll gladly sleep with them, both romantically and for pay. Be very, very careful not to cheat in these countries; think of your wife waiting for you back home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I do strongly recommend vacationing with your wife in Thailand. It is paradise on earth. All the conveniences of home - and much, much more! - without any of the drawbacks.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you somehow end up marrying a foreign woman, these tips will work equally well on her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Don\u2019t debate her.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s futile, because she has two weapons/flaws you do not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a. She does not respond to facts and logic, only feelings.\nYes, even the smartest women you know. For example, here are some of the smartest women in one of the smartest nations on earth, Israel: &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/IsraeliArmyWomen\"&gt;http://bit.ly/IsraeliArmyWomen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;b. She can fib far better than you.\nBecause women are the physically weaker sex, they have many non-violent tools to defend themselves. For example, they\u2019re far better at fibbing. They fib so often, and so effectively, that they may actually believe many of their fibs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here, for instance, is a woman successfully defending herself against a much stronger man: &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/HairSalonVideo\"&gt;http://bit.ly/HairSalonVideo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you notice how she said, \u201cI have a law degree\u201d? If she\u2019d actually practiced law a day in her life, she\u2019d have said, \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer.\u201d But, even though she isn\u2019t actually a lawyer, she still uses her law degree (probably from a not-very-prestigious school) to defend herself against a stronger man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here\u2019s an even braver woman, using similar strategies: &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/WomanVsGuard\"&gt;http://bit.ly/WomanVsGuard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;4. If she loves you, she\u2019ll sign a prenup&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half of all marriages end in divorce. This is not within your control; 70 percent of divorces are initiated by women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re probably worried about how to bring up a prenup with your beloved. So Here\u2019s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask her if she loves you. She\u2019ll say yes, and/or she\u2019ll ask why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tell her you love her very much, and would like the two of you to sign a prenup. She\u2019ll ask why you don\u2019t love her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reiterate that you love her very much, and say you want to explain. Give her the reasons for a prenup below, in order. Patiently hear her response to each reason before moving on to the next reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a. You know who recommends prenups? Personal finance guru Suze Orman: &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/PrenupYup\"&gt;http://bit.ly/PrenupYup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;b. A prenup &lt;em&gt;protects the kids&lt;/em&gt;. Divorce is a nightmare for the kids. They see mommy and daddy fight, see daddy leave the house and move to a crappy studio apartment, see wild accusations being thrown around in court, and watch as mommy brings home new men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;c. You already &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a prenup, which is your state\u2019s divorce laws. Instead of going along unthinkingly with those, you and your strong, independent mate should consciously think through, and sign, a prenup that is fair to both parties in the marriage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your love will probably get agitated and walk out during or after this discussion. Let her. She\u2019ll need some time to consider what to do. She may enlist friends and relatives to badger you; give them the same reasons you gave her, with the same responses to questions about your love. Stay reasonable; don\u2019t get agitated. You want to let your smart lady consider whether she wants to do the smart thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If, after a short time, your angel blindly refuses to sign a prenup, then please do me a favor, and ask yourself whether you\u2019re the man in this award-winning European short film: &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/HarpyaFilm\"&gt;http://bit.ly/HarpyaFilm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;A Final word&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don\u2019t share this with others.
