It's an ongoing thing, my relationship with him has gotten much better over the past ten years. After the divorce my mother and grandmother did their best to turn me against him and I cut him off for over a decade until I realized the truth. I'm taking him in to live with me once he retires. Who I am now as an adult is imbued with knowledge and more maturity; I've reignited my relationship with my father and undid a lot of damage done. \n\nA child's brain hasn't even developed fully, and our brains are plastic; they neurally adapt to our environments. It's no way to live, to not forgive yourself for dumb decisions and mistakes made in your past. I was 12 and being brainwashed against him, and I needed my mother's love like all children do, she was incapable of it, so I grew with shame and always found myself doing her bidding to win her approval. I wasn't a 28 year old then, able to see her as imperfect and incapable of unconditional love. She was an emotionally empty shell, only projecting rage and instability, unable to see past her own needs. I was a kid, and even younger, like 4-5, I was doing emotional cartwheels for her approval and acceptance. I could only reason that I wasn't being a good enough son, and maybe if I hated who she hated, if I validated her, if I was her emotional helper and parent, maybe she'd love me enough to ask me how my day was, or take me to the park to play. In between physical violence and abuse, seeing it and being subjected to it, there were islands where she said, sadly and with emptiness, \"I love you\", it was like a drug, getting those crumbs. I tried what I could to keep it coming. I remember once when I was six I saw my mother smash a fluorescent light tube across my father's face; I saw a man I looked up to reduced to blood and tears, and not being able to save face in front of his son. This is the psychological stuff that leads to the dysfunction of many males. Maybe not to the extremes of physical abuse, but the same undercurrent.\n\nHowever I don't think I'll ever really forgive myself for my failed relationship with him during my teenage years- all that missed time, entirely. But at the end of the day the divorce was between two legal adults. If my mother decided to manipulate and hide behind my voice to divorce in order to spite my father, that's her being abusive. That's a good sign of her character and believe me, not the worst she was capable of. She came from an extremely abusive family. \n\nLeave your judgment at the door, from 13-21 I did and saw things that couldn't even be mentioned here. But up to 12 I saw, experienced and did a lot of things in a very dysfunctional family and it pushed me over the edge. Lots of abuse of all sorts- physically, verbally, worse things- mostly running on the mother's side because this is what these people knew. Most of which I won't discuss in detail because it's personal and because it isn't my job to prove anything if you are going to keep invalidating it. \n\nThere's often a web of dysfunctionality that is attached to a family with abusive dynamics.

That's a topic for another time.", "edited": 1492234990.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reconnected him with a few estranged brothers and family back home, took care of him when he was sick, believed his side of the story and helped him get therapy for depression. It&amp;#39;s an ongoing thing, my relationship with him has gotten much better over the past ten years. After the divorce my mother and grandmother did their best to turn me against him and I cut him off for over a decade until I realized the truth. I&amp;#39;m taking him in to live with me once he retires. Who I am now as an adult is imbued with knowledge and more maturity; I&amp;#39;ve reignited my relationship with my father and undid a lot of damage done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A child&amp;#39;s brain hasn&amp;#39;t even developed fully, and our brains are plastic; they neurally adapt to our environments. It&amp;#39;s no way to live, to not forgive yourself for dumb decisions and mistakes made in your past. I was 12 and being brainwashed against him, and I needed my mother&amp;#39;s love like all children do, she was incapable of it, so I grew with shame and always found myself doing her bidding to win her approval. I wasn&amp;#39;t a 28 year old then, able to see her as imperfect and incapable of unconditional love. She was an emotionally empty shell, only projecting rage and instability, unable to see past her own needs. I was a kid, and even younger, like 4-5, I was doing emotional cartwheels for her approval and acceptance. I could only reason that I wasn&amp;#39;t being a good enough son, and maybe if I hated who she hated, if I validated her, if I was her emotional helper and parent, maybe she&amp;#39;d love me enough to ask me how my day was, or take me to the park to play. In between physical violence and abuse, seeing it and being subjected to it, there were islands where she said, sadly and with emptiness, &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot;, it was like a drug, getting those crumbs. I tried what I could to keep it coming. I remember once when I was six I saw my mother smash a fluorescent light tube across my father&amp;#39;s face; I saw a man I looked up to reduced to blood and tears, and not being able to save face in front of his son. This is the psychological stuff that leads to the dysfunction of many males. Maybe not to the extremes of physical abuse, but the same undercurrent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll ever really forgive myself for my failed relationship with him during my teenage years- all that missed time, entirely. But at the end of the day the divorce was between two legal adults. If my mother decided to manipulate and hide behind my voice to divorce in order to spite my father, that&amp;#39;s her being abusive. That&amp;#39;s a good sign of her character and believe me, not the worst she was capable of. She came from an extremely abusive family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leave your judgment at the door, from 13-21 I did and saw things that couldn&amp;#39;t even be mentioned here. But up to 12 I saw, experienced and did a lot of things in a very dysfunctional family and it pushed me over the edge. Lots of abuse of all sorts- physically, verbally, worse things- mostly running on the mother&amp;#39;s side because this is what these people knew. Most of which I won&amp;#39;t discuss in detail because it&amp;#39;s personal and because it isn&amp;#39;t my job to prove anything if you are going to keep invalidating it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s often a web of dysfunctionality that is attached to a family with abusive dynamics.

Women- even those making good money- want to let go of the burden of life and hop on the man's back as he climbs the hill of life, and eat from the fruit of his work. They have to.
