It comes not from  increased skill or ability (or even the tech) but from increased interest in that particular activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course in daygame world the effect manifests itself when you&amp;#39;re excited by being in a new/foreign city and you approach more girls there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to confuse flow state with novelty effect. Or should I say that it&amp;#39;s easier to get into the zone when you&amp;#39;re doing new things? Whenever you&amp;#39;re doing something new (or in a new way) &lt;strong&gt;it is exciting.

You feel great and it shows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the grind\u00a0starts, then you actually need to put work into all this. Novelty wears off and you&amp;#39;re back to raw, base level of your daygame skills. If you can&amp;#39;t handle your results toppling you might need a break or you&amp;#39;ll quit.
