A rather polite and warm comment in a different thread has led me to post my musings on something I&amp;#39;ve been pondering: the true alpha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I know what many of you are thinking: Welshman, I&amp;#39;m not a philosopher, I&amp;#39;m just here to increase the number of girls I get to bang.  Well, if that&amp;#39;s what matters most in your life, you have my pity.  There are significantly more important things to do then have sex, much as there are significantly more important things to do than play video games.  You can seek out as much pleasure as you like, but its fleeting.  I&amp;#39;d happily talk about how to be truly satisfied for those who are interested: spoiler, its through purpose, and the only purpose is serving the purpose God wants you to serve.  But, I&amp;#39;m not trying to get in a fight with fedora tippers in this thread (though I&amp;#39;ll gladly do so elsewhere, and will answer any questions pertaining to Christianity that you ask).  In this thread, the subject is leadership.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the most basic characteristics of an alpha male is an aura of command.  Lesser men like to follow them and women fall in love with them.  But, with great power comes great responsibility.  Not all men can lead.  And there is nothing more dangerous than a bad leader (any vets or current soldiers can back me up on this one I&amp;#39;m sure).  This is true for the military, for a company, for a country, for society, etc.  So, lets say you are an alpha or working to become one.  Congratulations, you are learning how to command.  Now, don&amp;#39;t just run off at this point and find some pretty babes.  You have a duty.  Most people are... unimpressive.  They need to be led to live a good life.  Long ago, when the concept of aristocracy was founded, that was the purpose of nobles.  To rule justly, to protect those under them.  Unfortunately, after the initial generation of nobles selected for merit, almost all that followed had no merit and abused the system.  Ultimately, most places in the world have destroyed their aristocracies because of it, and good riddance, almost all of them were leeches.  But that didn&amp;#39;t mean the need for leaders was gone.  That didn&amp;#39;t mean that society can function under no direction or poor direction.  No.  A true leader must step up.  And I encourage any of you with any ability to command and any sense of duty to step up.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many things wrong with today&amp;#39;s society: most men are miserable because women have gone insane under feminism, most women are miserable because they have ruined their lives with feminist lies.  Many ancient countries are on the verge of collapse as women and weak men let active enemies of the state into their countries where they may ravage their women, kill their men, and enslave their children.  Many people willingly choose not to work, instead accepting a modern twist on slavery: a meager pittance of food and entertainment in turn for voting for a politician.  All these are prevalent ailments to modern society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As aspiring or current alphas, you can turn your back.  You can find as many pretty women as you like.  You can make lots of money and live comfortably.  But there are your lessers out there suffering.
