There may be several pertinent times. \n2) How - how will the action be performed?\n3) What - what is the action?\n4) Why - often there are several contexts of why. More below. \n5) The Big Why - why do you get up in the morning? Remember, this is why you do any and everything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This can be fleshed out as an answer to each question. But.

It is, if you will, a personal mission statement. It reminds us why we do anything, by showing us the purpose we have created for ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To come up with your big why, answer the question by filling in the blanks here:\n&amp;quot;Every day, I wake up to take the opportunity to _____&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, for the sake of _&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;____.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typically your first big why is what you would expect. Try applying it iteratively 5 times to really hone in on your value in life. Doing this exercise with associates, several have cried as clairity and purpose in life has been revealed to them. It can be powerful stuff. Try it out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feedback always appreciated.
