I am a bit younger however and almost done with graduate school (STEM).  \n\nIn any case, building credit is easy if you don't overextend; keep receipts if you can to track what you spend. Make a table of all your unavoidable expenses. These should be:\n\n1. Food (groceries only)\n1. Rent\n1. Insurance\n1. Transportation\n\nEverything else can potentially go, meaning nights out, clothes, fast food, new tv, you name it. After you have your absolutely necessary expenses down, depending on the amount of money remaining, you can distribute a portion of it to the less important ones. \n\nDepending on how much you make, I would try to save 20% of your income for a start. Out of that, 50% could go to some small time investments (I am in favor of index, options or a fund). Options could be a bit tricky, since they require monitoring and some experience, but they can generate a steady return of 5 to 10% yearly if you are willing to do research and put in some work. Index is the safest and tends to give a much better yearly return than a savings account. Funds (mutuals) have higher returns than indices but they involve a tad more risk. Personally I prefer funds. There's a lot of reading behind all these, and I am a novice myself, since my income as a graduate student  does not allow me for much maneuverability yet. A good place to start would be interactive brokers or ameritrade. There is some good advice on red pill for personal finance, and a ton of information around the internet. Most important step however, is to make sure that until you make real money, you should cut down on unnecessary expenses. Spending 10 $ for lunch at work might not seem much, but with 20$ you can make lunch at home and bring it with you (+ hone your cooking skills), and it saves a lot of money in the long run. Same with eating pizzas etc. These things sound ridiculous I know, but you will slowly (on a yearly timescale) accumulate money.\n\nWhen you say you are looking for professional education do you have anything specific in mind? Something like an MBA? Since you are also looking to change jobs and get education at the same time, you could give it a shot and apply for an internship. I know it might suck having to compete with college kids, but probably you can do their job better, and if you play your cards right, secure a position. Have the same abundance mentality as with women; keep throwing nets till you catch fish. The more nets, the bigger the chances. If a company things that your skills are indispensable they can pay for additional education if it suits their purpose. Do some research first though; make sure you can sell yourself as the ideal match for whatever position you apply. Play on all your strong points academic or social.\n\nFor the rent part, maybe you could get a roommate to share the costs or move somewhere cheaper. If the roommate happens to be Chad, he can also greatly expand your potential plates.\n\nHope this helps even in the slightest; even if a single point is of help to you, it's a success. Otherwise if it's garbage the red pill gods will downvote me to death as I deserve.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I can help, since what you are describing yourself as like my other half of the puzzle i.e. we more or less started on the same point but I excel in what you don&amp;#39;t and you excel in what I suck at. I am a bit younger however and almost done with graduate school (STEM).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any case, building credit is easy if you don&amp;#39;t overextend; keep receipts if you can to track what you spend. Make a table of all your unavoidable expenses. These should be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Food (groceries only)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rent&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Insurance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Transportation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything else can potentially go, meaning nights out, clothes, fast food, new tv, you name it. After you have your absolutely necessary expenses down, depending on the amount of money remaining, you can distribute a portion of it to the less important ones. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on how much you make, I would try to save 20% of your income for a start. Out of that, 50% could go to some small time investments (I am in favor of index, options or a fund). Options could be a bit tricky, since they require monitoring and some experience, but they can generate a steady return of 5 to 10% yearly if you are willing to do research and put in some work.
