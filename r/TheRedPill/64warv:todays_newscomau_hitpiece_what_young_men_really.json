Yet this woman simply *can't join* those dots!\n\n&gt;R: The perception of the group is that they will have fewer opportunities than the young men who went before them and their fathers before that. \n\nR: **They don\u2019t see equality between women and men as a correction but an interruption to their own intended success.**\n\n\n&gt;R: It\u2019s not that they\u2019re against gender equality. For the most part they think it makes sense, but they do worry about how it will affect them as individuals.\n\n This above statement shows how open minded and mature these guys really are when  it comes to making such decisions, smart guys.\n\n&gt;R: I\u2019m struck by the fact none of these young guys sees the benefits of equality for men. (which is the \"happy wife, happy life\" 'family *is everything*' Bullshit metality)\n \n\n\n&gt; R: Their focus is on the greater competition for jobs, for advancement and for wealth that more women in the workforce might mean. \n\n* Their focus is on what they might have to give up so that women can be equal players.\n\n* But, there are strong cultural traditions and other reasons behind this; i.e. Aussie guys have *always been* RedPill in many ways. It's a very (stereotyped) Aussie male thing to be a 'strong, fit man, the 'outdoorsman' type/bronzed lifesaver, who works hard at what he does \n\n And doesn't like his women 'acting like men'! And so the women tend not to uness they're dykes, and that's cool if they want to, just *leave My girl alone!*\n\nThat's how the Men were, and how the Women liked them! \n\nMy grandma's advice to 'giving a woman tingles' is to \"go and chop a pile of wood and come back in all sweaty\" ... my Granny was kinda old school ... lol \n\n RiP Dory She was also 100% for 'equality in the sexes' \"*when and where it's feasible*\" e.g. The woman mind the children and get drinks whilst the men fought the fires, etc.\n\n And nursing ,, granny was a nurse all her life but was all for male nurses!. lol\n\n Equality was a neccessity back in my grandma's days growing up on \n\nthe farm, you did what you could and If the girls could do 'men's work' and they wanted to, sweet! \n\ne.g. Our 'cowboys' are called Jackaroo's and the cowgirls are called Jillaroo's! They do exactly the same work. And in Australia, that's not only \"just fine\", it's \"how it should be\"!\n\n In those days jobs were more easily separated into 'gender related'  roles of 'mens work' (physical, authoritarian) and 'women's work' which was 'nuturing and caring for their men' who 'brought home the bacon'. (or drank their wages, and left many a woman pregnant and single ,, which led to prostitution being common at the turn of the 20th century, as is legal to this day, and a LOT of girls I've known have \"given it a go\" in one way or another\n\n Just as there are lots of girls who are 'cam girls' for a bit and then disappear as 'it's not for them' ,, lots of women down here give being a \"working girl\" a go, but most can't keep it up, it fucks with their heads too much! ... this happens to the majority IME. \n\nYou'd be surprised at the amount of aussie girls, many HB8's and up who you see walking down the street who have 'worked' But you'd never think so! Unless *they let you know*.\n\n\nPossibly due to these and other factors, feminism never really got a hold in Australia and most young guys and girls are I've spoken to seem pretty happy with the status quo. \n\nSo back to these young guys: She says: They see only what they will lose and not what they will gain: (that's *only her female opinion*, which is;)  \"The privilege of one day being fathers in the fullest sense of the word\" lmao! Talk about 'projecting' (albeit clever and subtle! lol AWALT if they can be)\n\nAnd then states: **\"It's just they know women aren't the answer to getting there\"**.\n\n So, No they *don't* really miss anything if anything their gaining by not falling for 'the Disney Bullshit'!  \n\nThese guys are All for \"living balanced and meaningful life beyond paid work \u2026 and the freedom of living in a more equal and inclusive world\"\n\nBUT Not If the price for this is surrendering their musculinity and the right to be men to the encroaching Femitocracy. Of course not! \n\nAnd becoz **they just they know women aren't the answer to getting there**. \n\nNow if that isn't a Red Pilled attitude coming from these guys, IDK what is!\n\n Bravo young Aussie guys, bravo!", "edited": 1492095714.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOL this article is hilarious! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These young guys she&amp;#39;s talking to rock!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are already RP&amp;#39;d to a degree, BUT that&amp;#39;s part of the Australian Culture, which also affects the way women are here as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;R: &amp;quot;We talk for over an hour about their plans and desires for the future and how gender affects that.

This article through it&amp;#39;s content and title alone is in no uncertain terms insinuating that modern young men are idiotic children in need of growing up and facing reality and that society should be taking pity and doing something to fix the idiocy of young men.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider this is the only real power women have: to slander, to shame, and to cajole those weaker than her. Women only have power now because of daddy government. Let a woman try those tricks on an alpha and he&amp;#39;ll respond by simply laughing at her. Because she&amp;#39;s a joke. These young men are bluepilled fags that will feel shame when she casts it their way. It simply won&amp;#39;t work on an alpha. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course the go-to for her is to imply that they are children. It is all she&amp;#39;s evolved to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Off topic but another commenter got offended when I called Austrailia a 3rd world feminist shit hole. I stand vindicated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HAHAHA Update: same link as below, moving it here for the lazy. &lt;strong&gt;Watch the dude within 15 seconds how he responds to her cajoling&lt;/strong&gt; (in the Australian parliament).
