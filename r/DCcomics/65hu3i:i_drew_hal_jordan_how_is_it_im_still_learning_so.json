The color of his face is a perfect tone for his skin, the green glow of the ring is perfect kelly green, as it should be, and his uniform is juuuuuuust slightly a different shade of green so it stands out from the ring's energy.\n\n**The most critical thing I can tell you:**  Work on proportions before you bother learning how to do finishing details.  I'm not kidding about the Rob Liefeld bit; he [really does have no idea how to proportion a human being properly](http://unrealitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rob-liefeld3.jpg).  He spends all his time on finishing details while the proportions are absurd.  Having their musculature be a bit larger than average is fine, but proportions are critical.  Hal's legs are too long, and his hips too narrow.  Get a book that demonstrates human proportions in relation to head sizes, and do a bunch of quick sketches where you do no finishing, and don't worry about details - just sketch out bodies.  Start with them standing, then progress to walking, running, jumping, punching, whatever.  Don't burn time getting facial expressions and details of fingers or well-defined musculature, just quick sketches to get that right.\n\nIf you play music, you'll learn that rhythm is the most important thing.  I don't care if you break a string, forget a lyric, or forget what key you're supposed to be in, you *stay in rhythm* because getting out of rhythm stands out to people more than any other mistake.  Proportion and pose are the most important aspects of drawing.  I've seen people do poorly-finished or crudely-finished work in comics, but if their work has the right proportions, sense of weight, and sense of motion, it's fine.  Having an artist focus on finishing and crosshatching and finely detailed muscles and whatnot is pointless when the basic form of their sketch is wrong.  Google Rob Liefeld to see what I'm talking about; he's the most widely criticized successful artist in the comic book business.\n\n**Good work and good luck.**", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Criticisms:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hands need (a lot of) work, as has been said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t hide feet; learn to draw them; you aren&amp;#39;t secretly Rob Liefeld, are you?  &lt;strong&gt;XD&lt;/strong&gt;  Kidding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shadow on his face doesn&amp;#39;t look like a shadow, it looks like his face is just black.

For studies, he would practice a specific aspect that he wanted to work on two hours a day for about a week and then change the study just to keep learning and not bore himself with them.  For example, if he were studying lighting, he would take a lamp and light an object (whether it be fabric, metal, fruit, etc) and see how the light affects the object (does it get absorbed, is it reflective) and then paint it. Once he felt like he was good at it, he would try to replicate that painting from memory, and to further push the study, apply it to a painting of a monster wearing armor (metal being reflective and what not). The most important thing to remember when doing studies is that you aren't picking arbitrary studies because a peer is doing the same study.  Why paint a bird a thousand times and study the anatomy of it, if you'll never need or want to paint a bird.  Make sure when you choose the studies if you are self teaching, that you choose studies that you can apply to your own work.  As far as getting work, you should never be too proud to take a job.  Start somewhere by placing your work where people who hire will see it, now this doesn't mean facebook only.  Facebook is a social network, and I would say 0.5 times out of 10 has Dave been approached for work from his posts on facebook.  Invest your time and see where people are getting work and being hired and place yourself on those types of websites.  That being said, the internet is a convenient way of communicating with others for freelancers, and sharing your stuff with your friends, but the internet isn't everything.  So many good artists exist outside of the small bubble of the internet, and some of the greatest artists ever are dead and can't post their work online so you have to research and look for those to study.  The best advice at this moment in our generation is not to compare yourself so much to your peers, work really hard and stay focused.  I hope this helps\n\nSome other things I learned drawing on an academic level is that it's a-okay to draw the work you like.  So if you're into Jim Lee, or Steranko or any other illustrator, look at what they made and draw it.  It'll really help you understand what they were doing when they made their work.  (hell, even the old master painters from the 1500's did master studies of the artists they looked up to) \n\nAlso, similar to what Dave Rapoza's assistant says above, draw from life. Drawing real people, and real objects will help you immensely when drawing fictional fantastical things.  and you don't need to have a model stand there for you, take pictures of yourself, blow it up big on your computer and take your time.  draw really big, draw really small.
