All any of us who\u2019ve worked on the book this last year have wanted is to serve her well, to illuminate what we so absolutely believe makes Wonder Woman such a remarkable and unique and timeless and important character. To have had that opportunity is something that I doubted I would ever get again. Most of us don\u2019t get a single bite at the apple, let alone two, you know?

This is probably for the best, as I fear I will tackle-hug her and end up squeezing so tight as to potentially fracture ribs and/or frighten her.

Laura glowed. Rom shone. The scary stuff looked damn scary, the pretty stuff looked gorgeous, and the subtleties of their skill is so often overlooked, but it\u2019s what brings a book fully to life.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I have to save Liam Sharp for last, here, because he\u2019s been the lion this year. He\u2019s been constant, and driven, and every single time I started to flag or to doubt or to second-guess, he was the booster, he was the beacon. He is ferocious. He is probably the sweetest guy I\u2019ve ever met in the industry (and I know Matthew Clark, as I\u2019ve said, so that\u2019s saying something), he is a dedicated, true professional.
