That entire conversation points to one notion: that everyone involved was aware of one another&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;secret identity&amp;quot; except neither Bruce nor Clark suspected Lex&amp;#39;s duplicity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Clark, however, almost immediately worked out that Bruce was Batman but never got a chance to confront him about it because of the fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To think that Clark would have &amp;quot;worked out&amp;quot; Bruce&amp;#39;s secret without any real investigation and not the other way around is an extreme betrayal of the source material. Clark is aware of Batman&amp;#39;s secret identity primarily because of his powers (and yes, his skills as an investigative journalist to a degree). Bruce takes the time to deliberately work out Clark&amp;#39;s identity. Shit, you saw how carefully Bruce worked &lt;em&gt;every single detail&lt;/em&gt; of his fight with Superman out. Do you honestly believe his preparation stopped at &amp;quot;let me understand how his powers work and call the alien with my big flashlight&amp;quot;?
