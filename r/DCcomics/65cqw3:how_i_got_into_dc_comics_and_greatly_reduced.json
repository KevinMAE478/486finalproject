Sometimes they make the stakes too high or make things too reversible because they're interested in maintaining the status quo to try to keep readers in, but that's actually what pushes them out.\n\nDC on the other hand takes risks and makes the characters work inside the story they want to tell, rather than manipulating the story to preserve the character. They killed Superman. They paralyzed Batgirl. They killed Barry Allen. And sure, Superman came back, Barry came back, and Batgirl came back, but the events in comics had repercussions into the future issues and into other titles, and that's something DC does very well.\n\nI will say this though: I think we're letting Rebirth cloud our judgement. In the last two decades we've had some very not-so-great titles and now that Rebirth is so successful we look at DC as being the storytelling powerhouse. Marvel used to be just as good as DC, and DC used to be just as bad as Marvel. Marvel one day will have their version of Rebirth and the tides will turn, but right now the only Marvel title I'm willing to pick up is Amazing Spider-Man. From DC, on the other hand, I pick up Flash as well as buying TPBs of Titans, Superman, and some others.\n\n**TL;DR** Marvel makes the story work for the characters, DC makes the characters live in the story. Marvel's been off the past few decades, and so has DC, but the latter is making a successful comeback while the former digs its own grave further down every month.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Marvel used to do certain characters very well in the past (Spider-Man, X-Men, Daredevil, etc.) and I agree with you that they do events very well, but ever since the mid-2000s they&amp;#39;ve been missing something. Sometimes they make the stakes too high or make things too reversible because they&amp;#39;re interested in maintaining the status quo to try to keep readers in, but that&amp;#39;s actually what pushes them out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DC on the other hand takes risks and makes the characters work inside the story they want to tell, rather than manipulating the story to preserve the character. They killed Superman. They paralyzed Batgirl. They killed Barry Allen. And sure, Superman came back, Barry came back, and Batgirl came back, but the events in comics had repercussions into the future issues and into other titles, and that&amp;#39;s something DC does very well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will say this though: I think we&amp;#39;re letting Rebirth cloud our judgement. In the last two decades we&amp;#39;ve had some very not-so-great titles and now that Rebirth is so successful we look at DC as being the storytelling powerhouse. Marvel used to be just as good as DC, and DC used to be just as bad as Marvel.

When I first got into comics it was in high school and I came in when Tim Drake was Robin and fell in love with him and the teen titans. So Kon-El, Bart, Cassie and Tim were like my jam. I also adored Steph Brown and Cassandra Cain. I was a teen, they were teens it was all good. The new 52 changed a lot of that. I hated some of the new backstories and I get they needed new readers but I felt really alienated so I just stopped reading. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It feels Marvel is sort of making the same mistakes by changing so much. And their big plots are sort of nonsensical and boring. I mean what was the point of Civil War II? Why couldn&amp;#39;t there have been better communication between the inhumans and the mutants? And I&amp;#39;m just not super into the hydra cap story. it&amp;#39;s just not my sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rebirth fixed DC for me. Or at least is on the way to. Nothing is perfect but it feels more familiar. Characters seem like themselves and I have been enjoying the plots. So I hope they keep it up. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "DCcomics", "name": "t1_dg9dvsv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492217037.0, "created_utc": 1492188237.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlmm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cqw3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlmm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cqw3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qlmm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cqw3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9i1a1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "QuadCannon", "parent_id": "t1_dg9htz9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DCcomics", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Steve Rogers was a big part of me leaving.
