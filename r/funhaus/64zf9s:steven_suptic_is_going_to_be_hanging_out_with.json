I recently discovered Suptic and sourcefed, just like, two weeks before it went under- which sucked! His vlogs since then have been really high quality, I haven&amp;#39;t been much of a vlog person since like, early high school? But these are really great. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also has a pretty damn funny podcast called &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs3snA6GNU9HjV8ejeC0ISA\"&gt;Boys Only Club&lt;/a&gt; with Reina Scully, formerly of sourcefed but with Crunchyroll now, and there&amp;#39;s a bit in the latest podcast about job interviews that had me out of breath laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "funhaus", "name": "t1_dg6y2ik", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492076833.0, "created_utc": 1492048033.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_35b7i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zf9s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_35b7i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zf9s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_35b7i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zf9s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_35b7i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zf9s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_35b7i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64zf9s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7tdbu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tedstill", "parent_id": "t1_dg7sz9f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/funhaus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh my sweet baby boy", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh my sweet baby boy&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "funhaus", "name": "t1_dg7tdbu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492130326.0, "created_utc": 1492101526.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7sz9f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ltpirate", "parent_id": "t1_dg7e0e2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/funhaus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nope, Jacob is morose now that Youtube is removing all mature content, Boy Kissers is no more.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nope, Jacob is morose now that Youtube is removing all mature content, Boy Kissers is no more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "funhaus", "name": "t1_dg7sz9f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492129900.0, "created_utc": 1492101100.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7e0e2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tedstill", "parent_id": "t1_dg6qoz6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/funhaus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But Jacob?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jacob?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "funhaus", "name": "t1_dg7e0e2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492108770.0, "created_utc": 1492079970.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6qoz6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ltpirate", "parent_id": "t1_dg6npfg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/funhaus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Youthful joy and optimism?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youthful joy and optimism?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "funhaus", "name": "t1_dg6qoz6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492067812.0, "created_utc": 1492039012.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6npfg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "blakkattika", "parent_id": "t3_64zf9s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/funhaus", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I hope the ad situation gets back up on its feet for Funhaus so they could hire this kid.
