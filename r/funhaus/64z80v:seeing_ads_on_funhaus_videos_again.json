It's essentially the exact same issue.

Very few people were publishing weird, perverted shit just because they personally enjoyed it - they did it because they enjoyed making money and people absolutely ate it up. But it only took a few angry customers at Amazon upset because \"Daddy Took My Virginity\" popped up when they were searching for children's books with their four-year-old on their lap. So there would be a minor crackdown for a bit, then things would slowly get back to \"normal\" because Amazon also enjoys making money, and there was no denying that erotica sold bucketloads. \n\nThen, it started getting major press coverage. Mostly because of the dino porn, but also because of some incest stories etc. Nothing we're not familiar with from Rule 34 explorations, but to your average middle American with 2.5 kids and a minivan, it was totally unheard of. Porn?? In MY internet???? Even though most retailers, notably Amazon, had implemented some kind of automatic filtering system to make adult titles less visible, it wasn't enough.

Part of their agreement with WH Smith was that ebook listings from Kobo's self-pub portal would be listed and sold on WH Smith's site as well. Well, when WH Smith realized there was porn on their site - which had apparently escaped their attention until they read a Guardian article about it - they Lost Their Shit (TM).\n\nAt that point, all of Kobo's loyalty to us flew out the window. The ONLY thing that mattered was making one of their big corporate partners happy. So they went through and deleted their entire self-pub catalog, and even deactivated some indie publisher's accounts, with absolutely no warning or notification. ALL OF THEM.

Overall, though? While the golden age of erotica is basically over, it's still out there.

If I wanted to go back to writing shapeshifter porn, I could.
