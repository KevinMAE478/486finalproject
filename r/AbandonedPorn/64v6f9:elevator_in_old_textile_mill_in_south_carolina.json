had two floors.  There was a freight elevator at the back of the building.  I worked on the lower floor.  Part of my job was to go upstairs and get any parts that were ready to come downstairs, put them on the elevator, and take them downstairs so I could finish them.\n\nI worked night shift, Monday through Friday, 11 PM to 7:30 AM.  It was a Saturday night, so it was overtime.  Overtime nights typically had a skeleton crew working.  There were only two of us working in the building that night, myself and a guy we'll call Elvis.\n\nWhen Elvis and I arrived at work, there were enough parts to keep him busy all night, but not enough for me.  I told Elvis I was going to go upstairs, get some parts, and bring them down on the elevator.  Elvis went ahead an started working at his machines.  I went upstairs, opened the freight elevator and began loading carts onto it.  I squeezed as many carts as I could onto that elevator.  Having loaded the elevator, I climbed inside, closed the doors and hit the \"down\" button.\n\nMost companies will not allow employees to ride on the freight elevators, but the company I worked for would allow employees to ride, as long as they were travelling with parts going either direction.\n\nAs soon as I hit the \"down\" button, the elevator began moving.  It moved about halfway to the lower floor, then it stopped.  It stopped so quickly, I would have fallen, if it hadn't been for all the carts in the elevator.  This wasn't the first time the elevator had gotten stuck.  It wasn't even the first time it had gotten stuck with me on it.  I did what everyone did when the elevator got stuck; I began spamming the \"down\" button.  Nothing happened, so I spammed the \"up\" button.  Again, nothing happened.  I hadn't begun panicking yet, because this was pretty common.  I continued to spam the buttons, but to no effect.\n\nAfter about three minutes of no movement, I decided to try getting Elvis' attention.  The elevator was notorious for getting stuck when the buttons inside the elevator were pressed, but it would get unstuck when the button by the door on either floor was pressed.  I began pounding on the doors and yelling for Elvis.  No response.  I assumed Elvis would eventually notice I hadn't returned to my machines and come looking for me.  It's at this point I should mention Elvis was a little...slow.  Still, I had hope.  Every few minutes, I would spam the \"up\" and \"down\" buttons, pound on the walls, yell, and hope Elvis would hear me.  Nothing happened.\n\nMidnight passed, but I continued my ritual of spamming the buttons, pounding on the walls, and yelling.  1:00 AM, no help yet. \n 2:00 AM, still nothing.  3:00 AM, lunchtime.   Surely, Elvis would realize something wasn't right, because I wouldn't be at lunch, right?  Remember when I said Elvis was slow?  Well, Elvis was REALLY slow.  As in, tell him a joke on Monday, and he'd get it and laugh at it on Thursday slow.  It was around 3:30 that I became resigned to the fact that I would be inside that elevator until day shift started at 7:00.\n\n4:00 passed and I was still in the elevator.  5:00 came and went with no help.  The whole time, I was religiously hitting the buttons, pounding on the walls, and yelling.  \n\nFinally, at around 6:20, the elevator jerked and began moving upward.  I was in shock.  I was relieved.  The elevator arrived at the second floor, and, before I could open the doors, Elvis opened them.  I was standing there, looking at him, and he asked, \"Where you been?\"  \"Where have I been?  Where have I been?  I've been trapped in the FUCKING ELEVATOR!  That's where I've been,\" I said, like a crazed man who had just been rescued after decades on a deserted island.  Elvis just stared at my face.  I could tell he was trying to gauge whether I was being truthful about being trapped in the elevator.  Seriously, he was THAT slow.  \"Oh, shit!  Is THAT where you've been?  I thought you had left,\"  said Elvis.  \"Left?  WHERE WOULD I GO?!?  What the fuck?\" was all I could manage to say.  I closed the elevator doors and walked downstairs to unload the elevator.\n\nWhen day shift arrived and saw I hadn't gotten any work done, they wanted to know why.  I told them everything.  They thought it was hilarious.  I didn't, at the time, but I can laugh about it now.  I never rode on that elevator again.  I always sent it on its way then walked up or down the stairs.  No way in hell was I ever getting on that elevator again.\n\nLooking back, it wasn't as bad as it could have been.  I knew day shift would be starting at 7:00, so there would be someone using the elevator around that time, and I would be rescued.  I had taken a shit before coming to work, so I didn't have to do it while trapped in there.  I hadn't consumed much liquid before boarding the elevator, so I didn't have to piss while in there.  It was early fall, so the temperature in the elevator wasn't too hot or too cold.  I was hungry when I got out of there, but it wasn't like I was starving.  It could have been a lot worse, I suppose.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was working in an auto parts factory that had two floors.  There was a freight elevator at the back of the building.  I worked on the lower floor.  Part of my job was to go upstairs and get any parts that were ready to come downstairs, put them on the elevator, and take them downstairs so I could finish them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worked night shift, Monday through Friday, 11 PM to 7:30 AM.  It was a Saturday night, so it was overtime.  Overtime nights typically had a skeleton crew working.  There were only two of us working in the building that night, myself and a guy we&amp;#39;ll call Elvis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Elvis and I arrived at work, there were enough parts to keep him busy all night, but not enough for me.  I told Elvis I was going to go upstairs, get some parts, and bring them down on the elevator.  Elvis went ahead an started working at his machines.  I went upstairs, opened the freight elevator and began loading carts onto it.  I squeezed as many carts as I could onto that elevator.  Having loaded the elevator, I climbed inside, closed the doors and hit the &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most companies will not allow employees to ride on the freight elevators, but the company I worked for would allow employees to ride, as long as they were travelling with parts going either direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as I hit the &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; button, the elevator began moving.  It moved about halfway to the lower floor, then it stopped.  It stopped so quickly, I would have fallen, if it hadn&amp;#39;t been for all the carts in the elevator.  This wasn&amp;#39;t the first time the elevator had gotten stuck.  It wasn&amp;#39;t even the first time it had gotten stuck with me on it.  I did what everyone did when the elevator got stuck; I began spamming the &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; button.  Nothing happened, so I spammed the &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; button.  Again, nothing happened.  I hadn&amp;#39;t begun panicking yet, because this was pretty common.  I continued to spam the buttons, but to no effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After about three minutes of no movement, I decided to try getting Elvis&amp;#39; attention.  The elevator was notorious for getting stuck when the buttons inside the elevator were pressed, but it would get unstuck when the button by the door on either floor was pressed.  I began pounding on the doors and yelling for Elvis.  No response.  I assumed Elvis would eventually notice I hadn&amp;#39;t returned to my machines and come looking for me.  It&amp;#39;s at this point I should mention Elvis was a little...slow.  Still, I had hope.  Every few minutes, I would spam the &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; buttons, pound on the walls, yell, and hope Elvis would hear me.  Nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Midnight passed, but I continued my ritual of spamming the buttons, pounding on the walls, and yelling.  1:00 AM, no help yet. \n 2:00 AM, still nothing.  3:00 AM, lunchtime.
