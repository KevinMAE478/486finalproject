I also think more people are influenced by this idea than they would readily admit- so good for you for introspecting and critically investigating your own beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would argue against your viewpoint not by arguing for some universal standard of morality- I don&amp;#39;t believe it exists. I think that your view can be refuted from a basically utilitarian perspective. You say you want to maximize wealth and power. You don&amp;#39;t yet realize how empty and hellish your life will be in your 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond if you haven&amp;#39;t 1) cultivated personal relationships and the emotional intelligence needed to navigate them and 2) the inner resources necessary to entertain, educate, and be with yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically I think your definition of wealth and power are ass-backwards. I think power is being able to know yourself and know what makes you happy- wealth is having the resources to do it. Chasing money is a way to ignore every aspect of personal growth while stroking your increasingly sick and isolated ego. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I think you&amp;#39;re wrong about success.
