The southern states, prior to the war, were very prosperous, in part due to slavery. The northern states had less labor intensive agriculture and therefore used less slave labor.\n\nSugar, cotton, indigo dye, rum, these were all big money crops, but they also required a lot of labor. If you wanted to be competitive with the Caribbean islands and their prices, slavery was the only way to make a profit.\n\n\nBefore the country was even founded, a lot of people, both northern and southern, wanted to do away with the slave trade. Thomas Jefferson, himself a virginia slave owner, described the practice as a \"hideous blot\" on our society, but in the late 1700's and early 1800's slavery was the only economical way to manage certain industries. \n\nIn the early 1800's the abolitionist movement boomed in popularity, especially in the north and congress forbid the importation of slaves entirely in 1814(I think, it was during the teens anyway) which started to put a crunch on the southern plantation holders. This was an attack on their business, nay, their entire economy! The southerners argued to extend the status quo just a bit longer, but they couldn't swing the votes. Slavery as an institution and economic means to compete was in it's final days.\n\nThen came the war.  It was ghastly even by today's standards. A particular atrocity that is poignantly remembered to this day was General Sherman's \"March to the Sea\" where he basically left scorched earth behind him. He forced families from their homes, burned the homes, burned the crops in the field, tore up rail line, heated the tracks in fire and bent the track around trees so that the railroad could not be rebuilt. He destroyed ALL of the infrastructure that could allow people to rebuild. Sherman fought a Total War and his actions against civilians would be war crimes today. Everything he did, he did so that NO ONE behind him could mount a response.\n\nSo after the war, once prosperous and rich states with vibrant communities were reduced to literal ashes, with nothing left to help rebuild. They had no infrastructure left, no industry, no workforce, and no help from the government. Add to this an influx of northern immigrants blatantly profiteering off the devastation to build their own empires and one might begin to understand how resentment can continue generations later.\n\nAlabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Georgia used to be RICH. Now they're filled with poor people who have no hope because no one ever invested in building them back up, they just profiteered off the post war chaos.\n\nThis is EXACTLY why we needed to stick around in Japan after WWII and why we're still in Iraq and Afghanistan. If you just bomb them back to the stone age and walk away, they will NEVER recover.\n\nIronically if the Cotton Gin and a few other early industrial revolution inventions came along just a little sooner, the war could have been averted entirely. Like I said, many southern slave owners hated the system, but it was the only way to compete. The cotton gin and a lot of the mechanization that came after it were all about reducing the labor requirements and would have made those cash crops viable again without slavery. (Yes, I know the cotton gin was invented pre-abolition, but it was too little too late.)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m originally from Texas but my mother&amp;#39;s family is from Georgia, two states who were on the losing side of the war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The civil war both was and wasn&amp;#39;t about slavery. The southern states, prior to the war, were very prosperous, in part due to slavery. The northern states had less labor intensive agriculture and therefore used less slave labor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sugar, cotton, indigo dye, rum, these were all big money crops, but they also required a lot of labor. If you wanted to be competitive with the Caribbean islands and their prices, slavery was the only way to make a profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before the country was even founded, a lot of people, both northern and southern, wanted to do away with the slave trade. Thomas Jefferson, himself a virginia slave owner, described the practice as a &amp;quot;hideous blot&amp;quot; on our society, but in the late 1700&amp;#39;s and early 1800&amp;#39;s slavery was the only economical way to manage certain industries. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the early 1800&amp;#39;s the abolitionist movement boomed in popularity, especially in the north and congress forbid the importation of slaves entirely in 1814(I think, it was during the teens anyway) which started to put a crunch on the southern plantation holders. This was an attack on their business, nay, their entire economy! The southerners argued to extend the status quo just a bit longer, but they couldn&amp;#39;t swing the votes. Slavery as an institution and economic means to compete was in it&amp;#39;s final days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then came the war.  It was ghastly even by today&amp;#39;s standards. A particular atrocity that is poignantly remembered to this day was General Sherman&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;March to the Sea&amp;quot; where he basically left scorched earth behind him. He forced families from their homes, burned the homes, burned the crops in the field, tore up rail line, heated the tracks in fire and bent the track around trees so that the railroad could not be rebuilt. He destroyed ALL of the infrastructure that could allow people to rebuild. Sherman fought a Total War and his actions against civilians would be war crimes today. Everything he did, he did so that NO ONE behind him could mount a response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So after the war, once prosperous and rich states with vibrant communities were reduced to literal ashes, with nothing left to help rebuild. They had no infrastructure left, no industry, no workforce, and no help from the government. Add to this an influx of northern immigrants blatantly profiteering off the devastation to build their own empires and one might begin to understand how resentment can continue generations later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Georgia used to be RICH. Now they&amp;#39;re filled with poor people who have no hope because no one ever invested in building them back up, they just profiteered off the post war chaos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is EXACTLY why we needed to stick around in Japan after WWII and why we&amp;#39;re still in Iraq and Afghanistan. If you just bomb them back to the stone age and walk away, they will NEVER recover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ironically if the Cotton Gin and a few other early industrial revolution inventions came along just a little sooner, the war could have been averted entirely.
