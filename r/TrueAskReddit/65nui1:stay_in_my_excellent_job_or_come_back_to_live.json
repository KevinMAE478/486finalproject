I have to choose between staying in my current job in Netherlands and become a wealthy man or going back to my own country and stay with my family(and not be so wealthy).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Background:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bit of a background, I come from a south asian (pakistan,india,bangladesh) country where I lived with my family. I live with my mom, brother and little sister. I am 28 years old and not married. I am responsible for the finances of my house. So i pay for everything, including the college fee of my brother and sister and daily expenses such as food, electricity, rent etc. The college fee is done now as they are both in their last semester. Although, I will still be responsible for our daily expenses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently went to the Netherlands and studied there for two years. I got a degree and even found a really nice job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have two options to choose from:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: Stay at my current Job in Netherlands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a really nice job in the Netherlands. There is such a big difference in the working conditions that I don&amp;#39;t think I can work as a software engineer when I come back home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My one month&amp;#39;s salary in Netherlands is equal to my 3-4 months salary in my own country. In fact the difference in salary is so big that I dont think I can work as a software engineer when I go back home. It will just feel wrong to me to do the same type of work for 1/4th of the money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost all companies treat you like a human in the Netherlands. They have really nice laws about employment law. I don&amp;#39;t have to work overtime and even if I do work overtime, I will be paid for the overtime. This is not the case in my own country. In my country they expect you to work overtime and think you are not motivated if you refuse. And they will never pay you for overtime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands you can be on sick leave for a maximum of two years and still get paid salary. Though it is not so common to be sick for so long but it is really comforting to know. In my country they start deducting your holidays when you are sick. And when all of your holidays are gone then they start deducting your salary. And if you dont show up after two months then there is a big chance you will be let go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides my job, I have other benefits in the Netherlands. I have been on so many dates in the Netherlands which was not so easy in my country. Online dating is still non-existent in my country. I currently have a girlfriend in the Netherlands. I feel really free and independent in terms of dating. I can go to anyone&amp;#39;s house and invite any girl in my own house I also have nice public transport, online shopping for almost all video games, books, clothes etc. I have a really nice gym. The only career i can think of having when I go back is do my own business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While living in Netherlands has good points, there are also some bad things. There are some things that make me hate Netherlands sometimes. If I stay there for one year without a holiday then I get really miserable. I really miss my family on my holidays. I also feel that they sometimes look at us in a condescending way.I have had a lot of incidents related to racism. It seems like they feel like they are much better than us. I have been asked all sorts of questions like : Is there a tv in your country? Do you have internet in your country? Do you know what a washing machine is ? Sometimes people give me a look of disgust even. And they get more weird if they know I am a muslim. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: Go back to my home country and live with my family&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mentioned a lot of really nice things in the first option but I really miss my family and my country&amp;#39;s food. My mom is always very sad when my holidays are up and I have to go back. She is always crying when I leave. She said that I can stay in the Netherlands for as long as I want but she is happy when I am around. My little sister also misses me. She told me that I should come back next year. She is going to be married in a few years then I wont be able to see her so often. When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country&amp;#39;s snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday. And ofcourse I am happy to be around my family everyday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding finances, i will have around 20k$ of savings by next year.
