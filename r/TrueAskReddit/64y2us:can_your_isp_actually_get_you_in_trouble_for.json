An example is the [Copyright Alert System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Alert_System) which was used by several of the major ISPs in the US at some point, though apparently not by Charter. They may have had something similar though. These systems don't involve the police or the courts at all. This is just the ISP choosing to restrict or deny service to you, which as a private entity they have the right to do. The strike system doesn't give the ISP the authority to have you arrested or fined. (Maybe if fines are specified in the service contract you signed with them, you might have to pay, but I'm not sure if any ISP actually does that or if it would be legally enforceable.)\n\nLegal things like filing charges, criminal convictions, fines, arrests, etc. only matter if you get sued or prosecuted for copyright infringement, and in the US and similar legal systems, I don't think the ISP can do that. AFAIK only someone who has [standing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_%28law%29) to file a lawsuit can actually do so without having it thrown out by the courts, and in cases of copyright infringement, I believe the only entity with standing to sue is the owner of the copyright on the movies (or whatever) you downloaded/streamed. That would probably be the production studio, like Warner Bros or Paramount or so on. The ISPs and studios do cooperate to some extent, so if you did get caught repeatedly streaming/downloading by the ISP, you could expect that the studios would be aware of that, and they may even be able to get access to some of the connection information collected by the ISP. This might enable them to file a lawsuit against you.\n\nNow, the question is, would they win that lawsuit? Maybe, I dunno. Lots of things are unpredictable when it comes to the courts, if you're not very familiar with the legal system. But I will say this: in the US, the rights reserved to the copyright owner are listed in [17 USC 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106):\n\n&gt; 1. to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;\n&gt; 2. to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;\n&gt; 3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;\n&gt; 4. in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly;\n&gt; 5. in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly; and\n&gt; 6. in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.\n\n_Uploading_ copyrighted content using Bittorrent or a website like Putlocker seems like an infringement of #3. But it's not so clear if _downloading_ (or streaming) infringes any of these. I think the argument that it does, if someone cared to make such an argument, is that when you download/stream the content (a movie file or whatever), you're making a reproduction, and thus infringing on #1. But it's not clear whether that's really how it works.
