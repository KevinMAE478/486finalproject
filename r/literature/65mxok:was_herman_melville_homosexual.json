I have read that chapter (it's been a while, so had to look it up again though); and Melville is fairly explicitly concerned (it seems to me) with the universality of emotional transcendence that the oil unleashes.  It's sensual, sure, but not sexual necessarily. It could quite easily be read as a sensual experience that intensifies the fraternal feelings that men serving together (in the military, at sea, working towards any common cause) find.  That experience transcends the everyday \"felicity\" that one finds at home with your wife, in your bed, riding your horse etc.\n\nMy point is, it's describing a heightened sense of emotion and kinship; that's true whether or not Melville was gay and had a hand-squeezing fetish.  His sexuality offers no real enlightenment on the passage.  Tangentially it also assumes that the author can't separate himself from his characters.

As for potentially homosexual text in the Sonnets, look up sonnet references to Shakespeare&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Fair Lord.&amp;quot;  It&amp;#39;s a pretty well established theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;squeezing the oily hands of other men&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are references to all kinds of behaviours in literature that we would regard as odd these days, and it&amp;#39;s easy to read things through our narrow view on the world.  I have read that chapter (it&amp;#39;s been a while, so had to look it up again though); and Melville is fairly explicitly concerned (it seems to me) with the universality of emotional transcendence that the oil unleashes.  It&amp;#39;s sensual, sure, but not sexual necessarily. It could quite easily be read as a sensual experience that intensifies the fraternal feelings that men serving together (in the military, at sea, working towards any common cause) find.  That experience transcends the everyday &amp;quot;felicity&amp;quot; that one finds at home with your wife, in your bed, riding your horse etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is, it&amp;#39;s describing a heightened sense of emotion and kinship; that&amp;#39;s true whether or not Melville was gay and had a hand-squeezing fetish.  His sexuality offers no real enlightenment on the passage.  Tangentially it also assumes that the author can&amp;#39;t separate himself from his characters.
