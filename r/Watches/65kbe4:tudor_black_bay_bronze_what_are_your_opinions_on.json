This thread has helped me learn that I like the watch more than I care about what other people think it looks like, which is actually really nice to know. It means I&amp;#39;m not buying it to impress anyone, I&amp;#39;m buying it for myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is enforced by the fact that I considered taking the same money and buying a 34-36mm Rolex last night. I was about to make an offer on a beautiful 34mm oyster perpetual with a blue face and Explorer arabics when I realized that as much as I liked it, as much as I respect rolex, as much as it garners respect and attention from both the watch world and regular people, it didn&amp;#39;t give me the same feeling of joy as the silly oversized BBB. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Watches", "name": "t1_dgcck34", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492394813.0, "created_utc": 1492366013.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc649a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Atmke", "parent_id": "t3_65kbe4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Watches", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sounds like you made up your mind before you even made the thread.
