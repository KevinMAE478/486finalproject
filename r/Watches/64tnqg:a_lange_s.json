Is this just a grand moon phase or something special due to the details and color? If anyone has a link they could post to this, i&amp;#39;d appreciate it. Also, if anyone has one, how do you like it? Is it heavy? Would you prefer a different watch over this one? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the heaviness question is relative, but say compared to a Rolex Milgauss. Would you say it is as heavy as that or lighter? From a glance, it seems as though it would be lighter, but considering it has more complications I figure maybe it could be just as heavy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To anyone who takes the time to read this and/or answers these questions, I thank you and look forward to any responses. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Watches", "name": "t1_dg4wv53", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491973069.0, "created_utc": 1491944269.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qls5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tnqg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qls5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tnqg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ln04", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "derda", "parent_id": "t1_dg5e8z9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Watches", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Noone in germany uses 'Hergestellt in Deutschland' or similar in german language (except maybe some food products). \"Made in Germany\" is the label that is correctly used, especially since its mostly used on products that also get exported. \n\nThe history of the \"Made in Germany\" label is actually quiet interesting, since it was first introduced as a protectionist measure by the British to brand \"low quality / cheap / fake\" german products that were flooding the market in the 19th century.
