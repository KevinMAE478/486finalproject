A simple, functional watch for a guy who lived his life devoid of flash. \n\nAfter he was laid off, he put his watch in his drawer and didn't wear it for a number of years. One day, during the summer after my senior year of high school he sent me upstairs to grab something for him from his drawer and there it was.

It wasn't till after college, while I was out in the real world that I really found value in it.\n\nWhat my father sees as an emblem of misfortune, I see as a reminder of the uncertainty of things. A reminder that nothing is guaranteed and that you cannot prevent unfortunate things from happening in your life, but you sure as hell can decide how you react to them.
