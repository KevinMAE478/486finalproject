When I first saw the SSA303J1 on Seiko\u2019s official Instagram, I instantly fell in love with the shape of the hands and the fact that the power reserve is **centred on the dial**. Like my previous reviews, this is not a widely discussed watch on the Internet, so I\u2019d like to let you know more about it!\n\n**Specs**\n\nMovement: Seiko Cal. 4R57\n\nCrystal: Top flat sapphire crystal and hardlex display case back\n\nCase: Stainless steel\n\nStrap: Stainless steel\n\nDiameter: 42mm\n\nLug-to-lug: 49mm\n\nThickness: 14.5mm\n\nStrap width: 22mm\n\nWater resistance: 10bar\n\nExtra features: Power reserve indicator, date indicator dial\n\nMade in Japan\n\n**Design**\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a central power reserve on any other watch let alone on one at this price point (I\u2019ll come back to it later). Seiko has definitely [nailed the design]( http://i.imgur.com/lADLy0t.jpg) with the elegant and slender shape of the power reserve hand that almost resembles the Eiffel Tower. The watch has dauphine hands that can be seen in deep blue in certain lights. \n\nAtop the **sunburst dial** in silvery white sit baton markers that taper in towards the centre. I wish the dial had a creamy tone to it but there\u2019s no harm in having a [stern white face]( http://i.imgur.com/4eSxgvZ.jpg).\n\nThe silver date sub-dial is filled with concentric grooves. Not depicted in photos is that they produce a **rainbow-coloured sheen** similar to that on the back of a CD, which adds a subtle yet dynamic splash of colour to the dial. The cut-out for the power reserve dial is also finished in the same way.\n\nI find the font on the date dial a bit uninspiring, the print isn\u2019t particularly aligned as well, which I am not sure if it is by design. This is perhaps my biggest dissatisfaction with the watch\u2019s appearance. Departing from the date window, I realised how the date sub-dial gives perspective into what proportion of the month has passed. The drawback is that the date isn\u2019t particularly easy to read at a glance.\n\nAnother complain I have is that the power reserve hand neither rests at 12 o\u2019clock nor at \u201cE\u201d on the indicator dial when the power is empty. Perhaps the only solution is to wear the watch often enough to not let it wind down?\n\nThe chapter ring has these minute indices that give the watch a more sporty appeal, although I prefer without them. The appearance is good for formal and casual settings though. To sum it up, the dial has [a lot of depth and play with light]( http://i.imgur.com/A4nmllj.jpg). You won\u2019t be disappointed when seeing it in person.\n\n**Movement**\n\nAs the name 4R57 suggests, it\u2019s part of the 4R movement family. This variant includes a central power reserve indicator. 21,600bph with **hacking** and **hand-winding**, and 40 hours of power reserve: the same you would expect from the 4R36. I tested an accuracy of +1.3s per day over four days but that\u2019s just luck. I really wish this movement was based on the upgraded 6R series to be on par with the SARBs, but I guess we get the benefit of paying a little less by having a 4R movement. The finishing as seen through the [hardlex exhibition window]( http://i.imgur.com/MCUcYmt.jpg) is utilitarian \u00e0 la Seiko, but I admire the touch of a golden rotor.\n\n**Case**\n\nThe case is nothing too particular to this watch as it\u2019s a pretty standard Seiko case with the familiar [S-signed crown]( http://i.imgur.com/qJRsIzS.jpg). The top of the lugs and the sides are brushed, leaving the chamfer polished, but the finishing is not prominent enough to create a huge contrast. I ought to mention **how unexpectedly thick the case is**. At **14.5mm**, it\u2019s no dress watch, and it might be a deal breaker to some people. The 42mm diameter can also use some downsizing, but luckily the curved lugs don\u2019t put the watch over the edge of my 6in wrist.\n\n**Bracelet**\n\nThe oyster bracelet is also fairly standard with a [mostly brushed appearance]( http://i.imgur.com/adhlxYE.jpg). The bracelet is not bad by any means but I wish it looked more outstanding with some distinct polished touches, other than those currently on the edges of each link. It simply doesn\u2019t feel as if the bracelet was designed together with the watch (which it probably really wasn\u2019t). The bridge stamped out of sheet metal also cheapens the overall feel. Fortunately, any bracelet is replaceable and I\u2019m glad to find out that the watch also looks great on brown leather.\n\n**Final remarks**\n\nFor a watch of this calibre (pun intended), it\u2019s in line with the SARY, which is just below the SARB in terms of movement and quality of the bracelet etc. For about **US$300**, it\u2019s an attractive deal for having such unique feature, i.e. the central power reserve. Overall, I\u2019m happy with this timepiece especially with the dial finishing. Definitely a worthy choice for someone looking for a \u201cbaby Grand Seiko\u201d that is less mainstream than a SARY/SARB.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nLikes\n\n* Unique power reserve location\n* Aesthetical shape and colour of the hands\n* Beautiful sunburst dial\n* Very fair pricing (~US$300 at time and place of purchase)\n\nNeutral\n\n* Uses 4R movement instead of the better 6R\n* Not dressy enough\n\nDislikes\n\n* Large 14.5mm thickness and 42mm diameter\n* Boring font on the date dial, also they\u2019re not aligned\n* Bracelet does not look or feel very premium although it holds up\n\n\nSide note:\n\nI happen to have bought the last white-dialled example from CreationWatches. Unfortunately, other places on the Internet do not sell it at this price any more, although I saw it crop up on Massdrop once. This particular watch has a ding on the side, which manifested the risk I had to take with grey market dealers, but I plan on wearing it anyway. I would still recommend CreationWatches for their free DHL express delivery.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;==&lt;strong&gt;See TL;DR at the very end&lt;/strong&gt;==&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since owning the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/3pyeg5/seiko_review_of_the_sportura_kinetic_gmt_a/?ref=search_posts\"&gt;Seiko quartz GMT&lt;/a&gt;, I\u2019ve been craving for a taste of their highly acclaimed automatics, in particular the SAR- prefixed line-up which presents a lot of value in a myriad of style options.

Perhaps the only solution is to wear the watch often enough to not let it wind down?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chapter ring has these minute indices that give the watch a more sporty appeal, although I prefer without them. The appearance is good for formal and casual settings though. To sum it up, the dial has &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/A4nmllj.jpg\"&gt;a lot of depth and play with light&lt;/a&gt;. You won\u2019t be disappointed when seeing it in person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the name 4R57 suggests, it\u2019s part of the 4R movement family. This variant includes a central power reserve indicator. 21,600bph with &lt;strong&gt;hacking&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;hand-winding&lt;/strong&gt;, and 40 hours of power reserve: the same you would expect from the 4R36. I tested an accuracy of +1.3s per day over four days but that\u2019s just luck. I really wish this movement was based on the upgraded 6R series to be on par with the SARBs, but I guess we get the benefit of paying a little less by having a 4R movement. The finishing as seen through the &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/MCUcYmt.jpg\"&gt;hardlex exhibition window&lt;/a&gt; is utilitarian \u00e0 la Seiko, but I admire the touch of a golden rotor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The case is nothing too particular to this watch as it\u2019s a pretty standard Seiko case with the familiar &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/qJRsIzS.jpg\"&gt;S-signed crown&lt;/a&gt;. The top of the lugs and the sides are brushed, leaving the chamfer polished, but the finishing is not prominent enough to create a huge contrast. I ought to mention &lt;strong&gt;how unexpectedly thick the case is&lt;/strong&gt;. At &lt;strong&gt;14.5mm&lt;/strong&gt;, it\u2019s no dress watch, and it might be a deal breaker to some people. The 42mm diameter can also use some downsizing, but luckily the curved lugs don\u2019t put the watch over the edge of my 6in wrist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bracelet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The oyster bracelet is also fairly standard with a &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/adhlxYE.jpg\"&gt;mostly brushed appearance&lt;/a&gt;. The bracelet is not bad by any means but I wish it looked more outstanding with some distinct polished touches, other than those currently on the edges of each link. It simply doesn\u2019t feel as if the bracelet was designed together with the watch (which it probably really wasn\u2019t). The bridge stamped out of sheet metal also cheapens the overall feel. Fortunately, any bracelet is replaceable and I\u2019m glad to find out that the watch also looks great on brown leather.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final remarks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a watch of this calibre (pun intended), it\u2019s in line with the SARY, which is just below the SARB in terms of movement and quality of the bracelet etc. For about &lt;strong&gt;US$300&lt;/strong&gt;, it\u2019s an attractive deal for having such unique feature, i.e. the central power reserve. Overall, I\u2019m happy with this timepiece especially with the dial finishing. Definitely a worthy choice for someone looking for a \u201cbaby Grand Seiko\u201d that is less mainstream than a SARY/SARB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Unique power reserve location&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Aesthetical shape and colour of the hands&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Beautiful sunburst dial&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Very fair pricing (~US$300 at time and place of purchase)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neutral&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Uses 4R movement instead of the better 6R&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not dressy enough&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dislikes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Large 14.5mm thickness and 42mm diameter&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Boring font on the date dial, also they\u2019re not aligned&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bracelet does not look or feel very premium although it holds up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Side note:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I happen to have bought the last white-dialled example from CreationWatches. Unfortunately, other places on the Internet do not sell it at this price any more, although I saw it crop up on Massdrop once. This particular watch has a ding on the side, which manifested the risk I had to take with grey market dealers, but I plan on wearing it anyway. I would still recommend CreationWatches for their free DHL express delivery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Watches", "name": "t1_dg4n1jk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491962338.0, "created_utc": 1491933538.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qls5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sha5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ygum", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Oulomos", "parent_id": "t3_64sha5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Watches", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for the great photos!\n\nIMO it's too big for your wrist, but as long as you're happy with it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the great photos!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMO it&amp;#39;s too big for your wrist, but as long as you&amp;#39;re happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Watches", "name": "t1_dg4ygum", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491974983.0, "created_utc": 1491946183.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qls5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sha5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qls5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sha5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qls5", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sha5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4r85h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jawshoe", "parent_id": "t1_dg4po2i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Watches", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah got it thanks.
