The wives come to Eugene. He asks what they want, and they say they know he gave the pills to Sasha. They threaten to tell Negan if he doesn&amp;#39;t make new pills to kill Negan. Then Negan arrives and asks what&amp;#39;s going on. Nobody dares to anwser. Negan is angry and says he won&amp;#39;t accept to suffer people plotting against him. He is about to go apeshit, but a mad Simon breaks in and tells Negan to come and see. They go to the windows and we see Rick&amp;#39;s army standing there, just outside the Sanctuary (Everyone&amp;#39;s there except Michonne, Rosita, Daryl and Tara). Camera zooms on Rick as he fires a shot in the sky and orders Negan to come out, to talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CREDITS ROLL.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We see flashbacks of what happened just after 7x16. Rick tells Carl he loves him and that he isn&amp;#39;t sure if he could have coped with his death. Carl tells him that he should be able to because they are at war and anything can happen. Then we go back to present. Negan goes on a balcony and sarcastically asks Rick what he wants. They talk about what happened, about Sasha, and about loyalty. Rick says his men won&amp;#39;t betray him because they trust him, whereas Negan&amp;#39;s Saviors don&amp;#39;t. Rick even points out the Scavengers&amp;#39;s absence here. Camera zooms on Carol&amp;#39;s worried face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flashbacks again. Back in ASZ, Carol breaks up with Tobin and he seems to understand. At night, people sleep in the houses or under tents and there is a firecamp with a lot of people within the walls. Carol and Ezekiel are on duty guard outside. They hear a noise, and find Shiva eating a zombie. Comic moment where Carol asks if she won&amp;#39;t get sick and Zeke tells her that tigers are known to eat much worse. After showing impressive shooter skills to take out a zombie, Carol tells Zeke they should get back him. He smiles and anwsers he prefers to stay here, just with her. She laughs and says they should embrace the contradiction : go back inside and yet stay together. Ezekiel laughs and they go in. She has a talk with Rick, who thanks her for coming back. Then we see Carol taking care of Michonne and Rosita, while talking to Daryl. As camera is on her worried face, Daryl says that sadly, they&amp;#39;ll have to suffer many more casulaties during this war. At morning, she appears to still be thinking about it, and she&amp;#39;s looking at something. Camera doesn&amp;#39;t move and reveal that Ezekiel (who walks in) slept in the same house as her. He asks if she is okay. She says &amp;quot;Your tiger shat in my tub&amp;quot;. It appears that she was looking at the tub. They both laugh. Zeke jokingly says that a shit like won&amp;#39;t be a very good ally. He and Carol pretty much eyefuck during this scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go back to present, Negan shows off his new best friend, Gregory. The traitor tells the Hilltopers to lay down their weapons or they&amp;#39;ll be banished from Hilltop. Maggie tells her men she&amp;#39;ll understand if they decide to give up, but none does. Negan is furious and throws Gregory from the building (small building, he doesn&amp;#39;t die). Maggie notices snipers on the roof and yells at everyone to take cover, and they hide behind the buses and trucks as bullets start flying everywhere. Camera is on Maggie&amp;#39;s face as she takes shots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flashbacks. At morning, the leaders decide what to do next. They are going to attack the Sanctuary first, to break Negan and get the upper hand. Then we see the army on the highway where Richonne destroyed that herd. Maggie watches as the group moves cars and holds her belly. It grew a bit. Everyone works together. She smiles.\nGo back to present, she still smiles as she manages to kill one of the snipers. Enid and Carol have a sweet moment when she holds back the little girl and saves her from getting killed, calling her &amp;quot;Sophia&amp;quot; out of panic. Carol regrets her mistake, but also realises that she managed to save her. Morgan sees it and nods at her. Camera is on his stoic face as he takes shots after shots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flashbacks. On the highway, Morgan and Rick are moving cars together. They talk about killing and Morgan seems peaceful now. He kills only when it&amp;#39;s needed. He says his mind is clear. We see that they used the cars to make a way like they did in 6x01. Rick and his group use the car horns and then he climbs on a car with Morgan, who asks what it&amp;#39;s needed for. They hear a lot of walkers roaring and getting closer. Rick smiles and anwsers &amp;quot;For this&amp;quot;.\nWe go back to present. Negan now also hears the roaring from his position. He yells insults and orders his men to get back in. Rick&amp;#39;s army start shooting the windows. We eventually see hundreds of walkers heading towards the Sanctuary. Rick yells that their plan is working and that they must get back in the buses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flashbacks. Rick is on the car on the highway and makes a speech to his army. He tells them he&amp;#39;ll drive a truck through the fence. Negan won&amp;#39;t kill him because it&amp;#39;s a game to him. But he must be him. He sees the walkers coming through the cars&amp;#39;s way and tells everyone to get ready, and they head to the Sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go back to present. The walkers have arrived at the Sanctuary. Rick is about to go in the truck but Carol stops. She says she abandonned them for so long, that she needs to redeem herself by doing it herself. Rick  tells her not to and she tells him she is strong. He says he knows but he can&amp;#39;t let her. &amp;quot;I am not talking about that&amp;quot; she says as she hits him in the balls. He falls and she manages to go in the truck. She tells Rick she is sorry but she&amp;#39;ll be fine. Then she starts driving. Rick tries to follow her but Maggie forces him to the bus and tells him that Carol is gonna be okay. They try to reach the buses but they leave without them. (like when the bus left without Daryl &amp;amp; Beth in 4x08). Inside one, Ezekiel asks where Carol and Rick are. Jesus asks the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The buses leave by one way, Rick and Maggie by another. Then it cuts to Carol&amp;#39;s face as she drives the truck. She smiles because she is doing it for her group. She just destroys the walkers that Eugene put on the fence. As all music stops, she drives through the fence and destroys it too. In a beautiful shot, we see the truck causing a mayhem in the courtyard, then crushing into a wall. We only see smoke, and Carol having appearently passed out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last flashback. The army is walking towards the Sanctuary, which is just a mile away. Rick tells everyone to get ready as soon as possible. Carol has a private talk with Ezekiel. She tells him she is going to drive the truck herself because she feels guilty, because they need Rick for the battles to come, and because she knows she&amp;#39;ll be more useful inside Negan&amp;#39;s base. She points out the need of Negan having a hostage from Rick&amp;#39;s army, because he&amp;#39;ll try to strike a deal to make peace, using this hostage, and will let his guard down. Zeke says he doesn&amp;#39;t agree and tries to make her promise she won&amp;#39;t do anything. He ends up kissing her. She says she won&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Present again. Carol gets out of the truck and sees the walkers getting in. She falls on the ground and hears a voice saying &amp;quot;look at what we got here&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s Negan. Camera shows his shadow covering Carol&amp;#39;s face. He gives his remixed comic line &amp;quot;you think I&amp;#39;d let you get off that easy did you ?
