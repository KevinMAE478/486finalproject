Add increased costs of the cast amounting to something in the region of a 800% increase plus AMC never increasing the budget per episode and in fact lowering it by 35% early on and it all leads to an obvious conclusion, if the show is making profit then they will continue to make it with no regard for the story and once it hits negative numbers they will cancel it. A point to note, cast were only signed up for another 2 season (7&amp;amp;8) and then contracts will need negotiating again which will no doubt add another strain to the already gutted budget. As AMC were unwilling to up the budget from 1 to 6 while the cast were on a very low figure (Andy Lincoln was on 90k from 1 to 6 and is now on 650k for 7 and 8) for a show that was raking in profit and viewership was very high it is highly unlikely they will consider an increase ever now the dip is taking hold. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thewalkingdead", "name": "t1_dg46ljo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491942573.0, "created_utc": 1491913773.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rygv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q9y8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rygv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64q9y8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4e8ii", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SimplyMe94", "parent_id": "t1_dg47usw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thewalkingdead", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm not surprised by the dislikes, I've always suspected that AMC execs lurk on here.
