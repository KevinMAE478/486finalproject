Also Merle interacting with characters like Abraham, Gabriel, Jesus, Morgan and Negan would be cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andrea (just hear me out on this one) I know a lot of people call her the worst character in the series, but I think if she was kept alive at the end of S3, I think the writers could redeemed her and would relate more to how her character is in the comics. Laurie Holden isn&amp;#39;t a bad actress (at least I don&amp;#39;t think so anyway) she was just playing the character the way she was written with the material she was given. She may not have given the best performances out of everyone else, but she had a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "thewalkingdead", "name": "t1_dgb818x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492321523.0, "created_utc": 1492292723.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rygv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hulf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgclkdg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iWentRogue", "parent_id": "t3_65hulf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thewalkingdead", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I wish Merle would have lasted longer than what he did.
