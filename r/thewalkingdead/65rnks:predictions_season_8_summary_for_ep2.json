Carol is forced up by Negan&amp;#39;s men and they lead her to the door, while Negan and a few other stay back to fight the dead. They are quickly surrounded. Out of nowhere Carol manages to grab a gun and save Negan&amp;#39;s life. She orders everyone back inside and they follow her. Negan is utterly shocked. As they manage to get back in, he quickly yells at his men to shut the door as walkers get closer, which they do. Carol introduces herself to Negan and tells him they have to talk. Negan doesn&amp;#39;t anwser, walks past her and grabs something we don&amp;#39;t see. She asks him if he acceps to talk to her. In a low-angle shot on his face, Negan raises his arm and, smiling, he yells : &amp;quot;Let the slaughter begins !&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CREDITS ROLL.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s revealed that Negan was just about to start a ping pong game with Gary. Carol has to watch him play and tries to hide her boredom. Negan does his little Negan things and ends up winning. Carol smiles and congratulates him on his fierce swings. Negan eyefucks Carol but doesn&amp;#39;t seem to really trust her. He accepts to talk to her, but not in private, just right here. She tells him the reason why she went here and saved his life : because she was basically used by Rick as a weapon and wasn&amp;#39;t not recognized for her good job. She pulls her little act on and starts crying, saying that she couldn&amp;#39;t have it anymore and she needed to go somewhere where she could be recognized and respected. Negan is impressed. &amp;quot;Damn&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;Listen, I understand you were quite pissed off and impatient to be known as the badass chick you are, but did you really have to drive through my goddamn fence and bring all these undead pricks with you ?&amp;quot; She says she couldn&amp;#39;t control herself because she wanted to get away from Rick&amp;#39;s people as soon as possible. She apologizes. Negan tells Dwight to keep a close eye on her. D takes her somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Negan starts playing over again, but one of the wives comes in tells Negan that they have to talk. They go to a corridor nearby, where she tells Negan that Eugene was probably involved in Sasha&amp;#39;s death (for the ones wondering how the wives could know about Sasha&amp;#39;s death : they were told by the Saviors who had just came back after 7x16). She tells him about the pills he can make. He says he probably made those pills to help Sasha to die. Negan thanks her and tells her he&amp;#39;ll think about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol is in a sweet cell. Dwight comes in. He is bringing her food. It&amp;#39;s a funny scene because they both hesitate to speak because they don&amp;#39;t exactly know on which side is actually the other one, and they both don&amp;#39;t want to break their cover. As he leaves he tells Carol that it&amp;#39;s still the best she can hope for in this world. She asks him if he is sure of that. He leaves without answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Negan and his men are watching the courtyard from a balcony. &amp;quot;It sucks&amp;quot; says Simon as they see the hundreds of walkers at their gates. He asks Negan if he thinks Carol is serious or lying, to which Negan answers that he needs more time to know, but whatever she&amp;#39;s really up to, he likes her anyway. He takes a talkies and it&amp;#39;s clear that he is talking to Jadis. Funny conversation. He tries to imitate the Scavengers way of talking &amp;quot;Shit here. Lots of&amp;quot;. He orders Jadis to send 2 armies : one to attack Hilltop and one to attack Alexandria. She asks why not one to attack Kingdom, and he answers &amp;quot;because REASONS&amp;quot;. Conversation ends. Negan then turns over to watch the herd, raises his hands above his head, and says : &amp;quot;Now boys, let&amp;#39;s deal with that shit !&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a badass scene that follows. Negan and the Saviors go out and fight the herd \u00e0 la No Way Out. Tractors are used to throw logs on the walkers (it&amp;#39;s supposed that it&amp;#39;s the same tractors that were used to block the road with logs in 6x16). Badass music and all stuff. A few explosives are thrown from the balconies to blow the herd (it&amp;#39;s funny because first these explosives were supposed to destroy that herd on the highway, then were taken to be used against Saviors, before being taken again BY Saviors to be used against Rick&amp;#39;s army, before finally being used for their original purpose). The herd thins out but there is still too many of them, so Negan decides to go back in. He tells his men to take turns in the next hours to kill what remains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Off screen he orders Eugene to come to him in the great hall of the Sanctuary. There he organizes a meeting between him and the wives. He seems pissed off and says he can&amp;#39;t have such conflits going on inside his own house during wartime. Dwight comes in with Carol at this moment. Negan says she probably already knows Eugene. The mullet guy seems embarrassed. The wives accuse him to have made suicide pills and to have given them to Sasha. Doc Porter doesn&amp;#39;t know what to say. Carol steps up : she says that he indeed knows how to make pills, as he was making drugs on Rick&amp;#39;s order to keep her up and ready everytime (she acts and cries again). But she says that she asked him to help her to commit suicide (to end her miserable slave&amp;#39;s life under Rick&amp;#39;s malevolence) and he refused because he didn&amp;#39;t want to be responsible. She says the same probably happened with Sasha and he probably refused too. Negan seems convinced. The wives are pissed. Carol thanks Negan for believing her and says it&amp;#39;s the first time someone really believes her. She ends up kissing him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dwight and Eugene have a short talk about life. It&amp;#39;s the same kind of awkward scene than the one between Carol and Dwight earlier. It&amp;#39;s said during this scene that Carol is now allowed to walk freely in the Sanctuary. They end up in the great hall where Negan is playing ping pong. Simon&amp;#39;s group enter after killing some walkers. Simon tells Negan &amp;quot;look at who we found hiding in a bin !&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s Gregory. Negan mocks him and tells Simon to take him to a nice cell where he&amp;#39;ll wait till things get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At night, Eugene is eating pickles in his room. Carol breaks in. He is frightened. She swears she won&amp;#39;t hurt him and just asks him how he is and what happened with these pills and girls. He explains that they&amp;#39;ve tried to kill Negan with it. Carol just nods and leaves, but Eugene thanks her for having helped him. She just says that they are a family and they have to help each other. She then goes to visit Negan&amp;#39;s wives. They don&amp;#39;t seem to like her, but she manages to get a heart-to-heart conversation with them. She explains them how she also wants to have Negan dead and how they need to be united. She says Eugene is a good guy just lost for now. She ends up group-hugging the girls like a mom would do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol walks back to her cell to go to sleep, but Negan stops her. He basically proposes her to marry him just right now and become one of his wives. She accepts. Carol knows her plan is working because even though she is from Rick&amp;#39;s team, Negan noticed that she came with Kingdom and was close to the King. That&amp;#39;s the reason why he didn&amp;#39;t send an army to Kingdom : he&amp;#39;ll just try to have them lay down their weapons with his hostage (and by doing that, he&amp;#39;ll also lay down his guard). He says that now they must be honest to each other, so he needs to know if she really took drugs made from Eugene or not. She says she did, but he says that he needs to be SURE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he takes her to Doc Carson (Hilltop doctor). He makes his doctor things and confirms that she indeed took morphine two weeks ago. She adds that it was the last time she accepted to take it, and then she fled for the Kingdom. Negan seems happy. Simon calls him so Negan gets out of the room. Carson and Carol have a private talk. She explains that she was shot by a Savior and the morphine she took was from Kingdom&amp;#39;s doctors to heal. Carson smiles and says she is a good liar and they&amp;#39;re gonna need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At morning, Negan and the Saviors go out by the door. Beautiful shot of them at sunrise, walking on a sea of corpses. The entire herd has been wiped out. Negan gives a speech about the Saviors being &amp;quot;the swinging dicks of this world&amp;quot;. They can now go to war. Everyone cheers. Negan smiles at Carol who&amp;#39;s on a balcony, who smiles back at him. Then she looks at the truck she drove, still crushed in the wall and she smiles even more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPISODE ENDS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "It goes with this :\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/62w8l6/s7_spoilers_tsdf_spoilers_comic_spoilers_how_i/\n\nEPISODE 1 : https://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/65jsaq/predictions_season_8_summary_for_ep1/\n\n\n**EPISODE 8x02**\n\n\n*some things might have changed between the episode's description and what really goes down here*\n\nCold open on the zombies surrounding the Sanctuary.
