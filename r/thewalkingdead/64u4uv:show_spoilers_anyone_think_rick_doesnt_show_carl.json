I don't know why people blame characters (as if they're real) for writers not utilising certain relationships properly. This is a pacing problem, where Rick's story is so central to moving the plot forward that he cannot even have moments with his son just because. They actually did this *properly* in season 2, where it was a legitimate aspect of Rick's plot that he was neglecting to spend time with Carl. He had several characters point it out to him then fixed it. The advice he gave to Carl was the advice Carl looked back on when he had to put Lori down. That's good writing. Rick barely interacting with Carl all of season 7 is poor, abysmal pacing, because if there's two people who should be in constant on-screen contact, it's the main character and his child. \n\n&gt; But there's recently been several moments and even a whole episode dedicated to Rick's relationship with Michonne.\n\nFor the characters, Rick and Michonne have only been dating around a month. When they got together, it was just before the Negan line up. So there obviously needed to be an episode where they had their \"honeymoon\" (which is how the actors defined that episode, generally meaning it was a one-off to establish them as devoted to and happy with one another). I also don't see how an episode about Rick's romantic life negates his relationship to his son. \n\n&gt; After the Wolves attacked Alexandria (with Carl and Judith in it), would've been nice to see a scene with Rick find them and embracing them.\n\nThe episode was centered around Carol and Morgan, so there's your issue. The writers choose a few characters then base the entire episode's events around just those ones, instead of showing us a broad, realistic look at everyone's reaction. \n\n&gt; Didn't comfort Carl when he essentially called himself a one-eyed freak when the group was first going to Hilltop.\n\nMore bad writing. This was so Carl could still be insecure about it when he met Negan the following season. This is where I don't even know how the writers deem this kind of stuff passable. They care so little about realistic interaction now that they'll have a guy just stare blankly at his own son's insecurities about a life-changing injury, because they have NO IDEA how else to continue that insecurity over a season. Compare that to how they handled Rick's neglect in S2 and lead it into S3 above and you can see how untalented the current writing crew is.\n\n&gt; Was only slightly upset, not even concerned, that Carl had broke into the Savior's base and attacked them.\n\nAgain, we were shown nothing except the next part of his plan. He just went from \"OK I will fight back\" to \"Now I am recruiting people\". No time to just stop. Because the script doesn't call for it and the writers clearly see no use in it, or don't even think/care about it.\n\n&gt; The most glaring and upsetting example to me was in the Season 7 finale, when Carl is literally MOMENTS away from being killed by Negan, and Rick doesn't even try to help. He sheds ONE tear. It's not like he had any reason to stay complacent at that point, as he'd thought Michonne was also dead.\n\nThis is dumb and I'm surprised so many people don't seem to understand Rick was out of options here. There's nothing he could've done to save Carl in that moment. Begging in 701 did jack shit. Why would crying and begging again do anything this time? When he'd just twice tried to rise against Negan. The time for begging and crying was long over. Do you really think Rick doesn't care if his son his killed?? Like that's what you're really getting at here with no logic whatsoever. \"He didn't cry therefore he hate Carl now\". Come on. Look at the position he was in. \n\n&gt; I get that the idea was to emphasize his newfound fearlessness in the face of Negan, but how are you going to convince me in the future that he still cares about his son when he didn't even try to say his farewell to him? A shot of him sobbing slightly and looking at Carl one last time, saying \"I love you, son.\" would've driven home some heavy emotions.\n\nYeah but TIGER REVEAL LOL. Honestly, it should be clear the crew's priority is big set pieces and surprise moments now.
