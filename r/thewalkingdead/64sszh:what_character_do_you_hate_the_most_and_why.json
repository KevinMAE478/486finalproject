What do you mean by mixed messages?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying &amp;quot;stay&amp;quot; to him was in regards to him just saving Carl&amp;#39;s life. You don&amp;#39;t tell a close family friend to fuck off after he risked his life for your little boy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lori warned Rick because Dale confided his concerns about Shane, his theory about Otis and because Shane had just lied (again, in her view) to get her to do what he wanted (when he said Rick was already back at the farm after she tried driving after him, to her this was confirmation he did indeed lie about Rick being dead, too). She was correct in everything she said about Shane, and her warning is why Rick was ready for him when things went downhill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She thanked Shane for saving her and tried to clear up their mess a little too late in the game but, as she explained, she was doing so because she was scared for the group&amp;#39;s safety after the Sophia and Dale incidents. She&amp;#39;d gotten comfortable at the farm and the fear made her bring their issues to the table, so they wouldn&amp;#39;t regret not resolving it before it&amp;#39;s too late. She was not leading him on at any point in the conversation she started here. She felt she was closing their chapter for good. The irony being it was too late because Shane&amp;#39;s stability was hanging by a thread and &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; basic pleasantries from Lori was all he needed to break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she gets mad at Rick, it&amp;#39;s because Carl was involved.
