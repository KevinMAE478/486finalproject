We all place our faith in something because our existence is full of unknowns, yet **we need to believe in something in order to construct an understanding of our world and then act within it**. That is not wrong or dangerous (well, it is dangerous, but good luck avoiding your own lack of knowledge). What is really dangerous is forgetting what faith means--that you don't actually *know*--and then expanding that faith to include claims that are non-necessary. What does that mean? What it means is this: whether you believe in an intelligent creator of the universe or not (not talking about Christian God, just the concept of a creator), there are only two possibilities: there either is such a creator or there is not. We have no conclusive evidence to support one conclusion or the other at this vague level, so it becomes a ***necessary* article of faith**, meaning that even if you don't know the answer, you know that this question must have an answer and you also know exactly what the answer could possibly be. It is either Yes or No. Which do you place your faith in?\n\nHere is an illustrative example in case the above still doesn't make sense.\n\nImagine that one day we unexpectedly discover a toaster-sized black cube buried underground as part of a normal archeological dig. It is made out of a material that we have never encountered before that is so tough that we have no way of cutting into it, melting it, etc. We try to analyze the cube by various means, but we cannot tell conclusively whether it is solid all the way through or hollow inside like a box or made of layers of different materials. We also cannot determine who or what created the box based on what we can observe about it, nor can we establish why it came to rest where we found it.\n\nIt is accurate to say that we know: a) there is a mystery cube, b) we found it at these coordinates, c) we cannot currently determine what it is like inside of the cube, and d) we cannot currently determine where the cube originated, how it was formed, or whether there is any intent behind the cube's existence based on what we can observe about it.\n\nWe could theoretically leave it at this, but there is something in us that prevents us from doing so. This cube is too important to ignore. We cannot help but wonder what, if anything, is inside of it, and soon we will not be able to resist arriving at an intuitive conclusion about it. We can still be rational and scientific about investigating the cube, but somewhere in our hearts we have already placed our faith in an outcome in order to begin acting. What necessary forms could our faith regarding the cube take?\n\n1. The cube has an intelligent creator vs. the cube resulted from natural processes that can be explained without an appeal to intelligence or intent, no matter how surprising the process may be to us.\n1. We will one day be able to open the cube or otherwise determine what, if anything, is inside of it vs. we will never be able to determine what is inside of the cube through our own efforts.\n1. There is something of interest inside of the cube vs. there is nothing of interest inside of the cube.\n1. One day the cube will open on its own vs. the cube will never open on its own.\n\nGiven the evidence we have, there really is no strong justification for assigning a higher probability to any of these possibilities over their counterparts, but we will inherently do so because the cube's very existence forces us to react to it, and we cannot react to it until we resolve our own dissonance about the cube's possibilities.\n\nWhat if the cube contains something dangerous? Maybe we should isolate it then or try to get rid of it. But what if the cube contains nothing? Then let's not get rid of it to avoid the wasted effort. What if the cube contains something wonderful that is waiting to reveal itself to us? Then we should safeguard the cube and wait. But, then again, what if the thing that is waiting to reveal itself to us is dangerous? You see where this is leading. At some point you have to break the dissonance loop by deciding in your heart what you *feel* about the damn cube, as uncomfortable as that may be for those of us who love logic. We've already acknowledged that we don't know what's really going on with this cube, so what we think about it cannot be rational (i.e. rooted in facts)--our judgement must therefore be heuristic and based on our life experiences and subconscious processes and on our values. I can already imagine the debate:\n\n\"We cannot risk keeping this unknown cube in our midst. We cannot rule out the possibility that it contains something dangerous, therefore we must get rid of it.\"\n\n\"We have no reason to believe that the cube is dangerous. Look at it! Clearly it was designed and placed here in order to be discovered . It may contain something wonderful that we were meant to have when the time is right. We shouldn't pass up this opportunity.\"\n\n\"We believe that the cube resulted from natural processes that we are currently trying to understand. We should take sensible precautions with the cube while we study it, but we are not expecting to find anything supernatural or dangerous inside of it.

It is less stupid to believe that the box is whispering to you if you hear whispers yourself, because personal experience is the only real knowledge we ever obtain, but as a good rational being who is aware that mental illness and illusions and trickery are all possibilities, you should try to eliminate all of those possibilities but one, although this tumbles down a rabbit hole quickly in the case of genuine mental illness because can you trust your own rational faculty anymore?\n\nHappy living. :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is important that we separate religion from the actual problem, which is faith.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Faith is the faulty epistemology that leads to conclusions such as the existence of deities, pseudo science, alternative medicine etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Focus on faith and curing people of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr The problem is never faith itself but faith run amok outside of its domain of applicability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Faith in the epistemological sense refers to the belief in the unknown or the unproven.
