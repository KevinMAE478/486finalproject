Matt 19:1-12 Jesus pretty clearly reaffirms that marriage works the way the ancient Hebrews described. That includes, as he specifically says, being between a man and woman. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure you can try to explain away what Jesus says here with some interpretive jiu jitsu, and I&amp;#39;m sure many Christians do, but that&amp;#39;s not the point. Surely you can see why some Christians take that to mean marriage is between a man and a woman? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dgauorq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492303333.0, "created_utc": 1492274533.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgatew8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MouthAnusJellyfish", "parent_id": "t1_dgat1pr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What?
