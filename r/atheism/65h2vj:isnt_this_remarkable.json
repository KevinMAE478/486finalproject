They think of a philosophical nothing that is not even the fabric of spacetime. The problem with philosophical nothing is that we have no reason to believe that philosophical nothing is a physical possibility. No one has ever observed that particular nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further, they claim that everything that can change is &amp;quot;contingent&amp;quot; whatever the fuck that means and that an eternal and immutable God must have created everything else because such a God is not &amp;quot;contingent&amp;quot;. But, we&amp;#39;ve never seen such a non-contingent object. We&amp;#39;ve never seen a non-contingent object create a contingent object. And, we have no real reason to believe that the fabric of spacetime (or indeed anything else) actually is contingent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a made up concept by philosophers. It has no grounding in reality. There is no evidence that such claims are real. There is only philosophical logic that philosophers seem to think is infallible. But, it&amp;#39;s not grounded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no way to test whether the fabric of spacetime is contingent or could be created by a non-contingent object. It&amp;#39;s an assertion. The claim is that it&amp;#39;s axiomatic. But, it&amp;#39;s not really.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dgbn2ml", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492343334.0, "created_utc": 1492314534.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbce91", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "curtisconnors99", "parent_id": "t1_dgb5wyo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was referring to virtual particles.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was referring to virtual particles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dgbce91", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492327801.0, "created_utc": 1492299001.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb5wyo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Congruesome", "parent_id": "t1_dgb2gcl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No, they don't believe that \"nothing\" exists. \n\nThere is plenty going on in empty spacetime. \n\nNothing is not stable; there is always something. \n\nWhen physicists like Krauss talk about \"a universe from nothing\" they do not mean \"something came from nothing\", they mean that instabilities and vacuum fluctuations in \"empty\" spacetime, where \"virtual\" particle and anti-particle pairs constantly appear and annihilate one another, can under some circumstances cause a bubble of spacetime to inflate and create a region like our universe, an event with a net zero energy born from the crazy agitated mess of potentialities which \"empty\" spacetime contains.\n\nNobody claims something came from nothing.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, they don&amp;#39;t believe that &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot; exists. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is plenty going on in empty spacetime. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing is not stable; there is always something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When physicists like Krauss talk about &amp;quot;a universe from nothing&amp;quot; they do not mean &amp;quot;something came from nothing&amp;quot;, they mean that instabilities and vacuum fluctuations in &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; spacetime, where &amp;quot;virtual&amp;quot; particle and anti-particle pairs constantly appear and annihilate one another, can under some circumstances cause a bubble of spacetime to inflate and create a region like our universe, an event with a net zero energy born from the crazy agitated mess of potentialities which &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; spacetime contains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nobody claims something came from nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dgb5wyo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492318583.0, "created_utc": 1492289783.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb2gcl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "curtisconnors99", "parent_id": "t1_dgavlbk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Physicists.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dgb2gcl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492313870.0, "created_utc": 1492285070.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgavlbk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Congruesome", "parent_id": "t1_dgaiw8t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Who in the hell believes something came from nothing?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who in the hell believes something came from nothing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dgavlbk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492304587.0, "created_utc": 1492275787.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaiw8t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cystic_acne", "parent_id": "t3_65h2vj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not as remarkable as believing that something came from nothing.
