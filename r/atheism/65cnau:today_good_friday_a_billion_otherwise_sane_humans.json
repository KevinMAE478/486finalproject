Pointing out how intellectually dishonest the Christian faith is does not equate to the way the religious treat atheists. Hurting people's feelings because we don't accept their silly beliefs is not the same as the murder of secularists by Islamists or the fact that it is still illegal for atheists to hold office in several states in the US. This is religious apologetics 101 and only serves the purpose of shielding the religious from any and all criticism. Believing that a person died and was resurrected because it was written in a book by iron age peasants with less of an understanding of the world around them than most 5 year olds posses today is stupid.

I do get a lot of flack for watching a musical with Christian themes on easter, as well. But it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;so funny&lt;/em&gt;, and to me it&amp;#39;s better to be lighthearted on a day where it&amp;#39;s so easy to be bitter and angry (at least for me). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole tradition began when we realized our moms (both single mothers, neither of them religious) had introduced us to the musical separately, so it feels like a family tradition in a way, and since we now live far away from our family it&amp;#39;s nice to keep these things going. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if you feel like spending Easter watching a hilarious musical, maybe mocking the faith a bit, try Jesus Christ superstar, or Joseph and the amazing technicolor dream coat, and have a good laugh. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dg9cy2o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492215979.0, "created_utc": 1492187179.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cnau", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cnau", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9bdbu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "UK2KOR", "parent_id": "t1_dg973wx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Were, until Kraft fucked them up.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were, until Kraft fucked them up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dg9bdbu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492214240.0, "created_utc": 1492185440.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg973wx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 38, "report_reasons": null, "author": "knita4life", "parent_id": "t3_65cnau", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "To be fair though Cadbury eggs are the bomb.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair though Cadbury eggs are the bomb.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dg973wx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492209042.0, "created_utc": 1492180242.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 38}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cnau", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9cagn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "oomellieoo", "parent_id": "t3_65cnau", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[\"Remember kids, Jesus died for your sins...\" {eating chocolate} \"Yeah, I know, its great!\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGbdLpitzLQ)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGbdLpitzLQ\"&gt;&amp;quot;Remember kids, Jesus died for your sins...&amp;quot; {eating chocolate} &amp;quot;Yeah, I know, its great!&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dg9cagn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492215266.0, "created_utc": 1492186466.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cnau", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9cx0a", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "boot2skull", "parent_id": "t3_65cnau", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Easter is the pilate episode of The Walking Dead.
