Mormons are only [1.6%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_in_the_United_States) of the population, but they are [much more represented in politics than that.](http://www.ranker.com/list/mormon-politicians/famous-mormons)", "edited": 1491969136.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;ll agree that that&amp;#39;s a slightly hyperbolic statement, can you list even as few as ten openly atheist politicians? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;a href=\"/u/AnArzonist\"&gt;/u/AnArzonist&lt;/a&gt; I did a quick search, and here&amp;#39;s who I found that I can be confident of.  There are more who are active in news, law groups (the ACLU, for example), or in political parties, but haven&amp;#39;t won elections, and others who I think became openly atheist only several years after having retired from office.  Here are the ones who seem to be openly atheist and manged to win elected positions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Bothwell\"&gt;Cecil Bothwell&lt;/a&gt; (b. 1950): Asheville, North Carolina city council member, who was nearly denied his position because of his atheism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ernie Chambers (b. 1937): member of the Nebraska Legislature and civil rights activist.[155]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sean Faircloth (b. circa 1960): Attorney, served five terms in the Maine Legislature including appointments on the Judiciary and Appropriations Committees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kyrsten Sinema (b. 1976): U.S. Representative (D-AZ), Member of the Arizona Senate (2011\u20132012), Member of the Arizona House of Representatives (2005\u20132011).[165]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pete Stark (b. 1931): U.S. Representative (1973\u20132013) (D-CA), the first openly atheist member of Congress.[166]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Culbert Olson (1876\u20131962): Politician and Governor of California from 1939 to 1943.[164]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While there may be a few missing, that&amp;#39;s all wikipedia had listed, and considering the extensiveness of the list, it likely covers most of the major ones (I suspect a few city council members or school board members may have squeaked by, but probably not much higher up than that), and of course, there will be those with the sense to pretend religion to get elected.  There are often &lt;a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/19/atheists-in-congress_n_3944108.html\"&gt;no atheists in congress whatsoever&lt;/a&gt;.  Considering that atheists make up 3% of the American population, Agnostics another 4% on top of that, and &amp;quot;nones&amp;quot; (those who claim no religious affiliation, but don&amp;#39;t check either agnostic or atheist on the form) a total of 21%, you&amp;#39;d think we&amp;#39;d have slightly more representation in politics than that.
