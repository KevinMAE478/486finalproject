You are very confused about how the world works. You cannot claim someone deserves a job if they are unwilling to do some of the duties the job entails. How could I ever run a business if special snowflakes could claim some of their duties are against their religious convictions? And because \"religious convictions\" differ between sects and splinter groups, who is to say what is valid \"religious convictions\"? Do you just get to make them up as you go along to get out of work? What if I wanted to work at Olive Garden but said I am a Pastafarian and cannot handle pasta products because it's against my religious convictions?

I have been all over the Middle East for many years so I can say I have valid input here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just part of it. Another is just because one says something that is offensive to someone doesn&amp;#39;t mean they don&amp;#39;t have a right to say it nor does it justify violence against them. Even the most heinous speech should be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I don&amp;#39;t see this is widespread in progressive circles. Only on the fringe. Most sane, reasonable progressives may get up in arms when they see or hear something offensive to them personally but they will never disagree that being offended has no bearing on whether or not someone has the right to say or do something constitutionally protected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What I find so outrageous about the way so many publications justify silencing these people&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All publications pick and choose what story to publish and what not to publish. Not sure what your issue is here. If you don&amp;#39;t like a particular publication you are free to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, refusing to physically partake in abortions, for whatever reasons, does not make one a criminal nor does it mean the individual who refuses deserves to be unable to find a job in the medical field&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you apply to a job that provides abortion services and you are unwilling to perform your duties why in the hell do you think someone deserves that job and should be given special snowflake status? You are very confused about how the world works. You cannot claim someone deserves a job if they are unwilling to do some of the duties the job entails. How could I ever run a business if special snowflakes could claim some of their duties are against their religious convictions? And because &amp;quot;religious convictions&amp;quot; differ between sects and splinter groups, who is to say what is valid &amp;quot;religious convictions&amp;quot;? Do you just get to make them up as you go along to get out of work? What if I wanted to work at Olive Garden but said I am a Pastafarian and cannot handle pasta products because it&amp;#39;s against my religious convictions? That is pure silliness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have an honest conviction against performing abortions, DON&amp;#39;T APPLY TO A FACILITY THAT WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO DO SO. It&amp;#39;s really that simple.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dg86yj1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492144982.0, "created_utc": 1492116182.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg839d8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg7mqol", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dg839d8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492140901.0, "created_utc": 1492112101.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7mqol", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bcdiesel1", "parent_id": "t1_dg7grl5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Progressives are fighting against Western values at all costs.\n\nI'm a moderate myself but I'm totally confused by what you mean by that.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Progressives are fighting against Western values at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a moderate myself but I&amp;#39;m totally confused by what you mean by that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dg7mqol", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492123147.0, "created_utc": 1492094347.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652n1t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg85s5w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Argodargo", "parent_id": "t1_dg7grl5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You seem to have created a very bizarre meaning of the word \"progressive\". \n\nAlso, religious people and non-religious people can only co-exist peacefully in a secular society as long as the religious don't attempt to put the dictates of their bronze age books of mythology above secular law.
