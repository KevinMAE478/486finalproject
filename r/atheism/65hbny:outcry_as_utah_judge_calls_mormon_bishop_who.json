They mentioned a party, and I knew it was going to be bad news. I offered to be their Designated Driver.

Someone offered me a full cup, and said they just poured the rest of it for me. I was getting really dizzy  and about to faint so I gulped the whole thing down. That's when I realized it wasn't just orange juice. It definitely had a ton of alcohol in it. The people who offered it to me knew I was Mormon and laughed that they tricked me to drink.

I tried explaining this all to the officer but he just told me to shut my mouth.\" \nThe judge seemed to totally believe me.

He removed the ticket from my record and I was allowed to leave. No fees, community service, or anything.
