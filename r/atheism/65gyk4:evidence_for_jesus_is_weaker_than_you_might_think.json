We have records of Smiths existence, deeds, jail records, etc. They were made without any consideration for his religious impact. The mentions of Jesus we have were made in reference to the impact Christianity had in the Mediterranean world. &amp;quot;Accepting&amp;quot; that some historical person existed that served as the genesis for Christianity is either A) a lazy reluctance to exercise Critical Thinking because it creates &amp;quot;controversy&amp;quot; with a class of people who have limited to no capacity to apply it to their religious beliefs and is deemed more trouble than its worth. B) a lack of confidence to simply admit, &amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t know and it&amp;#39;s unlikely we&amp;#39;ll ever know without some astounding archaeological discovery that&amp;#39;s indisputable proof which is highly unlikely&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Resting on the laziness or fear of academia as evidence enough to assume Jesus existed is just as bad as resting on the assumption that the Bible is infallible. If you think it through there is no logical way to arrive at the conclusion a person named Jesus likely existed and kicked started this whole religion. We know the religion existed as far back as the first century. We don&amp;#39;t know more before that. It&amp;#39;d be like betting your money on what the majority of physicist believe existed before the Big Bang. Sure it&amp;#39;s the hunch of a large group of people educated in the field, but it doesn&amp;#39;t make it more real or certain because a group of educated people agree on that assumptive hunch. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dgb83x5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492321628.0, "created_utc": 1492292828.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgapquz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "guattarist", "parent_id": "t3_65gyk4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The existence of a historical Jesus is widely accepted amongst historians, so claiming someone like that never existed is definitely against the mainstream in academia.
