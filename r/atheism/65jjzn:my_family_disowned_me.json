But you&amp;#39;re still at home, you&amp;#39;re still speaking with them, and they are still supporting you. That&amp;#39;s a positive thing. Second, they obviously don&amp;#39;t hate you. If they hated you they wouldn&amp;#39;t give a shit what you believed in. They obviously care about you and are concerned about you. That&amp;#39;s also a positive thing, even if that worry is misguided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The big question is how you can move forward given this new reality. If you care about having a healthy relationship with your family, the last thing you want to do is get into meaningless arguments with them all the time. I promise you no &amp;quot;gotcha&amp;quot; argument you see here is going to magically convince them god isn&amp;#39;t real. So why bother? The next time the subject comes up, say something like this: &amp;quot;Look, this is how I feel. You always ask me to be honest with you so I am. If you are curious to know why I feel this way I&amp;#39;d be happy to explain it to you, but I really don&amp;#39;t want to argue with you. I love you and I don&amp;#39;t want this to hurt our relationship.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You still need them. That support will be vital to your success in the next few years. I&amp;#39;m assuming you still love them. So don&amp;#39;t do things that damage your relationship with them. Good luck to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dgayqvf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492308860.0, "created_utc": 1492280060.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 68}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jjzn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jjzn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jjzn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jjzn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jjzn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jjzn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jjzn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jjzn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jjzn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgattg6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bluenote73", "parent_id": "t1_dgatotg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You can tell him you will prove god doesn't exist when he proves there isn't an invisible undetectable dragon in your garage.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can tell him you will prove god doesn&amp;#39;t exist when he proves there isn&amp;#39;t an invisible undetectable dragon in your garage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dgattg6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492302101.0, "created_utc": 1492273301.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgatotg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Vaderthegamer", "parent_id": "t1_dgatkse", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I mean he was part of a order (aka he was a missionary priest)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean he was part of a order (aka he was a missionary priest)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dgatotg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492301920.0, "created_utc": 1492273120.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgatkse", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bluenote73", "parent_id": "t1_dgargd1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How can he be ex religious if he believes?\n\nThis might help your style: https://youtu.be/D8LYTy4DmEs\n\nThe outsider test for faith is essentially demonstrating that a religious person denies evidence when it's from a competing religion, and accepts it from theirs.

Until the non-believer can prove our God does not exist, God existing is the fact of reality.&amp;quot; - How would that sound to you? All I&amp;#39;ve done is move the shoe to the other foot. It sounds completely and utterly ridiculous because it is contrary to what you hold as clearly logical and true. Which is pretty much how I imagine that arguments for atheism sound to religious nuts. While I personally do not subscribe to the existence of any omniscient being, I am aware that I cannot PROVE that there isn&amp;#39;t one. Ergo, I could well be wrong.
