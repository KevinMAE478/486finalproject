I apologize for the short comment that probably made it seems as if I was just attacking you but my remark stands. Also, I strongly wish you to please not \"kill yourself\" because a life is a terrible thing to throw away my reddit brother/sister. I hope you see through your addiction as I am sure it is hell and I sincerely wish you the best. Now here is a lively discussion off your comment may it bring a good conversation or at least a welcomed time sink.\n\n\n&gt;I do believe in powers greater than myself because any idiot can readily observe that there are many things beyond thier control.\n\nAs an idiot on many occasions, What can I observe to make me believe in a greater power? I observe the world and see no evidence of this power. I agree there are universal things (one specific one: gravity) beyond my control but why label them god?\n\n&gt;I believe in the mechanics of the universe. I believe in good and evil. I believe in black and white.\n\nI too believe in the mechanics of the universe as described by peer reviewed science and make no claim to no anything more. I lose you at the good and evil and black and white part. Can an action by a individual that benefits another individual be considered good? Sure it can. But that action can also be considered \"evil\" by others that it does not benefit the same way? And by the same token the \"Black and White comment\". I see everything in shades of glorious grey to put my position in your context.\n\n&gt; I'm forced to wonder where their resentment lies...\n\nI resent the word \"God\" in the fact that it is the purpose/cause for much evil in our world caused by the actions informed by the beliefs of its followers, where logic and the ability to reason goes out the window. I grew up in a casual southern baptist church and had nothing traumatic happen. Simply put, around the age of 15-16 my internal bullshit detector started going off and I began investigating why that eventually lead to me classifying of myself as an \"atheist\" around age 20. I am an atheist because I am unconvinced by claims of Christianity or any other god argument I have heard. I consider myself a Explicit Weak Atheist, an atheist that has no assertion there cannot be a god, I reject the god claims I have been presented due to lack of evidence. \n\n&gt;I believe in a \"god\" of my understanding, and when we break apart the definitions and get down to actual root causes, you do too, even though it would basically destroy you to admit it. You just don't want to see it, thus pride is the issue here. \n\nNo - it would not destroy me, and frankly I have no idea what your talking about. You are classifying god as some vague \"Greater Power\". That's all well and good but then you are not an atheist (maybe a form of deist) and I have no inclination to change my position on that argument and your piddly remarks that I was raped by a priest and your malice laden sympathy is not warranted. \n\n&gt; You just don't want to see it, thus pride is the issue here. \n\nI have no pride in being an atheist. It just a position on the question \"Do you believe in a god?\". If there was good evidence for a god I would no longer be an atheist. \n\nThanks for your time.\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off: Thanks for the reply. I apologize for the short comment that probably made it seems as if I was just attacking you but my remark stands. Also, I strongly wish you to please not &amp;quot;kill yourself&amp;quot; because a life is a terrible thing to throw away my reddit brother/sister. I hope you see through your addiction as I am sure it is hell and I sincerely wish you the best. Now here is a lively discussion off your comment may it bring a good conversation or at least a welcomed time sink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I do believe in powers greater than myself because any idiot can readily observe that there are many things beyond thier control.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an idiot on many occasions, What can I observe to make me believe in a greater power? I observe the world and see no evidence of this power. I agree there are universal things (one specific one: gravity) beyond my control but why label them god?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I believe in the mechanics of the universe. I believe in good and evil. I believe in black and white.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I too believe in the mechanics of the universe as described by peer reviewed science and make no claim to no anything more. I lose you at the good and evil and black and white part. Can an action by a individual that benefits another individual be considered good? Sure it can. But that action can also be considered &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; by others that it does not benefit the same way? And by the same token the &amp;quot;Black and White comment&amp;quot;. I see everything in shades of glorious grey to put my position in your context.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m forced to wonder where their resentment lies...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I resent the word &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; in the fact that it is the purpose/cause for much evil in our world caused by the actions informed by the beliefs of its followers, where logic and the ability to reason goes out the window. I grew up in a casual southern baptist church and had nothing traumatic happen. Simply put, around the age of 15-16 my internal bullshit detector started going off and I began investigating why that eventually lead to me classifying of myself as an &amp;quot;atheist&amp;quot; around age 20. I am an atheist because I am unconvinced by claims of Christianity or any other god argument I have heard. I consider myself a Explicit Weak Atheist, an atheist that has no assertion there cannot be a god, I reject the god claims I have been presented due to lack of evidence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I believe in a &amp;quot;god&amp;quot; of my understanding, and when we break apart the definitions and get down to actual root causes, you do too, even though it would basically destroy you to admit it. You just don&amp;#39;t want to see it, thus pride is the issue here. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No - it would not destroy me, and frankly I have no idea what your talking about. You are classifying god as some vague &amp;quot;Greater Power&amp;quot;. That&amp;#39;s all well and good but then you are not an atheist (maybe a form of deist) and I have no inclination to change my position on that argument and your piddly remarks that I was raped by a priest and your malice laden sympathy is not warranted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You just don&amp;#39;t want to see it, thus pride is the issue here. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no pride in being an atheist. It just a position on the question &amp;quot;Do you believe in a god?&amp;quot;. If there was good evidence for a god I would no longer be an atheist. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dgaw6x0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492305403.0, "created_utc": 1492276603.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dganzlt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JimmyHungwell", "parent_id": "t1_dgalt9h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I do not believe in the traditional God that organized religion sells as if it were a commodity, I don't pray, I don't pay and I will bow to no man physical or mythical.
