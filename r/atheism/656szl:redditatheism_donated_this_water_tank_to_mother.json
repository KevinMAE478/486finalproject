We should be charitable by selflessness not to prove to religions we can be charitable too. Otherwise, as you say, we are just like religions, only being charitable for our own selfishness (i.e. religions to it to get into whatever &amp;#39;heaven&amp;#39; they believe in)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why the only &amp;#39;religion&amp;#39; I believe to be right on charity is Buddhism. Although you could argue their goal is enlightenment, it&amp;#39;s sort of more the other way round. They aren&amp;#39;t charitable to reserve them a place somewhere like Christian&amp;#39;s. They are charitable because it makes them a good person, and that is needed for enlightenment. It&amp;#39;s not just a checkbox like in Christianity, they believe they must become charitable &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "atheism", "name": "t1_dg8xm4z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492187888.0, "created_utc": 1492159088.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8vi2d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NotAnAnticline", "parent_id": "t1_dg8q4d9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/atheism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why is it so important to get recognition for doing good things - is recognition the goal?
