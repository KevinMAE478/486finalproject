Now I'm only going to the service for my family. I feel it's the least I can do and I'm starting to treat this holiday more like Thanksgiving and Christmas rather than it's own special holiday. Perhaps it's because I'm growing accustom to the secular view of it which is essentially just another holiday I can chill with the fam on.\n\nBut yeah, Easter is pretty much the service of all services. The whole reason as to why you believe is done in that service, or really in the Friday service if you want to get technical, which I kind of like more as the service ends when he dies. It's slowly become the only service I go to now as I've been free of weekend services while at college for a couple of years.
