There isn't much research in that way, so it's fairly unfounded, but even then I don't think that's a great justification. A lot of the reasons for FGM were very much rooted in the idea of community and togetherness. Specifically, it was a lot of women who had it done to them that encouraged it, which is interesting from a feminism point of view. Like most people assume it's men and the patriarchy tell women what to do with their body, but it seems more so from women (definitely influenced by patriarchy) supporting the idea as a sort of coming of age, joining the community of women, and by not through it signifies a rejection of culture / society.
