First of all, watch the video they refer to in the article. https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=f74_1452606016\n\n&gt;Could you find the word \"rape\" in there? Neither could I, unless you assume muslims rape their wives, since she said muslims can have sex with slave-women as they have sex with their wives.\n\n&gt;Secondly, from the tone and subject, I can make out that this professor is talking about the general concept of owning slaves. She explains that the only legitimate way for a muslim to acquire a slave, is through war. She actively denounces all human traficking, including mail-order brides from East-Asia specifically. She also explains that the muslims right now cannot engage in war with Israel, so while she mentions Israel as a hostile nation against a muslim nation, she's not encouraging the attack upon Israel.\n\n&gt;Basically, what this professor is doing is explaining the fiqh of slavery in Islam, and she is being honest by also explaining that there is a legitimate means of acquiring slaves, though it is very limited. This means being warfare between a muslim nation and a non-muslim nation. She also limits the type of warfare to defensive warfare in nature, where the slaves are taken \"to humiliate the enemy.\" In this way, any future attack by said hostile nature will be discouraged, because it resulted in the slavery of their people. She outlines that slavegirls have rights, even that wives have rights when it comes to the husband having a slavegirl(wife's permission is needed), she never mentions rape(physically harming one's slave is forbidden, so that includes rape) and she certainly doesn't say \"muslim men can rape non-muslim women to teach them a lesson.\"\n\n&gt;Basically, sensationalist article, based on a desire to put words into the mouth of an honourable professor at Al Azhar university. If you look behind her, it says \"fiqh al imra'\", meaning \"the jurisprudence of women\", so laws and rights of women.

Also remember Islam does NOT allow what you consider &amp;#39;slavery&amp;#39; - because slavery is complete submission which is not true in Islamic law - so it would be wrong to use what you think slavery means. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Where even to start? First of all, watch the video they refer to in the article. &lt;a href=\"https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=f74_1452606016\"&gt;https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=f74_1452606016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could you find the word &amp;quot;rape&amp;quot; in there? Neither could I, unless you assume muslims rape their wives, since she said muslims can have sex with slave-women as they have sex with their wives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, from the tone and subject, I can make out that this professor is talking about the general concept of owning slaves. She explains that the only legitimate way for a muslim to acquire a slave, is through war. She actively denounces all human traficking, including mail-order brides from East-Asia specifically. She also explains that the muslims right now cannot engage in war with Israel, so while she mentions Israel as a hostile nation against a muslim nation, she&amp;#39;s not encouraging the attack upon Israel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, what this professor is doing is explaining the fiqh of slavery in Islam, and she is being honest by also explaining that there is a legitimate means of acquiring slaves, though it is very limited. This means being warfare between a muslim nation and a non-muslim nation. She also limits the type of warfare to defensive warfare in nature, where the slaves are taken &amp;quot;to humiliate the enemy.&amp;quot; In this way, any future attack by said hostile nature will be discouraged, because it resulted in the slavery of their people. She outlines that slavegirls have rights, even that wives have rights when it comes to the husband having a slavegirl(wife&amp;#39;s permission is needed), she never mentions rape(physically harming one&amp;#39;s slave is forbidden, so that includes rape) and she certainly doesn&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;muslim men can rape non-muslim women to teach them a lesson.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, sensationalist article, based on a desire to put words into the mouth of an honourable professor at Al Azhar university.
