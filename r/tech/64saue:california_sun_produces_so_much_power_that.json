In fact, the world&amp;#39;s largest power plant has always been one hydroelectric plant or another, dating back to the very beginning of the power grid, at which time it was the Queenston-Chippewa hydroelectric plant at Niagara Falls on top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Queenston-Chippewa power plant is still there today, now called Sir Adam Beck generating station, and while it is limited by the tourist draw that is Niagara Falls (wasted energy, what a shame!) and various international agreements to maintain certain water levels in the lakes, it still technically holds the record as the largest hydroelectric reserve in the world (or it would, if anyone was keeping track), as it has essentially all of the upper great lakes for capacity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it wasn&amp;#39;t for the fact that we have roughly 40 million people living around the great lakes and huge amounts of economic advantages being tied to the lakes, it would be a much more attractive option to use them as an immense water battery. Unfortunately, we&amp;#39;ll probably have to look somewhere else for the large capacity energy storage that we need, but it&amp;#39;s cute that mother nature almost provided us a perfect one right there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tech", "name": "t1_dg5cawb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491993077.0, "created_utc": 1491964277.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh48", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64saue", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5celi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AML86", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ak7i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tech", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, and doing so serves two purposes.

Yes, your windmill will write down faster when producing power as opposed to standing still, but much less than a coal plant or even a nuclear plant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hurting the competition is not always a bad replacement for revenue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This (cheap power and less affordable other modes) combine incentivise the thing that will make wind power more profitable in the long run, grid storage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tech", "name": "t1_dg5rynj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492027966.0, "created_utc": 1491999166.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4s7ap", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 105, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RobsterCrawSoup", "parent_id": "t3_64saue", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tech", "controversiality": 0, "body": "To the layman, the idea that energy prices could go negative sounds like it might be too good to be true, but it does happen and it isn't actually good at all.\n\nEdit: sorry to leave my quick quip without explanation.  I was busy and didn't have time for a full explanation.  Since I seem to owe one and none of the responses have really explained it, here is a wall of text:\n\nFirst note that in California, like many areas in the US, you have wholesale energy markets (both day-ahead and spot markets).  What follows is an oversimplification that still gets to the point.  In these markets generators submit bids to provide some capacity of power generation for specific time periods.  For any given time period you may have a Coal plant bid in at $70/MWh (megawatt-hour), a NGCC come in at $60, a NG Peaker submit a high bid of $100/MWh (these figures are entirely fictitious).  In that time period, maybe only the coal and NGCC generators are needed to meet demand, so both will be dispatched for that hour and the market settlement price will be $70/MWh, both generator are paid the market price, even though one bid was lower.  The marginal bid to meet demand sets the price.  So in the next hour when the peaker is needed to cover peaking demand, the market price may rise to $100, and all three generators get paid $100/MWh.  So even though the NGCC is biding in at their marginal cost of $60, they net a profit of $10/MWh in the first hour, but $40 in the second.\n\nNow add wind and solar to the mix (nuclear is in this category but has even more complication), the marginal cost of energy to these generators is zero, and can even be below zero for wind (you don't want to have to use the brakes on a turbine if you don't have to).  These generators want to be dispatched by default and so they will generally submit negative price bids, nuclear generators do as well.  This ensures that no matter how low the market price goes, they will almost always be dispatched.  They bid below zero, but when the market settles at $100 they get $100.  However, if there is enough capacity bidding into the market at negative prices, you have a real danger of the settlement price (or marginal price) being negative!  If you are a solar or wind producer, you get nothing. \n\nI mentioned that they have basically zero marginal cost (of energy), so zero cost, zero revenue, no problem right?  Wrong.  Solar and wind projects are still expensive, it is just that almost all the costs are fixed capital costs and fixed operating costs (meaning that they do not go up and down with the amount of energy produced).  An investor who puts lots of money into building a wind or solar farm does so with the expectation that revenues in the energy market will payback the cost of building it.  However, when wholesale prices get too low, the incentive to build out more renewable generators drops out.  These renewable generators want a stable and safe income as much as you and I.\n\nIn the long run, lower costs are good, but lower prices in wholesale markets is only good when that lower price is representative of lower costs for producers.  If not, then producers are losing money, and investment dries up.  The last thing you want if you are pro-renewables is for investment to dry up.\n\nI don't want to imply that the problem is \"too much renewable generation\".
