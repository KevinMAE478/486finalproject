Down in the states if you go to the hospital without insurance you've just gone into bankruptcy. Single ambulance ride? $1000+. You can rent a helicopter for around $100 for an entire freaking hour but 7 miles in a ambulance will cost you $1000.\n\nI have to use the VA system due to being a veteran and poor and homeless and what not. So every month I have to physically go up to the hospital again, get an appointment with the doctor, see the doctor, all to get another month of my medication since they don't really do refills on my medication, then I get to spend the 2+ hours it takes to fill prescription only to find out the doctor hadn't sent the new ones in yet so I gotta wait again.... Now here's the fun part. That was the VA in georgia but I am now in maryland(9 hour drive) so if I want to get help at the VA i'd have to go all the way back down to georgia to do so or wait a few months to enroll at the maryland VA. It's retarded.\n\nThe reason for all this bureaucracy, long wait times, separations between VA hospitals due to different \"regions\", or even their actual treatment quotas(they have a limit to how many veterans they can do stuff for or enroll into the system for various things like disability, once they hit that limit they just hide their paperwork or lose it or just deny them until the next fiscal year), is argued because they claim that people \"may abuse the system\". So basically they are allowing people to suffer, waste massive amounts of money, cause lots and lots of deaths of veterans who can't get treatment or from suicides, all because of the possible CHANCE that someone at sometime may abuse the system a little bit. Oh dear heavens you mean a veteran got too much support? Wow better make sure that can't happen and while you're at it make a bunch more die because they were forced to wait too long. I mean holy shit is that aggravating.\n\nOh yeah and the best part is as the service member i/e military veteran, you(the veteran) have to prove to the military and VA that you were ever in the military and also have to try to track down all your records/paperwork/history etc... with a mountain of repetitive as fuck paperwork/applications which all is the same exact information. You also have to literally laminate and store in a secured vault with armed guards to keep your holy relic of a piece of paper called the DD214. It's just backwards as hell. The biggest and best military in the world forces the single individual to prove everything in their history because somehow the military can't be bothered with it? The VA somehow doesn't have immediate access to what it would need to help veterans prove that they are who they say they are? Like wtf!\n\nThe way it should be is that I'm a veteran and one day I wake up and find out i'm all fucked up. I go down to the local VA say i'm \"my name\" give them my ID(any government ID, state, federal, your fucking military ID) they say cool them's be where the doctors at and they point you to exactly the place that the doctor you'd need to see to be not fucked up is at. You just wait your turn and bam you get w/e it is you need to help you with your day. No paperwork, no applying to shit, just a little line or even an appointment concept, you just prove you are who you say you are and then yup you're on the list of veterans you're good to go. You get your disability pay, medication, broken arm not so broken, w/e you need and you're done. No hassle, no wasted money from the government that's it. If you somehow are abusing the system well they eventually find out and then you're forced to pay shit back and lose some access to stuff(not all because they still deserve medical care).\n\nThat's just crazy talk though to most people in the government because if people aren't dying then their job isn't being done properly enough.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worst thing though is that false fear is preventing newer generations from being able to make changes that are vital to the future of...further generations!

So every month I have to physically go up to the hospital again, get an appointment with the doctor, see the doctor, all to get another month of my medication since they don&amp;#39;t really do refills on my medication, then I get to spend the 2+ hours it takes to fill prescription only to find out the doctor hadn&amp;#39;t sent the new ones in yet so I gotta wait again.... Now here&amp;#39;s the fun part. That was the VA in georgia but I am now in maryland(9 hour drive) so if I want to get help at the VA i&amp;#39;d have to go all the way back down to georgia to do so or wait a few months to enroll at the maryland VA. It&amp;#39;s retarded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason for all this bureaucracy, long wait times, separations between VA hospitals due to different &amp;quot;regions&amp;quot;, or even their actual treatment quotas(they have a limit to how many veterans they can do stuff for or enroll into the system for various things like disability, once they hit that limit they just hide their paperwork or lose it or just deny them until the next fiscal year), is argued because they claim that people &amp;quot;may abuse the system&amp;quot;. So basically they are allowing people to suffer, waste massive amounts of money, cause lots and lots of deaths of veterans who can&amp;#39;t get treatment or from suicides, all because of the possible CHANCE that someone at sometime may abuse the system a little bit. Oh dear heavens you mean a veteran got too much support? Wow better make sure that can&amp;#39;t happen and while you&amp;#39;re at it make a bunch more die because they were forced to wait too long. I mean holy shit is that aggravating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah and the best part is as the service member i/e military veteran, you(the veteran) have to prove to the military and VA that you were ever in the military and also have to try to track down all your records/paperwork/history etc... with a mountain of repetitive as fuck paperwork/applications which all is the same exact information. You also have to literally laminate and store in a secured vault with armed guards to keep your holy relic of a piece of paper called the DD214. It&amp;#39;s just backwards as hell. The biggest and best military in the world forces the single individual to prove everything in their history because somehow the military can&amp;#39;t be bothered with it? The VA somehow doesn&amp;#39;t have immediate access to what it would need to help veterans prove that they are who they say they are? Like wtf!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way it should be is that I&amp;#39;m a veteran and one day I wake up and find out i&amp;#39;m all fucked up. I go down to the local VA say i&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;my name&amp;quot; give them my ID(any government ID, state, federal, your fucking military ID) they say cool them&amp;#39;s be where the doctors at and they point you to exactly the place that the doctor you&amp;#39;d need to see to be not fucked up is at. You just wait your turn and bam you get w/e it is you need to help you with your day. No paperwork, no applying to shit, just a little line or even an appointment concept, you just prove you are who you say you are and then yup you&amp;#39;re on the list of veterans you&amp;#39;re good to go. You get your disability pay, medication, broken arm not so broken, w/e you need and you&amp;#39;re done. No hassle, no wasted money from the government that&amp;#39;s it. If you somehow are abusing the system well they eventually find out and then you&amp;#39;re forced to pay shit back and lose some access to stuff(not all because they still deserve medical care).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just crazy talk though to most people in the government because if people aren&amp;#39;t dying then their job isn&amp;#39;t being done properly enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tech", "name": "t1_dge1req", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492488958.0, "created_utc": 1492460158.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge0ops", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "shadowofashadow", "parent_id": "t1_dge0fk1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tech", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sure does suck.

TL:DR just scroll to the bottom I wrote too much.\n\nSo going off of one singular state as a reference point. [The state police budget for maryland from 2017-1995](http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/23dsp/html/dspb.html) was $6,350,000,000. Mind you that is specifically only state police, so local, sheriffs, etc... aren't included. 22 years cost **$6.5 billion dollars** roughly. Now multiply that by the 50 or so states(not all states will be the same obviously) as well as non-states but are funded by the US. It's a crapton of money and it's only 22 years worth of the 60 or so years.\n\n[Now, the FBI which deals significantly with the war on drugs, from 1990-1998](https://www.ncjrs.gov/ondcppubs/publications/enforce/border/fbi_1.html) had a total budget of **$20.6 billion dollars**. [From 1999-2003 total budget of FBI](https://www.justice.gov/archive/jmd/1975_2002/2002/html/page96-99.htm) was [**$21 billion dollars**](https://www.justice.gov/archive/jmd/1975_2002/2002/html/page96-99.htm).\n\n[04 $4.6 billion dollars](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbis-fiscal-year-2004-budget), \n\n05 [$5 billion dollars](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbis-fiscal-year-2005-budget-request)\n\n06 [$5.7 billion dollars](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbis-fy-2006-budget-request-1)\n\n07 [6 billion dollars](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbis-fiscal-year-2007-budget-request)\n\n08 [6.4 billion dollars](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/the-fbi-budget-for-fiscal-year-2008)\n\n09 [7.1 billion dollars](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/the-fbi-budget-for-fiscal-year-2009-1)\n\n10 [7.9 billion dollars](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/the-fbi-budget-for-fiscal-year-2010)\n\n11 [8.3 billion dollars](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/the-fbi-budget-for-fiscal-year-2011)\n\n12 [8.1 billion dollars\\(holy shit it went down?\\)](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbi-budget-for-fiscal-year-2012)\n\n13 [8.2 billion](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2013)\n\n14 [8.4 billion](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2014)\n\n15 [8.3 billion](https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2015)\n\n16 [8.5 billion](https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2016-1)\n\n17 [9.5 billion](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/821341/download)\n\nso grand total 1990-2017 is **$143.3 billion dollars**\n\nNow understanding that not all of that goes to fighting the war on drugs, but the majority of it does especially considering the absolute lack of crime that would exist if there was no war on drugs policy.\n\n[Budget for DEA 1972-2014](https://www.dea.gov/about/history/staffing.shtml) is claimed at **$50.6 billion dollars**. \n\n[2015-17 $6 billion dollars](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/822096/download).\n\nNow here's where it gets funny, and depressingly obvious how stupid the war on drugs is. From [2005-2015 the DEA took away **33.1 billion dollars**](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/822096/download) through drug money seizures and another **3.5 billion dollars** worth of assets. So a total of **36.7 billion dollars**. Why this matters? Well because that's 36.7 billion dollars that was in the US market and then was removed. A lot of it was also used by the DEA through various \"programs\" aka inflated as fuck budget by using the drug money even though it's claimed to be destroyed. Now keep in mind the DEA wouldn't exist if the war on drugs didn't.\n\n[ATF budget from 2009-2016](https://www.atf.gov/about/budget-performance) is roughly **$10 billion dollars**\n\nOk i'm going to stop breaking it down all super nice and neat because it's getting tedious and I feel i'm just repeating my points so i'll just simplify it even more. [Just take a look at this little historical federal budget graph](http://stats.areppim.com/stats/stats_usxbudget_history.htm). Scroll down a bit and you can see each year's budget. Now former president Nixon took power in 1969 but his manipulations started well before that. Either way you'll notice a drastic increase in the national budget when he took office. That increase kept increasing due to the fact that all subsequent government leaders continued Nixon's policies.\n\nNow breaking it down a bit more i'm going to generalize here and under estimate due to fluctuations in concepts over time, so we will set percentages of budget as 1969-2013:\n\nSocial security 20% is $18,252.10 billion dollars\n\nMedical care(Medicare and Medicaid) 20% is $18,252.10 billion dollars\n\nFederal departments 10% is $9126.05 billion dollars\n\nDefense departments 15% is $13689.075 billion dollars\n\nCitizen support(food stamps etc...) 13% is 11863.865 billion dollars\n\n**Total expense 1969-2013 was $91,260.50** billion dollars with **$71,183.19 billion dollars** going towards important sections that are relevant to my argument.\n\nNow, the reason why the war on drugs has been the most expensive thing ever is because of those numbers right there. 20-25% of the federal budget is tied directly to the inflated cost of medical coverage. Those costs have been excessive and all directly thanks to the war on drugs and the lack of access to viable alternative less costly medications. So if the war on drugs would not have existed you could cut most likey at least 10-15% in just inflated medical coverage off the budget right there.\n\nThe main reason why social security has been 20-25 percent the entire time isn't because of people pulling that much from it but instead because the government has been using it as a discretionary fund i/e they take that social security money and use it for other stuff (usually black book things which tie directly to the war on drugs). In fact it's so bad that you can take another 15% off of that right there because it's basically the government paying itself back for the money it took.\n\nSince the war on drugs created a requirement for numerous federal departments that 10% would be vastly lower in fact lets take half of that away if there was no war on drugs.\n\nNow citizen support being at 13% is fairly high but it's directly linked to the war on drugs and the perpetual poverty those people experience due to the lack of actual support thanks to medical care being so damn high. They become incapable of taking care of themselves because they turn to illegal drugs which then cause them to make worse decisions and it spirals all the way down. Lets take 5% from that as a cause of the war on drugs.\n\nLastly defense budget. What most people don't know or want to ignore is that a vast majority of our enemies we've faced in the past few decades have been paying for their fights against us by the drug trade. If the drug trade were not to exist due to legalization they wouldn't have such a HUGE return on their investments which would lead to less funding for terrorism, rebellions, or over throwing governments. This means a huge chunk of that defense wouldn't have been required in the first place but lets only take 5% from it in association with the war on drugs.\n\n**So in total war on drugs through the various reasons is responsible for an estimated 55% of all federal spending or $50193.275 billion dollars**\n\nNow I want to estimate the losses from all the tax money that could have been but I just don't think I have that kind of time so I won't but your imagination could help you with it. I want you to think about how well the legalized states have been doing with excessive tax money, and look at the lack of a war on drugs federal spending policy and do the math. Just think what all of that money could have gone too, and how much more tax money the government could have gained. **Or even how little taxes we would have needed to pay!**\n\nhere's my math https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pCGX4b_6X_SXPgb_1W_GfoOpReR7PhEaQ93xJz41Euo/pubhtml", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright i&amp;#39;ll help you along with this one.

It&amp;#39;s a crapton of money and it&amp;#39;s only 22 years worth of the 60 or so years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/ondcppubs/publications/enforce/border/fbi_1.html\"&gt;Now, the FBI which deals significantly with the war on drugs, from 1990-1998&lt;/a&gt; had a total budget of &lt;strong&gt;$20.6 billion dollars&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archive/jmd/1975_2002/2002/html/page96-99.htm\"&gt;From 1999-2003 total budget of FBI&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archive/jmd/1975_2002/2002/html/page96-99.htm\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$21 billion dollars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbis-fiscal-year-2004-budget\"&gt;04 $4.6 billion dollars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;05 &lt;a href=\"https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbis-fiscal-year-2005-budget-request\"&gt;$5 billion dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;06 &lt;a href=\"https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbis-fy-2006-budget-request-1\"&gt;$5.7 billion dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;07 &lt;a href=\"https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbis-fiscal-year-2007-budget-request\"&gt;6 billion dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;08 &lt;a href=\"https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/the-fbi-budget-for-fiscal-year-2008\"&gt;6.4 billion dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;09 &lt;a href=\"https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/the-fbi-budget-for-fiscal-year-2009-1\"&gt;7.1 billion dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 &lt;a href=\"https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/the-fbi-budget-for-fiscal-year-2010\"&gt;7.9 billion dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11 &lt;a href=\"https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/the-fbi-budget-for-fiscal-year-2011\"&gt;8.3 billion dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12 &lt;a href=\"https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbi-budget-for-fiscal-year-2012\"&gt;8.1 billion dollars(holy shit it went down?)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13 &lt;a href=\"https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2013\"&gt;8.2 billion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14 &lt;a href=\"https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2014\"&gt;8.4 billion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;15 &lt;a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2015\"&gt;8.3 billion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;16 &lt;a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2016-1\"&gt;8.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;17 &lt;a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/821341/download\"&gt;9.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so grand total 1990-2017 is &lt;strong&gt;$143.3 billion dollars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now understanding that not all of that goes to fighting the war on drugs, but the majority of it does especially considering the absolute lack of crime that would exist if there was no war on drugs policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/about/history/staffing.shtml\"&gt;Budget for DEA 1972-2014&lt;/a&gt; is claimed at &lt;strong&gt;$50.6 billion dollars&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/822096/download\"&gt;2015-17 $6 billion dollars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s where it gets funny, and depressingly obvious how stupid the war on drugs is. From &lt;a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/822096/download\"&gt;2005-2015 the DEA took away &lt;strong&gt;33.1 billion dollars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through drug money seizures and another &lt;strong&gt;3.5 billion dollars&lt;/strong&gt; worth of assets. So a total of &lt;strong&gt;36.7 billion dollars&lt;/strong&gt;. Why this matters? Well because that&amp;#39;s 36.7 billion dollars that was in the US market and then was removed. A lot of it was also used by the DEA through various &amp;quot;programs&amp;quot; aka inflated as fuck budget by using the drug money even though it&amp;#39;s claimed to be destroyed. Now keep in mind the DEA wouldn&amp;#39;t exist if the war on drugs didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/about/budget-performance\"&gt;ATF budget from 2009-2016&lt;/a&gt; is roughly &lt;strong&gt;$10 billion dollars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok i&amp;#39;m going to stop breaking it down all super nice and neat because it&amp;#39;s getting tedious and I feel i&amp;#39;m just repeating my points so i&amp;#39;ll just simplify it even more. &lt;a href=\"http://stats.areppim.com/stats/stats_usxbudget_history.htm\"&gt;Just take a look at this little historical federal budget graph&lt;/a&gt;. Scroll down a bit and you can see each year&amp;#39;s budget. Now former president Nixon took power in 1969 but his manipulations started well before that. Either way you&amp;#39;ll notice a drastic increase in the national budget when he took office. That increase kept increasing due to the fact that all subsequent government leaders continued Nixon&amp;#39;s policies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now breaking it down a bit more i&amp;#39;m going to generalize here and under estimate due to fluctuations in concepts over time, so we will set percentages of budget as 1969-2013:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Social security 20% is $18,252.10 billion dollars&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Medical care(Medicare and Medicaid) 20% is $18,252.10 billion dollars&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Federal departments 10% is $9126.05 billion dollars&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Defense departments 15% is $13689.075 billion dollars&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Citizen support(food stamps etc...) 13% is 11863.865 billion dollars&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total expense 1969-2013 was $91,260.50&lt;/strong&gt; billion dollars with &lt;strong&gt;$71,183.19 billion dollars&lt;/strong&gt; going towards important sections that are relevant to my argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, the reason why the war on drugs has been the most expensive thing ever is because of those numbers right there. 20-25% of the federal budget is tied directly to the inflated cost of medical coverage. Those costs have been excessive and all directly thanks to the war on drugs and the lack of access to viable alternative less costly medications. So if the war on drugs would not have existed you could cut most likey at least 10-15% in just inflated medical coverage off the budget right there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main reason why social security has been 20-25 percent the entire time isn&amp;#39;t because of people pulling that much from it but instead because the government has been using it as a discretionary fund i/e they take that social security money and use it for other stuff (usually black book things which tie directly to the war on drugs). In fact it&amp;#39;s so bad that you can take another 15% off of that right there because it&amp;#39;s basically the government paying itself back for the money it took.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the war on drugs created a requirement for numerous federal departments that 10% would be vastly lower in fact lets take half of that away if there was no war on drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now citizen support being at 13% is fairly high but it&amp;#39;s directly linked to the war on drugs and the perpetual poverty those people experience due to the lack of actual support thanks to medical care being so damn high. They become incapable of taking care of themselves because they turn to illegal drugs which then cause them to make worse decisions and it spirals all the way down. Lets take 5% from that as a cause of the war on drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly defense budget. What most people don&amp;#39;t know or want to ignore is that a vast majority of our enemies we&amp;#39;ve faced in the past few decades have been paying for their fights against us by the drug trade. If the drug trade were not to exist due to legalization they wouldn&amp;#39;t have such a HUGE return on their investments which would lead to less funding for terrorism, rebellions, or over throwing governments. This means a huge chunk of that defense wouldn&amp;#39;t have been required in the first place but lets only take 5% from it in association with the war on drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So in total war on drugs through the various reasons is responsible for an estimated 55% of all federal spending or $50193.275 billion dollars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I want to estimate the losses from all the tax money that could have been but I just don&amp;#39;t think I have that kind of time so I won&amp;#39;t but your imagination could help you with it. I want you to think about how well the legalized states have been doing with excessive tax money, and look at the lack of a war on drugs federal spending policy and do the math. Just think what all of that money could have gone too, and how much more tax money the government could have gained. &lt;strong&gt;Or even how little taxes we would have needed to pay!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;here&amp;#39;s my math &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pCGX4b_6X_SXPgb_1W_GfoOpReR7PhEaQ93xJz41Euo/pubhtml\"&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pCGX4b_6X_SXPgb_1W_GfoOpReR7PhEaQ93xJz41Euo/pubhtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "tech", "name": "t1_dge6w3h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492494958.0, "created_utc": 1492466158.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh48", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wi57", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh48", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wi57", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeky91", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "samsc2", "parent_id": "t1_dge4m61", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tech", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The grand total is almost incalculable due to the mutli-generational loss of human life and the possibilities that can only be thought of but never done. 60 years of all those arrests, all that bloated funding, prisons built to capacity, countless corrupt officials caught in prisoner for money schemes, gigantic wars for nothing, goes on and on and on.\n\nThe worst part is how much of a huge hand the war on drugs has had on the nations to the south of us.
