Any tips on how to fix that?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always liked reading, but I never really set aside the time to read.  I maybe - MAYBE - read one book a year. I&amp;#39;m still in college, so I read about 8 text books a year so that may be why... but I&amp;#39;m trying to find a new book to draw me in!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping to find a horror book/series that is just well known for being scary.  I was thinking about reading some Lovecraft or Stephen King (I read the first 100-250 pages of The Stand and The Long Walk, did finish The Regulators 10 or so years ago tho lol), I just don&amp;#39;t really know where to start with either of these series. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any recommendations for some horror books or anything that has really supernatural (likes God&amp;#39;s and demons and stuff, not so much ghosts), I&amp;#39;d be super interested in hearing them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: also, any tips for getting me to actually start reading as a hobby will be nice too! I do a lot of video gaming and watching video game streams, on top of all my school work, but I have a craving to read.  I just never do it!
