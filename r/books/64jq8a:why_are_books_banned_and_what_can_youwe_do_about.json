Well according to &lt;a href=\"http://libguides.butler.edu/c.php?g=34189&amp;amp;p=217686\"&gt;Butler University&lt;/a&gt; they can be banned for the following reasons: blasphemy, encouragement of \u201cdamaging lifestyles\u201d, racial issues, presence of witchcraft, swearing, political violence, etc. The America Library Association defines a banned book as: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;an attempt to remove or restrict materials, based upon the objections of a person or group.&amp;quot;\nButler\u2019s University covers the most common reasons why books are banned:\nWHY are they banned(from top to bottom): sexual content, offensive language, unsuitable for age group, \u201cother\u201d, occult/Satanism, violence (there are other parameters in the graph, bit these are the most common ones)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WHO initiates the ban: Parents!

Well &lt;a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-10-22-challengedbooks_N.htm\"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 made up a list of those books and the reason why.

Here are the top 10, along with the reasons cited.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I could go through a list those top ten books, but I honestly haven\u2019t read them all so I picked one that I did read when I was in the high school-ish age range (but I read it recreationally so take that as you will):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Book 4 on that list. &lt;em&gt;The Golden Compass&lt;/em&gt; by Philip Pullman. &lt;strong&gt;Reasons:&lt;/strong&gt; religious viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Folks, this was the number 4 banned book in America for schools.

When a book &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; finally banned, what can we do about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well I googled it, and it was not an easy topic to find answers on. You could attend your local school\u2019s school board meetings and challenge it. You\u2019re a tax payer for that district and while you may not have children you do have a right to say how your tax dollars are spent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Write to the school board, maybe start a petition regarding that. Just because one parent or a handful of parents may take exception to a book that doesn\u2019t mean ALL parents do. If you are a parent you could work with the schoolboard to find a way to get the book unbanned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re a student and feel the book shouldn\u2019t be banned work with your other students that agree. Maybe just decide to read the book publicly at your school in protest. You could attend a school board meeting with your fellow students and protest the banning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, finally, take the banning to court.
