It is literally impossible to translate Russian prose into English accurately, so each translator has to make judgment calls based on their values.  If you are reading a great Russian novel, whether it is Brothers K or Tolstoy, and finding it to be a slog, I always recommend switching translators. It makes all the difference in the world. \n\nPlease don't give up on Tolstoy. What stands out in his writing to me, he might be the boldest author of the modern era from either hemisphere.  In the Death of Ivan Ilyich, he stares down death unflinchingly, and gives a play by play of what dying a meaningless life feels like- beat by fearless beat.  Not the Hollywood crap or the hyperromanticed ideal of death ala Hemingway or Dickens. In The Kreutzer Sonata, Tolstoy takes on heartbreak &amp; infidelity.  My life has been forever enriched by Tolstoy's courage to plunge these emotional crevices. I sure as hell would not have had the bravery in such detail on my own.  But Tolstoy put his own neck (and sanity, and wellbeing) on the line, and I am very grateful.
