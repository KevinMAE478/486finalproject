($2000+ for a refreshable Braille display vs $50 for a Braille book)\n- Secondhand books are inexpensive and recirculated \n- broken ereaders often create as much environmental waste as any other electronic device\n\nBooks in digital form have their advantages as well. \n- If you need that book right now. Perfect. \n- Need ten books from the library now? Overdrive. \n- Don't have space for books? Digital. \n- Want to read anywhere at any time on any platform? It's on all the devices. \n- Also, changing typefaces is a great boon, as well as screen color. \n- Possibly being able to project books is awesome. \n- Reading in the dark is obviously easier!\n- e-ink models makes it easy to read in sunlight \n- Plain e-readers have long battery lives\n- Theyre cheap depending on the model\n- HD e-reader tablets have Internet \n- Audiobooks and audible are great. Especially for the blind.\n- built in dictionary!\n- built in search and note functions including highlighting \n- less trees felled\n\nThat said, its obviously a great idea to mix it up. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no los dos? as they say.\nEdited to add even more great stuff.
