So sure, let's order this kid a Clive Barker novel! What could go wrong? Well, I was probably nine or ten at that time. got that there was a a point Barker was trying to make that I wasn't getting, and I was so disturbed by the illustrations and some of the imagery in the story that I didn't even want that damned ting in my room, is what. \n\nbut I started thinking about it again a few years ago and reread it, and *it is so good.* I was really surprised at how much I liked it. The prose is so charming and the story feels like all the good parts of Tim Burton and Ray Bradbury mixed together.
