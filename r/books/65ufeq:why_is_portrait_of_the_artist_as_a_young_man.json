Poems are highly structured, prose are free-form and loose.  Joyce novels are *so tightly structured,* you'd think he's a pathological control freak.  There's geometry to each of his work, part to part, part to whole balance, symmetry.  Everything is planned, by design, as though he's writing a poem, except it's a novel.  \n(Joyce wasn't the first to do that though, Flaubert and Henry James were the true pioneer in that.  Same with stream of consciousness technique -- Joyce didn't invent that, Virginia Woolf did it first.  Joyce's genius was that he understood the significance of all these fragments in his time and put them all together in one coherent epic.)\n\n\nIn Joyce's time, writers were having open warfare on writing style -- over things like realism vs symbolism.  They published insulting open letters to dismiss and mock each other over distasteful style.  Joyce rolled his eyes and used both -- his books are full of things that are banal, prosaic, degraded, unremarkable, realistic -- and yet the language is filled with symbolism, allusions... and the whole story is framed as a heroic epic.  \n\nSpeaking of symbolism and allusion,  **Stephen** is the first Christian Martyr, I don't want to go into details, I'd hate to offend a whole religion, but pm me if you want to discuss this, I think that meaning is significant as well.  Joyce is subverting something big here.\n\n**Dedalus** is the patron-saint of arts, who escapes entrapments using art.  Which is exactly what Joyce is doing: **using art to dissolve bitter and pervasive intellectual and political quarrels,** such as Catholic vs Protestant, Irish nationalism vs Internationalism, Left vs Right, symbolist vs realist, scientific vs mythic, subjective vs objective, prose vs poetry, classicist vs anti-classicist, Platonist vs Aristotelian, aesthetic vs social responsibility, art vs life, contingent vs eternal, content vs form, material vs spiritual, domestic vs epic.  \n\nLet me rephrase, because this is important: his commitment to becoming an artist in his youth was what enabled him to fly past these seemingly insurmountable entrapments, these bitter quarrels that confuse and entrap young people who grew up in that cultural environment, people like Oscar Wilde.  BTW, Joyce was one of the very, very few intellectuals in his age that supported neither the fascists nor the communists.  \n\n\nOh, and the final title, **Portrait of an Artist** -- is a reference to **Oscar Wilde's Picture of Dorian Gray** -- Joyce was disgusted with the way England threw Wilde under the bus.  Much of the angry discontents in Portrait were there to show how Wilde was the inevitable product of the British-ruled Ireland cultural entrapment -- the sort of trap Stephen must fly past.  Basil the artist ended up dead by his own aesthetics, and Dorian self-destructed in decadence and corruption.  Stephen (Joyce) will find a way to forge a path to life through his aesthetics.  He isn't going to die for his country like so many young men were doing at that time. (WWI, WWII, Spanish civil war...)\n\nAs for the slowness of pace, and the boring details: I think, because Joyce was raised catholic, and surrounded by a whole culture of people whose entire life was governed by church and scripture -- that's why he's writing his novels with that kind of boring excessive details.  Let me explain.\n\nEntertainment books cut out the details and chase after plots and cliffhangers.  Scriptures -- word of god himself -- dictates in great, boring, painful details what you eat, what you wear, what you read, how you relate to each other, how to treat your neighbor, what to do on what day of the week, how to treat guests, etc etc.  \n\nThat is to say, Joyce is **taking the language reserved for the holy books and using it for his novels.**  For Joyce, domestic human life *is* sacred, the church has gotten things backward.  A book about a boy growing up *is* holy, and deserves to be written in that kind of language.  It's not that he stopped being spiritual when he left the church, the epiphanies and ecstatic transports and compassion come from these uneventful, profane, unremarkable interactions. \n\n-------------------------- \n\nI'm working on my 5th reread/ false-start of Ulysses, with plenty of \"returns\" to Portrait.  I get sucked in, I lose my appetite for other books that I usually devour (I read 3 - 5 pop books a week when I'm not doing Joyce).  It's a little obsessive and demanding, but I find that rewarding.  And even when I eventually get sick of it and go back to read other entertainment-books, my mind is still working on Joyce in the background, it literally changes the way I read and the way I approach literature, it also forms a kind of mental map for me to make sense of and picture other books (and poems) I read.  \n\nSo, you're not alone in finding Portrait not-fun, I see where you're coming from, I understand why other people dislike it.  I didn't like it until I (tried to) read Ulysses and got deeper and deeper into it.  And yet, I also think, people aren't being pretentious or faking it when they praise it highly.

Scriptures -- word of god himself -- dictates in great, boring, painful details what you eat, what you wear, what you read, how you relate to each other, how to treat your neighbor, what to do on what day of the week, how to treat guests, etc etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is to say, Joyce is &lt;strong&gt;taking the language reserved for the holy books and using it for his novels.&lt;/strong&gt;  For Joyce, domestic human life &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; sacred, the church has gotten things backward.  A book about a boy growing up &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; holy, and deserves to be written in that kind of language.  It&amp;#39;s not that he stopped being spiritual when he left the church, the epiphanies and ecstatic transports and compassion come from these uneventful, profane, unremarkable interactions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working on my 5th reread/ false-start of Ulysses, with plenty of &amp;quot;returns&amp;quot; to Portrait.  I get sucked in, I lose my appetite for other books that I usually devour (I read 3 - 5 pop books a week when I&amp;#39;m not doing Joyce).  It&amp;#39;s a little obsessive and demanding, but I find that rewarding.  And even when I eventually get sick of it and go back to read other entertainment-books, my mind is still working on Joyce in the background, it literally changes the way I read and the way I approach literature, it also forms a kind of mental map for me to make sense of and picture other books (and poems) I read.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;#39;re not alone in finding Portrait not-fun, I see where you&amp;#39;re coming from, I understand why other people dislike it.  I didn&amp;#39;t like it until I (tried to) read Ulysses and got deeper and deeper into it.  And yet, I also think, people aren&amp;#39;t being pretentious or faking it when they praise it highly.  Typical of Joyce, apparently contradictory positions are both valid.  It sucks, and it&amp;#39;s great.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "books", "name": "t1_dgdncqr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492472803.0, "created_utc": 1492444003.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdn1m5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 24, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hongkie", "parent_id": "t3_65ufeq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/books", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Joyce's short stories are probably his only works that you can read effortlessly and still find them immediately enjoyable, entertaining, comprehensible.

And Derrida just couldn't stop gushing about FinWake.  \n\nIf you take a leap of faith, and reread, and research into it, I promise Joyce novels can be really really rewarding.\n\nIntellectual history is really significant as well.  Joyce was the only \"high modernist\" who ignored the cultural U-turn towards postmodernism during WWII, and kept working in the high modernist style (FinWake.)  \n\nMy speculation is that he had his works all mapped out from the start -- Portrait, Ulysses, FinWake were all part of one \"journey\"  -- a 20th century reinterpretation of Dante's Divine Comedy.  In that interpretation, Portrait maps onto *La Vita Nuova,* and Nora (the bird-girl on the beach) would be his Beatrice, that encounter his **invocation.**\n\n**Portrait** in its draft was originally titled **\"Stephen Hero,\"** -- establishing the artist as a heroic figure is something like a signature to the Modernist.  Remember this was when Royalist and Communists were fighting, capitalism was still being contested, and the artist must resist being absorbed into commercialization and monopoly of consumer culture. (Postmodernism would be the capitulation and open acceptance of mass culture as art, and eradication of \"high art.\")   \n\nWe postmodernist cringe at that now, we're deflated, cynical, mistrustful of humanity, heroism. But that's what everybody was doing back in those days.  So I'd argue **Portrait** is significant because of its invocation-function, rather than just a meaningful depiction of a young man growing up.  It establishes Joyce/ Stephen as an artist, **and** defines how an artist is heroic in this hinge moment in history.\n\n\n**Reinterpretation of Classics** \n\nMany modernists denounced classics, they felt modern artists must cleanly break with traditions in order to become democratic.  Imagism is one of those deliberate breaks.  WC Williams was probably the loudest anti-intellectual, anti-classicist.  Eliot notoriously defended classical taste and cultivated-discipline.\n\nJoyce ignored their quarrels and incorporate both the learned, the vast vocabularies, the allusions, the latin, the poetic structure, the formalism, the philosophy ... and the vernacular. (As any good Dantean should.)\n\nThis is what he's doing: From Homer to Virgil to Dante to Hamlet to Monte Cristo, the actors change their costumes, but the *pattern* repeats.  The heroic artist  crafts the conscience of his race, by reinterpreting past cultural achievements to make them suitable in his time.  So Virgil was just a reinterpretation of Homer, Dante a reinterpretation of Virgil, and on and on and on.  \n\nPortrait announces his intention and commitment to forge the epic of **modernity.**  The modern men don't fight windmills anymore, we fight abstract and domestic battles.  And Joyce thinks we're no less heroic for it, and that kind of struggles and narrow escape deserves the epic status.\n\nAnd he chose the novel form to acknowledge Hegel's theory that the novel *is* the middle class epic.  All the ingredients are already there, lying around.  The novel form, the recurring pattern.  Rewriting Dante's invocation + Comedia in novel form is all it takes to claim the **apotheosis.**   Many modernists depicted modern society as a sort of waste land, devoid of beauty, future, culture, commerce and production are industrialized and dehumanized, the lifestyle is decadent, materialistic, meaningless.  Human relationships are impossible.  Joyce thinks modern life *is* full of obstacles, and each of us in our domestic sphere is fighting the epic battle.\n\n**Unlikable Stephen**\n\nWell, yes, he's unlikeable, that's deliberate.  Self-overcoming is part of the battle for the modern man.
