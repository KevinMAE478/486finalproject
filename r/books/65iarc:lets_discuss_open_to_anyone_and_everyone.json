It\u2019s like I\u2019m scared when I read them, but even after I finish them there\u2019s still some lingering eeriness that lasts and after a while I have to go back and read them again to try and figure out what it is about these books that stays with you, but I guess that\u2019s the true definition of a psychological horror/thriller, right? It\u2019s supposed something that you can\u2019t quite understand but it speaks to your subconscious, and draws you back in over and over, if not just to question yourself, and why this particular story scares you so much?\n\n          Idk if it\u2019s like this for other people when they read the books I\u2019ve mentioned. But I do know that\u2019s it\u2019s been years since my mom read these books, if not a decade or two and she\u2019s the one who\u2019s recommended them and Stephen King in general, so I\u2019m guessing the stories stuck with her too? \n\n           Idk, I\u2019m just in the middle of reading TommyKnockers now, and it has that same eeriness I described earlier, and I want to know what it is about the human brain that can latch on to these crazy ideas that are so well written that even though you know they\u2019re impossible, when you read these books, you really feel like your there in this world with these characters and real lives are on the line, and even when you put the book down, you feel a ridiculous need to look over your shoulder. Am I alone in this? I doubt it, I can\u2019t be. If other people didn\u2019t have this reaction too, then why are these stories like The Shining, Pet Semetary, It, and Carrie so well known, why do people love them? \n\n           Stephen King is an amazing writer, it doesn\u2019t even have to be horror, just look at his other titles like Fire Starter, The Gun Slinger, Under the Dome. Fire Starter is one of my favorite books and it\u2019s not a psychological horror, when it comes down to it it\u2019s about a dad trying to save his little girl, and its amazing. And I need her to be saved, or to save herself. How can anyone write like that? How can reading Gerald\u2019s Game make me feel anxious and claustrophobic when I put the book down and go try to sleep? I\u2019m not handcuffed to a bed, no one is! No one has been stuck handcuffed to a bed for days with nothing but their thoughts! I haven\u2019t been trying to figure out how to get in handcuffed! So why when we read, or should I say when I read, these stories that are NOT real, is there a very real feeling of anxiousness and a sense of urgency? \n\n            I would love to see what is actually happening in a persons brain when they read these types of stories, that have been amazingly crafted. What parts of the brain are activated when we read? How does sitting in a bed reading words cause a physical effect on a persons body and mind? \n\n            Also what\u2019s is in Stephens Kings mind? Has he ever been measured the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP) that was developed in 1995 by Michael R Levenson and is used by the military to weed out potential psychopaths/sociopaths? I know it\u2019s like 500 questions but how can you write the things Stephen King has written, and so effectively and such conviction (conviction being the sheer number of books he\u2019s written in the psychological horror/thriller genre)without being somewhere on the Mentally Insane Spectrum, and if he is on the spectrum is that why his work, and especially descriptive detail work is so frightening? Idk I don\u2019t actually think he\u2019s MI, I think if he was MI he wouldn\u2019t be able to actually sit down and write multiple amazing books, or even two chapters of a book, unless he were on the very low end of the spectrum. I think he\u2019s just extremely talented and I think he writes to people\u2019s subconscious (if that\u2019s a real thing) rather than their conscious self, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like some formula that\u2019s been figured out, or that he\u2019s figured out per-say, I think he writes and it just happens.

I didn\u2019t mean for this to turn into a mini Stephen King essay but some one talk to me about this, I\u2019m craving this conversation, and want to hear people\u2019s ideas on how psychologically disturbing fiction can effect the way we think or react to fearful situations, and just how the fuck did Stephen King become such an amazing author.

Talk about horror! Even though it was super short (about 16 pages?) it still stays with me; every couple months I go back and re-read it just to get the chills again. Somehow he manages to nail the pacing every time, and makes 16 pages feel like a thousand and somehow still not enough.\n\nAnd you're right, it doesn't have to be horror either. His book \"The Eyes of the Dragon\" was, by technical definition, incredibly cliche: good King, evil dark magician, plans of treachery and assassination, all that stuff.   But somehow it managed to be one of the most enthralling reads I've enjoyed in a while, had me physically anxious whenever the characters were in trouble, and left me feeling empty and wanting more after I'd finished. There were parts of the story where character's actions and emotions made my heart wrench, and I was reduced to reading the page over and over just to figure out what made me feel so strongly.\n\nI'd love to know if there's a psychological reason behind the feeling, something that makes you love and connect with the characters so damn much even though it's just words on a page. \n\nEither way, I'm planning on reading a lot more King. Right now I'm reading \"American Gods\" by Neil Gaiman, and even though the pacing isn't quite that of a King book, I'm definitely intrigued. Up next on my list is either End of Watch or The Green Mile by King. If anyone has a preference or a warning about the two, I'd love to know your thoughts! ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first bit of Stephen King I ever read was &amp;quot;Survivor Type&amp;quot;. Talk about horror! Even though it was super short (about 16 pages?) it still stays with me; every couple months I go back and re-read it just to get the chills again. Somehow he manages to nail the pacing every time, and makes 16 pages feel like a thousand and somehow still not enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;re right, it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be horror either. His book &amp;quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&amp;quot; was, by technical definition, incredibly cliche: good King, evil dark magician, plans of treachery and assassination, all that stuff.   But somehow it managed to be one of the most enthralling reads I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed in a while, had me physically anxious whenever the characters were in trouble, and left me feeling empty and wanting more after I&amp;#39;d finished. There were parts of the story where character&amp;#39;s actions and emotions made my heart wrench, and I was reduced to reading the page over and over just to figure out what made me feel so strongly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to know if there&amp;#39;s a psychological reason behind the feeling, something that makes you love and connect with the characters so damn much even though it&amp;#39;s just words on a page. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, I&amp;#39;m planning on reading a lot more King.
