The surrounding heathen nations are also warned of doom, and first in line is Babylon. \n\n&gt; It is easy to suspect that chapters 13 and 14, in which the doom of Babylon is foretold with savage imagery, is not really Isaianic. In Isiah's time, it was Assyria that was the conquering nation and Babylon lay under its thumb in more devastating fashion than Judah did. The paean of hatred and scorn should, it would be expected, be turned against Assyria and the new capital that Sennacherib had built at Nineveh. \n\n&gt; On the other hand, a century after Isaiah's time, it was Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar that was the oppressor. It is reasonably likely, then, that this passage is of later origin and was possibly composed during the Exile at a time when Babylon seemed doomed to fall before the conquering armies of Cyrus the Persian. \n\n&gt; Picturing Babylon as already fallen, the writer recites a taunting poem of sarcastic contempt for the mighty Babylonian monarch now brought low. In part, it goes: \n\n&gt; Isaiah 14:12. How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! ... \n\n&gt; Isaiah 14:13. For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven ... \n\n&gt; Isaiah 14:14. ... I will be like the most High. \nIsaiah 14:15. Yet though shalt be brought down to hell ... \n\n&gt; The Hebrew word here translated as \"Lucifer\" is helel. Literally, it means \"The Shining One,\" and is thought to refer to the planetary body we call Venus. \n\n&gt; Venus is the brightest of the planets in our sky and, next to the sun and the moon, the brightest object in the heavens. Because of the position of its orbit between the earth's orbit and the sun, it is always seen (from earth) to be fairly close to the sun. When it is in that part of it's orbit that puts it to the east of the sun, it shines out most clearly after sunset, and sets never more than three hours afterward. It is then visible only in the evening and is called the evening star. \n\n&gt; On the other side of its orbit, when Venus is to the west of the sun, the planet rises first and for a short period of time (never more than three hours), it shines in the eastern sky as dawn gradually breaks. It is then the morning star. \n\n&gt; It is only natural that cultures unlearned in astronomy and not particularly observant of the heavens would consider the evening star and the morning star to be two separate bodies. In Isaiah's time, even the clever Greeks were of this opinion. It was not until two centuries after Isaiah's time that the Greek philosopher Pythagoras discovered the two to be the single body that the Greeks then came to call Aphrodite and the Romans (and ourselves) Venus. It is very likely that Pythagoras discovered this in the course of his travels in the East (tradition says he visited Babylonia and it was the Babylonians who were the great astronomers of ancient times). \n\n&gt; Venus, in its morning star aspect, could be called the \"daystar\" for its rising heralds the coming of day. It is also the \"son of the morning\" for it is only as morning approaches that it is possible to see it. Thus, the Revised Standard Version translates verse 14:12 as \"How art thou fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning.\" \n\n&gt; The Greeks, in the period when they thought Venus to be two bodies, called the evening star \"Hesperos\" and the morning star \"Phosphoros.\" Hesperos means \"west\" and it is always in the west that the evening star appears. Phosphoros means \"light-bringer\" and it is therefore the essential equivalent of \"daystar.\" By the Romans, the Greek terms were translated directly into Latin. The evening star became \"Vesper\" (\"west\") and the morning star became \"Lucifer\" (\"lightbringer\"). \n\n&gt; The Hebrew helel is therefore translated as Phosphoros in Greek versions of the Bible; and as Lucifer in Latin versions. \n\n&gt; The use of the term \"Lucifer\" in connection with the overweening pride of the Babylonian king is an ironic thrust at the habit of applying fulsome metaphors for royalty. Flattering courtiers would think nothing of naming their king the Morning Star, as though to imply that the sight of him was as welcome as that of the morning star heralding the dawn after a long, cold winter's night. This habit of flattery is confined neither to the East nor to ancient times. Louis XIV of France, two and a half centuries ago, was well known as the Sun King. \n\n&gt; The writer of the verses concerning Lucifer ironically described his fall from absolute power to captivity and death as the fall of the morning star from the heavens to Hell. \n\n&gt; With time, however, these verses came to gain a more esoteric meaning. By New Testament times, the Jews had developed, in full detail, the legend that Satan had been the leader of the \"fallen angels.\" These were angels who rebelled against God by refusing to bow down before Adam when that first man was created, using as their argument that they were made of light and man only of clay. Satan, the leader of the rebels, thought, in his pride, to supplant God. The rebelling angels were, however, hurled out of Heaven and into Hell. By the time this legend was developed the Jews had come under Greek influence and they may have perhaps been swayed by Greek myths concerning the attempts by the Titans, and later the Giants, to defeat Zeus and assume mastery of the universe. Both Titans and Giants were defeated and imprisoned underground. \n\n&gt; But whether Greek-inspired or not, the legend came to be firmly fixed in Jewish consciousness. Jesus refers to it at one point in the Gospel of St. Luke: \n\n&gt; Luke 10.18. And he [Jesus] said ... I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven. \n\n&gt; It seemed natural to associate the legend with the Isaianic statement; indeed, that statement about Lucifer may have even helped give rise to the legend. In any case, the early Church fathers considered Isaiah's statement to be a reference to the eviction of the devil from Heaven, and supposed Lucifer to be the angelic name of the creature who, after his fall, became known as Satan.

Solidified through a still relatively new medium, the 'motion picture', a primitive form of pre-AR tech involving simple dynamic stroboscopic effects to replicate motion largely seen as a stepping stone to our everyday XRSWavezines.\n\nThe founder of these new pantheon religions, Walt Disney, began as a visual scribe of older Western fairy tales stretching back to the literary and pre-literary oral narrative areas. Unlike other collectors of fairy tales, Walt Disney never kept his fairy tales limited to specific ethnicity or region. 'Princesses', the sort of demi-gods of Disney's first pantheon, could come from Germany, France, pre-Industrial Louisiana, or even Han era China. Long after Walt Disney, the founder, died, leadership of the church (at the time called 'corporations', which were competing internationalist churches founded for Colonialism (see chapter 13 and the histories of the 17th and 18th centuries in the West) revolved through various priests (known as CEOs) and archpriests (board of directors) until a young priest named Kevin Feige joined.\n\nKevin Feige had read the pulp literature of an obscure subtribe of popular literary culture at the time. Original pantheon gods of the Marvel sect came from picture books known as 'comics' that were exchanged largely by a core group of zealots, known colloquially as 'fanboys'. Drawing a connection between Disney's foundation in decentralized mythos and the various totemic godheads featured in the Marvel comics, Boardmember Feige saw a natural fit and brought them together under the banner of the Disney movement.\n\nIts success lead to further capsules of post-industrial mythmaking, none that rose so large against the Marvel universe than Star Wars. A mythos created by the motion picture artist and literary metaphysicist George Lucas, it had every element of the Marvel universe that tied to the Disney church pantheon: an internal heirarchy of familiar gods, demigods, and recurring human-like heroes of favor and skill, and like Marvel and Disney designed around an awareness of decentered, cross-geographical mythmaking. Unlike Disney's approach, better understood as appropriation of cultural myths worldwide, Lucas started out as an adherent of the primary literary metaphysicist Joseph Campbell, a towering figure in narrative studies at the time still with its adherents today. Using Campbell's studies of the dialectics of hero narratives worldwide, Lucas was able to create a heroic template that tied together various functions of the adventure and science fiction narratives he grew up with as a kid into a unique pantheon. So where Disney repurposed the familiar stories and tied them together in one pantheon and Feige adapted an existent pantheon to a new medium, Lucas invented a new pantheon off of the concept of pantheon-building as a whole.\n\nThese 'extended universes' gradually shifted the cultural landscape once they became popular renditions, especially in the West. The ancient Judeochristian religions were in decline, as were the last growing pains of industrialization. With the introduction of the first trans-national and user-interactive medium, at the time known as the Internet (a crude version of our current Ryclear Sky based in digital machines known as servers spread around the planet) came social and international conflicts. Centuries of declining poverty and war under a political structure known as 'representative democracy' (see chapters 14 and 15) gave way under the pressure of worldwide pollutants that caused the climate of earth to change at about the same time post-industrialization destroyed the last remnants of class-based feudalism in labor, resource attainment, and social evaluation. This collapse lead to a series of newly decentered globalist urgovernments that ran between about the 2040s to just before our current post-globalist era (see chapter 19).\n\nMany historical events swung the influence of the Disney pantheons to the realm of world religion in this era. First was Disney's tacit and structural interdependency with Silicon Valley, an American Southwestern technology-obsessed cult that established itself early on with a chaos agenda called 'disruption' of both individual national governments and the established international churches of the time. Silicon Valley's early rise involved the focused exploitation of the Internet to effectively undercut the resource-structures of the other churches. It's rise as a cult was largely misunderstood at the time as being in tandem with and structured around the very churches it antagonized. Nevertheless, as a church itself, Silicon Valley lacked a pantheon to create an overall metamyth for common people to follow. Lost mostly in their limited geography around the northern half of a rich state of the former United States of America, and speaking a rigorous and intricate form of jargon, Silicon Valley in many ways was culturally and ideologically cut off from the massive reach that mass media like motion pictures provided.\n\nHowever, that technology cult did create the visual imaging technology possible for Disney to fully 'realize' their pantheon with more verisimilitude that could be found on the literary pages of a pulp printing press. Furthermore, coincidentally many of the strongest adherents of the Silicon Valley cult were also zealots of the Marvel comics and Star Wars motion pictures. With these links in place, the Disney church became the proselytizers of Silicon Valley's ideologies, while Silicon Valley provided the technology and efficiency to distribute the Disney church's propaganda worldwide.\n\nThe second major event that solidified the Disney church was the decline of Western influence and a shifting of globalization toward China. Such shift had already begun before Silicon Valley founded its cult, but was advanced by a series of nationalist uprisings in the West due to increasingly strenuous grasp of representative democracy practiced in the region (see Chapter 18). Unfortunately, the Western hemisphere's attachment to increasingly aged pantheon myths of several millennia, and the effect those Judeochristian pantheon myths had on Western hegemony and philosophy, found the region ill-equipped to transition to a post-human globalized structure. Instead they looked to controversial heroes of the past to try to retransition to a pre-Industrial feudalism, largely by electing authoritarians and despots.\n\nChina, as it turns out, had in many ways destroyed much of its own past in a series of cultural revolutions stretching from the 19th to 22nd centuries. 2112 it had shed its last remnants of 'communism' and the 'cultural revolution' (see chapters 10 and 11) which had explicitly deconstructed and destroyed pre-Industrial Chinese pantheon and metamyths. Once the Chinese annexed the mid-continental region between Africa, Europe, and Asia, at the time known as 'The Middle East', they found an culture equally vacated of all of its previous metamyths. A Judeochristian sect known as Islam had turned insular and subsequently destroyed all of the regions' cultural and historical artifacts before engaging in the second hundred years' wars with the West. The resource-expense of this hundred years' war resulted in a region ill-equipped to survive the next hundred years of chaotic climate events, resulting in a mass depopulation unmatched on Earth since the forced diaspora of Africans in the 19th century (see chapter 8). The power vacuum of the West left the mineral resources of countries like Ancient Afghanistan and Ancient Syria ripe for the last actions of post-industrialization, and featured an elegant passageway for China into the still growing African continent.\n\nWhat China was missing at the time was any sort of metamyth to justify their expansion and annexing of the Middle East. For this they looked to their history and saw the funding of the Disney church they had engaged in centuries ago. Detached from its previous role as a Western institution, the Disney church had subsequently been purchased by Chinese nationalist forefathers long since deceased. No longer representing the chaotic disruption cultism of Silicon Valley, Star Wars and Marvel had increasingly begun to represent Chinese cultural institutions over time.\n\nThe third event that transitioned the church of Disney to its globalist form began when China started the indoctrination of the Middle East and Africa in earnest. But indoctrination of an ideology does not work without belief in that ideology, so new schools of Marvelism and Star Warsism were rolled out. \n\nThe Sect of Star Wars could be understood as a more mystical religion, whereas Marvel was more clerical. Star Wars taught the presence of an inhuman, metaphysical 'Force' which affected all creatures of its pantheon, though many mages of the pantheon were capable of tapping into and using that force. This sect found itself most popular in the Eastern Hemisphere itself, where non-heirarchical governments had formed and the center of power lay in nodes of influence of no particular leverage against each other. Against the more residual belief systems of the Americas, Europe, and Africa however were still belief in individualistic 'hero-characters', specific entities of idiosyncratic powers given unique privileges and weaknesses with which to contend with the complexities of the human condition. Those regions quickly found themselves adherents of an aggressive Marvel ideology.\n\nThe quick bifurcation between regional attachments to either the Marvel or the Star Wars ideologies quickly challenged Chinese global status quo, resulting in the last nationalists wars discussed in the next chapter.\"", "edited": 1492399391.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And in the early part of the millennium, around 2004-2115, saw a proliferation of a new pantheon of Gods from two competing sects, the &amp;#39;Marvels&amp;#39; and the &amp;#39;Star Wars.&amp;#39; Solidified through a still relatively new medium, the &amp;#39;motion picture&amp;#39;, a primitive form of pre-AR tech involving simple dynamic stroboscopic effects to replicate motion largely seen as a stepping stone to our everyday XRSWavezines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The founder of these new pantheon religions, Walt Disney, began as a visual scribe of older Western fairy tales stretching back to the literary and pre-literary oral narrative areas.

Once the Chinese annexed the mid-continental region between Africa, Europe, and Asia, at the time known as &amp;#39;The Middle East&amp;#39;, they found an culture equally vacated of all of its previous metamyths. A Judeochristian sect known as Islam had turned insular and subsequently destroyed all of the regions&amp;#39; cultural and historical artifacts before engaging in the second hundred years&amp;#39; wars with the West. The resource-expense of this hundred years&amp;#39; war resulted in a region ill-equipped to survive the next hundred years of chaotic climate events, resulting in a mass depopulation unmatched on Earth since the forced diaspora of Africans in the 19th century (see chapter 8). The power vacuum of the West left the mineral resources of countries like Ancient Afghanistan and Ancient Syria ripe for the last actions of post-industrialization, and featured an elegant passageway for China into the still growing African continent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What China was missing at the time was any sort of metamyth to justify their expansion and annexing of the Middle East. For this they looked to their history and saw the funding of the Disney church they had engaged in centuries ago. Detached from its previous role as a Western institution, the Disney church had subsequently been purchased by Chinese nationalist forefathers long since deceased. No longer representing the chaotic disruption cultism of Silicon Valley, Star Wars and Marvel had increasingly begun to represent Chinese cultural institutions over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third event that transitioned the church of Disney to its globalist form began when China started the indoctrination of the Middle East and Africa in earnest. But indoctrination of an ideology does not work without belief in that ideology, so new schools of Marvelism and Star Warsism were rolled out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Sect of Star Wars could be understood as a more mystical religion, whereas Marvel was more clerical. Star Wars taught the presence of an inhuman, metaphysical &amp;#39;Force&amp;#39; which affected all creatures of its pantheon, though many mages of the pantheon were capable of tapping into and using that force. This sect found itself most popular in the Eastern Hemisphere itself, where non-heirarchical governments had formed and the center of power lay in nodes of influence of no particular leverage against each other. Against the more residual belief systems of the Americas, Europe, and Africa however were still belief in individualistic &amp;#39;hero-characters&amp;#39;, specific entities of idiosyncratic powers given unique privileges and weaknesses with which to contend with the complexities of the human condition. Those regions quickly found themselves adherents of an aggressive Marvel ideology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The quick bifurcation between regional attachments to either the Marvel or the Star Wars ideologies quickly challenged Chinese global status quo, resulting in the last nationalists wars discussed in the next chapter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "books", "name":
