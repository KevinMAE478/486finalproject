There lay the guinea pigs and they ached all over and their legs stuck straight up like beetles and they looked depraved and were blue under their eyes as from months of debauchery. My sister puked calmly and indifferently: it ran slowly out of her slack mouth without her moving a single nerve. And the cave was warm as teats and full of autumn leaves and beneath the soil lay the arm of a mannequin. There lay the guinea pigs and ached and were made of dough. There lay the guinea pigs beside the knives that would slice them up like loaves. And my sister with lips of blueberries, soil and mush. In the distance, the siren bleated inhumanly. That is where the guinea pigs lay and waited with blood around their mouths and contorted bodies. They waited. And I was tired in my whole stomach from meat dough and guinea pig loaf and I knew that they would revenge on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "books", "name": "t1_dg8ivti", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492160448.0, "created_utc": 1492131648.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658ouv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8kf1u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "inbretrospect", "parent_id": "t3_658ouv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/books", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Heat lightening in a time of drought", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat lightening in a time of drought&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "books", "name": "t1_dg8kf1u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492162567.0, "created_utc": 1492133767.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_658ouv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8lv1t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EthyleneGlycol", "parent_id": "t3_658ouv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/books", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Lots of great poems here already but one my favorites that hasn't been mentioned yet is [\"Miniver Cheevy\"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/44978) by Edward Arlington Robinson.
