The pages of paperbacks in general tend to be drier and less oily (I think?) than hardbacks/fancier/pricier books, which can end up being &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; dry, after a few years--the kind that feel a little rough and a touch brittle, which scrape on your fingertips and dehydrate them. But a well-loved old paperback, which is constantly flipped through, and kept in good conditions, I think, keeps enough moisture to avoid that too-dry feel and gain character from the oils from your hands--they smell great, they feel great--if taken care of well, books make a fine aged good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "books", "name": "t1_dg2xlax", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491874110.0, "created_utc": 1491845310.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64kps9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg2vhh3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "buzzbookstore", "parent_id": "t3_64kps9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/books", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes.
