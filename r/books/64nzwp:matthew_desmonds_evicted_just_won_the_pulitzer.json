I would gladly forfeit an extra $150/month for someone with a good credit score that is proud to pay their bills on time and takes care of the property. My leases usually had a call-out fee, like $60 or $75, which would put sort of a floor on how small a thing the tenant calls me out for, plus if I had a insurance on it I could apply that to their callout fee. Usually I would try to provide a solid property that doesn&amp;#39;t break, but there usually is about 1 thing a year that requires attn. Anyway, it was very rare that I needed to evict, but now and then it would happen; what can I say. It was my income at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "books", "name": "t1_dg4o9uf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491963697.0, "created_utc": 1491934897.0,
