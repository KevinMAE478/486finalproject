Literature, and many forms of art, are supposed to hold a mirror to society and make us think, critically, about it and our place in it. Dystopian novels are very rarely supposed to be taken literally. Instead, they are a giant warning sign for us to pay attention to what&amp;#39;s going on in our world. &amp;quot;It can&amp;#39;t happen here&amp;quot; is an incredibly dangerous sentiment. It is that very sentiment that would allow for it to happen here. \nEven if you didn&amp;#39;t like the book, didn&amp;#39;t understand it, or just aren&amp;#39;t into that writing style, at least please take away the message not to take anything for granted. Remember those who fought for the rights that you enjoy today and to keep fighting those who try to take them away.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "books", "name": "t1_dg4h60a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491955926.0, "created_utc": 1491927126.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 219}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qc30", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg45e60", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 45, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "parent_id": "t3_64qc30", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/books", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Margaret Atwood did an AMA here [you might want to take a look](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2qprzk/i_am_margaret_atwood_author_of_the_handmaids_tale/) :) [Here's a link to all of our upcoming AMAs](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/amafullschedule)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was NOT re authorized in 2012 because Republucans argued against protections for same sex couples and for extending temporary visas to immigrants who were victims of domestic violence. The bill with the extended protections to these groups (and transgender and native Americans) was finally reaithorized in 2013 and signed by President Obama. In case you don't know, living with domestic violence is much like living in a war zone. A person's life is literally at risk, and he or she quickly learn where not to go (bathroom and kitchen) to avoid weapons and being trapped. The victim learns how to pacify her/his abuser to protect themselves and/or their  children. The abusers tell their victims that no one cares about them and no one will help them - things that seem to be true when congress is bitching back and forth about whether their lives were worth protecting. \n\nThe way I see it, people were playing politics with women's lives (and some men's and a good number of children) as recently as 2013. Don't try telling me that these things could never happen.

It was NOT re authorized in 2012 because Republucans argued against protections for same sex couples and for extending temporary visas to immigrants who were victims of domestic violence. The bill with the extended protections to these groups (and transgender and native Americans) was finally reaithorized in 2013 and signed by President Obama. In case you don&amp;#39;t know, living with domestic violence is much like living in a war zone. A person&amp;#39;s life is literally at risk, and he or she quickly learn where not to go (bathroom and kitchen) to avoid weapons and being trapped. The victim learns how to pacify her/his abuser to protect themselves and/or their  children.
