It was one of the first books to be mass printed and is said to have had a big impact on literacy throughout Europe, as everyone wanted to have read it. The source of the &amp;quot;Sturm und Drang&amp;quot; movement, Goethes work has inspired romantics everywhere to take a step back from puristic, protestant values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 . &lt;strong&gt;Ansichten eines Clowns&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;The Clown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;by Heinrich B\u00f6ll&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This book describes post-war Germany (and a little bit of WW2 Germany) perfectly. Cut out, dry humour \u00e1 la John Irving clashes with the (at the time) very real melancholy and nostalgia for the &amp;quot;good old times&amp;quot; by lots of older folks, as well as the depressive nihilism of lots of post-war generation youngsters. Stilistically, this books is great for finding out more about how time can be narrated in a very flexible way. In just the span of a few hours, the narrator tells his story of broken love in post war Germany.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. B\u00f6ll also wrote a great deal of the experience of WW2 soldiers, albeit from a non-political viewpoint, which is considered unique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 . &lt;strong&gt;Homo faber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;by Max Frisch&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hailing from Switzerland and originally having finished a degree in architecture, Max Frisch soon turned to journalism and writing. (My personal favorite of his is a drama: &amp;quot;Biedermann und die Brandstifter (The Fire Raisers)&amp;quot;). This book has phenomal tempo, and once it&amp;#39;s picked up, you can&amp;#39;t put it down. Max Frisch has, in this book, perfected the genre of a family tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are my top 3 suggestions for foreigners, as in my opinion they all epitomize different eras and writing styles (although arguably B\u00f6ll and Frisch are much closer to each other than Goethe is to either of them). They all excel in different areas of style, purpose and storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many more authors which I feel could and should be added, although I have the suspicion many literature buffs here will know them already: Kafka, albeit not from a german speaking country, is a great example, alongside Thomas Mann and his brother Heinrich Mann, both of which have great irony and tell some very personal stories; Thomas&amp;#39; are more of emotional nature, mostly of his homosexual nature which was not recognized at the time and still managed to become a big piece of German literature, Heinrichs&amp;#39; being of a more political variant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honorable mentions: G\u00fcnther Grass, Heinrich Heine, Hermann Hesse, Robert Musil, Bernhard Schlinks &amp;quot;Der Vorleser (The Reader)&amp;quot;, Joseph von Eichendorff, Alfred D\u00f6blin, Eduard M\u00f6rike, Wolfgang Borchert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you guys for the amazing responses. As always when I am confronted with the sheer depth of all things literature, I managed to learn something new in this thread, and I hope you guys are having as much fun as I am! Keep &amp;#39;em coming!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there has been a bit of a commotion about my non-inclusion of Mein Kampf into this list, and as ridiculous as I feel for even responding to this, I want to make my position clear and hopefully alleviate some confusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mein Kampf, and I really shouldn&amp;#39;t have to say this, shares an ideology that is abhorrent and misanthropic to its core. I have never personally met a German, even right wingers, who even in the slightest condones what is written in there, and obviously neither do I. There is a reason the state of Bavaria, which owned the copyright to it following Hitlers death, has kept it from being published in any way shape or form for the last 75 years, I believe. Obviously it was still avaiable, lots of people inherited copies and it was also free to read online, if you knew how to look. Alas, now it has been republished as a commented edition to limit its potential for abuse. This might prove useful, since, as most of our American redditors are probably aware, right-wing ideology is at a strong point and reading Mein Kampf might make it very clear to the reader just how similar ideologies only 75 years apart can be; learn from history, don&amp;#39;t repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, as other commenters have pointed out, this is a thread about &lt;em&gt;literature&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. the art form of creating meaningful text. Mein Kampf is none of this, and I&amp;#39;ll quote &lt;a href=\"/u/tammio\"&gt;/u/tammio&lt;/a&gt;: it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;the political ravings of a madman&amp;quot;. Not more, not less. Hitler never intended to create art, he meant to stir war into the hearts of the German people, and, sadly, succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you guys want to read meaningful WW2 literature, go ahead, check out Heinrich B\u00f6lls &amp;quot;Im Westen nichts Neues (All Quiet on the Western Front)&amp;quot; or most short stories by Wolfgang Borchert, such as &amp;quot;Das Brot (The Bread)&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Nachts schlafen die Ratten doch (Rats sleep at Night)&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So please, please quite derailing the thread.
