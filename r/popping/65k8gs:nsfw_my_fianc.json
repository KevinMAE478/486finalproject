During the formation of the butt-crack skin, sometimes small holes form as the result of skin not meeting fully in that area.\n\nIt begins with an itch. You shower, take a bath, scrub extra deep; it never goes away. During the 5+ years that I let my cyst go untreated, not once did I have a scab or raised skin. I did have a lot of pus and, after that, blood.\n\nI am now cyst-free, although my butt-crack looks like a Klingon's forehead from the way the skin healed with sutures (my sinus wasn't packed for healingd, as is tradition).\n\nMy layman's advice is that this is a small infection. Does it have hair in it? Maybe. Does it look like what I had?
