About two months ago I noticed the site of my scar on my right side was becoming raised. It wasn't terribly sore, but I was concerned it would become infected or cause a problem and took a picture to document the growth. Not long after the first picture was taken it became infected, which is what I first shared with you guys. For the record, I DID go to my GP for both antibiotics and a referral to a Podiatrist. I kept the site bandaged and clean, not needing to express any more for the most part. But TODAY, I put gentle pressure on each side and saw a pearl of white underneath. I pushed firmly and gradually from the bottom towards the end of my nail bed and this popped through the top. It is absolutely solid and quite sharp! I can't tell if it's a nail or a fragment of bone left behind from the surgery or calcium. I put it in a baggie to bring it to the doctor's with me. If anything more happens I'll be sure to document for you guys. \n\nEdit: spelling \n\nEdit 2: I got another piece out on Sunday.
