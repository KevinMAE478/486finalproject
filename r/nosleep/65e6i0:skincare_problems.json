And I\u2019m not talking mild bumps on my face\u2014I\u2019m talking about huge, disgusting blemishes on all the oily parts of my body, constantly aching and popping.  It\u2019s foul as hell, and I know it.  I\u2019ve tried all the washes, the creams, the treatment programs, but nothing has ever made it go away, and some of the treatments actually made it worse.  I kind of just gave up after a while and resigned myself to being the pizza-face in the corner, the person people are only nice to out of some weird sense of pity combined with the relief that they aren\u2019t like me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I\u2019ve taken to popping the larger boils, just to try and keep some semblance of maintenance, and to cut down on the grossness any way that I can.  Yeah, it leaves behind some wicked craters, but I\u2019d rather that than the pus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I was going through my evening pre-shower ritual of popping, and I had saved the worst one for last.  My shoulder had been aching all day due to the size of the blemish there, and I was ready to get some much-needed relief.  I grabbed my tweezers and started to poke and prod the thing, not stopping until it popped.  I grabbed some toilet paper and wiped away the pus and blood, making sure to squeeze out every last bit, and I noticed a weird tickling sensation as I rubbed the area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Confused, I looked at the reddened spot.  I expected pain from popping it, but it had never tickled before.  As I examined, I noticed a light brown hair poking out.  Now, when you have skin like mine, ingrown hairs aren\u2019t exactly unheard of, but mine have always been black to match the hair on my head.  I kind of just shrugged it off though and started to tug, figuring that the hair was why that one had been extra big and painful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I pulled, I felt some resistance from below the skin.  I readjusted my grip on the tweezers and tugged more firmly\u2014so firmly, actually, that the hair broke.  I cursed and looked at my shoulder, now redder and angrier than ever.  I could still see some of the hair poking up from the irritated lump of skin, and it looked really thick to me.  I started to wonder if the hair had coiled around on itself or something, because I poked at the blemish and, now knowing what I was looking for, I could feel a small, hard lump underneath my skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to try and widen the point of exit a little to make sure that there was enough room for the hair to escape.  I dug in with my tweezers, biting my lip against the pain, until I could visibly see the hole that the hair was protruding from, and sure enough, I could see some more in there.  I decided to try and pull from inside my skin, hoping that I would be able to get it out without it breaking.  (And if not, I figured I would go to the dermatologist and have her take care of it.  I\u2019m not a complete idiot.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the base of the hair within the hole, being sure that it was firmly squeezed between my tweezers, and started to tug lightly.  I felt that weird tickling sensation again, but I persisted, although I was starting to wonder just how long this damn hair had grown.  I kept at it, widening the hole a little periodically, and I felt the hair begin to move.  It was a lot wider than a normal hair, and for the first time, I thought that maybe it wasn\u2019t a hair at all\u2014it seemed too thick and solid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I continued to work, my progress slow but steady.  The tickling sensation was decreasing the more that I got out.  Finally, I was at the point where I figured that, with one more good tug, I would be able to get the whole thing out.  I steeled myself for any pain and pulled, and I succeeded.  I felt relief from some of the pressure in my shoulder, and although I could see it beginning to bleed from the small hole I had made, it didn\u2019t look too serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shifted my attention from my shoulder to the thing in my tweezers.  Honestly, as I was working, I had been trying hard to not think too much about what I was pulling out.  I wasn\u2019t prepared to see what had come out of my shoulder though.\nThe lower half of the spider was coated in blood, and its back legs were twitching weakly.  I screamed and dropped it in the sink.  Now that it had some room to expand, I could see that its body was about the size of a pencil eraser.  In a moment of rationality, I counted, and it thankfully hadn\u2019t left any legs behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called my dermatologist, and at first the secretary didn\u2019t believe me.  I had to get pretty irate before she agreed to talk to my doctor, who luckily decided to squeeze me in as an emergency appointment.  I put the spider in a clear container as instructed, threw on my loosest shirt, and drove over, careful to not lean against the back of the seat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m lucky that the spider wasn\u2019t venomous.  The ongoing theory seems to be that I had a pimple pop and, probably while I was sleeping, it crawled in and made itself a little nest.  Except that the skin quickly created a layer over it, trapping it and creating the pressure and tickling sensation that I was experiencing.  I did successfully remove the entire spider, and as traumatizing as this experience was, I was ready to put it behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dermatologist was chatting with me amicably, making sure that the wound was clean and not infected before bandaging it up, when I heard her gasp.  The loud ring of her metal tools hitting the tile floor echoed in the small room, and her scream pierced my ears.  My shoulder felt weirdly ticklish again, and I craned my neck to see what she had discovered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your mind never prepares you for the shock of seeing tiny spiderlings crawling their way out of a hole on your shoulder, tiptoeing across your skin in search of refuge.  I remember screaming and flailing, trying to get as many off as possible, before everything goes black.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One trip to the E.R. and a minor surgery later, and I have been pronounced spider-free.  I keep being told that I\u2019m lucky.  After all, I\u2019m not poisoned, and the spiders are all gone.  But I keep glancing at the bandage on my shoulder, then looking at all of the other pimples across my body.  And maybe it\u2019s just in my head, but I swear that, from some of them, I feel that tickling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I have always had acne.
