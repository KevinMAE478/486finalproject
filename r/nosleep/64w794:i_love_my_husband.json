We went to the same Elementary school but were in different classes. When a group of fourth graders cornered me, pushing me and pulling on my braids in an attempt to assert their upper-classmen dominance, he ran into them at full speed, knocking them over like bowling pins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLEAVE HER ALONE OR I WILL GO CRAZY ON YOU!\u201d He screamed as they stared up at him, eyes wide. They scrambled off. I wiped the tears from my eyes and he turned to me, looking concerned. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From then on, he always kept an eye on me. None of those kids ever messed with me again. We weren&amp;#39;t immediately best friends, but by the time we were in our new middle school, we clung to each other in a sea of unfamiliar faces. It was hard enough to be split up from our Elementary friends without totally isolating ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We shared lunches, walked each other to our buses, and did our homework together. He listed to my problems and I listened to his. It was only natural when, in the 8th grade, we gave ourselves our first kisses. It was during the homecoming dance that we went to together as friends. During a slow dance, we swayed together, joking and giggling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He stopped laughing, and there was a pause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou really look beautiful tonight,\u201d I must have had the biggest smile on my face, because he started smiling too. Then, I leaned in and kissed him, sealing our fate as high school sweethearts for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We really were inseparable. We did all of the typical high school things together: prom, Valentines dances, drive-in movies, arcade games, making out in the halls... We lost our virginity when we were sixteen on the hood of his dad&amp;#39;s car under a full moon. My family adored him, and his adored me. We were perfect for each other and stayed together through college, making sure to go to the same one so we wouldn&amp;#39;t be apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On my 23rd birthday, he took me to my favorite pier and treated me to a beautiful seafood meal at the swankiest restaurant there. Then, we rented a row boat. He said he wanted to take me out in the bay where we could be alone and look at the stars. It was the most romantic night of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he pulled out the ring, I started crying. As he launched into his beautiful and well-rehearsed speech, his shaking hands dropped the ring under the seat of the boat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh shit!\u201d we said together. Then we just looked at each other and started laughing. After both of us fumbled around in the dark, feeling along the cold bottom of the boat, we found the ring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOkay... so will you marry me?\u201d He said, shooting me one of his famous shy smiles. Of course I said yes. We made love in the bay under the stars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our wedding was perfect, and I couldn&amp;#39;t have been more in love. We moved away to a new city and bought a small two bedroom house to stat our new life. Marriage was definitely all it was cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the other shoe always drops. I look back on these and thousands of memories just like them, going back to a time where the term \u201cmadly in love\u201d meant something completely different. Our third anniversary was the worst night of my life. I was preparing dinner when I heard the knock on my door. When I opened the door, I was greeted by two policemen with sullen faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMa&amp;#39;am, there&amp;#39;s been an accident,\u201d Those were the five words that changed my life forever. I was rushed to the hospital to meet my husband who they said was in critical condition. Everything was a blur of policemen in black uniforms, doctors in white coats, and sterile white walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had been placed in a medical coma after being in a head on collision with a drunk driver. He had a few broken bones, a punctured lung, and a lot of brain damage. Apparently, his head met with the steering wheel at full force. The doctors said that if he hadn&amp;#39;t been wearing his seatbelt, he wouldn&amp;#39;t have stood a chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next few weeks were indescribably hard. When he came out of his coma, he couldn&amp;#39;t speak or walk. He stayed in ICU for a couple of weeks to try and get the swelling on his brain down. After that, he was able to start physical and speech therapy. It took months for him to relearn what we all take for granted. And I... was there for every step, every stutter, every bandage change, every tear. I was his rock as he recovered. I&amp;#39;d never seen him look so... weak, desperate, or broken. I needed him to know I was there and that I loved him no matter what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The therapists warned me that there may be some behavioral changes with an injury like his. To me, he seemed to have gotten back to himself by the time he was released and I rook him home. He was joking and trying to be his positive self, despite facing many daily challenges. I would have taken him back in any condition, honestly. There were many dark nights in the hospital when I thought about the alternative. What if he hadn&amp;#39;t survived the crash? The thought always sent me into heaving sobs, thanking what gods there may be for sparing his life. I didn&amp;#39;t think I could live without him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a few months, everything was okay. I worked from home so I could take care of him. As he became more physically able, I could tell he was starting to resent me for babying him. Things were strained between us- but I really thought that just meant he was antsy from being stuck inside all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou&amp;#39;ll be able to go back to work soon, I&amp;#39;m sure of it,\u201d I would tell him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It started with some angry outbursts. He would pick fights over small things. I figured he was entitled to a few outbursts after all he&amp;#39;d been through. But it soon became an every day occurrence... and he was getting angrier and angrier each day. He soon insisted that he stay in the guest bedroom so he \u201cdidn&amp;#39;t have to look at me anymore.\u201d It killed me to do it, but I obliged without much of a fight. The therapists said it was best to avoid conflict where possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gave him as much space as I could while still taking care of him and living under the same roof. When I wasn&amp;#39;t around for him to direct his anger at, he would fight with himself. There were several times where I went to check on him in the morning just to find decorations knocked off the walls and dresser, or holes punched in the doors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had long moments of clarity, though. I would find him curled into himself, crying and saying, \u201cI&amp;#39;m sorry, I&amp;#39;m so sorry,\u201d over and over. He would let me hold him and whisper to him until he fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doctors and therapists tried tens of medications to curb his behavior... but nothing made a difference. If anything, they made it worse. There were just new side effects to deal with. His moments of clarity were becoming farther and farther apart and his anger was growing by the day. In a period of six months, I had almost completely lost my husband.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One night, I heard a crash come from his room, followed by a guttural screaming. I ran in to find the dresser tipped onto the floor and smashed into bits, my husband pulling it apart board by board with bloodied hands. It looked as though some wood had splintered off and cut his hands badly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was screaming in that deep, shaking voice. I just covered my mouth and watched as he began hitting himself, flailing around and beating his body with his bloody hands. When he started hitting his head, I started screaming and ran towards him. I pulled on his arms to stop them from pummeling himself.  He looked me in the eye, teeth bared, and yelled \u201cGET OFF ME!\u201d in a voice I hadn&amp;#39;t heard before. He then pulled his arm out of my grip and hit me in the jaw hard enough to knock me to the floor. Shortly after, the cops arrived and detained him. Apparently, a neighbor had called them when they heard the commotion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night, he dislocated my jaw. It was also the first time I had ever been afraid of my husband.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband was placed in a psychiatric hold for three days after that. When I picked him up, he seemed foggy and out of it, but he had tears in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPlease... please, Jen, don&amp;#39;t ever let me go there again,\u201d he mumbled, wiping his eyes with shaking hands. \u201cI&amp;#39;m so sorry, I&amp;#39;m just so sorry,\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night, the night terrors began. He would sit up in a dead sleep in the middle of the night, screaming and pulling his hair. A few times, he took fistfulls of his hair out. He would also scratch his arms or stomach until he drew blood and pieces of his skin were falling off. I took to sitting in the armchair in the corner of the room so I could watch him while he slept and give him a mild sedative the doctors prescribed for when he woke up in these fits. Sometimes, he would hit me in the middle of these panicked episodes- but I don&amp;#39;t believe it was ever on purpose. We both had bruises, scrapes and cuts on our bodies and faces from those night terrors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the sedative kicked in, he would often have one of those moments of clarity. He would tell me he missed me, that he hated who he was, that I deserved better... He would often tell me to just shoot him because the anguish was too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m telling you all of this so that hopefully, you will understand why I had to do what I did. My husband meant.... means everything to me. He was my first and last love. He was my protector. He was my provider. He was... everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doctors told me that if we didn&amp;#39;t see any improvement, they would have to recommend admitting him to the psychiatric ward indefinitely. The damage on his brain was irreversible, they said. He may never improve, they said. When my husband heard this suggestion, he burst into tears, begging me to not let that happen to him. He said he wouldn&amp;#39;t last.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tonight, he had his last moment of clarity. After a particularly bad night terror, I had to wrap his wrist which was bleeding from a scab he had torn off with his nails and deepened the existing wound. As I was winding the gauze around his wrist, he sat up against the headboard and looked intently at me, eyelids slightly heavy from the sedative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said softly. He had dark circles under his eyes, rash-like scratches along his jaw and scraggly dark hair hanging over his face. \u201cI love you, Jen. I&amp;#39;m so sorry about everything. I wish I could get better, but I can&amp;#39;t, and I&amp;#39;m sorry for that,\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started crying and held his wrist close to my chest. This was when he fell asleep once again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat on the edge of the bed, looking at my husband through tears and silently weeping for him. I knew we couldn&amp;#39;t keep this up much longer. He would end up really hurting himself, and I would end up losing my mind along with him. Every memory we had together came crashing down on me, running in circles around my exhausted mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thought came to me so suddenly that I gasped. I grabbed his bottle of sedatives and poured them into my palm. I counted twenty-one pills. Twenty-one pills that would easily send the largest of men to death&amp;#39;s door. Surely, this would work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I scooped the pills back into the bottle and set it on the night stand. I kissed my husband&amp;#39;s forehead and thanked him for being the man that he was. Then, I grabbed a pillow and placed it gently over his face. I climbed above him so that my knees were pressing down on either side of the pillow, pressing down with my body weight so that he could not throw me off of him. For a moment, nothing happened. But then he started to struggle. I could hear his muffled voice screaming my name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His arms reached up and clawed at my back, unable to get a grip on me. I held onto the headboard and pressed harder into the pillow. His legs were kicking now. But it didn&amp;#39;t take more than a minute or two, a very long minute or two, before his fighting began to subside and his hits were backed with less force. When he stopped moving, I knelt on the pillow for several more minutes. I had to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I pulled the pillow off of his face, I screamed in agony. My husband was dead, and I killed him. I held his face in my hands for a moment, staring into his glossy, lifeless eyes and scanning his bruised cheeks as the blood ran out of them. I kissed his forehead, and that was it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I have nearly finished this \u201copen letter\u201d of sorts, I can call the cops. There are no longer twenty-one pills in that bottle. I&amp;#39;m just hoping the ambulance doesn&amp;#39;t get here too soon; I really can&amp;#39;t live without my husband.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything is getting quieter for me. I hope that you understand why I did it... I really do. I loved my husband with my entire soul. I loved him in sickness and in health. I loved him so much that I saved him from an existence of misery wrapped up in anti-psychotics, pain killers, and sedatives. I loved him enough to save us both from a life without each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve called the police. I&amp;#39;m going to go lay down with my husband now and rest my head on his chest for the last time. It&amp;#39;s getting too quiet now. I think it&amp;#39;s time for me to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry, please forgive me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Jen&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I met my husband when I was seven.

February 7 of last year my sister got hit by a drunk driver that sped through a red light when she was halfway through an intersection (meaning he t boned her car). She almost died. When we went to the emergency room we didn&amp;#39;t know if we were saying goodbye. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She went into a coma and had only managed to call a random contact on her phone (as she was extremely disoriented) who turned out to be her boss and all she said was: &amp;quot;Mama. I want mama.&amp;quot; before going unconscious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She survived narrowly but has pretty bad TBI (traumatic brain injury). She&amp;#39;s had to learn to move her body all over again, to wak, talk, eat, everything. She&amp;#39;s different but she&amp;#39;s still Chelsea and I can see her personality shine through sometimes. She remembers some specific things but has no memories of others. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man that hit her is an illegal immigrant that borrowed his friend&amp;#39;s truck, drank until he was three times over the legal limit, only showed up to two court hearings and ran off before we could get justice. He was easily bailed out of jail. We have all the hospital bills and no justice.
