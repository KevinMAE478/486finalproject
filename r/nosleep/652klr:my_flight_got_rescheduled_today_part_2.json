I\u2019ve closed all the blinds and drawn all the curtains in my house. I triple checked to make sure all the doors are locked and bolted. I\u2019m hoping that all of this is a prank, but I know that it\u2019s not. I feel guilty and anxious. I just want my boyfriend to get back home so I can talk to him; So that he can verify that this isn\u2019t some fucked up dream I\u2019m having.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~ &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He made it back, and I practically jumped out of my skin when I heard the front door opening. He had a bag in one hand and his car keys in the other. As soon as he stepped inside, I grabbed the food from him and tugged him into the living room, where the news coverage on my flight was being dutifully updated. He looked at the TV with his mouth gaping, and then turned to look at me like I was a ghost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He shook his head slowly before reaching out to touch me. Tears gathered in his eyes. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re dead\u2026? And I\u2019ve gone insane?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fear contorted his face and I was speechless. It felt like I had dove into icy water \u2014 my body was in shock. I couldn\u2019t feel my boyfriend touching me, or my body shaking. All I could focus on was the rapidly escalating beating of my heart. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat down and unlocked my phone. It sounds silly, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to call my friend back until someone else was with me. The voicemail had shaken me greatly, and I didn\u2019t want to be alone for the sake of chancing my line connecting with whatever haunting voice I had heard earlier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tapped my best friend\u2019s contact to call her back. My phone didn\u2019t ring. It made a strange, elongated beeping sound that filled me with dread for some reason. I instinctively threw the phone away from me onto the far end of the couch, as if it had burnt my hand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend was slowly returning to the moment, and furrowed his eyebrows at me. \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d He questioned, gesturing at the phone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that split second I was faced with a decision: Do I tell him about the voicemail? Do I share some of this burden? Or do I err on the side of safety, and shield him from whatever the hell that cryptic message means? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided on the latter. I love him too much to ever place him in harm\u2019s way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stuttered out an explanation\u2026 \u201cIt k-keeps making\u2026a\u2026a\u2026weird sound.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was obviously still in awe, and didn\u2019t take much note of my strange behavior. I\u2019m sure he chalked it up to the knowledge that I was here instead of at the bottom of an ocean. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes, he hugged me. It was a desperate sort of hug that poured out relief and gratitude and love and raw emotion. I hugged him back in the same way, and we stayed interlocked like that for what felt like an eternity. When we finally broke the embrace, he kissed me on the forehead and went to the kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s when I got the next call. My phone lit up, and I scrambled over to snatch it up and answer it. I hoped it would be my friend, but I knew who it was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I answered it. The same electronic voice answered: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou were smart to not implicate your boyfriend. Now he may continue to exist.\u201d The line seemed to go dead afterwards, but I remained motionless and silent with the phone pressed against my ear until I heard that haunting phrase again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou owe us.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked into my bedroom, not really sure what I was looking for. I scanned the room, searching for anything that seemed off. My stack of law school textbooks was still precariously stacked on my bedside table. The bed comforter was still neatly made. The light was still on. I took a deep breath, but a shadow caught the corner of my eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shouldn\u2019t have done it. But I had to. The shadow was coming from behind the curtains of the window. I brushed them aside and peeked through the blinds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the wind was sucked out of my lungs: Standing in between our house and the neighbor\u2019s was a man. He gave me a tight lipped, blood curdling smile and gestured with his finger for me to come to him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I blinked hard and fast, willing the image of the man that was now burnt forever in my mind to go away. He didn\u2019t move. I locked eyes with him and he moved his mouth slowly: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou owe us.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I burst into loud sobs, hoping that this was a horrible manifestation of survivor\u2019s guilt. That I wasn\u2019t really indebted to whatever \u201cus\u201d the man and the voice on my phone had been referring to. My boyfriend ran into the room, jarred and asking me what was wrong. I couldn\u2019t tell him, opting instead to bawl into his chest as he held me. With one arm around me, he yanked the blinds open with his free hand. I snuck a glance and the man was gone; I was momentarily relieved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After we ate and talked and comforted one another a bit more, my boyfriend and I got into bed. I laid there with my eyes bloodshot and wide open, listening to his breathing grow steadily slower and more rhythmic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had been awake for hours longer than my boyfriend, and finally gave up on sleep entirely. I got up and made my way to the bathroom to put my contacts in. As soon as I had done so, my phone lit up: another call from an Unknown caller ID. I answered it once again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWho is this?\u201d I choked out into the phone before the voice could come through the line. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as I asked the question, the doorbell rang. I dropped my phone and it toppled to the tile on the bathroom floor. I bent down and grabbed it, noting that the call was disconnected. I made my way to the door in a trance, not really sure what I would even do if the man I had seen outside my window was now outside my door. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I approached the door, loud knocks hammered against it.
