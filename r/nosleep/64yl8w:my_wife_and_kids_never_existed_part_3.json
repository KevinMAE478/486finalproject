These last 4 days have been the most difficult time in my life. I can\u2019t do this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After my last update, nothing really eventful happened. I went to the gym offered by the hotel, and continued to ponder my current situation until I passed out at about 9:30PM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I awoke to the sound of the hotel phone ringing on the bedside table. I knew who it was. I knew what I was about to hear, but I still picked up the phone. However, I didn\u2019t hear the expected \u201cI hope you find them.\u201d No, what I heard was much worse, something that I haven\u2019t been able to stop hearing in my mind for this entire 4-day period. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I picked up the phone, expecting to hear that tormenting phrase, but I was met with breathing. Heavy breathing. It took me a few seconds to identify whose breathing it was, and when I did I almost dropped the phone. The breathing was from my wife. At first I thought that this must be another recording, but then she said something that confirmed it wasn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPlease\u2026 find me\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her voice cracked and trailed off into sobbing. I was about to ask her where she was when the line went dead. I ripped the phone out of the wall and smashed it against a lamp on the same table, sending it into a collision with the opposite wall, breaking it. I ran out into the parking lot in a fit of both tears and rage. I just sat there and cried. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She exists, but someone has her. Why else would she be crying? What the fuck are they doing to her? Where the fuck is she? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got into my car and drove off. I know it was wrong of me not to pay for the room, but I can\u2019t stay there knowing that the woman who is tormenting me knows that I\u2019m there. I can\u2019t go back home, that place isn\u2019t safe either. I decided that I was just going to have to sleep in my car. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked my watch and saw that it was 3:13AM. As per a recommendation on my previous update, I decided to stop by my in-laws house. I couldn\u2019t find them through any forms of social media, but now that I knew Christina exists, or at least I think she does, maybe they do too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was about 20 minutes later that I arrived at \u201ctheir\u201d house. They lived decently far out on the outskirts of town, so it took a while. I parked my car directly in front of their yard. I left it on, and walked up to their front porch. Their property was small, they were an older couple and didn\u2019t need much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knocked on the door, and rang the doorbell until someone answered. I know it was early, but I didn\u2019t care. I needed to know if they were there. I saw the lights come on in the window seconds before a man opened the door. He was a short scruffy looking-dude who had the body type of a meth addict. \u201cThe hell do you want?\u201d I just replied with nevermind and turned around and walked away, got in my car, and sped off; the man yelling obscenities and swears at me all the while. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My in-laws definitely don\u2019t exist. That much has been confirmed, but where was Christina? How would I be able to find her? Are my kids with her? The thought of some sick fuck having control over them made me furious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I drove to an empty parking lot that was for sale, and decided that it would be an alright place to crash. I drifted off to sleep a few minutes after I had parked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had nothing but nightmares that night. I was tied down to a chair, watching as my wife was running barefoot through a cornfield, her cheeks wet with tears. She was running from a wall of darkness that was closing in behind her. She then stopped, turned around and looked directly at me. I saw the look of fear in her eyes, she looked like she had given up. I saw her lips begin to move, forming the words \u201cPlease find me\u201d and with that she was gone. The darkness absorbed her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I awoke with a start. I can\u2019t even be safe in my dreams anymore. I checked my watch and saw it was 5:30AM, the rush hour traffic had begun. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I couldn\u2019t stay here, but where else would I go. With that my laptop dinged. I looked over into the passenger seat and saw that I had a message from 000000000. I moused over to it, and clicked on it. I knew it was going to be another message meant to torment me. I didn\u2019t care anymore. The amount of pain I was feeling already couldn\u2019t possibly get any worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The messenger app opened and the newly started conversation loaded, if you could call it that. It was a picture. It was incredibly dark, I couldn\u2019t see anything but a slight outline of a person. I saved the picture and used a photoshop app to brighten the image.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t even know how to explain this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took the image and brightened it all the way. I recognized who it was immediately. It was the woman who was once in a blue dress. She was lying completely naked in a bathtub, the water red with her blood. Her head lay over the side, her lifeless eyes staring directly at the camera. There were words on the wall above her written it what I presumed was her blood. They read:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019M SORRY\u2026 PLEASE FIND THEM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the car door and vomited onto the pavement below. My laptop dinged as two more notifications had arrived. I looked and saw that I had received two new messages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SHE DIDN&amp;#39;T LAST LONG&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;M GONNA FIND YOU YOU SON OF A BITCH&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65e7gh/my_wife_and_kids_never_existed_part_four/\"&gt;Click Here For Part Four!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Click Here for Part 1!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/63hyrq/my_wife_and_kids_never_existed/)\n\n[Click Here to Read Part 2!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/641qml/my_wife_and_kids_never_existed_part_two/)\n\nI don\u2019t know if I can keep doing this.
