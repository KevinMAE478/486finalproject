The parking lot was crowded with tired students, yellow buses, and stressed teachers. My cellphone buzzed in my pocket. I had recieved a message from Vida. &lt;em&gt;Hey, where r u?&lt;/em&gt; it read. Hastily, I texted her back. &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m parked by the football field. Hurry up so none of the teachers see us.&lt;/em&gt; Moments later, I spotted Vida quickly making her way across the parking lot towards my beat-up pick up truck. She was wearing a ridiculous ensemble of fishnet tights, a tight black dress, and spiky earrings. She opened the passenger door and sat down beside me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why does this truck smell like week-old bologna?&amp;quot; Vida asked, rolling her eyes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Check the backseat.&amp;quot; I stated, turning the key in the ignition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vida turned around and picked up a moldy sandwich. &amp;quot;Seriously? Ugh, men are so gross.&amp;quot; She tossed it out the window as we exited the school parking lot. &amp;quot;Not our problem anymore.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once we were a safe distance from the school, I typed in the name of the diner on my phone&amp;#39;s GPS and began a long, boring drive down the highway. Vida and I sat in silence for what felt like forever until I finally decided to break the ice. &amp;quot;So,&amp;quot; I began, gripping the steering wheel tighter. &amp;quot;Do you remember that time we spilled powdered sugar all over your mom&amp;#39;s floor?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My mom was so angry that day.&amp;quot; Vida said with a chuckle. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll ever forget the look on her face when she saw the mess.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frostburg was a cross between a charming little community and a college town. Harper&amp;#39;s Diner was hard to find because it was tucked away behind a church. I parked and followed Vida inside the tiny diner. It was less than impressive. The green booths looked like they hadn&amp;#39;t been cleaned in years and there were cracks in each of the windows. A young woman, probably a college student, offered us a booth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry, but we&amp;#39;re actually wondering if we could speak to Harper.&amp;quot; Vida said. &amp;quot;Is she here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The girl nodded. &amp;quot;Sure, I can go get her for you.&amp;quot; She said in an accent I didn&amp;#39;t recognize. &amp;quot;Are you here to fix the ovens?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not exactly.&amp;quot; I answered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A woman emerged from the kitchen. She had wavy, gray hair tied up in a tight bun on the top of her head. She was wearing a pair of overalls with a flannel shirt underneath. Her eyes were concealed by a pair of dark sunglasses and she walked with a long, white cane extended in front of her. &amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot; She snapped, stopping a few feet in front of me and Vida. When neither of us didn&amp;#39;t responded, she let out a loud groan. &amp;quot;Well don&amp;#39;t be shy, introduce yourselves!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My name is Pete and I&amp;#39;m here with my cousin, Vida.&amp;quot; I explained. &amp;quot;We have some questions that we&amp;#39;re hoping you can answer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, you and your college buddies can&amp;#39;t have a party here.&amp;quot; She replied, sitting down on a stool behind the counter. &amp;quot;Last time I let people your age in here past ten o&amp;#39;clock, the place was a wreck the next morning.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vida glanced at me nervously. &amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t want a party. We have questions about something called Living Flame.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harper&amp;#39;s annoyed expression melted into one of fear. &amp;quot;What did you just say?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My grandfather was named Edgar Meadows, but everyone just called him Ed. His wife was named Beatrice.&amp;quot; I said, noting her discomfort. &amp;quot;Did you by any chance give them a scrapbook for their wedding?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harper was silent for a few seconds. &amp;quot;You kids don&amp;#39;t know how dangerous Living Flame truly is.&amp;quot; She said quietly. &amp;quot;All you need to know is that it&amp;#39;s a cult. I suggest you don&amp;#39;t try to find out anything else, okay? It&amp;#39;s for your own safety.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t going to give up that easily. &amp;quot;Can you at least tell us how you knew our grandparents?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I left Living Flame about five years after your grandparents got married.&amp;quot; She said with a shudder. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m assuming your grandparents and parents left before you were even born because you don&amp;#39;t know anything. That&amp;#39;s good.You should keep it that way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well if they&amp;#39;re doing anything illegal we need to report them to the police.&amp;quot; Vida said indignantly. &amp;quot;Where are they located?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have no idea.&amp;quot; Harper replied. &amp;quot;They relocate every four years to keep themselves hidden. Still, when I was a part of Living Flame, they always relocated to rural farmland on the Eastern Shore or even in Delaware. That way, they could be self-sufficient. &amp;quot; She stood up and retreated back to the kitchen. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m telling you kids.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait!&amp;quot; I called.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; Harper called from the kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you.&amp;quot; I said sheepishly. &amp;quot;I understand if you don&amp;#39;t want to tell us anything else.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m glad you do.&amp;quot; She said. &amp;quot;Now go home and forget you heard anything about Living Flame.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If only I had listened to her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second we left the restaurant, Vida said what I was thinking. &amp;quot;I say we drive to the Eastern Shore and ask the locals if they&amp;#39;ve seen anyone walking around in weird red robes.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a long shot, but information usually gets around quicker in small communities.&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;If we get lucky, we&amp;#39;ll find Living Flame and get some answers out of them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After stopping for a bite to eat at a fast food joint, we were off. The drive from Frostburg to the Eastern shore was 4-5 hours, but I was up for the challenge. At what other point in my life would I get the opportunity to uncover a cult? Vida fell asleep by the time we reached the outskirts of Baltimore, which was fine with me. Making small talk with someone who you once considered to be your best friend is more painful than most people realize. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Bay Bridge was packed with people trying to get to Ocean City for the weekend, which was a pain in the butt. I&amp;#39;ll admit, crossing the bridge made me a bit nervous, but not nervous enough to make me turn around and go back home. The western and eastern parts of Maryland are almost polar opposites. The western half, where most people live, is overcrowded with people who either commute to D.C. or Baltimore each day. The eastern half across the bridge is more relaxed and calm, well, unless you&amp;#39;re go to Ocean City during the summer. That place is a madhouse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up in Delaware a few miles away from the Maryland border. Vida had woken up by that point, and I could hear her stomach growling. &amp;quot;Hey, I know this place.&amp;quot; She said. &amp;quot;If you turn right, we&amp;#39;ll be at what I personally think is the best farmer&amp;#39;s market in the world. They sell the freshest fruit I&amp;#39;ve ever had. My parents accidentally discovered it a few summers ago when they got lost and we&amp;#39;ve been stopping here ever since every time we&amp;#39;re in the area.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot; I said, spotting the tiny fruit stand a few hundred yards away. &amp;quot;But after this, we need to start asking people if they know anything about Living Flame.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know that.&amp;quot; Vida mumbled. &amp;quot;But while we&amp;#39;re here, we may as well enjoy ourselves, y&amp;#39;know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman running the tiny cart full of fruit was the stereotypical nice old lady. She smiled sweetly as we hopped out of the truck. &amp;quot;Hey kids, what can I do for you?&amp;quot; She said. &amp;quot;Are you lost? We don&amp;#39;t usually get visitors around here I&amp;#39;m afraid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I actually just love the fruit you sell here.&amp;quot; Vida said, picking up a basket of strawberries. &amp;quot;How much is this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can just have it for free, dear.&amp;quot; The woman replied. &amp;quot;While your here, would you like to come inside for some lemonade?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suddenly realized how dry my throat was. &amp;quot;That sounds great.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her house looked like it had been built about a century ago. There was a swing on the front porch along with some potted plants. A good old-fashioned farmhouse. I held the door open for her and Vida then followed them inside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all happened so fast. I heard someone lock the door behind me as my mind began to process what I was looking at. there were about thirty people, men, women, and children all of them in red cloaks, smiling at me. A few of them looked like they had been crying. Before I could react, I was shoved into a wooden chair and tied down. Someone snatched the cellphone from my pocket. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Vida, you have completed your mission.&amp;quot; A man, presumably the leader, said as he stood in front of me. &amp;quot;Now go take that ridiculous makeup off and come back down here in your proper uniform.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vida nodded. &amp;quot;Of course, Lord Oliver.&amp;quot; She walked up a flight of steep stairs and disappeared from view&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; this?&amp;quot; I asked in disbelief. &amp;quot;Wait a second..Vida! Did she know about this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course she did.&amp;quot; Oliver answered. &amp;quot;It was her job to lure you to us, and she succeeded.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know what to say next. &amp;quot;But...But Harper! She seemed like she actually hated you guys.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Harper Kowalski?&amp;quot; Oliver said, grinning. &amp;quot;Never thought I&amp;#39;d hear that name again. I thought for sure she&amp;#39;d keep her mouth shut after The Flame took away her vision.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thrashed around in my chair, but it was no use. The Living Flame sure knew how to tie a tight knot. &amp;quot;What did you do to Harper? What are you going to do to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oliver pulled a small, black book from his pocket and opened to a marker page. &amp;quot;So glad you asked. The prophecy states that whenever a pair of twins is born into Living Flame, the firstborn of those twins must live among the outside world for eighteen years so they become impure. Then, exactly three months after their eighteenth birthday, they are to be brought here to be cleansed and then sacrificed to The Flame.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I&amp;#39;m not a twin! I don&amp;#39;t even have any siblings!&amp;quot; I protested, tears streaming down my face. &amp;quot;Please...this is all a misunderstanding. Let me go now, and I won&amp;#39;t say a thing to anyone about this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(That was a lie)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s where you&amp;#39;re wrong, Peter.&amp;quot; Oliver replied slowly. &amp;quot;Vida isn&amp;#39;t your cousin. She&amp;#39;s your twin sister.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart dropped. &amp;quot;No. no no no no no no no.&amp;quot; I whimpered. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not true. There&amp;#39;s photos of my mom and Vida&amp;#39;s mom posing together while they were pregnant.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Photoshop exists, Pete.&amp;quot; Vida said as she walked down the stairs. She looked so different without any makeup on. &amp;quot;My parents are your parents. Your so called &lt;em&gt;parents&lt;/em&gt; never had any children. All of them are in full suppoert of sacrificing you because it must be done no matter what. The only one who was disobedient to The Flame was your grandfather. He was going to tell you all about us on your eighteenth birthday, so The Flame got rid of him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, Oliver stuck a needled into my arm. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry, you&amp;#39;ll wake up later.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My world went black. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64omjt/i_found_an_old_vhs_tape_in_my_grandfathers/)\n\nI pulled into the parking lot of Sleekfall High School.
