Panting and sweating, I walked to the middle of the bus and sat down next to an older woman. I plugged in my headphones, leaned back, and started to enjoy the beginning of my 40-minute ride until I felt a sharp finger jab me on my side. I yelped and looked over at the old woman. She was looking at me with the most disgusted look possible. She started to say something so I took my headphones off and said, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With an agitated sigh, she cleared her throat and said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to sing along with your music please make sure you brush your teeth in the morning. I can smell your breath all the way over here.\u201d The people behind me started snickering and I muttered a half-hearted apology before plugging my headphones back in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Twenty minutes go by and the woman gets off and squeezes by me. Before she starts walking towards the door she reached into her pocket and threw 5 pieces of candy at me. Annoyed, I tossed them under my seat and just looked out the window until the bus arrived at my spot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh. Before I forget, let me introduce myself. My name is Simon and I am a waiter at a seafood restaurant. I am 28 years old and I live at my parent\u2019s house. They don\u2019t really mind. I pay my share of rent as well as buy my own groceries. I come back home at reasonable hours, and I was never one to start any type of trouble. I do have the money saved up to move out and get my apartment, but there really is no reason. I have enough space in my room, I have never had a serious relationship, and I\u2019m pretty sure I never will. Not trying to be negative or anything. Just truthful. I\u2019m fucking ugly. Not your average ugly. I am the guy that actually creeps you out just by looking at you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Horribly misshapen teeth, eyes that look like they are about to pop out any moment, acne all across my face as well as neck area, and hair that is already half balding is just the beginning of my physical flaws. Not trying to sound clich\u00e9, but I do have a great personality. That is why I am so good at being a waiter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love my job. It wasn\u2019t my dream job, but it is gradually becoming something that I am very passionate about. My tips are always great and I get to meet a lot of people from around our city. Most are nice, but of course, there are some people who are rude throughout their entire meal and refuse to tip. It\u2019s just all part of the job. The good always makes up for the bad luckily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, back to what started happening 2 days ago. I got off the bus and started to walk towards the restaurant, Crackin\u2019 Crabs, and felt something rub against my jeans. I dug into my pocket and pulled out the five pieces of candy the lady handed me. Curious, I put the rest of the candy back in my pocket except one and held it up to my face. It was orange and had a clear plastic covering over it. Shrugging, I opened up the wrapper and popped the candy into my mouth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It may sound really dumb for me to say this, but holy shit, that candy was the best tasting candy I ever ate. It was orange flavored, but there was so much more depth to the taste. The strong aroma of a peeled orange enveloped my mouth. This is kind of awkward and embarrassing to say, but I puckered up my mouth and sucked as hard as I could. Before I knew it, the rest of the candy dissolved from my mouth and flowed down my throat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disappointed about the candy\u2019s early dismissal, I walked into the restaurant, clocked in, and started to work. It started off normally, but gradually I started to notice the other workers staring at me. Not of disgust but of genuine curiosity. I didn\u2019t really know why they were staring at me until a customer I was serving asked me, \u201cMan. I mean this in the straightest way possible. You are about the best looking guy I have ever seen!\u201d I gave him a laugh and rushed to the restroom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reflection looking back at me was me, but not really me. It was a perfect version of me. Teeth were completely straight, hair was styled perfectly, my face was crystal clear of any imperfections, and the rest of my body looked to be much more fit. Curious, I lifted up my shirt and saw that my slight pudge was now an immaculate six pack. Everything on my body was completely defined. I looked down my pants and gave a little chuckle when I saw the unexpected growth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should I have been curious about what happened? Absolutely, but put yourself in my shoes. This was the first lucky thing that really happened to me. I was finally confident to talk to people, and I was finally somewhat happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With confidence, I walked through the door and worked the rest of my shift. As I was grabbing my jacket from the break room a cook that recently laughed in my face after I asked her out on a date, Janet, nervously walked up to me and asked me if I needed a ride. I gave her a smile and told her I was fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After giving her a nod, I started to walk towards the bus stop when I heard someone scream out, \u201cNo!\u201d I quickly turned around and saw Janet running full speed at me. Panicking, I took off running and didn\u2019t stop until I got in the middle of the others waiting on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn\u2019t stop running until she tried grabbing me, but the other people started to push her off of me. The whole time she kept yelling, &lt;strong&gt;\u201cYou can\u2019t look like that. You\u2019re not supposed to look like that.\u201d&lt;/strong&gt; She grabbed a knife from her back pocket and tried to throw it at me but luckily they had her down on the ground. They all tried to fight for the knife, but in the end, she managed to grab the knife with both of her hands before plunging it into her chest repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cops came about 15 minutes later. They kept asking me how I knew her and why she would do that, but I kept telling them the same thing. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d After going back and forth for about 40 minutes they told me to not leave the area and they would contact me if they had any other questions. I gave them a slow nod and they left. The bus ride was the longest ride of my life. I finally acknowledged that my good looks did not come out of luck. It was something else. The candy, but why did the old woman give me the candy? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bus came to a stop and I looked up and saw that it was my stop. I got off and walked up to my house. When I walked in I noticed that my parents were asleep on the living room couch. They did that every night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started walking up the stairs when I heard my dad wake up and ask, \u201cNow what the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing here?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Confused, I looked at him and asked, \u201cWhat do you mean dad? I\u2019m just going to my room. I have to wake up early tomorrow for work.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a grunt, he got off of his couch and walked up to me. I stood still but flinched when he raised his hand at me. Instead of hitting me, he just grabbed me by the shoulder and threw me out the front door. As he closed it I heard him yell out, \u201cDon\u2019t you think you can ever come back in here you evil piece of shit. You hear me? I hate you. You are worthless and you will never be anything. Go kill yourself, because sooner than later. We will come kill you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was confused as well as hurt. My father always treated me well. He was the last person I ever thought would say he hated me. I\u2019m in a hotel now, I got a free room. The woman in the front counter blushed while telling me that she will cover the cost for me. Flattered I gave her my number and went to my room. After just 2 hours in my room, I am scared shitless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the middle of writing this out to you guys, I started to hear several familiar voices call out my name. I got up from my bed and looked out my window. Everyone I loved, my uncle, aunt, father, mother, and my 2 best friends, Matt and Stephen, were staring up into my window. I stuck my head out the window and asked them what they wanted, but they kept staring up at me. My mother had a knife in her hand and rubbed it against my father\u2019s back. My uncle rose up his gun and I ducked out of the way. I sat there shuddering. They were all looking at me with a look of absolute hatred. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the rest of the candy and tried to get rid of it, but it keeps coming back to me. I threw it out my window, flushed it down the toilet, threw it out of my door and down the hall, and even tried melting them with my lighter. Nothing works. The candy and the wrapping around it will not melt or truly disappear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t want to eat the rest of the candy. I already have the people I love outside trying to kill me. I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I ended up calling the cops. After I told them the address to the building and said I was just filing a noise complaint I hung up the phone. By the time they arrived at the hotel and walked to the spot I described everyone was gone.  So please guys. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m stuck with these fucking demonic candies, and I just really wish I never &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HayongNoSleep/\"&gt;ate the first one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/655txx/five_pieces_of_candy_ruined_my_life_final_update/\"&gt;Part Two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Have you ever had something simple ruin your entire life? \n \nI\u2019m talking about something so minuscule that you would never have guessed that anything terrible could ever occur from said item. \n \nFor me, 5 small pieces of hard candy did just that. \n \nThis morning, I was running late, but managed to get ready and caught the bus before it drove away.
