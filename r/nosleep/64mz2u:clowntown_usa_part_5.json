I could still hear the mechanic outside as he tinkered with my car, most likely ensuring it would never run again. My son had run away to play with the monstrous children in this town that was holding us both prisoner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know there were many things I could have done. Made the trek to the outside world on foot, on my own, and come back with the real police. Held a knife on the mechanic until he put my car back in working order, gone on a vehicular  rampage until they agreed to give my son back. But I was not the woman then that I am now. My thought process moved in panic loops. One thought kept coming back, no matter how many times I tried to banish it: &lt;em&gt;the clown knows something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered his face as he looked at my son. You\u2019d think the only living clown would be happy to see a new disciple. But no, he had looked dismayed at my son\u2019s transformation. It was the first natural reaction I had seen since I&amp;#39;d come to town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I waited until dark. The mechanic left hours before, leaving parts of my car scattered all over my driveway. The destroyed clown statues hadn\u2019t been taken, but new ones sat  in the empty spaces until you couldn\u2019t see a single inch of lawn. I resisted the urge to kick one over as I snuck out of my house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did not have any set plan at this point. I had packed one of my kitchen knives for self defense, but beyond that I was prepared for nothing. What would I do? What would I say? That would all depend on the clown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t travel by the road, but skulked through yards and occasionally hopped fences. I was wary at all times of being watched, but by the time I hit the school I was fairly confident I hadn\u2019t been followed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The school had a baseball diamond and a soccer field to the south, beyond that was a cluster of trees probably left over from the town\u2019s development. I crept through the bushes, not even sure of what I was looking for until I heard the sound of canned laughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little ways into the trees was a shack made of corrugated tin. I could see the glow of light in the window as I crept up and peered inside. There were only four pieces of furniture in the shack: a metal cot, a bureau, a bar stool that held a black-and-white television, and a folding chair. The clown sat in the chair, nursing a bottle as he watched a rerun of Roseanne. I checked the room for weapons, saw none, and decided to make my entrance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The door was situated within sight of the chair, so there was no element of surprise. I simply opened the door and walked in. The clown glanced up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh hey,\u201d he said like he was casually greeting an old friend, \u201cI was wondering when I&amp;#39;d see you here.\u201d His normal voice was soft, not at all what I\u2019d expected&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept my hand on the knife in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Up close, the clown was an even sadder picture than he\u2019d been from a distance. His white makeup had cracked  away in big patches. I realized that he probably never washed it off, just slapped another layer on every morning. His poofy hair was lopsided and up close I could see that the red was peppered with grey. His eyes were sad and brown and bloodshot inside their greasepaint circles. He gave me a limp smile and took a pull from his bottle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPull up a chair,\u201d he said, \u201cor don\u2019t. S\u2019up to you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where could I start? \u201cSo you\u2019re Buster Brown?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He winced. \u201cAh. I hate that nickname. Call me Arthur. That\u2019s my real name. You\u2019re Mrs. Hughes?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c&lt;em&gt;Ms.&lt;/em&gt;, actually. I\u2019m divorced.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He clicked his tongue. \u201cThat\u2019s how they got ya. Steel Mill laid me off. That\u2019s how they got me. I kept thinking \u2018&lt;em&gt;where else am I going to find someplace this nice?&lt;/em&gt;\u2019 Then it was too late. They dig at you, don\u2019t they? Make you feel worthless?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As odd as it was, this was the most normal conversation I&amp;#39;d had since I&amp;#39;d arrived in town. \u201cYou know what\u2019s happening to my son?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He got sad. \u201cYeah. Nice kid. What\u2019s his name? That little bitch Missy just keeps calling him \u2018new boy\u2019.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHis name is Joshua.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The clown smiled slowly. \u201cHuh. Mine was a J too. Jeremiah. That\u2019s him over there.\u201d He pointed an unsteady finger at the bureau. There was a picture frame made out of glued-together popsicle sticks sitting on top. The boy in the picture had red hair and sticking-out ears, he wore that style of brown-striped shirt that had been popular in the early eighties. The boy grinned mischievously at the camera, showing a missing front tooth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat was taken on his eighth. Before we came to this...place.\u201d The clown knocked back another swig. \u201cSorry if I ramble. I haven\u2019t really  talked to anyone in...god, it\u2019s been years.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to my son?\u201d I asked curtly. He shot me an apologetic look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSorry. You\u2019ve noticed he\u2019s changing, right? How none of the kids around here look right? Like they\u2019ve got some sort of disease?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s this town. Changes people. Hang on\u2014\u201d he grunted as he heaved up from the chair. The clown waddled over to the bureau and opened the top drawer. After a minute of rustling, he tossed two photographs onto the chair where he\u2019d been sitting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHad a hell of a time finding these. They were taken back when the town wasn\u2019t so smart about leaving a record of things.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The top photograph looked to be taken in the 1900\u2019s or so. Whatever era it was still fashionable to photograph corpses being propped upright in their coffins. Five men, five dead men leered drunkenly at the camera. Their noses and lips were heavily swollen, so were their hands and feet. Their skin was so chalky white it made the sockets of their eyes vanish in darkness. Their hair was coarse and frizzy and stood out around their heads in a halo. In some horrible, monstrous way, they looked like\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cClowns?\u201d I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He nodded grimly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second photo was also in black and white, but in much better condition. It was taken at a party of some sort. By the look of the clothing and hairstyles, it was in the fifties. A girl that looked like Missy Jackson minus the ugly stood in the front, wearing a hair bow and a party dress so aggressively ruffled it stood straight out from her waist. Behind her stood a man with an eerily familiar shit-eating grin. His hair was greased back and much darker, and his face was younger, but I could still see it was my welcoming committee Spencer Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked over the photos to the clown. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had sat on the bed, twisting his bottle of cheap liquor. \u201cWell, I&amp;#39;ll tell you what I put together. I might get a few things wrong, so take it as you will. You see what this town does to kids. How it twists \u2018em. I think they used to become like these men, used to grow into these clown-lookin\u2019 things before dying. People in town just accepted it. One in ten kids turns into a clown? Pfft. we can live with that. Then it became one in three. Then it was every single one.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He took another drink to fortify himself. \u201cI think at one point they figured out they couldn\u2019t stop the whole thing, but they could stop it part of it. The thing about this...whatever it is, it makes \u2018em obsessed with fun. They figgered out that if they indulged the hell out of the kids, they wouldn\u2019t molt into these poor bastards. Trouble was the kids just &lt;em&gt;stopped&lt;/em&gt;, period. They don\u2019t age, they don\u2019t grow, and they don\u2019t get any prettier, that\u2019s for damn sure..\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was struggling to take this all in, looking from photograph to photograph. \u201cSo the children used to turn into these...things, but don\u2019t anymore? What happens if you stop indulging them, let them get angry? Do they turn into clowns?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He shook his head. \u201cThey explode.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stared at him for a good long minute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLook, I know this is all a lot to swallow, but trust me. I\u2019ve seen it firsthand. Your son run a lot of fevers these days? That\u2019s part of it. They get real hot and then &lt;em&gt;boom&lt;/em&gt;! Like a meat grenade.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo you have any proof of this?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an answer, he removed his leg below the knee. The clown chuckled a little at my expression. \u201cLittle souvenir from the last time I tried to go against the grain.\u201d He tapped the metal shin rod of his prosthetic leg. \u201cIt was my little Jerry. The only reason I&amp;#39;m still here to talk to you is because of my wife. She was standing in front of me, took the blast full force.\u201d His eyes got all misty. \u201cI got lucky, as funny as that sounds. The older they are, the bigger the boom. Jerry was only here long enough to take out his mom \u2018n me. When someone like Missy Jackson goes off\u2026\u201d he sucked air over his teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just stared at the pictures with a horrible sinking feeling. \u201cHow long were you here when Jerry went off?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThree weeks.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had been in the town for nearly two months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAfter I got out the hospital. They started in on me,\u201d he said, \u201cthey had paid for my stay and now I owed \u2018em. I was already low. Now they picked at me. Said if I had just been a better father, none of it would have happened. They told me I had upset the other kids with what I did, said I needed to fix that\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point I had started shaking with rage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd that\u2019s pretty much it. I\u2019m a living ghost. I can just go into a store and take what I need, any time, and they won\u2019t look twice at me. As long as I keep the kids busy, they don\u2019t care\u201d He took another swig. The bottle was nearly empty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d I said, \u201cif the town\u2019s atmosphere is that dangerous, why do they invite more people in? Why would you want more children if that\u2019s the end result?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He shrugged heavily. \u201cI guess in a sick way they need it. They wanna believe the way they live is the right way, and the best way to prove that is to get more converts.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat makes no logical sense.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot sayin\u2019 they run on logic. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked good and hard at him. \u201cSo if you\u2019ve lived here so long without talking, why tell me now?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot to get too personal, but I like you. You got spunk, I saw that on the first day of school. Been a long time since I&amp;#39;ve seen that here.\u201d He grinned at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As oddly reassuring as that was, I didn\u2019t feel any better after our talk. No, now I was just more aware of how much danger my son was in, and how helpless I was to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI need to find Joshua,\u201d I said, \u201cI have to get him out of here and to a doctor, maybe. Find out what\u2019s wrong with him. Maybe...\u201d &lt;em&gt;maybe fix him&lt;/em&gt; were the words that caught in my throat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gave me a morose look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHasn\u2019t anyone else ever tried it?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere have been others, yeah.\u201d The way he said it let me know exactly how well it went.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t care. My son is all I have left in this world. I\u2019m going to fight for him.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He toasted me with the empty bottle. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I went out the door, he gave me a sweaty handshake. \u201cBest of luck to ya. Give \u2018em one for me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI will, Mr. Brown.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cArthur,\u201d he reminded me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cArthur,\u201d I repeated back, \u201c...you can call me Denise.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBye Denise. It was nice, talkin\u2019 to someone real for once.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201cit was.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I stepped out, I had to ask one last thing: \u201cAt some point, didn\u2019t you stop feeling like you owed them? Why didn\u2019t you leave? You don\u2019t have anything left for them to take away.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gave me a morose look. \u201c...I stay for the kids, Denise. It\u2019s not their fault they\u2019re like this.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside the shack, I could see lights circling the hills surrounding Clanton. Probably search parties. My absence hadn\u2019t gone unmissed. It would be a bad time to strike out on foot. I walked aimlessly through the school grounds, trying in vain to plan an escape. Perhaps I could start a fire as a distraction? I wasn\u2019t too attached to my house anymore\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could hear an excited whispering as I circled the baseball diamond. A cluster of children huddled under the bleachers, I could hear the croaking of some poor tortured animal. With horrible clarity, I could see the back of my son\u2019s head and the shirt I had got him at the Grand Canyon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJoshua,\u201d I called. The children scattered, giggling as they ran. Joshua ran too. Not fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I locked my hand around his upper arm. \u201cJoshua, do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; run from me again.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He twisted in my grip, bratty expression distorting his face. His bone structure was already becoming pronounced in that strange way the town\u2019s children had. His arm burned in my grasp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLet me gooooooo,\u201d he whined, face becoming redder and redder, \u201cI wanna go playyyyyyy.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must say with absolute sincerity that I am not proud of what I did next. I was frightened that my own child was becoming a stranger to me and that I had no power to prevent it. So I grasped at the only tool left to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJoshua,\u201d I said, do you remember daddy?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He stopped moving immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo you remember how he left? How he took all his things out of the house and went away?\u201d I pulled him until he faced me. \u201cI will do that Joshua. I want to protect you, but in order for me to do that you have to listen to me, Joshua. If you don\u2019t listen to me, I have to leave.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His temperature dropped. \u201cMommy don\u2019t leave,\u201d he said in a tiny voice. He hugged me. It felt like years since he\u2019d done that. I didn\u2019t deserve that hug, but I returned it all the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI won\u2019t if I can help it,\u201d I said, petting his hair, \u201cbut we do need to get out of here. This place isn\u2019t really our home, Joshua. It\u2019s like the candy house in Hansel and Gretel. It pretends to be nice but is really mean\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow can we get out?\u201d Josh said into my shirt. \u201cBilly said all the dads in town are looking for you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked up at the searchlights in the hills. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/62wn5k/clowntown_usa_part_1/)\n\n[part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/639cms/clowntown_usa_part_2/)\n\n[part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/63p1ny/clowntown_usa_part_3/)\n\n[part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/643mom/clowntown_usa_part_4/)\n\nI sat on the couch in my living room while my life fell apart around me.

You\u2019ve noticed he\u2019s changing, right? How none of the kids around here look right? Like they\u2019ve got some sort of disease?\u201d\n\nI nodded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this town. Changes people. Hang on\u2014\u201d he grunted as he heaved up from the chair. The clown waddled over to the bureau and opened the top drawer. After a minute of rustling, he tossed two photographs onto the chair where he\u2019d been sitting.\n\n\u201cHad a hell of a time finding these. They were taken back when the town wasn\u2019t so smart about leaving a record of things.\u201d\n\nThe top photograph looked to be taken in the 1900\u2019s or so. Whatever era it was still fashionable to photograph corpses being propped upright in their coffins. Five men, five dead men leered drunkenly at the camera. Their noses and lips were heavily swollen, so were their hands and feet. Their skin was so chalky white it made the sockets of their eyes vanish in darkness. Their hair was coarse and frizzy and stood out around their heads in a halo. In some horrible, monstrous way, they looked like\u2014\n\n\u201cClowns?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe nodded grimly.\n\nThe second photo was also in black and white, but in much better condition. It was taken at a party of some sort. By the look of the clothing and hairstyles, it was in the fifties. A girl that looked like Missy Jackson minus the ugly stood in the front, wearing a hair bow and a party dress so aggressively ruffled it stood straight out from her waist. Behind her stood a man with an eerily familiar shit-eating grin. His hair was greased back and much darker, and his face was younger, but I could still see it was my welcoming committee Spencer Jackson.\n\nI looked over the photos to the clown. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d\n\nHe had sat on the bed, twisting his bottle of cheap liquor. \u201cWell, I'll tell you what I put together. I might get a few things wrong, so take it as you will. You see what this town does to kids. How it twists \u2018em. I think they used to become like these men, used to grow into these clown-lookin\u2019 things before dying. People in town just accepted it. One in ten kids turns into a clown? Pfft. we can live with that. Then it became one in three. Then it was every single one.\u201d\n\nHe took another drink to fortify himself. \u201cI think at one point they figured out they couldn\u2019t stop the whole thing, but they could stop it part of it. The thing about this...whatever it is, it makes \u2018em obsessed with fun. They figgered out that if they indulged the hell out of the kids, they wouldn\u2019t molt into these poor bastards. Trouble was the kids just *stopped*, period. They don\u2019t age, they don\u2019t grow, and they don\u2019t get any prettier, that\u2019s for damn sure..\u201d\n\nI was struggling to take this all in, looking from photograph to photograph. \u201cSo the children used to turn into these...things, but don\u2019t anymore? What happens if you stop indulging them, let them get angry? Do they turn into clowns?\u201d\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cThey explode.\u201d\n\nI stared at him for a good long minute.\n\n\u201cLook, I know this is all a lot to swallow, but trust me. I\u2019ve seen it firsthand. Your son run a lot of fevers these days? That\u2019s part of it. They get real hot and then *boom*! Like a meat grenade.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have any proof of this?\u201d\n\nAs an answer, he removed his leg below the knee. The clown chuckled a little at my expression. \u201cLittle souvenir from the last time I tried to go against the grain.\u201d He tapped the metal shin rod of his prosthetic leg. \u201cIt was my little Jerry. The only reason I'm still here to talk to you is because of my wife. She was standing in front of me, took the blast full force.\u201d His eyes got all misty. \u201cI got lucky, as funny as that sounds. The older they are, the bigger the boom. Jerry was only here long enough to take out his mom \u2018n me. When someone like Missy Jackson goes off\u2026\u201d he sucked air over his teeth.\n\nI just stared at the pictures with a horrible sinking feeling. \u201cHow long were you here when Jerry went off?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree weeks.\u201d\n\nI had been in the town for nearly two months.\n\n\u201cAfter I got out the hospital. They started in on me,\u201d he said, \u201cthey had paid for my stay and now I owed \u2018em. I was already low. Now they picked at me. Said if I had just been a better father, none of it would have happened. They told me I had upset the other kids with what I did, said I needed to fix that\u2026\u201d\n\nAt some point I had started shaking with rage.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s pretty much it. I\u2019m a living ghost. I can just go into a store and take what I need, any time, and they won\u2019t look twice at me. As long as I keep the kids busy, they don\u2019t care\u201d He took another swig. The bottle was nearly empty.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d I said, \u201cif the town\u2019s atmosphere is that dangerous, why do they invite more people in? Why would you want more children if that\u2019s the end result?\u201d\n\nHe shrugged heavily. \u201cI guess in a sick way they need it. They wanna believe the way they live is the right way, and the best way to prove that is to get more converts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat makes no logical sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot sayin\u2019 they run on logic. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d\n\nI looked good and hard at him. \u201cSo if you\u2019ve lived here so long without talking, why tell me now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot to get too personal, but I like you. You got spunk, I saw that on the first day of school. Been a long time since I've seen that here.\u201d He grinned at me. \n\nAs oddly reassuring as that was, I didn\u2019t feel any better after our talk. No, now I was just more aware of how much danger my son was in, and how helpless I was to stop it.\n\n\u201cI need to find Joshua,\u201d I said, \u201cI have to get him out of here and to a doctor, maybe. Find out what\u2019s wrong with him. Maybe...\u201d *maybe fix him* were the words that caught in my throat.\n\nHe gave me a morose look.\n\n\u201cHasn\u2019t anyone else ever tried it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been others, yeah.\u201d The way he said it let me know exactly how well it went.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. My son is all I have left in this world. I\u2019m going to fight for him.\u201d\n\nHe toasted me with the empty bottle. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d\n\nBefore I went out the door, he gave me a sweaty handshake. \u201cBest of luck to ya. Give \u2018em one for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, Mr. Brown.\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur,\u201d he reminded me.\n\n\u201cArthur,\u201d I repeated back, \u201c...you can call me Denise.\u201d\n\n\u201cBye Denise. It was nice, talkin\u2019 to someone real for once.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201cit was.\u201d\n\nBefore I stepped out, I had to ask one last thing: \u201cAt some point, didn\u2019t you stop feeling like you owed them? Why didn\u2019t you leave? You don\u2019t have anything left for them to take away.\u201d\n\nHe gave me a morose look. \u201c...I stay for the kids, Denise. It\u2019s not their fault they\u2019re like this.\u201d\n\nOutside the shack, I could see lights circling the hills surrounding Clanton. Probably search parties. My absence hadn\u2019t gone unmissed. It would be a bad time to strike out on foot. I walked aimlessly through the school grounds, trying in vain to plan an escape. Perhaps I could start a fire as a distraction? I wasn\u2019t too attached to my house anymore\u2026\n\nI could hear an excited whispering as I circled the baseball diamond. A cluster of children huddled under the bleachers, I could hear the croaking of some poor tortured animal. With horrible clarity, I could see the back of my son\u2019s head and the shirt I had got him at the Grand Canyon.\n\n\u201cJoshua,\u201d I called. The children scattered, giggling as they ran. Joshua ran too. Not fast enough.\n\nI locked my hand around his upper arm. \u201cJoshua, do *not* run from me again.\u201d\n\nHe twisted in my grip, bratty expression distorting his face. His bone structure was already becoming pronounced in that strange way the town\u2019s children had. His arm burned in my grasp.\n\n\u201cLet me gooooooo,\u201d he whined, face becoming redder and redder, \u201cI wanna go playyyyyyy.\u201d\n\nI must say with absolute sincerity that I am not proud of what I did next. I was frightened that my own child was becoming a stranger to me and that I had no power to prevent it. So I grasped at the only tool left to me.\n\n\u201cJoshua,\u201d I said, do you remember daddy?\u201d\n\nHe stopped moving immediately.\n\n\u201cDo you remember how he left? How he took all his things out of the house and went away?\u201d I pulled him until he faced me. \u201cI will do that Joshua. I want to protect you, but in order for me to do that you have to listen to me, Joshua. If you don\u2019t listen to me, I have to leave.\u201d\n\nHis temperature dropped. \u201cMommy don\u2019t leave,\u201d he said in a tiny voice. He hugged me. It felt like years since he\u2019d done that. I didn\u2019t deserve that hug, but I returned it all the same.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t if I can help it,\u201d I said, petting his hair, \u201cbut we do need to get out of here. This place isn\u2019t really our home, Joshua. It\u2019s like the candy house in Hansel and Gretel. It pretends to be nice but is really mean\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we get out?\u201d Josh said into my shirt. \u201cBilly said all the dads in town are looking for you.\u201d\n\nI looked up at the searchlights in the hills. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Series", "id": "64mz2u", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 326, "report_reasons": null, "author": "demons_dance_alone", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64mz2u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.nosleep", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "flair-series", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/64mz2u/clowntown_usa_part_5/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491893294.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64mz2u/clowntown_usa_part_5/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Clowntown, USA [part 5]", "created_utc": 1491864494.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 17, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 326}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64mz2u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3fbrj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NoSleepAutoBot", "parent_id": "t3_64mz2u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It looks like there may be more to this story.
