She can be a happy carefree normal child, but one who has more terrifying moments than other, who she almost always shows to me. I just happen to never really see her in her normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to the now, I\u2019m writing this from the hospital. This is going to be a long post so I apologize in advance but fuck so much happened and i feel like i should tell everything for you to really understand what the hell went on in my house the last day&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The night was going fine, just how I left off in my last post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie was in the living room watching that Moana movie (one of Abel\u2019s, and honestly my, favorites so its always in the DVD player) pretty much mining her own business and being fine. She was acting like a normal human being, and a happy child, something I rarely have seen from her. I was doing some work on my computer and watching over her to make sure nothing happened. For about an hour everything was fine. Ellie was laughing at the movie, rewinding and fast forwarding around watching parts over and over. I was getting my work done and for a moment it seemed like everything was normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she went back to the part where Moana and Maui are going back and forth about the Demi God on the beach, but instead of having a little argument the two characters were standing side by side and staring at the screen like they could see the person watching. Blank faces, just standing there still. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou have to do it\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My head shot up and saw that Moana was talking, and Ellie had walked up to the TV and sat right in front of it, only a few inches away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie: I can\u2019t do it &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The screen started glitching, distorting the characters on the screen, flashing red green until it went to static and the outline of a black figure was on the screen. I stood up from behind the table and stared in shock. I could hear Ellie start to cry as she talked whatever was on the TV&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie: I dont want to do it, Ty please dont make me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ty: You have no choice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie: Ty plea-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ty: YOU HAVE NO CHOICE! YOU HAVE NO CHOICE! YOU HAVE NO CHOICE!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right as the TV started screaming the lights started to flicker before shutting off completely. I almost fell over I was so scared, but just as they turned off they turned back on and Ellie wasn&amp;#39;t in the living room anymore. The house was completely silent until I heard footsteps run up the stairs and a loud giggle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except this could not be caused by an 8 year old tiny little girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The footsteps were loud and heavy and I could hear them running down the hall. You cant even hear that when Cadie walks upstairs or any other adult- let alone a CHILD. And god that laugh\u2026 that fucking laugh. It was deep and rough, and sounded like it was taunting me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCOME FIND ME\u201d the same deep, twisted voice echoed before a loud BOOM erupted from upstairs, the force of it sending me falling down on my ass. My ears hurt, like they popped and the whole atmosphere felt weird, like it was slowed down and surreal. A feeling I cant explain and have never felt before. Moments after my cell phone dinged. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked my phone, it was from the same number that had called me to tell me about the incident, Sherrie. All it said was \u201cHelp her, you can stop it\u201d and nothing else. I tried to call it but all I got was \u201cThe number you are trying to reach is not in service\u201d. I tried to text it back, asking what it meant but the message failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can stop it. Stop what? That meant I had to go UPSTAIRS with whatever the hell had just made that noise. Going upstairs ALONE was the last fucking thing I wanted to do. I reached for my phone and tried to call the police but it now said NO SERVICE. Now I\u2019ve read enough scary stories and watched enough horror movies to know what was next. I reached for landline, and of course there was no service at all. Of fucking course. So I did the only thing my mind found practical instead of hauling tail out of the house, and grabbed the gun from my safe in my bedroom, because a few things were now clear to me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1- Ellie was NOT evil\n2- Whoever the fuck Ty is WAS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and 3-He was possessing Ellie and making her do these evil things&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my gun and I painfully scaled the stairs and immediately it was like a scene from a horror movie. Now Im going to describe this the best I can, but its hard. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to honestly because I can\u2019t even make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hallway looked like it always did, except it was completely different in a few ways. It seemed longer and deadly still, like everything was in HD but slow motion at the same time. It was too dark. For not even being completely dark outside, the hall way was a dark blue and almost glowing. All the bedroom doors were swinging open and closed in slow motion and I could hear this low deep growl coming from the last bedroom in the hall, Ellie\u2019s bedroom.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I raised my gun and cocked it, pointed and was ready for anything. My heart was beating so fast I almost thought I would have a heart attack before I reached the door, but once I was in the doorway I really thought I was going to die. I dropped to the ground and hid behind the door frame, poking my head just past so I could see into the room&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything in the room was floating. Her lamps, her pillows, the toys on the ground, hell even the bed was a good foot in the air, and all vibrating slowly around the figure that was hunched over in the center of the room. The flickering of the lights made it hard to make out what the figure was, but little by little the lights got brighter and brighter&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hunched over was this thing, I&amp;#39;m still not sure what it was. It looked like a human, shaped like on at least. Two arms, two legs, torso a neck with a head on top, you know the general human body make up. Its skin was a saggy dark yellow with patches of flesh that had been rotted away, oozing with a thick yellow pus that dripped down. Covered in patchy hair all over its body, it was completely naked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the most disturbing part of it all was the tail. God that tail, long and badly burned, it had bubbles of pus all over it. Every time the thing moved a chunk of flesh would come off, exposing the bone, and the puddle of pus would get bigger on the floor making me want to vomit right then and there. A sinister laugh started erupting from the creature, this time a high pitched males voice on loop getting louder and louder each time. It wasn\u2019t until now that I realized the thing was crouching over a body. A small girls body with long blonde hair. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her eyes were shut and she was still, like she was dead. There was a huge hole in her stomach from the claws of this thing digging into her making the hole bigger and bigger. Just as I raised my gun an pointed it at the thing again it screeched in cheer, throwing its boney arms around and laughing like a mad man before burrowing its face into her stomach and pushing its body down into it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It struggled for a few seconds, then I realized what it was doing. It was climbing into her body. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A shoulder went in, then the next, and soon almost the entire body was almost inside of Ellie before I finally had the courage to do something.  A single leg was left out when I ran into the room and grabbed onto the leg hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right as I made contact a deafening screech was heard and the room started shaking. The leg started shaking back and forth, flesh started to fall off in my hands but I kept pulling. I was not going to let it hurt this child again. Little by little it started to come back out, covered in blood, almost all of its skin was completely off now. It stopped resisting and sent me falling back, landing hard on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched as it pulled its self back out of Ellie and turned to face me, the first time I had seen it\u2019s face. It looked like nothing I had ever seen and will ever see again. The eyes were an unnaturally solid white, it\u2019s nose was a gaping hole that oozed a black liquid every time the thing breathed, the mouth looked like it had been cut into it\u2019s face with a jagged knife. There were no teeth, just rotted bloody gums and a long black tongue. Horrified I tried crawl backwards but the thing latched onto my ankle, looking me dead in the eye. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I raised my gun and aimed it at it\u2019s head, firing off two bullets into its forehead. The thing doubled over, landing hard on its back. It started making a horrible grunting noise then proceeded to jump forward landing on top of me. It\u2019s claws dug deep into my left thigh, making me scream in pain like I\u2019ve never screamed before. I could feel the claws digging inside me, the same way they were digging into Ellie. I fired another bullet into it\u2019s stomach, making it weaken up enough for me to roll out from under it and get up, running to the other side of the room&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It stood up on its legs, legs that were obviously not made for walking. One was a good foot longer than the other, both badly broken and jolting in different directions. It started growling and the whole house started to shake. It cracked its neck and stated to walk towards me slowly then went to pounce on me, but was too late. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled the trigger, sending another bullet into its forehead. I kept pulling the trigger until it was out of bullets and the thing was laying on its back, eyes shut on the floor. Right as it hit the ground the lights cut back on and everything in the room dropped back to the ground, a loud boom sending me to the ground covering my ears. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, like I said, I\u2019ve watched my fair share of horror movies, and I know that half the time that when things \u201cdie\u201d they usually come back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked over to Ellie\u2019s bed and broke off a part of her beds headboard, a long wooden stake looking piece of wood, and walked over to the thing. I stabbed the stake into it\u2019s chest, its eyes opening wide, revealing it\u2019s real eyes, a lovely blue color. The same color as Ellie\u2019s. It groaned and fidgeted around under my weight, but I proceeded to stab it over and over until it\u2019s eyes rolled back and all the color left it\u2019s body. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the night was a whirlwind, and I\u2019m still trying to make sense of everything. Right as I got up off of the thing I went to phone the medic. Just before I got out of the room the things body erupted into flames. It burned for a few minutes, turning into ash before the fire went out. Nothing was left of the creature except the holes in my thigh to prove it was ever here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie was still laying on the floor, the hole in her stomach was gone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The medics got there quickly and I really didn\u2019t know what to tell them. They took my to the hospital since I had lost a lot of blood and decided they wanted to keep me over night to monitor the wounds for infection, and also because of something with my heart rate. Just to be safe, and honestly I didn\u2019t want to go back home for the night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie and I bonded last night. The nurse brought her in once I was bandaged up and she ran to me, wrapping her tiny arms around me and started to cry. The nurses left us and I pulled away and asked her if she knew what had happened &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie: you got rid of Ty, didnt you&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I guess I did. Was that thing Ty?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She nodded&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Was Ty the one making you do all the bad things Ellie?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie: Ty never let me have a say he always just took over&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: You don\u2019t have to worry about that anymore&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We bonded last night, as she slept in my hospital room. For the first time since we\u2019ve had her she opened up to me and now everything feels so different with her. She feels like a child who just needs someone, instead of a child you need to get rid of. We stayed up talking for almost two hours, not breaking conversation once and I found out a lot about her, and a lot of my questions were answered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie told me a little more about Ty, but couldn&amp;#39;t really explain it. As long as she can remember, she&amp;#39;s had an imaginary friend named Ty who has always threatened to take over if she doesn&amp;#39;t listen to what he says. Usually he didn\u2019t make her do anything too bad, just small things. Stealing, lying, running away, setting fires to abandoned places.. petty crime things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except once she came to us his requests got worse. At first it was things she could ignore or do, stealing money from Cadie. Dropping glasses on the floor and breaking them, bad thing but nothing that caused harm to others. Then he wanted her to hurt Able, and when she wouldn\u2019t he took over. He wanted her to hurt kids at day care, and when she begged him not too, he took over. She said he had never took over until she came to us, and that each time he took over it was different, but he had to inhabit her body. She never remembered what happened when he took over, and never knew how many times he took over her, but she thinks he would do it every night because she never had dreams, and she always use to have dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I asked her why he started to take over now, her answer was that when she met us she no longer needed Ty. She didnt need an imaginary friend because she felt like she had found a family. And this made Ty angry. She didnt want to talk much about him, but she told me that she doesn&amp;#39;t remember how Ty came into her life, except that she had met him outside at night. Who he is, what he is, she can\u2019t remember. Maybe one day we will know, or she will remember and we will have more answers. But all we know is that he is gone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman who had brought her, Angelica Rorro, to us was her aunt. Ellie said she was a mean woman who didn\u2019t want the burden of taking care of a child. She said she would always blame Ellie for the death of her sister, Ellie\u2019s mom, and tried to get rid of her multiple times. Dropped her off in the middle of the city on her own when Ellie was 6, tried to drown her in a pond at age 4, broke her arm and collar bone when she was 7, the list goes on. She never sent her to school, and made her stay inside during the day so no other kids could play with her. She was only allowed to go out at night, which is how she met Ty in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally she came up with a plan that would insure that Ellie never got back to her. Ellie said she had broken into a foster care agency and looked at the families registered, where she had found my families name. She read about how we had previously foster 2 and adopted one, and figured we wouldn&amp;#39;t mind taking in another. She gave her a fake name (for her sake I will not put her real name here) and told her if she ever told us the truth or told the police that she would make sure that the entire family she put her with would be killed. Lucky for her she picked us and not another family for Ellie\u2019s sake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know how to make sense of it all. It doesn\u2019t make sense. Except for one thing. Just before Ellie fell asleep in my arms, we were talking about her mom. She doesn&amp;#39;t remember her at all, since she was born the day her mom died, but has been reminded of her mothers death her whole life by her Aunt. Blamed for it. I asked her what her moms name was, just out of pure curiosity, and Ellie replied with \u201cSherrie\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not religious by any means, but I fully believe that the same number who had texted me and called me about Ellie, who said her name was Sherrie, was the spirit of Ellie&amp;#39;s mom. Maybe serving as a guardian angel of some sorts, trying to get me to get to the scene before things happened to save her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dont know. Its all confusing, but its what it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadie and Abel are still going to stay in Perth for a few days, and Ellie and I are going to go join them later tonight. I booked our flights and I think we might actually move out there, get away from that house and Sydney for a while. Thank you all for being here for me during this. I\u2019m sorry if this is confusing as I\u2019m pretty drugged up right now and generally confused as it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I know is that this little girl is safe, my family is safe, and thats all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a daughter now, and I have to go back to being a dad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64lio5/i_think_there_is_something_wrong_with_our_foster/\n\n2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64v9q5/i_think_there_is_something_wrong_with_our_foster/\n\n3: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/652wua/i_think_there_is_something_wrong_with_our_foster/\n\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for the delayed update, but once i explain what has happened the last few days I know you guys will understand.\n\n\nOne thing I want to clear up that I feel like I havent mentioned: Ellie isn\u2019t always the creepy fuck i find her to be.

Horrified I tried crawl backwards but the thing latched onto my ankle, looking me dead in the eye. \n\n\nI raised my gun and aimed it at it\u2019s head, firing off two bullets into its forehead. The thing doubled over, landing hard on its back. It started making a horrible grunting noise then proceeded to jump forward landing on top of me. It\u2019s claws dug deep into my left thigh, making me scream in pain like I\u2019ve never screamed before. I could feel the claws digging inside me, the same way they were digging into Ellie. I fired another bullet into it\u2019s stomach, making it weaken up enough for me to roll out from under it and get up, running to the other side of the room\n\n\nIt stood up on its legs, legs that were obviously not made for walking. One was a good foot longer than the other, both badly broken and jolting in different directions. It started growling and the whole house started to shake. It cracked its neck and stated to walk towards me slowly then went to pounce on me, but was too late. \n\n\nI pulled the trigger, sending another bullet into its forehead. I kept pulling the trigger until it was out of bullets and the thing was laying on its back, eyes shut on the floor. Right as it hit the ground the lights cut back on and everything in the room dropped back to the ground, a loud boom sending me to the ground covering my ears. \n\n\nNow, like I said, I\u2019ve watched my fair share of horror movies, and I know that half the time that when things \u201cdie\u201d they usually come back. \n\n\nI walked over to Ellie\u2019s bed and broke off a part of her beds headboard, a long wooden stake looking piece of wood, and walked over to the thing. I stabbed the stake into it\u2019s chest, its eyes opening wide, revealing it\u2019s real eyes, a lovely blue color. The same color as Ellie\u2019s. It groaned and fidgeted around under my weight, but I proceeded to stab it over and over until it\u2019s eyes rolled back and all the color left it\u2019s body. \n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nThe rest of the night was a whirlwind, and I\u2019m still trying to make sense of everything. Right as I got up off of the thing I went to phone the medic. Just before I got out of the room the things body erupted into flames. It burned for a few minutes, turning into ash before the fire went out. Nothing was left of the creature except the holes in my thigh to prove it was ever here. \n\n\nEllie was still laying on the floor, the hole in her stomach was gone. \n\n\nThe medics got there quickly and I really didn\u2019t know what to tell them. They took my to the hospital since I had lost a lot of blood and decided they wanted to keep me over night to monitor the wounds for infection, and also because of something with my heart rate. Just to be safe, and honestly I didn\u2019t want to go back home for the night. \n\n\nEllie and I bonded last night. The nurse brought her in once I was bandaged up and she ran to me, wrapping her tiny arms around me and started to cry. The nurses left us and I pulled away and asked her if she knew what had happened \n\n\nEllie: you got rid of Ty, didnt you\n\n\nMe: I guess I did. Was that thing Ty?\n\n\nShe nodded\n\n\nMe: Was Ty the one making you do all the bad things Ellie?\n\n\nEllie: Ty never let me have a say he always just took over\n\n\nMe: You don\u2019t have to worry about that anymore\n\n\n\nWe bonded last night, as she slept in my hospital room. For the first time since we\u2019ve had her she opened up to me and now everything feels so different with her. She feels like a child who just needs someone, instead of a child you need to get rid of. We stayed up talking for almost two hours, not breaking conversation once and I found out a lot about her, and a lot of my questions were answered. \n\nEllie told me a little more about Ty, but couldn't really explain it. As long as she can remember, she's had an imaginary friend named Ty who has always threatened to take over if she doesn't listen to what he says. Usually he didn\u2019t make her do anything too bad, just small things. Stealing, lying, running away, setting fires to abandoned places.. petty crime things. \n\nExcept once she came to us his requests got worse. At first it was things she could ignore or do, stealing money from Cadie. Dropping glasses on the floor and breaking them, bad thing but nothing that caused harm to others. Then he wanted her to hurt Able, and when she wouldn\u2019t he took over. He wanted her to hurt kids at day care, and when she begged him not too, he took over. She said he had never took over until she came to us, and that each time he took over it was different, but he had to inhabit her body. She never remembered what happened when he took over, and never knew how many times he took over her, but she thinks he would do it every night because she never had dreams, and she always use to have dreams.\n\nWhen I asked her why he started to take over now, her answer was that when she met us she no longer needed Ty. She didnt need an imaginary friend because she felt like she had found a family. And this made Ty angry. She didnt want to talk much about him, but she told me that she doesn't remember how Ty came into her life, except that she had met him outside at night. Who he is, what he is, she can\u2019t remember. Maybe one day we will know, or she will remember and we will have more answers. But all we know is that he is gone. \n\n\nThe woman who had brought her, Angelica Rorro, to us was her aunt. Ellie said she was a mean woman who didn\u2019t want the burden of taking care of a child. She said she would always blame Ellie for the death of her sister, Ellie\u2019s mom, and tried to get rid of her multiple times. Dropped her off in the middle of the city on her own when Ellie was 6, tried to drown her in a pond at age 4, broke her arm and collar bone when she was 7, the list goes on. She never sent her to school, and made her stay inside during the day so no other kids could play with her. She was only allowed to go out at night, which is how she met Ty in the first place.\n\n\nFinally she came up with a plan that would insure that Ellie never got back to her. Ellie said she had broken into a foster care agency and looked at the families registered, where she had found my families name. She read about how we had previously foster 2 and adopted one, and figured we wouldn't mind taking in another. She gave her a fake name (for her sake I will not put her real name here) and told her if she ever told us the truth or told the police that she would make sure that the entire family she put her with would be killed. Lucky for her she picked us and not another family for Ellie\u2019s sake.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know how to make sense of it all. It doesn\u2019t make sense. Except for one thing. Just before Ellie fell asleep in my arms, we were talking about her mom. She doesn't remember her at all, since she was born the day her mom died, but has been reminded of her mothers death her whole life by her Aunt. Blamed for it. I asked her what her moms name was, just out of pure curiosity, and Ellie replied with \u201cSherrie\u201d \n\n\nI\u2019m not religious by any means, but I fully believe that the same number who had texted me and called me about Ellie, who said her name was Sherrie, was the spirit of Ellie's mom. Maybe serving as a guardian angel of some sorts, trying to get me to get to the scene before things happened to save her daughter.\n\n\nI dont know. Its all confusing, but its what it is.\n\n\nCadie and Abel are still going to stay in Perth for a few days, and Ellie and I are going to go join them later tonight. I booked our flights and I think we might actually move out there, get away from that house and Sydney for a while. Thank you all for being here for me during this. I\u2019m sorry if this is confusing as I\u2019m pretty drugged up right now and generally confused as it is.\n\n\nAll I know is that this little girl is safe, my family is safe, and thats all that matters.\n\n\nI have a daughter now, and I have to go back to being a dad.\n\n\nThank you.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "65li6c", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 265, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ex202", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65li6c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.nosleep", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "edited": 1492353688.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/65li6c/i_think_there_is_something_wrong_with_our_foster/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492320020.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65li6c/i_think_there_is_something_wrong_with_our_foster/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "I think there is something wrong with our foster child FINAL", "created_utc": 1492291220.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 30, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 265}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65li6c", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65li6c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbebhp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ex202", "parent_id": "t1_dgbd0ul", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "thank u!!!!!!!!!!
