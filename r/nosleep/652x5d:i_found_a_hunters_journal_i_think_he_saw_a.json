I can&amp;#39;t find the words for how I know, but my gut always screams that it isn&amp;#39;t right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been out here for two days now, and I heard it the first time yesterday. It&amp;#39;s why I am not in my truck right now. I came about four miles deeper into these woods looking for whoever needed help. I am going to make coffee and just wait out the night tonight. I can&amp;#39;t sleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/After about three cups of coffee and most of my cigs, I have the words for what&amp;#39;s wrong with this situation.

I thought it was a hiker, camper or whatever. Someone who needed my help. I started going for them pretty quick without a second thought. They sounded far, or maybe behind a big rock/small hill. I began calling back, but they only ever said the exact. Same. Thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey!

I thought about myself in this situation and that was all it took to keep me looking. I even fired a round to help draw some attention. They still called out the exact same way. It&amp;#39;s like someone is drawing me deeper into the woods with a voice recording and now I&amp;#39;m out here for the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/Update: I ended up nodding off. I woke up somewhere else, but everything is the same. I will take pictures, but I don&amp;#39;t think it will help without the old camp to reference.

It&amp;#39;s been a few hours and I have been going directly towards my truck. I saw tracks that I can&amp;#39;t identify. Took pictures.

I didn&amp;#39;t sleep, but it wasn&amp;#39;t hard to stay awake this time. I&amp;#39;m certain someone is fucking with me. The calls for help got closer. I saw someone running. They looked like they were wearing a bunch of weird clothes. I shot at them. Going to eat and start running. The fire can keep burning.

It couldn&amp;#39;t have been real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got to my truck, finally. It was at least ten miles from where I guesstimated and I don&amp;#39;t know how I got that far off the mark. Maybe I&amp;#39;m bad at navigation, but I&amp;#39;m not fast enough to wind up so deep in the woods without thinking about it. I think it must be to do with that night I passed out. I don&amp;#39;t understand how I ended up in a different location. But that isn&amp;#39;t the most fucked up part. No.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The voice followed me the entire time. It added more words though. My words. I can&amp;#39;t explain it, but it was my voice. It was what I was calling out when I was looking for it the first day.

I&amp;#39;ve looked around online for pictures of sick animals in case maybe that&amp;#39;s what I saw, but I know I&amp;#39;m fooling myself. It was a nightmare. Every time I try to describe it I become more unsure of myself. It was tall, it walked funny and it was thin. That much I can always describe. I never saw it and heard it at the same time.
