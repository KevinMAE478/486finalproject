The owner, Robert, just another typical grease monkey. In reality though, there was much more to the shop and its owner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most interesting fact about Robert was that he could fix anything. I don&amp;#39;t remember when it started, but one day the people in my hometown found out that Robert was not just a typical mechanic, but more of a jack of all trades. It made no difference to him if it was a car, a toy, household appliances or electronic devices. Good old Robert would fix it. Something broke or was damaged? You brought it to Robert&amp;#39;s Repairs and it was as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a person too, Robert was extremely interesting. I remember that the first time I ever talked to him was when I got my bike back. The chain and the gears had all been entangled and damaged, so my parents brought it over to Robert. He told us to be back in a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was completely fixed when I came back to the shop. He told me to be more careful in handling the gears and that I should make sure to keep them sufficiently greased and oiled so it wouldn&amp;#39;t happen again. I thanked him and before I left I asked him how he was able to fix all those things that people brought over. I had been interested in machines and mechanisms ever since I was little, so you could say that because of all the stories, Robert had become a sort of role model to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is simple.&amp;quot; he started to explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Every mechanism, machine or tool is made up of parts. Like this clock, see?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He picked up a small clock he had found lying on his workbench.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter what it is. The bigger and more complex it is, the more parts there are, sure, but in the end it is always the same principle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What you do is that you disassemble it into all its parts.&amp;quot; With that he opened the back of the clock to reveal the inner workings and started to take out the various gears, springs and other parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then you just have to find out which of them are broken, damaged or cause problems. Like this one here in case of this clock.&amp;quot; he held up a weirdly deformed spring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now you just have to fix it or replace it and put it back together.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While Robert replaced the spring with a new one and carefully put the clock back together, I just stood there dumbfounded.\nFor the nine year old me it was as if I had just found the Holy Grail. The biggest secret in the whole wide world had been revealed to me. Robert must have noticed, because he started to laugh. \nI am sure I must have stood there, mouth wide agape, not saying anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From this day onward I spent a lot of time at Robert&amp;#39;s shop. My parents knew and were happy about it. I had found a new hobby and hopefully I&amp;#39;d be able to learn a thing or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quickly grew to like Robert and soon found out that he not only knew a lot about mechanics, but also a variety of other topics. When he didn&amp;#39;t have to fix anything, he&amp;#39;d teach me about science or he&amp;#39;d tell me things from history. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He even gave me a couple of his old books. They were mostly on math, but there were some on science and electronics as well. I loved that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert was the smartest guy in the world to me. My opinion of him would get even higher though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day a little boy with his pet came over to Robert&amp;#39;s shop. He was crying and said his kitty was sick and hurt and he had no idea what to do or where to go. Robert, the good guy he was, nodded and told the boy everything would be alright. He&amp;#39;d take care of everything and the boy should come back in a few days. It was exactly what he had told me when I had brought over my bike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you going to do with it?&amp;quot; I asked Robert once the boy was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you going to bring it to the hospital or call the animal doctor?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert just laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No need for that.&amp;quot; He said in his ever happy and euphoric way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing I can&amp;#39;t take care of myself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you mean, Robert?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stared at him wondering what he was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Remember what I told you before? That everything is made up of parts?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, it is the same with animals too. They are just big, organic machines. You just find the parts that are broken, fix them and they&amp;#39;ll be fine again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But that is not how animals work!&amp;quot; I said in protest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We shall see about that, shall we?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that he carefully took the hurt little cat in his hands and walked towards a door at the back of his shop. I started to follow him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now hold on a second Mark, will you?&amp;quot; He said to me as he vanished behind the door. A few moments later he was back, but without the cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What did you do with it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I just put it somewhere save. Can&amp;#39;t have the little guy in here with all the grease and dirt around, can we?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s behind the door?&amp;quot; I asked him and went forward to open it and see for myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert put his arm in front of me. &amp;quot;Sorry, but that&amp;#39;s top secret.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pouted and complained for quite a while, but Robert didn&amp;#39;t give in. In the end I spend the rest of the afternoon helping him repair an old TV set and afterwards made my way home. On the way I was thinking about what he had told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That same evening during dinner I asked my parents how you&amp;#39;d fix animals. They simply laughed and soon changed the topic to something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I went to Robert&amp;#39;s shop again a few days later, I couldn&amp;#39;t believe my eyes. Right at the front porch was a little kitty, sleeping and purring, not a worry in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recognized it right away as the one that the little boy had brought over the other day. I went closer to it and carefully started to pet it. It opened its eyes, looked at me and then rubbed his little head against my hand. The kitty was perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert saw me playing with it and gave me a thumps-up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good as new.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How did you do it, Robert?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Exactly as I told you. Simply fixed the broken parts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made a sour face at his simple answer, but Robert just ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the little boy came over he was overjoyed. He started to cry tears of joy when he saw his little friend was alright. His parents who accompanied him thanked Robert for saving the cat. Robert simply smiled and nodded. It was from this day onwards that people would not only bring all sorts of items and appliances to Robert, but also their sick pets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently Robert could really fix anything. A cat with broken legs? She&amp;#39;d be fine a few days later. A limping dog? Same thing. A dying hamster? He&amp;#39;d be fit and full of life again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During this time I was at the store even more often than before. There&amp;#39;d always be animals around to play with. It was only the healthy ones though, the ones that Robert had already &amp;#39;fixed&amp;#39;, as he used to say. All the other ones were kept in what Robert now called the &amp;#39;top-secret-room&amp;#39;. I had no idea what exactly he did with them in there or how he went about fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thought of how Robert was doing all the things he did stayed on my young mind for quite some time. More than once did I try to sneak into the room, but I either found the door locked or was caught by Robert. In time though I accepted it as the way things were supposed to be. Maybe Robert had a secret medicine that no one else knew off?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My doubts about Robert were reawaken in the middle of summer break. It was then that Robert did something that even I, as a kid, knew to be completely and utterly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a normal Saturday afternoon and I spend it at Robert&amp;#39;s shop as usual. I was playing with a cat and waiting for Robert to fix up an old bike. He had promised to teach me a few more things about electronics once he would be done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My attention was drawn from the cat to a car that suddenly arrived and came to a stop with squeaking tires. A crying woman jumped out of the passenger seat, followed by a man on the driver&amp;#39;s seat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman came running over towards Robert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have to save her!&amp;quot; she cried, tears streaming down her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert walked towards her, his expression instantly serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What happened?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman continued to talk to him, but I couldn&amp;#39;t make out all of it. I heard the words accident and car and then she was pleading him over and over again to save her and to &amp;#39;do it again&amp;#39;. I didn&amp;#39;t understand what she was talking about. Robert motioned her to be quiet and hurried over to the man who brought out the limp body of a little girl from the backseat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She was hit about ten minutes ago.&amp;quot; I heard the man say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was so much blood. It was everywhere. I was shocked and looked on wide-eyed. The arms and legs were dangling from her body. She wasn&amp;#39;t moving at all. When I saw her face for a moment, the eyes were completely empty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Go home for today Mark, I teach you another day.&amp;quot; he said to me as he motioned for the father to bring the girl inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t understand what was going on. Why did they bring the girl to Robert? I wanted to stay and started to follow them inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert noticed me after a few moments and for the first time ever he seemed to be mad at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I told you to go home, Mark.&amp;quot; he yelled at me. It was the first time I had heard him like that. His voice had changed and was loud and serious, even a little scary. I left right away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t understand how he&amp;#39;d do it, but I already knew what was going to happen. The girl had been hurt and her parents had brought her over, so Robert could fix her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I told myself it was stupid. They were there to call a hospital or a doctor. Animals were one thing, but humans are different, right? When I got home I told my parents what had happened, but they simply nodded and didn&amp;#39;t say much. They probably didn&amp;#39;t believe me or didn&amp;#39;t really understand what I was talking about. I must have been way too agitated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I later heard the whole story of what happened that day. The little girl was named Margaret Miller and was eleven years old. She had dropped something while crossing the main street with her parents and ran back without watching. The driver of an oncoming car had no chance to stop in time and she was run over. The people who saw it said it was a terrible accident and everyone was sure that the girl had died instantly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when the parents took her and brought her over to Robert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My skin started to crawl when I went over to Robert&amp;#39;s shop the next time. At first I wasn&amp;#39;t sure, but soon there was no mistaking it. A little girl was sitting on the bench in front of the store, smiling happily at me as I came closer. I stared at her wide eyed for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who are you? Are you Robert&amp;#39;s daughter?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hi! My name is Margaret.&amp;quot; she answered with a big smile and held her hand out to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I shock her hand, I remembered the name. It was the same name as that of the little girl that had been hit by the car. What was this? I stammered something, unsure what to say. Before I spoke again, I was called over by Robert who had seen me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mark, this is important, don&amp;#39;t talk to her about anything you saw the other day, alright?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is too early for her to remember something as scary as the accident.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded, but I felt as if this wasn&amp;#39;t the real reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What did you do to her? Did you cure her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or fix her, I thought, as he always referred to it for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How did you do it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert smiled and he gave me the same answer he had given me so many times before:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You simply have to find the parts that are broken and fix them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I exploded at him. I had enough. Even at my age I knew things weren&amp;#39;t as easy as he made them out to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But that is not how it works! You can&amp;#39;t bring someone back to life by fixing their parts.&amp;quot; I yelled at him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert&amp;#39;s face changed to a soft and somewhat sad smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You are right Mark, sometimes there is no easy way to fix things. Sometimes you have to replace all the parts that are irreparable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t really understand what he was talking about at that time. Was he still talking about humans? Or was he talking about machines again. I was puzzled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is like with this,&amp;quot; he turned away from me to find something to explain things to me. That&amp;#39;s when I saw my chance. I started to run for the door at the end of the shop. I pressed the handle and with a loud noise, that surprised even me, it opened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mark, what are you&amp;quot; I heard Robert call out to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came to a halt right away. I had no idea what I was seeing. To this day I don&amp;#39;t know what the place I saw back then was exactly. I saw futuristic machines and test tubes, various glass tanks and containers, cabinets and computers, and innumerable cables connecting it all together. The room stood in stark contrast to the rest of Robert&amp;#39;s shop. Everything else was dirty, greasy and old. This room here was new and clean, almost sterile. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the room was a large table. Something was laying on it, covered by a large sheet of white cloth. I don&amp;#39;t know why, but went forward and pulled. I saw a small white arm, then a shoulder and finally a face. A female face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was right at that point that Robert reached me, pulled me away and quickly pushed me out of the room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was yelling at me but I didn&amp;#39;t hear anything. I only saw it for a moment, but I knew whose face I had seen there. Once I had gathered myself I confronted Robert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why is she back there? She is outside, isn&amp;#39;t she?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert&amp;#39;s expression changed again. The anger went away and now his face showed a sad expression again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you do when something is broken beyond repair?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t know. I couldn&amp;#39;t even think about an answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In that case,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;you have to replace the whole thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was this statement that freaked me out more than anything, because I knew what he was implying. That little girl outside wasn\u2019t really Margaret Miller, but a replacement. Robert didn&amp;#39;t say anything else, or even tried to stop me as I walked outside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw the little girl again. She was still where she had been when I arrived. Her friendly, but empty smile haunted me for the rest of summer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that day, I never went back to Robert&amp;#39;s Repairs again. The place was wrong. Unnatural. I never found out what Robert exactly did, but I knew it was not normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This summer is now more than ten years ago. I heard a lot more about Robert&amp;#39;s ordeals and antics throughout the years. There were other stories about more people he fixed. It was all just so weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, Robert never did anything wrong to anyone, but somehow I knew that what he was doing was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before you ask, yes, I told my parents about what I saw, but they mostly shrugged it off. They simply didn&amp;#39;t believe me and said I shouldn&amp;#39;t make up stories like that. However long I pleaded to them and assured them that it was true, the more they ignored me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was right after I finished high school that I left the town and Robert&amp;#39;s Repairs behind. I just couldn&amp;#39;t stay there anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am in a bigger city now and I am going to college. I am majoring in the STEM field, which I hate to admit is due to Robert&amp;#39;s influence on me as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently visited my parents. We talked a lot about old memories and went through a couple of photo albums of my middle and high school times. It made me feel quite nostalgic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later that evening, after my parents had already gone to bed, I decided I&amp;#39;d have a look at a couple of the older albums. I remembered that my parents pretty much had created an album for every year of my life. The first thing I noticed was that one of the albums was noticeably thinner than the rest. I was eight years old at the time. I looked through it and noticed that it went from melting snow and early spring right to pictures of autumn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I asked my mother about the album and where the pictures of my birthday were. She told me I had been very sick that year and had stayed at the hospital for some time. Her eyes betrayed her. She was never good at lying and I noticed it right away. Even after calling her out on it, she insisted on it being true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to think back. Had I ever stayed at a hospital? I couldn&amp;#39;t remember anything like it. I thought back to my school days. I would have been in second grade back then. For some reason though, I couldn&amp;#39;t pinpoint much about this time. Or anything before it, for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had seen the albums filled with pictures of me in kindergarten, starting school and first grade, but even when I tried my hardest, I couldn&amp;#39;t recall anything about it. It was as if all my memories before second grad were missing. I tried as hard as I could. Had I suffered from a concussion and lost all my memory?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly something came back to me. A smell of oil and grease, the sound of machines and tools. There it was. The memory of sitting on a bench and my parents running towards me and hugging me. What were those images? Was it at the hospital? If so, why was I outside?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it hit me. The grease. The oil. The bench I was sitting on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as the little girl who had been sitting on the bench in front of Robert&amp;#39;s shop. It was the same imagine. Only that I saw it through my eyes. I had been sitting there too, on the same bench, waiting as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was shaking now, because I understood. This must have been when I was in second grade. Almost a year before I had been visiting Robert regularly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long before Robert had fixed that little girl, he had fixed me too. That&amp;#39;s why the mother of the little girl had been pleading him to do it again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had been fixed by Robert as well. The only question was:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What exactly did he &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/r.rehnwriter/\"&gt;do to me...?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "If you'd see Robert's Repairs you'd most likely just think of it as a simple, small town repair shop. The owner, Robert, just another typical grease monkey. In reality though, there was much more to the shop and its owner.\n\nThe most interesting fact about Robert was that he could fix anything.

It was exactly what he had told me when I had brought over my bike.\n\n\"What are you going to do with it?\" I asked Robert once the boy was gone.\n\n\"Are you going to bring it to the hospital or call the animal doctor?\"\n\nRobert just laughed.\n\n\"No need for that.\" He said in his ever happy and euphoric way.\n\n\"Nothing I can't take care of myself.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Robert?\"\n\nI stared at him wondering what he was talking about.\n\n\"Remember what I told you before? That everything is made up of parts?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Well, it is the same with animals too. They are just big, organic machines.

I started to follow him.\n\n\"Now hold on a second Mark, will you?\" He said to me as he vanished behind the door. A few moments later he was back, but without the cat.\n\n\"What did you do with it?\"\n\n\"I just put it somewhere save. Can't have the little guy in here with all the grease and dirt around, can we?\"\n\n\"What's behind the door?\" I asked him and went forward to open it and see for myself.\n\nRobert put his arm in front of me. \"Sorry, but that's top secret.\"\n\nI pouted and complained for quite a while, but Robert didn't give in. In the end I spend the rest of the afternoon helping him repair an old TV set and afterwards made my way home. On the way I was thinking about what he had told me.\n\nThat same evening during dinner I asked my parents how you'd fix animals. They simply laughed and soon changed the topic to something else.\n\nWhen I went to Robert's shop again a few days later, I couldn't believe my eyes. Right at the front porch was a little kitty, sleeping and purring, not a worry in the world.\n\nI recognized it right away as the one that the little boy had brought over the other day. I went closer to it and carefully started to pet it. It opened its eyes, looked at me and then rubbed his little head against my hand. The kitty was perfectly fine.\n\nRobert saw me playing with it and gave me a thumps-up.\n\n\"Good as new.\"\n\n\"How did you do it, Robert?\"\n\n\"Exactly as I told you. Simply fixed the broken parts.\"\n\nI made a sour face at his simple answer, but Robert just ignored it.\n\nWhen the little boy came over he was overjoyed. He started to cry tears of joy when he saw his little friend was alright. His parents who accompanied him thanked Robert for saving the cat. Robert simply smiled and nodded. It was from this day onwards that people would not only bring all sorts of items and appliances to Robert, but also their sick pets.\n\nApparently Robert could really fix anything. A cat with broken legs? She'd be fine a few days later. A limping dog? Same thing. A dying hamster? He'd be fit and full of life again. \n\nDuring this time I was at the store even more often than before. There'd always be animals around to play with. It was only the healthy ones though, the ones that Robert had already 'fixed', as he used to say. All the other ones were kept in what Robert now called the 'top-secret-room'. I had no idea what exactly he did with them in there or how he went about fixing them.\n\nThe thought of how Robert was doing all the things he did stayed on my young mind for quite some time. More than once did I try to sneak into the room, but I either found the door locked or was caught by Robert. In time though I accepted it as the way things were supposed to be. Maybe Robert had a secret medicine that no one else knew off?\n\n\nMy doubts about Robert were reawaken in the middle of summer break. It was then that Robert did something that even I, as a kid, knew to be completely and utterly impossible.\n\n\nIt was a normal Saturday afternoon and I spend it at Robert's shop as usual. I was playing with a cat and waiting for Robert to fix up an old bike. He had promised to teach me a few more things about electronics once he would be done.\n\nMy attention was drawn from the cat to a car that suddenly arrived and came to a stop with squeaking tires. A crying woman jumped out of the passenger seat, followed by a man on the driver's seat.\n\nThe woman came running over towards Robert.\n\n\"You have to save her!\" she cried, tears streaming down her face.\n\nRobert walked towards her, his expression instantly serious.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\nThe woman continued to talk to him, but I couldn't make out all of it. I heard the words accident and car and then she was pleading him over and over again to save her and to 'do it again'. I didn't understand what she was talking about. Robert motioned her to be quiet and hurried over to the man who brought out the limp body of a little girl from the backseat. \n\n\"She was hit about ten minutes ago.\" I heard the man say.\n\nThere was so much blood. It was everywhere. I was shocked and looked on wide-eyed. The arms and legs were dangling from her body. She wasn't moving at all. When I saw her face for a moment, the eyes were completely empty. \n\n\"Go home for today Mark, I teach you another day.\" he said to me as he motioned for the father to bring the girl inside.\n\nI didn't understand what was going on. Why did they bring the girl to Robert? I wanted to stay and started to follow them inside.\n\nRobert noticed me after a few moments and for the first time ever he seemed to be mad at me.\n\n\"I told you to go home, Mark.\" he yelled at me. It was the first time I had heard him like that. His voice had changed and was loud and serious, even a little scary. I left right away.\n\nI didn't understand how he'd do it, but I already knew what was going to happen. The girl had been hurt and her parents had brought her over, so Robert could fix her. \n\nThen I told myself it was stupid. They were there to call a hospital or a doctor. Animals were one thing, but humans are different, right? When I got home I told my parents what had happened, but they simply nodded and didn't say much. They probably didn't believe me or didn't really understand what I was talking about. I must have been way too agitated.\n\nI later heard the whole story of what happened that day. The little girl was named Margaret Miller and was eleven years old. She had dropped something while crossing the main street with her parents and ran back without watching. The driver of an oncoming car had no chance to stop in time and she was run over. The people who saw it said it was a terrible accident and everyone was sure that the girl had died instantly. \n\nThat's when the parents took her and brought her over to Robert.\n\nMy skin started to crawl when I went over to Robert's shop the next time. At first I wasn't sure, but soon there was no mistaking it. A little girl was sitting on the bench in front of the store, smiling happily at me as I came closer. I stared at her wide eyed for a moment.\n\n\"Who are you? Are you Robert's daughter?\"\n\n\"Hi! My name is Margaret.\" she answered with a big smile and held her hand out to me.\n\nWhile I shock her hand, I remembered the name. It was the same name as that of the little girl that had been hit by the car. What was this? I stammered something, unsure what to say. Before I spoke again, I was called over by Robert who had seen me.\n\n\"Mark, this is important, don't talk to her about anything you saw the other day, alright?\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"It is too early for her to remember something as scary as the accident.\"\n\nI nodded, but I felt as if this wasn't the real reason.\n\n\"What did you do to her? Did you cure her?\"\n\nOr fix her, I thought, as he always referred to it for some reason.\n\n\"How did you do it?\"\n\nRobert smiled and he gave me the same answer he had given me so many times before:\n\n\"You simply have to find the parts that are broken and fix them.\"\n\nThat's when I exploded at him. I had enough. Even at my age I knew things weren't as easy as he made them out to be.\n\n\"But that is not how it works! You can't bring someone back to life by fixing their parts.\" I yelled at him.\n\nRobert's face changed to a soft and somewhat sad smile.\n\n\"You are right Mark, sometimes there is no easy way to fix things. Sometimes you have to replace all the parts that are irreparable.\"\n\nI didn't really understand what he was talking about at that time. Was he still talking about humans? Or was he talking about machines again. I was puzzled. \n\n\"It is like with this,\" he turned away from me to find something to explain things to me. That's when I saw my chance. I started to run for the door at the end of the shop. I pressed the handle and with a loud noise, that surprised even me, it opened.\n\n\"Mark, what are you\" I heard Robert call out to me.\n\nI came to a halt right away. I had no idea what I was seeing. To this day I don't know what the place I saw back then was exactly. I saw futuristic machines and test tubes, various glass tanks and containers, cabinets and computers, and innumerable cables connecting it all together. The room stood in stark contrast to the rest of Robert's shop. Everything else was dirty, greasy and old. This room here was new and clean, almost sterile. \n\nIn the middle of the room was a large table. Something was laying on it, covered by a large sheet of white cloth. I don't know why, but went forward and pulled. I saw a small white arm, then a shoulder and finally a face. A female face. \n\nIt was right at that point that Robert reached me, pulled me away and quickly pushed me out of the room. \n\nHe was yelling at me but I didn't hear anything. I only saw it for a moment, but I knew whose face I had seen there. Once I had gathered myself I confronted Robert.\n\n\"Why is she back there? She is outside, isn't she?\"\n\nRobert's expression changed again. The anger went away and now his face showed a sad expression again.\n\n\"What do you do when something is broken beyond repair?\"\n\nI didn\u2019t know. I couldn't even think about an answer.\n\n\"In that case,\" he said, \"you have to replace the whole thing.\"\n\nIt was this statement that freaked me out more than anything, because I knew what he was implying. That little girl outside wasn\u2019t really Margaret Miller, but a replacement. Robert didn't say anything else, or even tried to stop me as I walked outside. \n\nI saw the little girl again. She was still where she had been when I arrived. Her friendly, but empty smile haunted me for the rest of summer.\n\nAfter that day, I never went back to Robert's Repairs again. The place was wrong. Unnatural. I never found out what Robert exactly did, but I knew it was not normal.\n\nThis summer is now more than ten years ago. I heard a lot more about Robert's ordeals and antics throughout the years. There were other stories about more people he fixed. It was all just so weird.\n\nI mean, Robert never did anything wrong to anyone, but somehow I knew that what he was doing was wrong.\n\nBefore you ask, yes, I told my parents about what I saw, but they mostly shrugged it off. They simply didn't believe me and said I shouldn't make up stories like that. However long I pleaded to them and assured them that it was true, the more they ignored me.\n\nIt was right after I finished high school that I left the town and Robert's Repairs behind. I just couldn't stay there anymore.\n\nI am in a bigger city now and I am going to college. I am majoring in the STEM field, which I hate to admit is due to Robert's influence on me as a kid.\n\nI recently visited my parents. We talked a lot about old memories and went through a couple of photo albums of my middle and high school times. It made me feel quite nostalgic. \n\nLater that evening, after my parents had already gone to bed, I decided I'd have a look at a couple of the older albums. I remembered that my parents pretty much had created an album for every year of my life. The first thing I noticed was that one of the albums was noticeably thinner than the rest. I was eight years old at the time. I looked through it and noticed that it went from melting snow and early spring right to pictures of autumn.\n\nThe next day I asked my mother about the album and where the pictures of my birthday were. She told me I had been very sick that year and had stayed at the hospital for some time. Her eyes betrayed her. She was never good at lying and I noticed it right away. Even after calling her out on it, she insisted on it being true.\n\nI tried to think back. Had I ever stayed at a hospital? I couldn't remember anything like it. I thought back to my school days. I would have been in second grade back then. For some reason though, I couldn't pinpoint much about this time. Or anything before it, for that matter.\n\nI had seen the albums filled with pictures of me in kindergarten, starting school and first grade, but even when I tried my hardest, I couldn't recall anything about it. It was as if all my memories before second grad were missing. I tried as hard as I could. Had I suffered from a concussion and lost all my memory?\n\nSuddenly something came back to me. A smell of oil and grease, the sound of machines and tools. There it was. The memory of sitting on a bench and my parents running towards me and hugging me. What were those images? Was it at the hospital? If so, why was I outside?\n\nThen it hit me. The grease. The oil. The bench I was sitting on.\n\nSame as the little girl who had been sitting on the bench in front of Robert's shop. It was the same imagine. Only that I saw it through my eyes. I had been sitting there too, on the same bench, waiting as well.\n\nI was shaking now, because I understood. This must have been when I was in second grade. Almost a year before I had been visiting Robert regularly.\n\nLong before Robert had fixed that little girl, he had fixed me too. That's why the mother of the little girl had been pleading him to do it again. \n\nI had been fixed by Robert as well. The only question was:\n\nWhat exactly did he [do to me...?](https://www.facebook.com/r.rehnwriter/)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "65qai8", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 763, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rakushasu", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65qai8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.nosleep", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "edited": 1492365205.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/65qai8/roberts_repairs/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492392838.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65qai8/roberts_repairs/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Robert's Repairs", "created_utc": 1492364038.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 43, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 763}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qai8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcjuza", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 81, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gameshurtmymind", "parent_id": "t3_65qai8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "3D printer?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;3D printer?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nosleep", "name": "t1_dgcjuza", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492404418.0, "created_utc": 1492375618.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 81}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qai8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65qai8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd0ttq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheNessLink", "parent_id": "t1_dgcrt6s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "She left the cap off the toothpaste!
