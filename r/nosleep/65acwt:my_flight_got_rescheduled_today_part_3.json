They realized pretty quickly that I knew nothing of much use. Apparently, they chalked up my flight being rescheduled to a technical glitch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything was uneventful until the end of the line of questioning when the officer I was speaking with informed me that the FBI had been called in to take over the investigation. At first, I didn\u2019t think much of this. To me, the FBI seemed to be a natural step in the process of solving a possible act of terrorism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn\u2019t until I left the interrogation room that I saw him: the man from outside my window. He was wearing a suit, and looked important; He commanded the attention of everyone. Officers were diligently listening to him as he spoke about the missing plane, scribbling down notes as he went. I couldn\u2019t move my feet from their position on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, he finished whatever speech he was giving and began to walk towards me. I couldn\u2019t breathe properly, my vision was blurry from the fear eating me alive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHello, Ms. \u2014-. I\u2019d like to thank you for coming in on behalf of the FBI.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gaped at him. He smiled that tight lipped smile that I knew would haunt me for the rest of my life \u2014 regardless of how long or short it may be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou must still be in shock, which is completely normal. But, you can rest assured that we will find the plane. Give everyone closure.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded my head in silent agreement.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWould you mind stepping out with me for a few minutes, Ms. \u2014-?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked around, bewildered. Nobody seemed to take any interest in the interaction between us. I knew that it wouldn\u2019t matter whether I said yes or no; I was going to have to be alone with this man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cS-sure.\u201d My voice shook hard. I had never heard myself sound more irresolute. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled again, guiding me to the back door of the police station and holding the door open for me to step out. He followed suit, and we were swallowed up in silence compared to the bustling interior of the building. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man leaned against the side of the building as if this were the most casual thing in the world. As if a plane wasn\u2019t missing. As if I hadn\u2019t seen him standing outside my window last night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We stood there in silence for a few minutes. I waited for him to begin the conversation, to say anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re quite the lucky woman.\u201d He chuckled to himself. \u201cLet me ask you something: Do you think luck exists? Karma? Fate?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned to face him. \u201cI\u2019d like to\u2026\u201d My voice wavered as it trailed off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man didn\u2019t respond to me at first. I couldn\u2019t tell if he was satisfied with my answer or not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cInteresting. I\u2019ll see you soon, Ms. \u2014-.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I could say anything, he brushed past me, opened the door, and disappeared into the hoards of officers and agents milling about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After waiting a bit, I made my way back inside, made a bee-line for the door and drove home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend started badgering me with questions as soon as I walked through the door. I did my best to answer all of his queries, but he could tell I was exhausted. It was still fairly early in the afternoon, so he proposed that he would drive to the grocery store and buy some things for dinner while I napped. I kissed him in appreciation, admiring him and the love I have for him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as he left, my phone lit up. I answered, preparing myself for the eerie voice. Instead, it was the voice of the man from earlier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHello again, Ms. \u2014-. Listen closely. You will report to XYZ. Leave immediately. Tell no one. I look forward to seeing you again.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I could manage a response, the line went dead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I steeled myself, grabbing my keys off of the counter and sliding into my car. I knew that I was being stupid; I also knew that this was unavoidable. Either I went, or he would come get me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at the address he had given, I parked and tried to regain my composure. Before I could even take thirty seconds to do so, my passenger door had open and shut, and the man from the police station was in the car with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me that he was a shadow; Part of the cryptocracy. That I am now indebted to them. That I will join them. I will serve with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy? Why me?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou have potential. You can carry this weight with us. Together.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He leaned over and whispered something into my ear before getting out of the car and striding away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I drove away, completely dazed. I felt like I wasn\u2019t in charge of my body, or my thoughts, or anything. Every bit of control that I had ever believed I had was dissolving. I talked out loud to myself in an attempt to calm down, but trying to piece together my sanity was futile. It was slipping through my fingers, right in front of my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stumbled inside, blind to the world around me. My boyfriend wasn\u2019t home. I sat down on the couch and started typing this. Maybe instead I should kill myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m going to live. That I\u2019m going to carry more burdens like this. Forever. That I am now Atlas, shouldering the knowledge of all the fucked up things in this world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My phone lit up. I answered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was an electronic, deep voice: \u201cWe will come for you soon. You have much more to learn.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I was fucking insane. I thought that maybe I was suffering from schizophrenia. That maybe I have cracked under the weight of my guilt for not boarding that plane yesterday. That there\u2019s been a break somewhere deep inside of me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it made sense. It makes sense. They run everything. They know everything.
