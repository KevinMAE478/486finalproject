I&amp;#39;m 25 now, working at a magazine company. I&amp;#39;m here to tell you all what happened when I was just a normal girl of 17 years old who just moved to a small town with my dad. I was not welcomed in my old home town...people found me weird. \nNot that I wore weird outfits or wore my hair like a crazy bimbo or anything. \nWhat I want to tell you guys is what happened on November 2nd, first day at my new school. I didn&amp;#39;t plan on making any friends, because nobody would want to be anyway.\nI walked through the hallways as if I was invisible, head down, quiet footsteps. I didn&amp;#39;t want to look at anyone. I didn&amp;#39;t want them to look at me either. But there was Alex, he was different from others. He became my friend from that day on. We would share stories of ourselves as we walked home together after school. We were so close that we would even exchange our own diaries. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[02.11.2001]\nIt&amp;#39;s November 2nd today, the year is 2001. My name is Alex and I&amp;#39;m just your usual high school kid of 17 years old. Honestly, there&amp;#39;s nothing special about me so I don&amp;#39;t know why the fuck I&amp;#39;m writing a self intro. Anyway, today happened to be the day I decided to start a diary entry to keep track of my life. I went to school just like any other day today. I got up at 7.45am. I was fucking late. I rushed to brush my teeth and wash my face. I looked out the window and saw Dave, my best friend, in his silver Honda Accord waiting on the sidewalk. He seemed to be daydreaming, guess he was waiting for too long. I heard his engine starting as I quickly ran downstairs. Shit. I sprinted out the front door and as I reached the porch, his car was gone. Fuck, this asshole. Guess I had to walk to school AGAIN. Didn&amp;#39;t this guy have any patience at all? It was a nice day though, the breezy autumn air blew softly upon my face as I walked on the sidewalk, it was early November but yellow, crimson leaves were all on the floor already. I took a deep breath and sighed, at least the weather was good to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reached school at around 8.20am and I was 20 minutes late to mathematics class. Luckily, I slipped into the class while Mrs Dunwall was playing slides, the room was dark and she was pretty occupied so I guess nobody noticed me. Thank god. Break time started sooner than I thought. Great. I walked on the hallways that were filled with people, searching for my &amp;quot;best friend&amp;quot; but he was nowhere to be seen. The bell rang and it was class time again. While everybody were leaving and the crowd started to spread out, I walked through the lockers towards my classroom, and I noticed a girl. She seemed to be putting books in her locker, but as soon as she put them in, she took them out again, looking around. She repeated this for a few times. How weird, I thought to myself, come to think of it, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve seen this girl before. Filled with curiosity, I went up to her. \n&amp;quot;Hey, what are you doing?&amp;quot; I tapped on her shoulder. \nShe looked back at me, startled. \n&amp;quot;Jesus! I&amp;#39;m just uh..putting back my books..who are you anyway?&amp;quot; \nI smiled, she looked cute. \n&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Alex, never seen you around here, you must be new.&amp;quot; I said with a smile.\n&amp;quot;Yeah, I just moved here with my dad, I&amp;#39;m Sylvainne.&amp;quot; she replied, finally closing her locker. &amp;quot;Gotta head to class now, see ya!&amp;quot; As I watched her ran off down the hallway. This girl is weird, but there&amp;#39;s just something about her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lunch time came by quickly but I wasn&amp;#39;t hungry at all. I went to the cafeteria anyway, hoping I&amp;#39;d find Dave there. Scanning the huge room, I finally spotted him with a few of his mates--Wlliam, Conner and Michael. I greeted and quickly sat down with them, they were talking loudly and I was trying to find a chance to confront Dave about this morning. \n&amp;quot;Dudeee, you see that girl over there?&amp;quot; Will said as he pointed over the corner. I followed his gaze as I saw Sylvainne, sitting alone. \n&amp;quot;What about her?&amp;quot; I asked\n&amp;quot;Name&amp;#39;s Sylvia or something..Heard she&amp;#39;s new here, she&amp;#39;s kinda hot isn&amp;#39;t she?&amp;quot; He continued. \nI nodded in agreement. \nWell..can&amp;#39;t really disagree with that, she IS kinda cute. Despite our awkward encounter this morning.\n&amp;quot;Uh, wouldn&amp;#39;t say that. Heard she&amp;#39;s weird. She doesn&amp;#39;t really talk to anyone, she barely even smiles.&amp;quot; Michael joined in. \n&amp;quot;I talked to her this morning, she seems pretty nice.&amp;quot; I interrupted.\n&amp;quot;Man, heard her mum&amp;#39;s a fortuneteller...or a psychic..eh some shit like that, she might have got those talents from her mum, pretty creepy&amp;quot; Will whispered. Dave looked up as he finished texting on his phone. Finally, that was my moment. \n&amp;quot;Yo dude, what&amp;#39;s up with you this morn--&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;Hey Dave, do you think you could ask that girl...&amp;quot; Conner interrupted. \n&amp;quot;Nah.&amp;quot; Dave replied as he suddenly stood up, taking his tray with him and left. \n&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s up with him?&amp;quot; Will and I exclaimed at the same time. Conner shrugged. \nMy guess was what Conner said had angered him or something, since Dave&amp;#39;s dad died when he was seven in a freak car accident. It was a long time ago, he doesn&amp;#39;t even wanna talk about it, but why today? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as this long ass day ended, I went looking for my mates at the lockers and found them huddled in a circle at Dave&amp;#39;s locker. \n&amp;quot;...You going for that weird girl?!&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;What the actual fuck?&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;Damn Dave!&amp;quot; \nI peeked in Dave&amp;#39;s locker and saw a bunch of flowers. Woah, my man&amp;#39;s going for a girl! Before I could congratulate him, Dave rolled his eyes and walked away. \nI wanted to follow him but I saw Sylvainne walked past me so I caught up with her, wondering whether I should tell her about Dave.\n&amp;quot;Sylvainne! How was your day?&amp;quot; I smiled.\n&amp;quot;Hey Alex. Um..nothing much. Nobody talked to me..What about you?&amp;quot; She didn&amp;#39;t smile back. \n&amp;quot;Everyday&amp;#39;s the same for me.&amp;quot; At this point, I&amp;#39;ve decided to give some support to my man. \n&amp;quot;So, uh, you know Dave Kingston?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s in my English class, what about him?&amp;quot; she thought about it for a second.\n&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s my best friend, he&amp;#39;s a cool guy, you should talk to him some time!&amp;quot; I joked. \nShe looked at me and frowned, then she muttered &amp;quot;Uh..okay..?&amp;quot; \nYou gonna act that way even if he gives you flowers? I thought to myself. \nAnyway, I should focus on helping Dave. \n&amp;quot;Hey, maybe you should get a ride from him today?&amp;quot; I suggested. \n&amp;quot;What? No, I&amp;#39;m okay---&amp;quot; she replied but I dragged her to the parking lot in search for Dave&amp;#39;s car. \n&amp;quot;Hey! Look, I don&amp;#39;t wanna--&amp;quot; but before she could finish, we came upon Dave&amp;#39;s car. \n&amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot; Dave questioned. \n&amp;quot;Uh..I...could you give me a ride home?&amp;quot; Sylvainne mumbled in a soft voice. \nDave looked puzzled but he kinda smiled and said &amp;quot;Sure&amp;quot; \nI caught a glimpse of the flowers in the backseat and was kinda proud of myself, I&amp;#39;ve done a pretty good job. \n&amp;quot;See ya!&amp;quot; I waved as Sylvainne got into his car and they drove off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve decided to walk home rather than taking the bus. As I was quietly enjoying the autumn air, I noticed Dave&amp;#39;s car parked by the sidewalk. Hmm, they must have gotten off, but where? Suddenly, I caught a glimpse of a sign that was right above me--it said Cemetry. \nI was shocked, what were they doing in a cemetry? Dave sure knew the best spot to confess. \nI went in and caught a glimpse of the both of them, standing before a gravestone. With the flowers Dave had brought, laying still on the ground.\nHoly shit, had Dave gone out of his mind?It sure wasn&amp;#39;t the best time to visit his dad with a girl he barely knew! \nI approached them from behind and stopped dead in my tracks. I couldn&amp;#39;t move, I couldn&amp;#39;t speak. What the fuck? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There, on the gravestone, was my name. \nCarved in the elegant font were the words &amp;quot;Here lies Alex Gardner.&amp;quot; \nThis can&amp;#39;t be happening, is this some kind of sick joke?! A prank?! I looked at the date as it says November 2nd, 1998...that&amp;#39;s today, 3 years ago\nThen I heard Dave&amp;#39;s voice. \n&amp;quot;Alex was my best friend..we&amp;#39;ve known each other since we were kids..He died three years ago...&amp;quot; he stopped, holding back tears. &amp;quot;It was all because of me...I didn&amp;#39;t wait for him...he had to walk to school, got hit by a school bus..&amp;quot; he finally broke down into tears. \nSylvainne&amp;#39;s eyes widened as she opened her mouth, trying to speak.\nThen, all of a sudden, a surge of memories hit me. I remembered, the giant yellow school bus at the corner of my eyes as I was crossing the road, it all happened so fast...\nGod..it has been 3 years already\n&amp;quot;I would drive by his house every morning from that day on...hoping he would come out of the house..&amp;quot; Dave continued.\nSylvainne patted his back. \n&amp;quot;People say you&amp;#39;re psy...can you see him?&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s right behind you&amp;quot; \nDave immediately looked behind, and I looked back at him. \n&amp;quot;Alex?&amp;quot; \nI smiled faintly, fighting back tears.\n&amp;quot;Hi Dave, it&amp;#39;s been a while, thanks for coming by everyday.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[2009]\nMy name is Sylvainne, most people call me Sylvie.
