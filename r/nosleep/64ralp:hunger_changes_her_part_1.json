I was dreaming about her again, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise what I woke with a start, covered in sweat with tears stinging my eyes. The clock by my bed blinked midnight, the result of a brown out weeks ago. I never bothered setting it anymore, what was the point? I\u2019d get out of bed when I felt like it. I rarely did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sound continued for another minute while I lie there, looking up at the ceiling, praying for it to end. For her to rest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screeeeee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What had I done?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sounds went on, and I gave up hope that she would stop before sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I threw off the heavy covers, the house was cold - I rarely bothered with heat anymore now that it was just me - and headed outside barefoot, still dressed in three-day-worn pajamas. The air that hit me was only slightly cooler than the house, but it was enough to raise goosebumps on my arms. Either that or the look of the triple-locked shed standing next to the house still raised the hairs on the back of my neck. From inside, the screeching of nails on metal almost drowned out the hiss and sizzle of the flesh inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have loved. I have burned with love. Burned with the fire of a thousand suns. I have looked into the eyes of a woman and seen my future laid out before me. Our home, our children, the life we\u2019d have and the years of joy ahead of us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met her in the way most people meet these days, on the internet. It was a small thing. A chat room where we shared our love of movies and, after long nights filling each other\u2019s screens with secrets and promises, shared the love we developed for each other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three months after I met Rebecca, I moved two thousand miles away from my friends and job to be with her. Three months after that, we found a place together at the foot of a beautiful snowcapped peak. It was a small place, but it was ours. A haven where we could love and grow and laugh. Together our love could have burned the world. Now it just might.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Rebecca? She was beautiful too. Hair dyed whatever color caught her eye that month, her body covered in tattoos and old scars. She was my punk rock princess, a dream given form. The first time we met she picked me up at the extended stay motel I\u2019d picked out as a launching base for my new life and we drove around in her little metro for hours. I couldn\u2019t speak, I knew the words but my mouth wouldn\u2019t obey. We drove and later that night, our first night together, we made love. I never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had it all. Right up until they said the words that would change everything forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the man in the white lab coat said as I held the hand of the bravest girl I\u2019d ever known, \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid the tumor is malignant.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our world shattered. I held her that night as she cried in my arms and every night after that as she endured round after round of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. She lost weight, her beautiful hair which I loved and she was always unsatisfied with fell out in ugly, uneven chunks. Through it all, she was still my beautiful princess, the love of my life. The girl I\u2019d do anything for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a year of unsuccessful treatments, including a stint in a promising but ultimately fruitless drug trial, the fight became too much for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMichael, enough.\u201d She said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tears streamed down my face as I looked at her. \u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d I repeated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLook at me.\u201d There was steel in her voice, that bravery that I\u2019d always admired turned against me in a flash. \u201cI\u2019m dying. The doctors say another six months if I\u2019m lucky. There\u2019s nothing else they can do, and I don\u2019t want to die in some hospital waiting for a cure that will never come.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe can try something else,\u201d I pressed. \u201cThere are alternative treatments. There\u2019s a drug out of China that\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo. I love you, I love this house. Our house. If I\u2019m going to die I want to die here, living the life we built together.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t know what to say. I wanted the years we\u2019d planned, the trips and the family we were going to build. I nodded. But in my heart, I couldn\u2019t accept the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, she withered away. Rebecca became a shell of the vibrant young woman I had fallen in love with. When she became too weak to get out of bed we turned the guest room into a makeshift emergency care room. A nurse came in three times a week to see that she was as comfortable as possible. Eventually, Rebecca was too weak to eat or speak for more than a few minutes at a time. I treasured those minutes, holding the bone-thin hand of the woman I loved more than life itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the endless hours between, I searched for anything to keep her alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I followed dead end after dead end, ordered herbal teas and the powdered bones of endangered species off of less-than-reliable websites. I knew it might kill her, but I was desperate and, in my mind, she was dying anyway. I slipped the treatments into her food, gave them to her when she was too weak to move. Nothing worked, she just kept getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was when I got the package.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don\u2019t remember ordering it. There was a constant stream of packages coming to the house at that point, boxes filled with powders and oils. The box was wrapped in plain brown paper with a cheaply printed shipping label slapped on top. There was no return address.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took the package inside and sat it next to a discarded envelope that had, supposedly, held the finger bone of a saint renown for its healing properties. As hopeless as I was at that point, every new treatment brought a thrill. A spark of hope that I couldn\u2019t let go off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside the box was a small plastic vial filled with a viscous red liquid. A small handwritten note simply read: &lt;strong&gt;Inject into arm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Staring at the red liquid, blood I was sure, I considered briefly giving up. Who knew what or where it had come from, what diseases it might carry? At that point, Rebecca was all but gone. I\u2019d watched her become a shell, an empty husk without the energy to lift her head from the pillow. It didn\u2019t matter what harm the blood caused now, if I didn\u2019t find a cure in the next two weeks there\u2019d be nothing left to save. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Syringes are easy to come by when you have a loved one dying of cancer, and I filled one of the thick plastic tubes with the contents of the vial. It slipped into the syringe in an oozing, crawling fashion that made me shiver. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could have stepped back, even then. I could have let Rebecca have what she wanted most, to die in peace with me by her side, holding her hand as she slipped into darkness one last time. Instead, I held her hand as I slipped the needle into her veins, praying to anyone who would listen that this time I\u2019d found the answer, that I wouldn\u2019t lose her yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rebecca shuttered and sighed as the blood flowed into her, the atrophied muscles in her arm contracting as I pulled the empty syringe away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, I could only wait. I slept fitfully that night, questioning what I\u2019d done and wondering how I\u2019d go on without her. It was the heavy thud of something falling to the floor inside the kitchen that finally pulled me out of bed and away from the nightmares that seemed to haunt my ever night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked into the kitchen slowly. When I saw Rebecca\u2019s flannel nightgown, the gown I\u2019d put on her the day before after getting her out of the bath, the haze in my tired brain burned away in an instant. She was thin and frail, barely five feet tall and dropped to ninety pounds, but she was standing on her own two feet with a jar of peanuts in her hand hungrily shoving them into her mouth. On the floor was a bag of flour that had exploded on impact, knocked loose from its precarious perch as she\u2019d rifled for food. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBecca?\u201d I whispered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She turned to look at me, startled. \u201cSorry, I\u2019ll clean it up.\u201d She said sheepishly, the smile on her face drawing her gaunt cheeks tight. Smiling for the first time in months, her once soft features took on the look of a grinning skull. I didn\u2019t care. I ran to her and wrapped my arms around her waist, pulling her against me. She hugged back, her arms strong. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Rebecca said, \u201cI feel good Michael. I feel better than I have in a long time.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSit down,\u201d I told her, \u201cI\u2019ll make us something to eat.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rebecca was ravenous, and she ate everything I put in front of her with a kind of hungry fervor that, at the time, I assumed was from long weeks of eating through a tube. When she was done her too-thin stomach was bloated and her breath came out in wheezing gasps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGet to bed,\u201d I said, \u201cYou still need to rest.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked up at me with hungry eyes but nodded, exhaustion overtaking her at the mere mention of bed. I helped her back, her body barely weighing anything as she leaned on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days color returned to her cheeks and the hair, which had never grown back despite chemo being months behind her, had started to grow back a bristly blonde. A natural color I\u2019d never seen on her before. She was still hungry, eating everything she could get a hold of, but however much she ate she never seemed full.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were other changes. Her nails seemed to have grown thick and long, I assumed during her illness though I\u2019d never noticed them before, and her always-bright green eyes almost glowed at the barest hint of light reflecting off of them. She was, in many ways, a new woman. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And our sex life was more exciting than it had been even at the start. It\u2019s hard not to look back and see the signs there. Instead of weak and tired she was as ravenous in bed as in the kitchen, her body was strong and her legs clamped around me like a vice as she rode me for what felt like hours without so much as a break. I was in heaven. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, one morning, I found the bag. A little red and black backpack covered in blood waiting on our doorstep. I hid it before she woke up that morning and, for a time, she seemed almost back to normal. Not the sickly girl I\u2019d taken care of or the ravenous miracle patient who ate everything she saw. Just Rebecca. Just my princess fully restored. If not for the too-short blonde hair on her head you might have never known she was sick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The news reported day and night on the missing boy. Little Timothy Cutler. They said he vanished from his room, his red and black backup had disappeared with him. Search parties failed but the hunt went on. I tried to keep Rebecca away from the news, every time she saw it her heart would break. I wanted to confront her about it, to ask about the backpack, but I was afraid of her answer. I kept it to myself, enjoying my time with her while I had it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would take almost two weeks before she started to change again. This time the changes were more noticeable. When we had sex she bit me; that in itself wasn\u2019t unusual, but the blood that dripped from her lips when she finished was more than new. I bit down on my own lip and swallowed the pain, trying to ignore the way her pointed teeth gleamed in the light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was hungry again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn\u2019t take a genius to make the connection. And I knew who held the blame for her change, her hunger, and the disappearance of Timmy Cutler. I didn\u2019t know what to do, but I couldn\u2019t risk her killing another child. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly, Rebecca started to lose herself. I could see her rational mind slipping away, smell the animal on her skin. I could see the way she looked at me, like I might make a better snack than a lover. I was losing her, losing the beautiful girl I knew. But I had an idea about what would bring her back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was when I built the shed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "*Screeeeeee.*\n\nThe sound woke me up from another fitful, restless nightmare.
