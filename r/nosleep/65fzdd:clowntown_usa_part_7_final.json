My son clung to my side, face buried in the bloody cloth of my shirt. I could hear a wasp buzzing against one of the cheese trays but beyond that the entire party was completely silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Missy Jackson scowled down at the corpse she had just made. The act of murder appeared to have calmed her, she was no longer a warning shade of red. Beside her, Spencer Jackson was ghost white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSweetums,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cyou just killed mister clown.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHis name was Arthur,\u201d I said. Nobody seemed to hear me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Missy tossed her head.  \u201cWho cares? He\u2019s just a clown.\u201d Ah yes. The &lt;em&gt;pwecious&lt;/em&gt; speech impediment had been an act, an act she now dropped completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spencer shook her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that, you...you just can\u2019t.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Missy &lt;em&gt;hmphed&lt;/em&gt;. \u201cYou shoulda got me the boy when I said. It\u2019s &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; birthday. If you don\u2019t get me what I want, I\u2019ll blow up.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m sure Spencer Jackson had been through scenes like this probably thousands of times over his daughter\u2019s long, spoiled life. And, like many occasions before I&amp;#39;m sure, he looked for someone to blame for his daughter\u2019s actions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he lifted his gaze  to find me and my son.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spencer\u2019s face hardened and he drew himself up to full height. \u201cWell?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t answer. I just stared at him. I could feel the tension of the children behind my back. It was like a pile of hot kindling. All it needed was a spark somewhere and it would flash into a raging inferno.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spencer dared to take a few steps towards us. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot to make up for. What do you have to say for yourself?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stayed silent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He seemed to take courage from my lack of speech. \u201cWe have a nice little community here. No one\u2019s ever had a problem with it before you. We opened our arms to you after you drove your husband away, and this is how you repay us? Who do you think you are?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I licked my lips. I tasted copper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He dared to take a few more steps. \u201cI want an answer, and I want it now. How are you going to make this up to us, hmm? How are you going to fix this?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opened my mouth. Laughter poured out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spencer took a step back again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bent double, cramping with the force of my mirth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFix this?\u201d I gasped, \u201cfix this? Fuck you, fix this!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spencer turned an ugly red, just like his daughter had. He snapped his fingers and suddenly Clanton cop Ted appeared, big and blond and intimidating. He unholstered his gun and pointed it at my chest. I could see eagerness in the way he held his arm, practically trembling with excitement at the thought of shooting me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still laughing, I turned and slapped Missy Jackson across the face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t do it very hard, but she still fell back. It was probably more shock than anything else. I don\u2019t think in her whole life anyone had dared to lay hands on her. She took a few seconds to process what had just happened, her breath came fast and faster with every intake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Missy took one big breath and screamed. Higher and higher it went, like a kettle shooting out steam. Her face went red. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She put her hands out and ran at me. At the last second, I turned aside and let her run into the children\u2019s fence. She hit it with her eyes closed, winding up tangled in the plastic bars.  Missy rose up swinging, punching a boy in the face. That was it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The children erupted into violence, fighting a battle a thousand times more savage than any playground. They clawed at each other\u2019s steaming red faces, pulled hair, bit limbs. A stray tooth hit me on the arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What adults were left in the area fled as soon as Missy crashed the fence. I saw big bad cop Ted winging it over the lawn to the cars. A few doomed souls had taken cover under the deck, as if that would somehow shield them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My strange calm had made everything seem like it was happening in slow motion. I noticed my son had left my side. It occurred to me that I should find him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I waded through the melee, looking for Joshua. I found him locked in a terminal battle with another boy who usually flanked Missy Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJoshua? Joshua, I&amp;#39;m leaving,\u201d I called over the carnage. He looked up briefly, then went back to gouging the boy\u2019s eyes with his thumbs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spied a woman\u2019s purse that had been dropped and trampled. I opened it and found makeup. I knew what to do with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I scooped up two fingers of blue eyeshadow and ground it into my right eyelid. Again. And again. The lipstick in the purse was bright red. I scribbled a banana shape around my lips, filling it in with thick strokes. With the lip liner pencil, I drew pink eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJoshua,\u201d I called, straightening up, \u201clook at mommy!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He looked up briefly, then back at his prey. Then he looked up again. His puzzled face turned into joy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLook at mommy!\u201d I said in my best clown voice. Joshua dropped the other boy and ran to me, dodging assaults from every side. He reached me with his eyes shining in pure excitement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMommy,\u201d he yelled, \u201cboop!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He hit me in the nose. My head snapped back and my eyes watered. Still, I kept a smile on my face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFollow me, Joshua,\u201d I said, \u201cfollow mommy!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did a funny little backwards walk, beckoning my son. He followed, pinwheeling his arms, trying to land a punch on me as he giggled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d Spencer Jackson called to me from beneath the deck. \u201cThat\u2019s very good, Denise! Now come here and do the rest!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I continued my backwards walk, eyes on Joshua, always on Joshua.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDenise?\u201d Spencer\u2019s tone grew desperate. \u201cMrs. Hughes?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I backed onto the empty green lawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people beneath the deck called, shouting at my son to come back. Spencer offered Joshua Missy\u2019s birthday presents. Miss Lettie said she\u2019d be his new mommy, she\u2019d let him have all the choccy milk he ever wanted. A man screamed that he\u2019d be a clown, he\u2019d be a much better clown than me if we\u2019d only come back\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the mouth of the Jackson\u2019s large driveway, a traffic jam had formed. Instead of abandoning their cars and fleeing, the frantic people leaned out of their windows to scream at each other. One enterprising man had the bright idea of crashing his car into the jam, perhaps thinking that would clear it. I still could hear screams and shattering glass behind me when we left the mansion behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ran. I made a game of it, told Joshua we were racing to the hills. When he fell I picked him up. We did not follow the spiral of the road but cut a straight line through yards and fences. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not know why no one else left the town. Perhaps they underestimated the coming explosion. Perhaps they truly felt their town would keep them safe after all this time, and died clutching at their denial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We watched it happen from far above. The explosion was like a bomb going off, shattering the windows of every building in town. Joshua watched the fire spread with bright eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPretty,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half the town was leveled. No survivors except for my son and myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was thirty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joshua was seven then. He is still seven now. He will be seven for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My ex husband died in a car crash ten years ago, skidding into a highway barrier while his soon-to-be fifth wife gave him fellatio. I broke the news to Joshua that his father was dead. He simply shrugged and went back to disemboweling a teddy bear. I don\u2019t think he remembers what \u201cfather\u201d is, or what life was like before we came here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The town is infamous now. Some witty soul spray-painted \u201cClowntown, USA\u201d on the entrance sign, and that\u2019s how people know it. People who call themselves explorers trespass in its ruins and take pictures of the clowns and post them online. I\u2019ve seen a few of the sites. They hypothesize that it\u2019s the dream project of a perverse billionaire, or the resting place of some kind of carnival of the damned. They take selfies with the dead-eyed murals that cover the remaining buildings, pick off clown statue arms and noses as souvenirs. It\u2019s like hell on earth, they say. If only they knew. If only they knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They speak of a ghost in Clowntown, a specter that is only ever seen from far away and in brief flashes. But it is not a middle-aged man with sad brown eyes and a prosthetic leg. No, it is a woman with unkempt white hair and ghastly clown makeup, who leads the spirit of one of her doomed victims around by the hand, a little boy who probably perished in the natural gas explosion thirty years ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I see flashes of my son, but mostly he is the thing the town has made him. I keep him occupied, keep him happy, keep him alive. We survive by foraging. When foot traffic becomes too much, I make a game of hiding to Joshua. We make houses in the underbrush and pretend we\u2019re army commandos hiding from the enemy. I can barely feel the paint on my face anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is not a terrible life to lead. You get used to it. You get used to anything. And the day we can no longer live as we choose, the day they find us and try to separate us,  I will let Joshua get angry. I will not soothe him as the furnace burns hotter and hotter inside him. I will hold him tightly to me and we will both go together. All I asked for was a simple life in a small town with my only son. And in the end, that is all I got.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/62wn5k/clowntown_usa_part_1/)\n\n[part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/639cms/clowntown_usa_part_2/)\n\n[part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/63p1ny/clowntown_usa_part_3/)\n\n[part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/643mom/clowntown_usa_part_4/)\n\n[part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64mz2u/clowntown_usa_part_5/)\n\n[part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6524l2/clowntown_usa_part_6/)\n\nThe only friend I had made in town lay dead at my feet.
