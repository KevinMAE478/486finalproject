I\u2019m sure there are good ones, but I don\u2019t want to find out.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Asylum I worked in was built to be confusing, once you worked there long enough you started to get used to the place, but the patients never did. They sometimes closed off exits for a few days just to further confuse people. The basements were always horrifying. Dim lit long corridors for storage, and the tunnels? My god\u2026 Even back then I remember seeing shadow people walking down there.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve told you a lot of stories of the stuff I used to do to help the patients, how I used to be the chef there and I cooked meals and had a cooking program. There were many times I was told to put things in food for some of the patients there. Times I had watched as some of them wither away, or fall sick after eating some of my food.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, some days I wanted to leave. Some days I would walk right up to the head doctors office raise my fist to knock on the door only to turn and walk away. As much as I wanted to quit, I had to stay and advocate for these poor souls. Some of them would never be able to be saved, but there were a few who might look at my face and for a moment feel warmth, and to me that was worth all the pain I felt being there.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s you could be tossed into an asylum for most any reason. Some troubled children would even be sent to the asylum instead of going to prison. The thought was that maybe they were just mentally ill, but the truth was the Asylums knew that by accepting them it was more money. I remember seeing troubled girls and boys come in as frustrated teenagers who just needed love and acceptance from parents who gave them nothing, and they only left cold and empty.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was one young man named Joseph who was there because he was constantly secluded in his room smoking pot. His father said he never seemed to want to go outside or talk to anyone, he just wanted to smoke pot and stay in his room. He tried to take his drugs, he tried to take away his guitar, he tried to yell at him but Joseph would find a way to get pot and would only go out when it was time for school, and even then his attendance was less than acceptable.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of questions, how did Joseph get pot if he never left his room to hang with friends? How did he got pot if he had no money? I watched Joseph on his first day in the kitchen, his hands were crossed around his chest and he had the usual teenage look that told me he wasn\u2019t interested in this stupid thing, but he was just here because he had to be.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was gentle. I never asked him to do anything because I knew he wouldn\u2019t, but I kept an eye on him to find out what he would be interested in doing. After a few days went by, I noticed he started taking an interest in baking of all things. He finally opened up to me one day and said that his mother used to bake him a special cake on his birthday. Not store bought, from scratch with homemade icing made from cream cheese.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhen\u2026 mom died, dad didn\u2019t cry even for a day. In a month he had a new girlfriend and in two years he was married again. That\u2019s when the drinking started.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Joseph. I can\u2019t imagine how that must have felt. How old were you?\u201d I asked him. I could see in his eyes hurt and anger. I had found the issue, I had found what he was escaping from.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u201cYoung\u2026 too young.\u201d He said in a whisper. I knew he must not want to talk more about it so I left it alone.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was scared for him, I knew what the asylum did to kids like him. He may open up to me, but he wouldn\u2019t open up to a doctor or nurse. They tended to \u201ctreat\u201d them by humiliation and scolding. They might make them wear diapers and said they were acting like a baby so they would treat them like one. Making them walk around in the things for all to see. Some weren\u2019t aloud to go outside.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Joseph I saw him for a while, and then he was gone. They decided that if he liked staying inside and smoking pot they would put him in a dark room with food and water and nothing else. No window, no books or games, just what he was given for food every day. No one was allowed to speak to him. They figured if he spent so much time with out people he would soon learn to love talking to people. This literally broke him. After a week in this room he came back completely changed. Instead of wanting to speak to everyone though, he wouldn\u2019t speak at all. It was as if he forgot words.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might think, that they realized the experiment did nothing and they should try something different, not the Asylum. Instead they put him back in the room for another week. It was at night when they did it. I was heading home when I heard him screaming at the top of his lungs. Screaming for them to put him down. Screaming that he would behave. I turned a corner and saw him being carried by five doctors, as they shoved him into a straight jacket and tossed him into the room. His screams didn\u2019t stop though, as they shut the door the screams continued although muffled. I walked away for the night with my head down. There was nothing I could do for him.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day when I went back in I walked by the isolated cell they tossed him in. I couldn\u2019t look in a window like the other cells but I just listened and could hear muffled cries. I shook my head and went to the kitchen, praying that maybe they would let him out early. Once was bad enough, but to go back and know how horrible the week was going to be? It must have driven him insane.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I walked by and heard that he was talking to himself. I couldn\u2019t make out what he was saying, but that afternoon he was gone. I had thought the worse, but a nurse had said he was removed because he was ramming his head against the wall and had knocked himself out cold. In a few days he was back in the class. He was truly broken and half insane now.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHello Bill, how are you today?\u201d He said robotic and politely. I could see his eyebrows now had a twitch to them.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u201cI\u2019m good Joseph, glad to see you are back.\u201d I responded.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u201cI am well, thank you Bill. I hope today we will bake. I love to bake.\u201d His response was quick and out of tune. It lacked personality of any sort.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u201cYes, there will be some baking today.\u201d I smiled warmly.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u201cI am glad. They say that I have improved and if I continue to improve they will let me return home. I am glad to be going home. I miss my father. I love him. I also love my doctor. I\u2019m thankful that they treated me. Since I am better I can go home soon they say.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\nThe repetition scared me. I started to worry that he was truly broken for good and may never recover. I saw his eyes, and realized they were dilated. They had put him on some form of medication. His nurse broke in the middle of his long circular monologue by saying,&lt;br/&gt;\n\u201cCome on Joseph let\u2019s go bake then.\u201d&lt;br/&gt;\n\u201cOkay, I do love baking. Mother baked for me, I will be happy to go back home and bake for my father. The doctors say I can go home soon if I continue to recover.\u201d He was pulled away by the nurse, his eyebrows twitching like they had a mind of their own.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was completely crushed by this. How could they do this to a boy who was merely stressed with his home life? They never tried to talk to him, they never let him open up to them. His father had failed him, and his mother was dead. Instead they treated the problem like an issue that could just be solved with medication or a therapy. They called it Isolation Therapy as if it was some real cure.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This story doesn\u2019t end in some cruel bloody way, It ends with Joseph going home. He smiled as he left with his father. He repeated how happy he was to go home, and I think his father would have been taken aback by his behavior if he wasn\u2019t slightly drunk himself. Whatever medication Joseph was on I\u2019m sure they kept him on it. I had hoped that Joseph had gotten off of it and recovered, but sadly two months later he had made a noose and killed himself.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d like to say how sad I am that Joseph had done this to himself, but truthfully I think he was tired of putting up a front and knew if he went back to pot and seclusion they\u2019d toss him back in a cell, to him the only escape was a rope. I wish I could have done something to help him, but there was again nothing that could be done. Tons of teenagers came in, and were treated as poorly as Joseph. A majority of them had broken homes, and the asylum was just the place they were tossed to get them away from home. The excuses ranged from sexual promiscuity to drug abuse to the ambiguous term \u201cunusual behavior\u201d. They were all tossed in like orphans and treated as lab rats.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To Joseph, I truly hope you are in a better place. I hope that you found your mother in heaven and you are in her arms once more. I hope if nothing else you are truly resting in peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Last Story](https://wh.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/63ax5h/my_uncle_worked_in_an_insane_asylum_a_human/)  \n  \n\n\nI know some of the readers have told you that they were in an asylum or mental hospital.
