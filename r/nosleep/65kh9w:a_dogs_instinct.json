After trying on tons of dresses that previous fit me last summer, I came to conclusions A) it looks like a flowly, safe dress kinda night, B) I might have overdone it during holidays, and c) tomorrow first thing it was time to get back in shape. When I finally woke up on Sunday, I spent the whole day swearing I would never drink like that again (like I have many times before), nursing my hangover, cuddling with my dog and not exercising. After work on Monday, I finally got my butt in gear and threw on some workout clothes and started heading for the door. My dog followed me closely at my heels and I decided she could probably use a jog herself. She&amp;#39;s a master at begging for table scraps and I give in far to often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the best place to run is at the local park. I live on the outskirts of the city suburbs, so right after my town is all rural area. The park is right next to the river and its paths extend right into the woods. There is also a man made fishing pond with a path wrapping around. Most people tend to use this path since it stays in the main park area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After parking my car, I decided to take the one into the woods since all the people on the pond would make it hard to run with a dog. I put in my headphones, played my music, and started my running app. During the walking warm up, my dog was excited to be out and sniffing everything with her little tail wagging. We were almost to the first turn in the path, which would prevent us from being seen from the main park, and the ding to run went off. I took about three strides and there was tension on the leash and then it went shoting in front of me with just the collar on. I flipped around, ready to chase after my dog, but she was just sitting there staring into the woods. Relieved she didnt make a run for it, I put her collar back on and tighted it up. I tried to proceed down the path, but she just stubbornly sat and stared. I looked where she was staring, but there was nothing in trees. She started backing up and pulling on the leash and slowly dragging me to the path entrance. Not wanting to stress her out more, I started for the entrance and she broke out in a sprint, dragging me along. When we finally got to the main part, she calm down and let me finish my run on the pond path. I went home and completely forgot about her weird behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I work, I was scrolling on the internet and saw a post from the news station. A body was found at our park and the park would be closed until further notice. No other information was being released for now. I checked back every day for more information, but didnt have anything new until today. Elizabeth ****** was found in the park woods Tuesday morning. Her estimated time of death was Monday evening 5pm-8pm. Police are still in the woods searching for all parts of Elizabeth. The killer has yet to be identified. They have pictures of her everywhere. The worse part of all of this, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I was the last one to see alive. As my dog was dragging me out of the woods, she was running in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When your dogs are weary or scared, you should probably listen. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "At first it wasn't a story worth sharing, but after recent events  I realize it could be warning for others. \n\nLast Saturday my friends finally convinced me to go to the new club that opened in the city.
