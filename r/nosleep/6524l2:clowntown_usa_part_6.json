The one thing I wanted to do above all else, run far far away, I was totally unable to do. My son, my poor mutated boy, shivered now that his rage-fever had cooled. I did the only thing left to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made a game of it, sneaking through town. I told my son if we were caught we would lose, leaving out what exactly we would lose. He loved it, held my hand throughout the whole game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The front door of our house hung open and crooked on its hinges. I made Joshua wait in the bushes while I made sure the way was clear. The inside of the house was trashed. Apparently my absence hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The walls of my front hall were no longer blank. Someone had spray-painted crude clown figures not only over the original mural space, but over every wall and part of the ceiling. I made sure to go through every room, jabbing my knife into spaces where people could hide. I found no one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of my personal belongings were smashed. Joshua\u2019s goldfish lay dead on the ground in the wet stain of his destroyed tank. In the ruins of these things were more clown statues, grinning like they were the ones that had done the smashing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gestured Joshua inside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told Joshua the lights were broken, that we were going to play a special game now. I made it look like we had come back to ransack the house for supplies. I took things and tied them up in a bundle with one of my sheets. I put a line of pillows beneath mine and Joshua\u2019s covers, so it looked someone was sleeping there. I gathered up a sleeping bag, a lantern, the food, and Josh\u2019s plastic canteen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I hid us both in the basement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I arranged the boxes I had yet to unpack so that they hid us from sight. I was smart enough not to lock the door, locking it would just bring more questions. I wanted them to think I was attempting a journey. I wanted them to look for me anywhere but the house. I told Joshua that we were still playing our game, that now we had to hide in the basement. If he heard any grownup calling his name, he had to remain completely silent. If he made any noise, we lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slept what was left of that night with my son in my arms. It nearly felt like we were a family again. I woke up the next morning and Josh was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had made a mistake in my planning. The door was still firmly shut, and my noisemaking trap of tin cans scattered over the top step remained in place, but one of the small basement windows gaped open. It had been locked from the inside. I had told him not to listen to a grownup calling his name, but I hadn\u2019t cautioned him against children calling him as only children could do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went upstairs to arm myself. Through my open front door, I spied one of the two Clanton cops, the one who had skulked on my lawn while his partner threatened me. Too late to draw back, he saw me. I walked up and had my hand on the doorknob before he could just walk in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cop(was he Ted or Dylan? Did it matter?) did his best to intimidate me, leaning over and breathing rank coffee breath in my face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLittle lady,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re in a whole heap of trouble.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI mean it. I got some questions you need to answer.\u201d He put his hand on the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I smiled at him. \u201cUntil I see a badge or a gun, you\u2019re not coming in.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He scowled. He wasn\u2019t as physically intimidating as his partner, and probably knew it. The cop turned so that I could see the handgun holster at his belt. Just as I suspected. They had no badges, probably no more authority than the townsfolk bought for them. My smile widened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s neat. You ever shot anyone with it? You think you even know how?\u201d I was babbling. I had only gotten a few hours of sleep and I couldn\u2019t remember when I&amp;#39;d last eaten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cop shoved the door, so I stepped back and let him intrude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cExcuse the mess. I guess I&amp;#39;m not the best housekeeper in the world.\u201d I looked him dead in the eye as I pushed a clown off a bookshelf so it broke on the floor. \u201cCan I get you something? Coffee? Whiskey? Some bullets?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He looked me up and down, not sure of what to make of me. \u201cI\u2019ll have a cup. You have one too. Have a couple.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made him sit in the living room, on a hard-backed chair because someone had slashed the couch and all its stuffing was bleeding out. I kept up a stream of talk as I went to the kitchen to start a pot of coffee. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019d have you say hi to Josh, but I can\u2019t seem to find him this morning,\u201d I called as I rummaged through drawers.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s Missy Jackson\u2019s birthday party. He got an invitation.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cReally? A birthday? Must be a big occasion! Are the banks closed?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re in a lot of trouble, ma\u2019am, I hope you know that.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI know, I must look a mess.\u201d I peeked out of the kitchen at him. The chair\u2019s back was turned to me.  \u2018It\u2019s tough being a single mother. My hair must look like I slept in a bush.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He glared at me. \u201cI\u2019m serious. You know what you are? A shit-stirrer. We\u2019ve never had this much trouble, not with anyone else. You think you can do whatever you want? We\u2019re a family here, and we take care of our own. I\u2019m here to find out if you\u2019re one of us, or...\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c...or a tourist?\u201d I went to the knife block and drew out one that had been an anniversary gift from my husband. It was an expensive one, the metal looked like woodgrain. The weight felt nice in my hand. \u201cI dunno, it doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m on vacation. Do I seem more tan to you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTed thinks you\u2019re an unfit mother.\u201d Ah, so this one was Dylan. \u201cHe says we\u2019re within our rights to appropriate custody from you, seeing as you\u2019re acting erratically. I wanted to speak with you, see one last time whether you\u2019ll listen to reason.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s generous of you. Do you like your coffee black or with cream,\u201d I said as I stabbed him in the neck. He buckled over, grasping the wound with a shocked look on his face. I stabbed the other side, then the back of his head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dylan slumped over and bled out on my living room rug. I watched him die and tried to figure out why I didn\u2019t feel anything. I came to the conclusion that it didn\u2019t really matter, and that I needed to get my son.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spencer Jackson had the biggest house in town. I did not even need directions, because I knew where it would be. Dead center in the middle of Clanton. The place where the only road ended. The road that was completely deserted as I set off on my journey, bloody knife in my hand and three more hidden around my body. It looked like the entire town emptied out for Missy Jackson\u2019s birthday. No shocker there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jackson\u2019s house was a large brick mansion with a lawn the size of a state park. The lawn was covered with people talking, drinking, pretending to have a good time. And into this, I brought my madness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked right up to the party and started screaming my son\u2019s name. \u201cJoshuaaaaa! &lt;em&gt;Joshuaaaaaa&lt;/em&gt;!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every adult within earshot looked at me with panic. I could see where the children were playing, in a fenced-off area separate from the adults, and pushed my way through the crowd. They tried blocking me with their bodies, but once I brought up the knife they parted like the red sea. I laughed at that. I found just about everything funny. Nothing felt real anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spencer was up on the deck with his cronies, wearing a tuxedo very much like the one in the picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMrs. Hughes,\u201d he yelled out to me, \u201cwhat in god\u2019s name do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t answer, just made a beeline for the children. The other parents stood around like a bunch of statues, terrified looks on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The children had been playing their cruel games with a pile of stuffed animals that were disintegrating into a pile of fluff. My son was in a corner of the fenced area, being pinned back by the same kids I had seen around Missy Jackson time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded to them. \u201cLet Joshua come to me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One boy whose mouth was so twisted he could barely close it sneered at me. \u201cNo.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I held up my bloodstained knife. \u201cWanna see something cool?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their eyes lit up and they released Joshua, who took about two steps towards me before getting sidetracked by the pile of stuffed animals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJoshua,\u201d I said, \u201ccome to me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He frowned. \u201cBut I wanna &lt;em&gt;playyyyy&lt;/em&gt;\u2026.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRemember what I told you last night? We need to go now.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The adults all hung back from the children\u2019s pen a good fifty yards. Cowards. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Missy Jackson pushed through the crowd, carrying a pincushion with some wicked-looking hatpins. She was wearing a dress that, if it wasn\u2019t the one from the photograph, was very similar. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She grimaced at me. \u201cGo away, you stupid wady. I wanna pway with the new boy.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHis name is Joshua, and I say you can\u2019t play with him.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI wanna!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell you can\u2019t!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGo \u2018way so I can pway with him!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy did you make him come here?\u201d I asked, \u201cis it because you\u2019re so ugly no one else wants to &lt;em&gt;pway&lt;/em&gt; with you?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could hear snickering from the children behind me. Missy turned a bright red, redder than I&amp;#39;ve ever seen a human being go. I smelled something hot and chemical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spencer Jackson appeared behind his daughter, immediately going into appeasement mode. \u201cMissy, darling, let\u2019s go open your presents. You have lots of lovely new toys!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Missy didn\u2019t let up. \u201cI want that new boy, daddy. Get him for me or I&amp;#39;ll bwow up!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spencer wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. He looked at me. I smiled at him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJoshua, come to mommy.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My son still hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJoshua? I\u2019m leaving.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His little face fell. \u201cMommy don\u2019t leave, mommy don\u2019t leave!\u201d he chanted as he hopped the little fence and ran to grasp my side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t think you appreciate the gravity of what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Spencer hissed at me. He tried to grab my son\u2019s arm. I nicked his hand with my knife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI know what I&amp;#39;m doing,\u201d I said, \u201cI&amp;#39;m taking my son and leaving and none of you are going to stop me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you crazy? You walk into my daughter\u2019s party with a knife, demanding your son stop playing a harmless party game?\u201d he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m well within my rights to call the authorities.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWho, the cops?\u201d I grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll wait here. Hell, I&amp;#39;ll even dial. We wouldn\u2019t want this to &lt;em&gt;blow up&lt;/em&gt;, would we?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His face fell as he finally realized that I knew. \u201cYou\u2019re putting us all in danger, your son included. Come inside and let\u2019s discuss this like adults.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo thanks,\u201d I said, jabbing the knife at him so he fell back, \u201cI&amp;#39;m done talking to you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Missy was so red she practically steamed. Her eyes disappeared into the folds of skin around them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI wan\u2019 the new boy,\u201d she hissed, \u201cI wan\u2019 him.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDenise!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all looked up. There was Arthur Brown, jogging up with his hand pressed to his side. He had done that day\u2019s greasepaint in a hurry, it was lopsided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this,\u201d he said, holding a hand up, \u201cgo wait for me out front.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spencer stomped between us. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, clown?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arthur glared at him. \u201cSaving your ass. Shut up and do nothing, it\u2019s what you\u2019re good at.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI wanna pway!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIs this your idea? We\u2019re going to have to curtail some of your privileges\u2014\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPrivileges?\u201d Arthur laughed. \u201cWhat privileges? You pretend I don\u2019t exist! I\u2019m the one who raises your goddamn kids for you, asshole!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCwown pway with me!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMissy not now\u2014listen, if you don\u2019t diffuse this situation we\u2019re going to have to reconsider not turning you in for your son\u2019s death\u2014\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2014&lt;em&gt;don\u2019t you dare bring my son into this&lt;/em&gt;\u2014\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Missy shrieked so loud my eardrums hurt. She didn\u2019t go boom. No, she did the last thing I&amp;#39;d have expected. She snatched the knife out of my hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCwown not funny!\u201d she screamed, and rammed it into Arthur\u2019s gut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All noise stopped. Arthur made eye contact with me. I remember seeing a whole range of emotions pass through his eyes at that last second, but what stuck with me most was the last: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;relief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arthur Brown slumped to the ground, blood seeping through his only shirt and staining his polka-dotted clown suspenders. Clanton\u2019s only living, breathing clown lay dead at my feet. And behind me, I could hear the rush as all the children of Clanton took a sharp breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/62wn5k/clowntown_usa_part_1/)\n\n[part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/639cms/clowntown_usa_part_2/)\n\n[part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/63p1ny/clowntown_usa_part_3/)\n\n[part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/643mom/clowntown_usa_part_4/)\n\n[part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64mz2u/clowntown_usa_part_5/)\n\nI stood in the baseball diamond of the school and watched search parties comb the hills for me.

Do I seem more tan to you?\n\n\u201cTed thinks you\u2019re an unfit mother.\u201d Ah, so this one was Dylan. \u201cHe says we\u2019re within our rights to appropriate custody from you, seeing as you\u2019re acting erratically. I wanted to speak with you, see one last time whether you\u2019ll listen to reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s generous of you. Do you like your coffee black or with cream,\u201d I said as I stabbed him in the neck. He buckled over, grasping the wound with a shocked look on his face. I stabbed the other side, then the back of his head.\n\nDylan slumped over and bled out on my living room rug. I watched him die and tried to figure out why I didn\u2019t feel anything. I came to the conclusion that it didn\u2019t really matter, and that I needed to get my son.\n\nSpencer Jackson had the biggest house in town. I did not even need directions, because I knew where it would be. Dead center in the middle of Clanton. The place where the only road ended. The road that was completely deserted as I set off on my journey, bloody knife in my hand and three more hidden around my body. It looked like the entire town emptied out for Missy Jackson\u2019s birthday. No shocker there. \n\nThe Jackson\u2019s house was a large brick mansion with a lawn the size of a state park. The lawn was covered with people talking, drinking, pretending to have a good time. And into this, I brought my madness.\n\nI walked right up to the party and started screaming my son\u2019s name. \u201cJoshuaaaaa! *Joshuaaaaaa*!\u201d\n\nEvery adult within earshot looked at me with panic. I could see where the children were playing, in a fenced-off area separate from the adults, and pushed my way through the crowd. They tried blocking me with their bodies, but once I brought up the knife they parted like the red sea. I laughed at that. I found just about everything funny. Nothing felt real anymore.\n\nSpencer was up on the deck with his cronies, wearing a tuxedo very much like the one in the picture.\n\n\u201cMrs. Hughes,\u201d he yelled out to me, \u201cwhat in god\u2019s name do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t answer, just made a beeline for the children. The other parents stood around like a bunch of statues, terrified looks on their faces.\n\nThe children had been playing their cruel games with a pile of stuffed animals that were disintegrating into a pile of fluff. My son was in a corner of the fenced area, being pinned back by the same kids I had seen around Missy Jackson time and time again.\n\nI nodded to them. \u201cLet Joshua come to me.\u201d\n\nOne boy whose mouth was so twisted he could barely close it sneered at me. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nI held up my bloodstained knife. \u201cWanna see something cool?\u201d\n\nTheir eyes lit up and they released Joshua, who took about two steps towards me before getting sidetracked by the pile of stuffed animals.\n\n\u201cJoshua,\u201d I said, \u201ccome to me.\u201d\n\nHe frowned. \u201cBut I wanna *playyyyy*\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember what I told you last night? We need to go now.\u201d\n\nThe adults all hung back from the children\u2019s pen a good fifty yards. Cowards. \n\nMissy Jackson pushed through the crowd, carrying a pincushion with some wicked-looking hatpins. She was wearing a dress that, if it wasn\u2019t the one from the photograph, was very similar. \n\nShe grimaced at me. \u201cGo away, you stupid wady. I wanna pway with the new boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis name is Joshua, and I say you can\u2019t play with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanna!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell you can\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cGo \u2018way so I can pway with him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you make him come here?\u201d I asked, \u201cis it because you\u2019re so ugly no one else wants to *pway* with you?\u201d\n\nI could hear snickering from the children behind me. Missy turned a bright red, redder than I've ever seen a human being go. I smelled something hot and chemical.\n\nSpencer Jackson appeared behind his daughter, immediately going into appeasement mode. \u201cMissy, darling, let\u2019s go open your presents. You have lots of lovely new toys!\u201d\n\nMissy didn\u2019t let up. \u201cI want that new boy, daddy. Get him for me or I'll bwow up!\u201d\n\nSpencer wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. He looked at me. I smiled at him.\n\n\u201cJoshua, come to mommy.\u201d\n\nMy son still hesitated.\n\n\u201cJoshua? I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\n\nHis little face fell. \u201cMommy don\u2019t leave, mommy don\u2019t leave!\u201d he chanted as he hopped the little fence and ran to grasp my side.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you appreciate the gravity of what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Spencer hissed at me. He tried to grab my son\u2019s arm. I nicked his hand with my knife.\n\n\u201cI know what I'm doing,\u201d I said, \u201cI'm taking my son and leaving and none of you are going to stop me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you crazy? You walk into my daughter\u2019s party with a knife, demanding your son stop playing a harmless party game?\u201d he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m well within my rights to call the authorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho, the cops?\u201d I grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll wait here. Hell, I'll even dial. We wouldn\u2019t want this to *blow up*, would we?\u201d\n\nHis face fell as he finally realized that I knew. \u201cYou\u2019re putting us all in danger, your son included. Come inside and let\u2019s discuss this like adults.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d I said, jabbing the knife at him so he fell back, \u201cI'm done talking to you.\u201d\n\nMissy was so red she practically steamed. Her eyes disappeared into the folds of skin around them.\n\n\u201cI wan\u2019 the new boy,\u201d she hissed, \u201cI wan\u2019 him.\u201d\n\n\u201cDenise!\u201d\n\nWe all looked up. There was Arthur Brown, jogging up with his hand pressed to his side. He had done that day\u2019s greasepaint in a hurry, it was lopsided.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this,\u201d he said, holding a hand up, \u201cgo wait for me out front.\u201d\n\nSpencer stomped between us. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, clown?\u201d\n\nArthur glared at him. \u201cSaving your ass. Shut up and do nothing, it\u2019s what you\u2019re good at.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanna pway!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this your idea? We\u2019re going to have to curtail some of your privileges\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPrivileges?\u201d Arthur laughed. \u201cWhat privileges? You pretend I don\u2019t exist! I\u2019m the one who raises your goddamn kids for you, asshole!\u201d\n\n\u201cCwown pway with me!\u201d\n\n\u201cMissy not now\u2014listen, if you don\u2019t diffuse this situation we\u2019re going to have to reconsider not turning you in for your son\u2019s death\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014*don\u2019t you dare bring my son into this*\u2014\u201d\n\nMissy shrieked so loud my eardrums hurt. She didn\u2019t go boom. No, she did the last thing I'd have expected. She snatched the knife out of my hand.\n\n\u201cCwown not funny!\u201d she screamed, and rammed it into Arthur\u2019s gut.\n\nAll noise stopped. Arthur made eye contact with me. I remember seeing a whole range of emotions pass through his eyes at that last second, but what stuck with me most was the last: \n\nrelief.\n\nArthur Brown slumped to the ground, blood seeping through his only shirt and staining his polka-dotted clown suspenders. Clanton\u2019s only living, breathing clown lay dead at my feet. And behind me, I could hear the rush as all the children of Clanton took a sharp breath.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Series", "id": "6524l2", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 286, "report_reasons": null, "author": "demons_dance_alone", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_6524l2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.nosleep", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "flair-series", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/6524l2/clowntown_usa_part_6/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492071553.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6524l2/clowntown_usa_part_6/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Clowntown, USA [part 6]", "created_utc": 1492042753.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 27, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 286}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6524l2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ts4f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NoSleepAutoBot", "parent_id": "t3_6524l2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It looks like there may be more to this story.
