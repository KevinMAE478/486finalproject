At that time what Theresa had said about the \u201cmean ones\u201d hadn\u2019t clicked, and I was just weighing the options of working in a haunted store versus my only real other option of applying to the Sonic near my high school where my friend worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being the teenager I was, I picked the better paying job with the ghost, which I\u2019m still not sure I regret or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next time I saw Matilda was just a few days later. Maybe she\u2019d been giving the new kid a break the first two weeks. But anyway, we\u2019d closed and within a few minutes of the mall clearing out, I saw her moving along the walls, making that tick-tick-tick-ticking as she seemed to want to look at every single piece of clothing on each rack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It startled me at first, but she seemed to be ignoring me, so I took a deep breath (and a sip or two from one of Theresa\u2019s hidden bottles), and started going about the usual process of cleaning and straightening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept an eye on Matilda the whole time and was surprised to find that, if anything, she seemed to leave the store neater where she passed. I saw her straighten a few articles on their hangers after she examined them, and once, I swear, she even folded up a t-shirt that had been left on the ground and put it back on the display. Theresa thinks I\u2019m making that one up, though. Once she made a circuit of the store, she just wasn\u2019t there the next time I looked around for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That isn\u2019t to say all my encounters with her were so mild, or even helpful. She had a habit of sneaking up on you, which, I guess, isn\u2019t all that hard for an entity composed of consciousness and ectoplasm, but it\u2019s still pretty disconcerting when you\u2019re balancing six boxes of shoes in your arms and you round a corner to see a rotten, convulsing, undead face peering at you sullenly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the time I was on a ladder replacing the bulb in a spot light and leaned down for the box to see those gaping, lipless jaws bared up at me, with, I\u2019m pretty sure were maggots pooled down her throat. I sprained my ankle pretty bad on that fall. I think Matilda might have felt bad, because she just made her normal trip around the store for a few weeks after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over all, she really was pretty harmless, at least by ghost standards. Absolutely grotesque to look at, but like Theresa said, she pretty much just minded her own business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was one occasion in particular I saw her bad side, though. It\u2019d been about two years since I\u2019d started, and I\u2019d found myself hanging around the store longer than I\u2019d planned when I was hired. Theresa had even made me a shift manager at that point, and I was closing the store by myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On this night, we\u2019d just received some new stock and I was doing a quick inventory then I\u2019d been making a display for the line in between helping customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I was cleaning up and tearing down boxes, Matilda appeared, staring at the new merchandise.

I felt it in every cell of my body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forcing myself to open eyes I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d squeezed shut, I saw the aftermath of the scream. The display was a wreck.
