[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "nosleep", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been three months since my grandfather&amp;#39;s sudden death. He was found alone in his house, slumped over in his favorite armchair. Even though his lifelong habit of smoking had caused irreversible damage to his lungs, no one had expected him to only live to be 59 years old. My grandfather had been a well respected member of the tiny community of Sleekfall, Maryland, and his death had certainly caused much grief. I guess that&amp;#39;s part of the reason my family waited three months to put his house up for sale. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My grandfather was a man of few possessions, which became more and more evident as I helped my parents clean out his bedroom drawers and kitchen cupboards. His wife had passed away ten years prior, and it was obvious that the china cabinet hadn&amp;#39;t been touched since. The beautiful plates and other cutlery were caked in dust. After cleaning off the plates in hot, soapy water, I noticed they had a rather odd design. On the outer rim of each plate, there was a strange inscription. It read: &amp;quot;NEVER FORGET WHAT THE FLAME HAS DONE. NEVER FORGET WHAT IT&amp;#39;S PURPOSE IS.&amp;quot; When I asked my parents about it, they brushed off my question and told me to go clean the basement. I came to the conclusion that they knew what the inscription meant, but they weren&amp;#39;t going to say anything. Annoyed, I walked down the steep stairs that led to my grandfather&amp;#39;s basement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like the rest of the house, there wasn&amp;#39;t much to be found. There were two cardboard boxes stacked against one of the walls, along with an old box t.v., a broken chair, and an empty toolbox. I opened the first box. It contained three scrapbooks. The first was full of pictures of me and my parents when I was younger. Nothing special. The second was just pictures of the time my grandma and grandpa went to Disneyland in the 80s. Again, nothing special. But the third scrapbook had some of the strangest photos I&amp;#39;d ever seen. From what I could tell, it was my grandparent&amp;#39;s wedding. But all the guests were wearing long, red robes that reached the floor and displayed golden rings in their noses. There was one photo in particular that sent chills up my spine. It was a photo of my grandparents holding their bleeding forearms over a small flame. My mind jumped back to the inscription on the china plates. Was my family hiding something from me? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the second box. It was full of old VHS tapes, most of which were labelled. Most of them were recorded nature documentaries and cooking shows, but there was one tape in the bottom of the box that caught my attention. It was a vibrant red color. I picked it up and examined it for any labels. There were none. I glanced at the old box t.v., wondering if I should plug it in and watch the tape just to see what was on it. I was so deep in thought that I didn&amp;#39;t notice the sound of someone walking down the stairs. It was just my cousin, Vida. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we were growing up, Vida and I were best friends. We were close to the same age and attended the same school. I remember exploring the forest with Vida and racing toy boats in the creek with her on warm summer afternoons.  But when high school began, Vida and I grew apart. She dyed her long, golden hair a hideous purple color and chopped it short. Her makeup was thick and dark, and she insisted on wearing all black every day. Whenever I tried to talk to her in school, she stared at me like she&amp;#39;d never seen me before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Pete, my mom is picking up some dinner, and she wants to know if you want anything.&amp;quot; She said, crossing her arms across her chest. She had protested cleaning the house because it meant she would have to miss some hardcore metal  concert. Needless to say, she hadn&amp;#39;t gotten her way. She was making sure everyone knew she was NOT happy about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I placed the red tape back in the box. &amp;quot;No thanks,&amp;quot; I muttered, wondering if I should tell her about my strange findings. As she began to walk back up the stairs, I called her name. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She glared down at me. &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I-I need to show you something.&amp;quot; I stuttered, holding out the red tape and wedding scrapbook. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vida snatched the scrapbook and began flipping through it. &amp;quot;This is just pictures of Disneyland.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry, wrong scrapbook.&amp;quot; I replied, handing her the right one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her eyes widened as she looked through the disturbing images. &amp;quot;What the-?&amp;quot; She slammed the scrapbook shut and picked up the tape. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s on this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shrugged. &amp;quot;No idea. Care to watch it with me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She plugged in the t.v. and nodded slowly. &amp;quot;Did you see the weird words on the china plates? Do you think it has something to do with the flame grandma and grandpa were standing by during their wedding?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s what I was thinking.&amp;quot; I said, turning on the t.v. Surprisingly, it worked. I slipped in the tape and took a deep breath. Hopefully, it was just another nature documentary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t. the woman on the screen was wearing the same red robe and golden nose ring as the people in the wedding photos. She smiled, revealing perfect, white teeth. Her brown hair was an odd style for a grown woman: pigtails. &amp;quot;Hello,&amp;quot; She began in a smooth, happy tone. &amp;quot;Let me be the first to welcome you to Living Flame.. The fact that you&amp;#39;re viewing this tape tells me that you&amp;#39;ve already completed the necessary rituals to enter Living Flame.  Here, we believe through personal sacrifice, we can maintain a perfect society, just as the Flame intends. As long as you pay your monthly dues, you will have the privilege of remaining in the commune. At the end of this tape, please report to room 107 for further instructions. Thank you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tape ended. &amp;quot;What was that?&amp;quot; I asked, removing the tape. &amp;quot;Do you think our parents know anything about this Living Flame thing?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We shouldn&amp;#39;t say anything to them.&amp;quot; Vida answered quickly. &amp;quot;If they haven&amp;#39;t told us anything yet they aren&amp;#39;t going to tell us anything now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I asked my parents about the plates, they wouldn&amp;#39;t answer me.&amp;quot; I stated. &amp;quot;Still...I want to get to the bottom of this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vida opened the scrapbook. &amp;quot;I think I found our first clue.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the front of the scrapbook, there was a small note. It read: &lt;em&gt;Congratulations on your marriage! I hope you fill this scrapbook with your favorite pictures from this special day. Much love, Harper Kolowski&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled out my phone and Googled the name &lt;em&gt;Harper Kolowski&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;quot;No way,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;It says here that Harper Kolowski is the owner of a diner up in Frostburg.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But that&amp;#39;s less than an hours drive from here.&amp;quot; Vida said. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s no way that&amp;#39;s a coincidence. Harper Kolowski isn&amp;#39;t exactly a common name.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I say we ditch school tomorrow and drive up to the diner.&amp;quot; I suggested, thankful I had a car. &amp;quot;But if you don&amp;#39;t want to skip school, we could always go Saturday.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vida grinned. &amp;quot;Do I look like I&amp;#39;m afraid of skipping school?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lets meet at school tomorrow morning and head up to Frostburg.&amp;quot; I said, adding, &amp;quot;And don&amp;#39;t tell anyone about this, even your boyfriend.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My lips are sealed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If only I had known what I was getting myself into...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "It had been three months since my grandfather's sudden death.
