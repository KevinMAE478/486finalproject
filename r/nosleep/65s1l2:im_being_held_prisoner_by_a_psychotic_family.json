I&amp;#39;m a twenty year old guy from Louisiana and I desperately need help. I&amp;#39;ll try to keep this short, she&amp;#39;ll be back any minute now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friend and I are urban explorers of sorts. We like to seek out old, abandoned properties and have a look around on the inside. Word got out amongst our circle of friends that there was a massive lodge in the woods that had been abandoned for a few years, and so we started preparing for another excursion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a long drive before we got anywhere near the property, but when we did it was blatantly obvious how out of the way this place is. My 4G is spotty at best - but it works - and at times the signal would completely vanish. No cell towers in sight. Old school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I digress. Walking up to the dilapidated building sent a shiver down my spine. I had a feeling in my gut that we had no place being here, that we should turn back. Sure as hell wish I&amp;#39;d listened to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We began to look around the building for an entry way. The windows were boarded up, as was the front door, but the crawl space underneath the deck was smashed open, leaving enough space to crawl in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cameron went in first, complaining about getting dirt on his jeans as I followed behind him. The two of us shuffled around in the darkness with barely enough room to navigate as we looked for an entrance into the house.

There were people there, if you can call them that. All I remember was hearing Cameron scream as something smashed into my head and everything went black.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I woke up in this cell. It&amp;#39;s quite big, and in some kind of basement. The door&amp;#39;s heavy. No way to bust it. It&amp;#39;s damp and gloomy, with a stained mattress on some springy bedframe. My bag was gone when I woke up, but I suppose they overlooked my phone in my pockets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was pacing about my cell when I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. Pushing my phone into my pocket, it turned out to be some lady, dressed in rags and with a wild look in here eye. She looks like a fucking meth addicted corpse, smells about the same too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to shout at her, but all that came out wad a squeak as she shoved a tray of some rotting food under the door. She smiled, showing her rotten teeth, and told me to eat up. Fuck. That.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried calling somebody, but I can&amp;#39;t connect to any calls. I don&amp;#39;t have any social media I can use to get a hold of anyone apart from Reddit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh Shit I can gear her coming.
