I was getting hung up on the word &lt;em&gt;ripe&lt;/em&gt;. The connotations implied I was getting ready to be harvested for food, but what entity would possibly choose me? I&amp;#39;ve never built on ancient Indian burial grounds or disrespected a primordial altar. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; once find out some guy&amp;#39;s gamer-tag password in high-school and stole his characters, but I hardly think that&amp;#39;s grounds for being tormented like this. There was absolutely nothing about my life which suggested I should be the target for this madness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten bucks was enough to get the homeless man talking. He said he gets thrown out of the park if he sleeps here too often, so he&amp;#39;s also set up a camp a little outside town in an aspen grove. The last time he was there, about three days ago, he witnessed a young girl (Jessica) being burned alive while an older woman (the Lady) watched. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, he didn&amp;#39;t actually say it in those words. His version had a lot more colorful phrases like &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d sooner eat my shit and eat the next shit afterward then go through that&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;she was screamin&amp;#39; like a dozen cats getting raped by a tiger.&amp;quot;.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I passed the last gas station in town, and he said the aspens were only about a ten minute walk from here. I&amp;#39;ve never been so tired in my life. This had to be more than sleep deprivation. It was a mortal weariness - a spiritual weariness, almost as though the bond tying me to this world was starting to unravel. I kicked a rock in my way, and I half expected my foot to pass straight through it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My best guess is that the Lady is some kind of Demon, and she sacrificed the girl and now she&amp;#39;s going after me. But the older voice in the recording had said &lt;em&gt;Jessica we agreed on this. It&amp;#39;s either you or him.&lt;/em&gt; How could Jessica have agreed to go through that? Was she tricked? What could she possibly stand to gain?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew something was wrong the second I stepped into the aspen grove. The cool morning breeze died the moment I passed the first trunk. The green leaves hung frozen and unnaturally static. The only thing that seemed to be moving was a steady stream of sap which poured down the trees. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not sap. Blood.&lt;/strong&gt; I could tell by the dark red streaks left behind on the white bark as it oozed toward the ground. I considered turning back right there, but the more unnatural it seemed, the more important it was for me to stop whatever was happening to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a clearing in the center of the grove where a circle of salt was lain upon the earth. Sitting in the center of the circle was a middle aged woman who I can only presume was &amp;#39;The Lady&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her face was plain and warm, although heavy lines of grief pulled her eyes downward. She wore jeans and a simple floral sweater - not exactly how I would have imagined a witch or Demon. Her eyes were closed; hands folded calmly in her lap as though she were waiting for someone - for who? For me? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re the Lady.&amp;quot; The moment I said it, I realized the homeless guy probably just called her that because he didn&amp;#39;t know her name. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re the one who burned Jessica alive.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She opened her eyes wide - comforting, soulful eyes. Eyes I would have trusted under any other circumstance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You weren&amp;#39;t supposed to find out until the end. I&amp;#39;m sorry you became involved in this,&amp;quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Until the end? You mean when I was ripe? What was going to happen then?&amp;quot; I wanted to hit her. To throw a stone - to yell - anything. But seeing her so calm and ordinary and sad, I couldn&amp;#39;t even raise my voice. The little energy I had left was fueled with indignation and anger, and without that it was all I could do just to keep standing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I told you, mother. He deserves to know what&amp;#39;s going on.&amp;quot; My skin prickled. Jessica was sitting outside the ring of salt - or at least what was left of her. The whole body was as black and rough as charcoal. All of her clothes had burned away, and the skin had burst in many places to reveal flayed sinew and cooked bone underneath. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You burned your own daughter alive?&amp;quot; I felt the rage building again, and I didn&amp;#39;t fight it. I had to hold onto it. This feeling was all that reminded me I was still awake - still &lt;em&gt;alive.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right, Jessica. I&amp;#39;ve been so selfish,&amp;quot; the woman sighed, and seeing her in such dismal misery, my anger was once more replaced by profound pity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when she explained everything to me. She wasn&amp;#39;t a Witch at all - only a mother who couldn&amp;#39;t bear to watch her daughter suffer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jessica was born with cerebral palsy - an incurable disorder which devastated her mind and body. She could barely swallow on her own, and her mother had done everything within the boundaries of medical science only to find that was not enough. After that, she&amp;#39;d tried alternative medicines - crystals, powders, ointments, prayers, and finally at the end of all things: rituals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her pursuit of the arcane led her subtly down the road of the occult until she discovered a process known to cure someone of all mortal ailments. In this vain hope, she burned Jessica alive in order for her to return purified. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The entity I made the pact with was willing and eager up until I lit the fire in her flesh,&amp;quot; her mother told me, &amp;quot;but afterwards he began to make demands before he would bring her back.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the Demon&amp;#39;s request (for that is what she found herself bound to), she planted seven black seeds in the food where she worked as a grocer. Only once the seeds had ripened within their victims would Jessica be allowed to return. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of her tale, the last of my strength had fled me and I was sitting beside her in the salt circle while Jessica watched from the outside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry,&amp;quot; she mumbled, no longer able to meet my gaze. &amp;quot;I had already burned her. I couldn&amp;#39;t stop before I...&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What happens? When they&amp;#39;re - when &lt;em&gt;we&amp;#39;re&lt;/em&gt; ripe?&amp;quot; I asked. My throat was choked and dry. I couldn&amp;#39;t help but glance back at Jessica&amp;#39;s grotesque disfiguration. Was that what was in store for me too? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The seeds are a portal into the other side,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Once they&amp;#39;re fully grown, the Demon will enter this world and -&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And possess me.&amp;quot; I finished. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so sorry. He told me you would just go in peace. I never thought one of you would find out what was going on -&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How long do I have?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. Not long. That&amp;#39;s why Jessica and I have been watching the people with the seeds. We&amp;#39;ve been waiting for them to burst.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you stop it?&amp;quot; I knew what her answer would be before I even asked, but I had to hear it anyway. If it meant bringing her daughter back, would she have stopped it even if she could?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. All I did was plant the seeds in the food. How they work is as much a mystery to me as you.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We stared at each other for a moment. I lifted my hands and felt their unnatural weight, and she flinched as though afraid I would strike her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you hate me?&amp;quot; she asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; And it was true. I hated that this was happening - I was afraid - but I didn&amp;#39;t hate her. I might have even done the same in her place. &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t hate you, because I need you.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I told you there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do -&amp;quot; she protested. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can stay with me here, and keep me company until it comes. You&amp;#39;re a lucky girl, Jessica. Your mother loves you very much.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t even have enough energy to sit upright anymore. I slumped against the Lady - it&amp;#39;s easier for me not to know her name - and she wrapped her arms around me. I pulled out my phone and considered calling my family, but I didn&amp;#39;t know how to make sense of my situation. Instead I&amp;#39;m posting my final update, which they will find and come to understand. The Lady held my hand as I rested against her, and together we are waiting for &lt;a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade\"&gt;oblivion to come&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel a great emptiness growing inside of me. If by some chance there is still something left of me after the seed is ripe, I will let you all know.
