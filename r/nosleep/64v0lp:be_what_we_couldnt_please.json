[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "nosleep", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d come from one of those small towns, where everyone knows everyone, and your graduating class was just barely shy of 100 people. I was a small town girl you could say. But, I didn\u2019t want that to be my legacy, so when I had the chance, I\u2019d moved to a bigger town (but not much bigger) in hopes of making my dreams come true. I\u2019d left my family, my friends, and my \u201csmall town\u201dbehind and hit the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 years and much debt later, I was trying to make ends meet while becoming that famous artist that my parents said I wouldn\u2019t become. I wasn&amp;#39;t filthy rich, but I was happy. I felt guilt for leaving but this was my life, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was busy busing tables at a Denny\u2019s during the day and pushing my beautiful landscapes and portrait paintings into critic\u2019s faces at night. That\u2019s how I heard about the White Barn restaurant. Located on the edge of town, it was a magnificent place. The place was said to have a dark past,but no one could tell you what had happened there. Bad luck some would say, or just a bad investment others chimed in. It had partially burned down a few years ago and renovations had just completed. The outside looked like your average farmhouse barn, with huge doors in the front that opened up wide so that customers could see in before they even stepped foot into the place. The outside was painted a beautiful snowy white, as well as the inside. There was only one blemish, a dark mark on the barn doors that wouldn\u2019t go away, even after many coats of paints. But, it didn\u2019t take away from the beauty. It had been divided into four huge rooms inside, with each connecting to the other, to make a huge circle. Everyone loved it. I had to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I hadn\u2019t seen my friends in almost 5 years, I decided to invite three of my friends, Jay, Sarah and Rebecca to come have lunch with me. I wanted to catch up, and slightly impress them, with the establishments that were located in my new town. Jay and Sarah had been married for 3 years and Rebecca hadn\u2019t moved away from her parents home yet. I was the only one to have ventured out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the White Barn, confused by the lack of cars in the parking lot. This place was supposed to be popular, even hopping you might say. It was raining and the air was cool, but I didn\u2019t think that would deter people from coming to the most popular place in town. But, I only saw two cars in the back lot, which I assumed would belong to staff. Not wanting to have my friends, I sent them all a quick text that I\u2019d be waiting inside, and I went inside to grab a table. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I was impressed by the outside, I was also impressed by the inside. It was huge. It seemed like the place kept going and going. But, it felt lonely inside. Like, something was missing. There was a chill to the air inside the White Barn. I quickly overlooked it as me being nervous about seeing my friends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow many will be in your party today?\u201d The hostess was cheery and seemed happy to see me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere will be four of us,\u201d I stated clearly. \u201cCan I go ahead and be seated?\u201d She smiled brightly and nodded. Grabbing four sets of silverware and four menus, Ms. Bright and Shiny led me to a table located in the middle of the restaurant.I ordered a sweet tea and started to look over the menu. I sat on the far right, so that my friend Rebecca could sit next to me, with Jay and Sarah across from us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn\u2019t heard any word from Rebecca, so I assumed she was on her way. There was no point in bothering her, we were all adults here, so I didn\u2019t call her again. Jay and Sarah had texted and said they were about 10 minutes away. I knew that gave us about a half hour in their case. I gazed around the restaurant and it was empty. I was the only one sitting in this massive dining room and it was overwhelming. I brushed the feeling off again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sweet tea had arrived but my friends had not. I wasn\u2019t concerned,I was just getting impatient. Just as I was about to check my phone, I saw Rebecca approach me. She looked beautiful. She was wearing a white dress and along red overcoat that flowed with every step she took. I stood from my chair to greet her and as I went to hug her, she pulled back from me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d she snipped at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just stood there and let my arms fall. Okay, she didn\u2019t want to be touched. I was okay with that, but damn, don\u2019t snap at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled out the chair next to me for her and she seemed to just glide into the seat. I looked around for our waitress so Rebecca could order a drink, but she wasn\u2019t anywhere to be found. Rebecca wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye. Instead she stared down at her menu, intently studying the soup choices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow have you been girly? I really do miss you.\u201d I said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo you?\u201d she quipped at me without even looking up from her menu. It stung to hear her use that tone with me and it almost brought tears to my eyes. This wasn\u2019t the Rebecca I was used to. All through high school this girl had been my best friend, but time and life had pulled us apart. I hadn\u2019t been the best friend to hear after we graduated, but she hadn\u2019t tried to stay in contact either. It hadn\u2019t helped that I\u2019d turned her down every time she\u2019d made a pass at me. I\u2019d always had boyfriends in school. She\u2019d had girlfriends. I knew that she was in love with me, but I wasn\u2019t interested. I loved her to death, but she wasn\u2019t my type. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah\u2026I mean, I\u2019ve been busy, but I didn\u2019t forget about you.\u201dThe anger in my voice must have been noticeable, because her head snapped up,and her eyes narrowed at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI didn\u2019t say you did. Look, I\u2019m sorry. Things haven\u2019t been the best for me. You could say I\u2019m having a rough day,\u201d she said, sarcasm dripping from her words. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, don\u2019t take it out on me, you twat,\u201d I said. Her face broke into a smile. Old nicknames still worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cShut up slut face,\u201d she joked back at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo, what have you been up to?\u201d I questioned. There was still no sign of Jay or Sarah and our waitress had also failed to reappear. I shivered. I hadn\u2019t noticed that I\u2019d gotten cold and I wrapped my arms around me trying to find some warmth. Had I always been able to see my breath? Or was that new too? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot much,\u201d Rebecca muttered. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t have much time.I can\u2019t be bothered with the small details.\u201d Her face was back to serious Rebecca. I was confused. This was lunch we were talking about. Lunch with friends to catch up on the small details of what we had been up to for the past few years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I retorted. \u201cStop being a jerk. This is supposed to be us catching up.\u201d She ignored me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou have to forgive yourself. It\u2019s not your fault. You have to move on with your life. You did what we all wanted to do. You got away from that town and you started a new life. What happens happens for a reason. You can\u2019t blame yourself forever. Be happy. Be yourself. Stop feeling bad for the past. I know I pushed you away. Be what we couldn\u2019t be, please. Make me proud,please.\u201d I looked at Rebecca\u2019s face. There were tears rolling down her cheeks.I didn\u2019t know what to say. I didn\u2019t understand where this was coming from. I just stared at her. What the hell was she talking about?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know how long we just sat there staring at each other. Tears rolling down her face and tears pooling in my eyes. I went to reach for her hand, but again, she pulled away. I don\u2019t know how much time had passed nor did I care. We just sat there crying. The room was still cold and I shivered again. Jay and Sarah needed to get here, now. I didn\u2019t like the awkward silence and I wanted the mood to change. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard commotion coming from the front of the restaurant and I looked up in time to see Sarah running at me. Relief washed over me. Now this meeting wouldn\u2019t be so awkward. I saw Jay not far behind her, carrying a huge box with a red bow wrapped around it. I looked at Rebecca and she nodded at me, and I ran to both of them and greeted them with hugs. As I pulled away to look at them both, I could see Sarah crying. What was it with everyone crying today? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you,\u201d Sarah sobbed. \u201cI needed to make sure you were okay.\u201d She buried her face in my shoulder. I looked at Jay with a bewildered look on my face. He just shrugged his shoulders, looking like he was at a loss for words. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve been here for almost an hour talking to Rebecca. She\u2019s right over there.\u201d I pointed to the table that we were sitting at and turned to wave at Rebecca. But, she wasn\u2019t there. \u201cWhere is she? She was just there,\u201d I sputtered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat do you mean? Talking to our Rebecca? That\u2019s impossible,\u201d Jay said in disbelief. \u201cLook, we just came from the scene of the accident. Rebecca died on her way here.\u201d I heard Sarah sob even louder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stared at the empty table. Jay handed me the box with the red bow wrapped around it. I opened it to see Rebecca\u2019s red coat inside. It had a note attached to it, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to read it. \u201cI can\u2019t Jay. Read it for me,\u201d I said with tears in my voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I stared at the empty table, I caught a glimpse of red passing through the next room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay read the note, his voice catching with unshed tears. \u201cBe what we couldn\u2019t,please.
