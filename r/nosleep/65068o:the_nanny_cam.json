Patrick is a regional marketing head and I am an in-house counsel at AIA. We have a son, Chester. He\u2019s five this year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After Chester was born, I left AIA to become a full-time mother. A month ago, however, my old boss, Lim, gave me a call. It was the day before Chester\u2019s fifth birthday, and I was at the party shop buying paper plates and cups for the kids that will be coming around.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have an opening, Lim said. Would you like to come back?    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hesitated. Did I really want to go back to the grind, the rat-race? But, as much as I love my baby boy, wiping poo in the middle of the night was getting tiring. And the thrill of closing a case tingled my spine pleasantly \u2026 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, I called Lim. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Patrick was supportive. Ever the pragmatic husband, he suggested we hire a maid. At first, I didn\u2019t like the idea. I told Patrick that mom can come down and help. But mom stays in a kampong in Hulu Langat back in Malaysia, while we are in Singapore, and we would have to work around some visa issues to get mom here for the long term. So, in the end, I agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never expected things would turn out like this.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The maid came to our household last month; just a few days before I started work. At first, I didn\u2019t like her. She always smelled funny and she never smiled. And whenever I talk to her, she just nods and says things like, \u201cah\u201d, \u201cya\u201d, \u201cokay\u201d, \u201cyes mam\u201d. I did try to get her to open up. But she never responded. The saving grace, I guess, was that her housework was good and she was a fast learner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first three weeks, everything went on normally and uneventfully.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was going through an M&amp;amp;A draft when Patrick called from overseas (he was on a work trip). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDarling, can you open the nanny cam app and see what\u2019s happening? Nina looks like she\u2019s acting a bit strange.\u201d (Nina is the name of our maid.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said I would, and he hung up. Had to rush off for a client meeting, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I tapped the nanny cam app open, I couldn\u2019t understand what Nina was doing at first. She was standing, facing the camera. I noticed that she was bent forward, her back hunched. Her long hair was all wet and tangled and it completely covered her face. (It looked like she just showered.)  What struck me as odd was the white, flowy robe she was wearing. &lt;em&gt;Where did that come from?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, her body started to wince and twitch and nod forward mechanically like a clockwork doll. Then, her arm shot straight out like a robot\u2019s and started pointing at something. Instinctively, I panned the camera in that direction. Nothing. Just our living room. At this point I could hardly breathe. Trembling, I panned it back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was when I saw its face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was not Nina\u2019s face at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing\u2019s face was completely white and had lots of wrinkles. Its eyes had no pupils. Just black irises. It stared at the camera for a few seconds. And with a sharp jab of pure horror, I realized that it was staring straight at &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. The gleam in its shiny black eyes was unmistakably malevolent. Evil. As it turned away from the nanny cam, its mouth, blood-red and quivering, slowly curled into a horrifying, evil smile. It continued to twitch and wince for a few moments as ice-cold specks of sweat caked my face and chest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, it collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran as fast as I could \u2013 not even bothering to tell my boss \u2013 and got into a cab. I realized I was crying \u2013 shaking, when I yelled my address to the cabbie. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s there. And Chester is with it, alone \u2013&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frantically, I called Chester.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cChester, &lt;em&gt;listen to mommy \u2014Okay?&lt;/em&gt; S-S-Stay in your room and don\u2019t come out. &lt;em&gt;I said Don\u2019t.

Frantically, I jabbed the lift buttons, praying with all my will that it was not too late. It felt like an eternity.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I got to our apartment, I swung the door open with a mad rush of adrenaline, fear, and anger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing but an eerie silence followed the tremendous &lt;em&gt;bang&lt;/em&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, a horrible thought suggested itself to me. Worse than any of the others which raced through my mind in the cab. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cChester! Chester!

On our way home, Chester asked me where was Nina. Who was going to make his morning cereal, if Nina Jiejie was gone? I put on a brave smile, and told him that Nina had an Really Serious Emergency back home in the Philippines and had to rush back.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I was firing off an email to Lim that I will be taking a one-week leave, Chester, probably unsatisfied with my lame-ass answer, asked again,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMommy, kenapa Nina hilang tiba-tiba?

The practitioners are referred to as Mangkuklamand. Like Voodoo a rag doll of the victim is used to injure their victims. The curse is complete when the Mangkuklamand obtains something from the victim such as a strand of hair, ties a string around the doll, and utters an incarnation often in a form of pig Latin. Believers maintain the only way to lift the curse is to compel the witch to remove the string from the doll or kill her. I suspect she will be contacting you soon to make financial arrangements to remove the string. As you live in Malaysia I am uncertain of your religion, however, regardless of what it is I urge you to contact your spiritual leader on this matter immediately.

The curse is complete when the Mangkuklamand obtains something from the victim such as a strand of hair, ties a string around the doll, and utters an incarnation often in a form of pig Latin.
