I think they went to the other cars to find better WiFi and lights that stay on.&amp;quot; I corrected him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ron stroked his short scruffy beard as if thinking about what I said. &amp;quot;Yes, some confusion is to be expected when one is whisked away so suddenly. You must be full of questions.&amp;quot; He responded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you have a phone charger? &amp;quot; I asked half jokingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Android or apple?&amp;quot; He asked back&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A...

I also noticed it gave off a sort of vibration as I held it and it had the brand name \u201cSouler Charger\u201d written on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But of course I do&amp;quot; Ron said with a weird grin.  &amp;quot;Mobile phones are wicked technology&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lol, This Ron guy sure is odd.&amp;quot; I said in my head.  I didn\u2019t care because my phone was back to 5% and I turned it on. This time the WiFi wouldn&amp;#39;t reconnect, it was password protected. Strange but I figured maybe the power outages reset the router to a default mode.

I checked the time, it still showed the same time as last time I checked. Maybe the battery dying messed it up, I don&amp;#39;t know. But I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I&amp;#39;m already late to work.
