I lived in constant, sleep-deprived fear as every strange shadow and every reflection of light on the wall signified the beginning of what I knew would be my end. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Logic told me the shadows were just piles of dirty clothes or my coat rack; that the reflections were just from passing cars on the street below. But logic fails in the face of terror. If it weren\u2019t for my older brother, Jason, with whom I shared the bedroom, there was a very real chance I would\u2019ve lost my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember my 13th birthday with the same detached sense of helpless violation as a victim of sexual assault. The day itself had been fine. Pleasant, even. My parents, who were always caring and supportive, did their best to make sure my birthday was enjoyable. They knew I was stressed. They knew I was anxious. I\u2019d never told them why, though. Only Jason knew, and he promised to keep it a secret.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the festivities, I went up to my room to play video games. I had two hours to play before lights-out. Jason sat on his immaculately-made bed, which was in stark contrast to my messy one, and watched, offering pointers as I died over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two hours went by quickly, and Dad came in to say it was time to go to sleep. He sat next to Jason on the bed and let me know he was proud of me; how I\u2019d been brave despite having a hard time and that things would get better. He wished me a happy birthday and kissed me goodnight, switching off the light on his way out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a little while, I felt pretty good. Like I said, I never told my parents exactly what had been bothering me. They\u2019d ask every so often, but they wouldn\u2019t pry. They could tell I was struggling. I heard them cleaning up downstairs, comforted by the fact they were still awake and alert. With a sense of security I hadn\u2019t felt in a long time, I drifted off to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a couple hours, I woke up and glanced at the clock. 11:26. I closed my eyes again. Before I could drift off to sleep, though, I noticed something. The room smelled bad. It wasn\u2019t a scent I could identify in the slightest - it was heavy and medicinal, but organic, too. Strange. Alien.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My eyelids lifted to the sight something shuffling toward my bed. I tried to shout and bolt away, but nothing worked. No movement, no sound. Only my eyes could receive my commands, and they stared, bulging out of my skull, as thing stood over my supine body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew it\u2019d finally come to me; this was the day I\u2019d anticipated and dreaded for years. I tried to make out the features on its face. All I could pick up on was hideousness. Deformity. A head with its upper-left quadrant missing. A mouth with no lower mandible and a shriveled tongue lolling down to its skinny neck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRobbie,\u201d it gurgled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It knew my name. It had been studying me and it knew my name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo more me, Robbie. No more me. Time to grow up.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its head came down and touched my forehead with the remains of its upper lip. As it tilted, maggots tumbled out of the cratered skull and landed on my face. They squirmed and tumbled onto my pillow. I felt them writhing against my ears and the sides of my neck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turned and walked toward Jason\u2019s bed. I tried over and over to scream as panic suffused the entirety of my being; the dark world around me blurred and I knew I was going to pass out. I knew I was going to fail my brother and not be able to warn him before the creature reached him. Before I lost consciousness - before I passed into a dreamless morass of black - I hated myself for being so useless. For being so weak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother\u2019s shrill, panicked shriek catapulted me back into reality. The room was bright. It was morning. Mom stood over Jason\u2019s bed wailing and sobbing and I heard Dad thundering across the hall from their bedroom. He burst into the room and immediately saw what Mom did. I watched his knees tremble, as if he were about to fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t move. Everything from the night was coming back and I knew - I was certain - Jason was dead. My big brother was gone. The certainty was overwhelming and searing tears of leaked down my cheeks onto the pillow. Something wriggled against my neck. I gasped and leapt to my feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything went slowly for the next few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned and saw the ring of maggots around my head print on the pillow. Dad was crossing the room to take me in his arms when he saw the bugs on my pillow and in my hair and whispered, \u201coh my God.\u201d He picked me up. He hadn\u2019t done that in years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rode out of the room in his strong arms. \u201cDon\u2019t look at your brother\u2019s bed,\u201d he ordered. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I looked as we exited. One glance was all I needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jason\u2019s body was on the bed. He was wearing a stained and dirt-encrusted blue suit. \u201cOh no,\u201d I thought to myself, as I took in his injuries: the torn lower mandible. The caved-in skull. The desiccated, green-gray skin that was mostly gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mom\u2019s wracking sobs had escalated to hysterical screaming. As Dad and I rounded the corner and headed downstairs, we heard her shouting, \u201chow did you come back? Why are you here? Who did this?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dad whispered in my ear as we walked. \u201cIt\u2019s okay sweetheart. It\u2019s okay. We don\u2019t know who did it, but it\u2019s going to be all right. It\u2019s not your brother anymore. It\u2019s just the body he doesn\u2019t need. He\u2019s still in heaven, okay? He\u2019s still in heaven.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to shake and Dad\u2019s voice cracked with emotion as he spoke those last words. \u201cHe\u2019s in heaven.\u201d It sounded horribly, horribly familiar. I closed my eyes and saw a coffin. I saw my parents standing next to it, sobbing. I saw a large, framed picture of Jason and a room full of friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I also saw the toys I was playing with. And I saw Jason sitting next to me. We played while everyone else cried. He grinned and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be upset, Robbie. I\u2019ll be here to help while you grow up. You don\u2019t have to feel sad.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My aunt, Lindsay, came up to me and stood in the exact same spot where Jason was sitting. I remember thinking it was strange she could do that, and then she knelt down and said, \u201che\u2019s in heaven\u201d before walking back to my cousins and uncle. Jason winked at my confused face, then we kept playing with our toys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJason died,\u201d I whispered to Dad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He nodded and I watched as he eyed the muddy footprints from the back door which led up the down the hall and up the stairs to my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou were probably too young to remember, but he loved you so, so much.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought back to all the fun we\u2019d had in our room over the years, all leading up to the video games on my 13th birthday the night before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re the same age he was now,\u201d Dad said, and tears freely flowed down into his beard. \u201cYou\u2019re all grown up.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something from the previous night buzzed in my ear. \u201cNo more me, Robbie. No more me. Time to grow up.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then it clicked.
