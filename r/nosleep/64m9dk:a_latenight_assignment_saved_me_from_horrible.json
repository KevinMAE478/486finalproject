When I had to stay back at the university for a group project and therefore miss out a sleepover at my friend\u2019s place, I thought life couldn\u2019t get any worse. But in the greater scheme of things, that assignment saved me from a horrible death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happened about eight months ago when I was at the University in my final year of undergrad. We are three sisters and I am the middle child. My father is a high-ranking police officer so we led a comfortable and privileged life. Despite the abundant opportunities to pile up fortunes as a police officer in Pakistan, my father somehow managed to remain honest and scale up the career ladder. The downside of this honesty was that he made many enemies including hardened criminals, senior police officers and even some politicians. Eventually, four years ago, he got posted out to a small town in Punjab and so began our new life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soon after moving to the town, my father appointed a driver-cum-guard for our family. He was a mature man, about 50 years old, average build and about three inches of greying beard. His real name was Sharif but we called him \u2018Uncle\u2019. Uncle never said much, which was convenient for us sisters, as he\u2019d never tell our dad about our secret rendezvous with friends, after classes. Over the years, we developed an almost fatherly bond with Uncle. He\u2019d drop me at the university in the morning and I\u2019d call him at the end of lectures to pick me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life went on. My elder sister graduated med school. My little sister got into med school and I entered the final year of my mechanical engineering degree. Dad was usually late from work and always busy on phone. We weren\u2019t allowed to attend the home landline or his cell for safety reasons. Our parents were very protective, which was a bit annoying because we didn\u2019t get to hang out a lot with friends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My best friend Sarah was getting married. We were a group of three girls \u2013 Sarah, Natasha (we called her \u2018Nat\u2019) and I \u2013  and we were inseparable throughout the four years of university. Despite our busy work schedules due to approaching final exams and project submissions, Sarah decided to have a sleepover for the four of us before her wedding. We agreed, of course. All arrangements were made. It was decided that Nat would go with Sarah to her place after classes. As I finished late, I\u2019d join them a couple of hours later and we\u2019d watch girly movies and do all kinds of crazy stuff all night. I was excited because I hadn\u2019t had this kind of fun in a long time. Honestly, there was very little anybody could do in this small town, not to mention my over-protective parents and the workload that comes with a degree like mechanical engineering. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At around 6:30 pm, Sarah and Nat texted me that they had reached Sarah\u2019s place and were setting things up for the night. I texted back saying I was trying to finish as early as possible and be with them. Sarah joked that if I needed more time with Mister Jimmy, I could stay longer. Jimmy was a cute guy who played in the university football team. Sarah and Nat knew that I had a secret crush on him and would often tease me about it. He usually stayed back late after classes to practice his game with friends. I sent back angry emojies and promised retribution. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For our final year project, my team and I were working on an automatic solar powered mini-vehicle that would work within the campus. Everything was almost ready and we were putting together our final presentation, due in five days. We had decided to show a pre-recorded video demonstration of our project during the presentation so we could impress potential employers. We decided to do a test run before wrapping up for the day and if everything happened according to plan, we\u2019d have the video ready by tomorrow. Aly, my project mate, started the test run. Miriam was taking notes. The mini-vehicle skidded across the empty university road with a buzzing sound that was amplified by the quietness of the night. Suddenly, as the vehicle made its programmed return to base, things went to hell. The car screeched. Aly desperately tried to abort the run but the vehicle toppled over and 80 percent of the project came undone. We stared at each other, horrified. A few moments ago, we were the favorites for the best project award and here we were staring at two years of hard work, gone in seconds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat now?\u201d, Aly asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d, I honestly replied. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a pause, Aly suggested we go check it out. It seemed that the front wheel had come loose. Fortunately, the error was not in programming but the hardware, which was easier to fix. Without wasting any time, we started working on the fixes and lost all count of time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first call was at 8:00 pm from my dad, who was checking to make sure I had reached Sarah\u2019s place. He had explicitly told Uncle to stay with me at the University until I finished and only come back once he had dropped me at Sarah\u2019s home. I felt guilty for keeping him there since morning. I told my father about the whole ordeal. He wasn\u2019t too happy with the idea of me working late at the university. After some convincing,  he agreed to let me work until 10:00 pm maximum, after which I was to return home and not go to Sarah\u2019s place. He said he\u2019d personally come to pick me on his way back from work. In my mind, I swore with every curse word I knew, before angrily hanging up. I proceeded to call up Sarah and Nat and let them know about the situation. They sympathized but sounded disappointed. I cursed my luck again and blamed my stars for ruining this only opportunity of fun in a long time. Little did I know that fate had just saved me from the worst nightmare I could possibly imagine, in my privileged and sheltered life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miriam however, did not get permission to work so late at the university. Usually, she would either go back with her mother who picked her up after work, or with me if we finished early, as her home was in the same neighborhood as mine. She was a shy little person but extremely sweet and caring towards others. Aly and I said goodbye to Miriam and she headed out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDon\u2019t run off early tomorrow! Talk to your mom, so we can finish this nasty piece of extra work, okay?\u201d, Aly called after her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI will.\u201d, she promised and went out of the lab. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went out with her to tell Uncle to go back home and apologize for keeping him waiting for so long. My father\u2019s black sedan was the only car in the parking lot. Uncle was pacing in front of the car. He looked\u2026aggravated? Nervous? When he spotted us, he immediately straightened and opened the car door. His expressions turned blank again as usual. While Uncle never spoke to any of us sisters loudly, I knew I had crossed the line of ethicality by keeping him waiting all day. I couldn\u2019t even think of the right words to apologize. I started dumbly: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUncle, I\u2019m so sorry I kept you waiting for so long. Really, we ran into some trouble with the project and I completely forgot you were still here.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d, he sounded impatient. Of course, he would be. He wanted to go home, eat and crash in bed. It wasn\u2019t his project that had just crashed. A fresh wave of guilt washed over me as I continued:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUmm... Uncle, I will have to stay a bit longer\u2026\u201d, I said, embarrassed to the core. He stared at me as if he would murder me. I hastily added:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut you can go back. Daddy will come to pick me up when I\u2019m done. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, I stay. You finish your work. I will wait.\u201d, Uncle said in a tone that conveyed finality. It sounded as if he was desperately trying to suppress the urge to strangle me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found it rather strange. I just told this man that his shift of labor is over and he is free to go back and do whatever he does after work, but he was insisting to stay with me. I chided myself for thinking this way about a man who was so loyal to my family. He probably didn\u2019t want to bother my father and was willing to wait a few more hours to fulfill his responsibility. If there was a Guinness record for feeling guilty, I knew I was breaking it in that moment. \nMiriam was standing some distance away from us and talking to someone on the phone. She hanged up and started walking towards me looking a bit tense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIs something wrong, Miriam?\u201d, I asked, concerned. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUmm\u2026actually I was wondering if you could drop me...\u201d, she sounded embarrassed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miriam did not come from an affluent background. Her mother was a nurse at a local government hospital and her father had passed away 10 years ago. She had a younger brother in grade 7. Her mother was the only bread earner of the family. I understood how tough it was for her to manage everything alone. One of the reasons, I used to offer Miriam a ride home whenever I could, was to save her mom some time and money on picking her eldest daughter. Nonetheless, Miriam was a bright child, who aspired to be an air force engineer after graduation. Considering that she had already qualified psychological assessment and medical exams, I had no doubt that she\u2019d make an outstanding air force engineer after her graduation later this year. So, I understood that her mother had suggested that Miriam come back home with me as she usually did. Her mom did not know that I was staying late and Miriam, being the sensitive and caring daughter that she was, had not told her mom, to save her the trouble. An idea came to my mind. I turned to Uncle and said:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUncle, could you please drop Miriam home on your way back? Daddy will pick me up later.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miriam looked at me hesitantly. She had always only travelled with Uncle when we were together. I gave a reassuring nod and she seemed to calm down considering that Uncle seemed non-threatening in his simple attire and white beard that gave him a Santa Claus like appearance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uncle seemed to contemplate the situation for a while. He looked at Miriam who was timidly standing next to me. After a long pause, he nodded tersely and motioned for Miriam to climb in the car. She thanked me and got in the backseat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSee you tomorrow!\u201d, I said, as the car sped off and she waved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the last time she waved to anyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As promised, my dad had come to pick me in his official vehicle with his guards. On the way back, I had told him about the mess we landed in and how we had to stay back to fix it. I apologized for my mistreatment of Uncle and told him that I had sent him back. For some reason, I did not mention that Uncle had dropped Miriam on his way back. Perhaps, I considered it unnecessary information to share. We drove back in silence for the rest of the way. I got home around midnight. I hadn\u2019t even reached my room when my phone rang. It was Miriam\u2019s mom. She has probably called to thank me for giving Miriam a ride, I thought tiredly. I answered the phone and my life turned upside down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miriam\u2019s mom was frantically asking if we had left and if Miriam was with me or not. I listened to her questions in stunned silence. It had been two hours since Uncle had left with Miriam and it usually took 30 minutes in heavy traffic to reach her place. At this time, it should have taken only 20 minutes for Miriam to be home. I ran to the living room and called out for my mom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMom! Has Uncle returned? Where is he?\u201d, I asked, breathless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat are you taking about, girl? He was with you, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d, my mother eyed me in disbelief. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt my stomach dropping into a bottomless pit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHoney, are you alright?\u201d, I vaguely registered my mother\u2019s concerned voice. Dad had joined her in the living room at some point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDad\u2026 Miriam\u2026 she didn\u2019t reach home. I think Uncle and Miriam had an accident. Please dad, check. Please.\u201d I was crying now. Panic was eating at my insides. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCalm down, Zoya! Tell me what happened. What about Miriam? Tell me everything.\u201d, Dad held me from my arms and sat me on a sofa. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I regretfully quoted the incidents of the previous hours. \nInstantly, he was on the phone. Within five minutes, the police were looking for our black sedan. That was the most difficult night for our family. Miriam\u2019s mother rushed to our house. She was half mad with grief and I could only imagine the horror she was going through. All night the police searched for the vehicle. There was no clue. There was no sign of an accident along any route from university to Miriam\u2019s home. It was as if the earth had swallowed the car and its occupants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The night turned to day and the day turned to another night. The wailing and weeping had stopped and a deadly calm had taken over our living room. Miriam\u2019s mom was huddled in a corner, eyes closed, lips silently reciting prayers. Her 12-year-old son held her hand and looked ghostly white. My sisters were sitting on one of the sofas, tears trickling down their faces. It was like a silence before the storm. A storm that was about to destroy our lives forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Father entered the room. I had never seen that look on his face before tonight. His features were set hard and a nerve in his temple was ticking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMrs. Sher, can we talk in private?\u201d, my dad said in a low tone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miriam\u2019s mother came out of her trance and sprang up. She followed my father to the side room. I couldn\u2019t contain it anymore and ran to the wall. I pressed my ear against it and listened. I wish I hadn\u2019t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMrs. Sher, the police found the car near an abandoned factory 20 miles from the town. We believe that the factory was the base of a human trafficking crime group. The police caught a member of the group who told us that the driver had sold Miriam to this group and vanished. Miriam\u2019s body was found cut in pieces and dumped in the bushes behind the factory. When she refused to cooperate with the abductors, they raped her repeatedly. She suffered critical injuries and became useless to the traffickers. So, they shot her, cut her and disposed of her body before packing and leaving. The police are on the hunt for this group. We will do everything in our power to find them.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What followed were the most horrible screams of agony I\u2019ve ever heard. To this day, Mrs. Sher\u2019s screams haunt me in my nightmares. She cursed us for the horrific death of her daughter. On complaint of Mrs. Sher, an investigation was launched against my father by the police and he remained suspended until the investigation was complete. Although my father was cleared of any involvement in the abduction, rape and murder of Miriam Sher, his reputation suffered greatly. The media reported the incident and highlighted that his car was found at the site. My mother and sisters wept for months. My younger sister started suffering from sleeping and eating disorders. Father fired the cook, the maid and the gardener. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I withdrew from everyone. I refused to answer calls, even Sarah\u2019s and Nat\u2019s calls and messages. I have no idea how I managed to sit the exams but performed poorly and failed two courses. Everyone at the university looked at me strangely and I lost almost all friends. Some girls would openly taunt me or whisper where I could clearly hear them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey look! There she is. I think her dad was involved in this. I bet he took a lot of money from the kidnappers for Miriam.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI think she was always jealous of Miriam, because she scored better than her and was prettier. So, she and her driver sold her off. She is pathetic.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The depression was so extreme that I started having suicidal thoughts. I was to blame. If I hadn\u2019t told Miriam to go with Uncle that night, she\u2019d still be here. If I had not offered her to go back with my driver, she would have waited for her mother. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eight months have gone by and the police have neither caught the human traffickers nor the driver. Uncle\u2019s family knew nothing of his whereabouts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last evening, I was back home early. My father\u2019s car was already parked in the garage, which meant he was home too. I absentmindedly started climbing the stairs to my room when I overheard part of the conversation between my mom and dad, in their room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe was not after Miriam. He wanted Zoya.\u201d, my father was saying. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d, my mother sounded shocked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSharif\u2019s real name was Fazal. Four years ago, I arrested Fazal\u2019s brother for murdering his wife and kids. Fazal was taking his brother\u2019s revenge, from me. He planned to sell Zoya to the traffickers and use that money to bribe the police to let his bother go. He had already talked to his police \u2018contact\u2019 at the jail where his brother was held. Two days ago, we caught this contact and I found out about Fazal. There was a wolf among us all this time and I didn\u2019t know. What kind of a father am I?\u201d my father was completely broken. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut, it doesn\u2019t make sense. If he had come for revenge, why did he serve you so loyally for three years? Why plan it that night?\u201d my mom asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBecause, I had a tracker on the car. I always knew the exact location of the car. Even when our daughters thought they were smart and that I didn\u2019t know about their little adventures, I was following their every move. Fazal didn\u2019t know about the tracker but would come back and tell me every detail, word to word. I began trusting him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo you remember that I never let him take the car for maintenance? I either took it myself or went with him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When he had won my trust, a week before the night, I let him do it for the first time. I checked for the tracker after he brought the car back and it was there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMy guess is, Fazal had probably learnt about the tracker long ago and hadn\u2019t taken it off. Waiting for the right moment to violate my trust. That night, we found the tracker in Zoya\u2019s University car park. He planned to sell her that night and vanish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhen he knew that he couldn\u2019t have Zoya that night and I\u2019d find out he tampered with the tracker, he took the second best bet he could get. He sold Miriam and freed his brother. Now there are two of them out there, waiting for revenge on my family. I brought this on you all. Miriam became the collateral damage in this war for revenge, but the real target is my family. I need to catch these bastards before they harm anyone again. I won\u2019t let them hurt any of you.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t hear the rest. I ran to my room, fell on the bed and cried. He wanted me. My innocent friend died for me. And this wasn\u2019t over. He will come back. The nightmare has just begun. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/650vvl/they_are_stalking_me_now/\"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "It\u2019s ironic how we sometimes blame situations for messing up our lives when in fact, they save us from terrible fate.

Uncle, I will have to stay a bit longer\u2026\u201d, I said, embarrassed to the core. He stared at me as if he would murder me. I hastily added:\n\n\u201cBut you can go back. Daddy will come to pick me up when I\u2019m done. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I stay. You finish your work. I will wait.\u201d, Uncle said in a tone that conveyed finality. It sounded as if he was desperately trying to suppress the urge to strangle me. \n\nI found it rather strange. I just told this man that his shift of labor is over and he is free to go back and do whatever he does after work, but he was insisting to stay with me. I chided myself for thinking this way about a man who was so loyal to my family. He probably didn\u2019t want to bother my father and was willing to wait a few more hours to fulfill his responsibility. If there was a Guinness record for feeling guilty, I knew I was breaking it in that moment. \nMiriam was standing some distance away from us and talking to someone on the phone. She hanged up and started walking towards me looking a bit tense. \n\n\u201cIs something wrong, Miriam?\u201d, I asked, concerned. \n\n\u201cUmm\u2026actually I was wondering if you could drop me...\u201d, she sounded embarrassed. \n\nMiriam did not come from an affluent background. Her mother was a nurse at a local government hospital and her father had passed away 10 years ago. She had a younger brother in grade 7. Her mother was the only bread earner of the family. I understood how tough it was for her to manage everything alone. One of the reasons, I used to offer Miriam a ride home whenever I could, was to save her mom some time and money on picking her eldest daughter. Nonetheless, Miriam was a bright child, who aspired to be an air force engineer after graduation. Considering that she had already qualified psychological assessment and medical exams, I had no doubt that she\u2019d make an outstanding air force engineer after her graduation later this year. So, I understood that her mother had suggested that Miriam come back home with me as she usually did. Her mom did not know that I was staying late and Miriam, being the sensitive and caring daughter that she was, had not told her mom, to save her the trouble. An idea came to my mind. I turned to Uncle and said:\n\n\u201cUncle, could you please drop Miriam home on your way back? Daddy will pick me up later.\u201d\n\nMiriam looked at me hesitantly. She had always only travelled with Uncle when we were together. I gave a reassuring nod and she seemed to calm down considering that Uncle seemed non-threatening in his simple attire and white beard that gave him a Santa Claus like appearance. \n\nUncle seemed to contemplate the situation for a while. He looked at Miriam who was timidly standing next to me. After a long pause, he nodded tersely and motioned for Miriam to climb in the car. She thanked me and got in the backseat. \n\n\u201cSee you tomorrow!\u201d, I said, as the car sped off and she waved. \n\nIt was the last time she waved to anyone. \n\nAs promised, my dad had come to pick me in his official vehicle with his guards. On the way back, I had told him about the mess we landed in and how we had to stay back to fix it. I apologized for my mistreatment of Uncle and told him that I had sent him back. For some reason, I did not mention that Uncle had dropped Miriam on his way back. Perhaps, I considered it unnecessary information to share. We drove back in silence for the rest of the way. I got home around midnight. I hadn\u2019t even reached my room when my phone rang. It was Miriam\u2019s mom. She has probably called to thank me for giving Miriam a ride, I thought tiredly. I answered the phone and my life turned upside down. \n\nMiriam\u2019s mom was frantically asking if we had left and if Miriam was with me or not. I listened to her questions in stunned silence. It had been two hours since Uncle had left with Miriam and it usually took 30 minutes in heavy traffic to reach her place. At this time, it should have taken only 20 minutes for Miriam to be home. I ran to the living room and called out for my mom. \n\n\u201cMom! Has Uncle returned? Where is he?\u201d, I asked, breathless. \n\n\u201cWhat are you taking about, girl? He was with you, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d, my mother eyed me in disbelief. \n\nI felt my stomach dropping into a bottomless pit. \n\n\u201cHoney, are you alright?\u201d, I vaguely registered my mother\u2019s concerned voice. Dad had joined her in the living room at some point. \n\n\u201cDad\u2026 Miriam\u2026 she didn\u2019t reach home. I think Uncle and Miriam had an accident. Please dad, check. Please.\u201d I was crying now. Panic was eating at my insides. \n\n\u201cCalm down, Zoya! Tell me what happened. What about Miriam? Tell me everything.\u201d, Dad held me from my arms and sat me on a sofa. \n\nI regretfully quoted the incidents of the previous hours. \nInstantly, he was on the phone. Within five minutes, the police were looking for our black sedan. That was the most difficult night for our family. Miriam\u2019s mother rushed to our house. She was half mad with grief and I could only imagine the horror she was going through. All night the police searched for the vehicle. There was no clue. There was no sign of an accident along any route from university to Miriam\u2019s home. It was as if the earth had swallowed the car and its occupants. \n\nThe night turned to day and the day turned to another night. The wailing and weeping had stopped and a deadly calm had taken over our living room. Miriam\u2019s mom was huddled in a corner, eyes closed, lips silently reciting prayers. Her 12-year-old son held her hand and looked ghostly white. My sisters were sitting on one of the sofas, tears trickling down their faces. It was like a silence before the storm. A storm that was about to destroy our lives forever. \n\nFather entered the room. I had never seen that look on his face before tonight. His features were set hard and a nerve in his temple was ticking. \n\n\u201cMrs. Sher, can we talk in private?\u201d, my dad said in a low tone. \n\nMiriam\u2019s mother came out of her trance and sprang up. She followed my father to the side room. I couldn\u2019t contain it anymore and ran to the wall. I pressed my ear against it and listened. I wish I hadn\u2019t. \n\n\u201cMrs. Sher, the police found the car near an abandoned factory 20 miles from the town. We believe that the factory was the base of a human trafficking crime group. The police caught a member of the group who told us that the driver had sold Miriam to this group and vanished. Miriam\u2019s body was found cut in pieces and dumped in the bushes behind the factory. When she refused to cooperate with the abductors, they raped her repeatedly. She suffered critical injuries and became useless to the traffickers. So, they shot her, cut her and disposed of her body before packing and leaving. The police are on the hunt for this group. We will do everything in our power to find them.\u201d\n\nWhat followed were the most horrible screams of agony I\u2019ve ever heard. To this day, Mrs. Sher\u2019s screams haunt me in my nightmares. She cursed us for the horrific death of her daughter. On complaint of Mrs. Sher, an investigation was launched against my father by the police and he remained suspended until the investigation was complete. Although my father was cleared of any involvement in the abduction, rape and murder of Miriam Sher, his reputation suffered greatly. The media reported the incident and highlighted that his car was found at the site. My mother and sisters wept for months. My younger sister started suffering from sleeping and eating disorders. Father fired the cook, the maid and the gardener. \n\nI withdrew from everyone. I refused to answer calls, even Sarah\u2019s and Nat\u2019s calls and messages. I have no idea how I managed to sit the exams but performed poorly and failed two courses. Everyone at the university looked at me strangely and I lost almost all friends. Some girls would openly taunt me or whisper where I could clearly hear them. \n\n\u201cHey look! There she is. I think her dad was involved in this. I bet he took a lot of money from the kidnappers for Miriam.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she was always jealous of Miriam, because she scored better than her and was prettier. So, she and her driver sold her off. She is pathetic.\u201d \n\nThe depression was so extreme that I started having suicidal thoughts. I was to blame. If I hadn\u2019t told Miriam to go with Uncle that night, she\u2019d still be here. If I had not offered her to go back with my driver, she would have waited for her mother. \n\n\nEight months have gone by and the police have neither caught the human traffickers nor the driver. Uncle\u2019s family knew nothing of his whereabouts. \n\nLast evening, I was back home early. My father\u2019s car was already parked in the garage, which meant he was home too. I absentmindedly started climbing the stairs to my room when I overheard part of the conversation between my mom and dad, in their room. \n\n\u201cHe was not after Miriam. He wanted Zoya.\u201d, my father was saying. \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d, my mother sounded shocked. \n\n\u201cSharif\u2019s real name was Fazal. Four years ago, I arrested Fazal\u2019s brother for murdering his wife and kids. Fazal was taking his brother\u2019s revenge, from me. He planned to sell Zoya to the traffickers and use that money to bribe the police to let his bother go. He had already talked to his police \u2018contact\u2019 at the jail where his brother was held. Two days ago, we caught this contact and I found out about Fazal. There was a wolf among us all this time and I didn\u2019t know. What kind of a father am I?\u201d my father was completely broken. \n\n\u201cBut, it doesn\u2019t make sense. If he had come for revenge, why did he serve you so loyally for three years? Why plan it that night?\u201d my mom asked. \n\n\u201cBecause, I had a tracker on the car. I always knew the exact location of the car. Even when our daughters thought they were smart and that I didn\u2019t know about their little adventures, I was following their every move. Fazal didn\u2019t know about the tracker but would come back and tell me every detail, word to word. I began trusting him.\n\n\u201cDo you remember that I never let him take the car for maintenance? I either took it myself or went with him. \n\n\"When he had won my trust, a week before the night, I let him do it for the first time. I checked for the tracker after he brought the car back and it was there. \n\n\u201cMy guess is, Fazal had probably learnt about the tracker long ago and hadn\u2019t taken it off. Waiting for the right moment to violate my trust. That night, we found the tracker in Zoya\u2019s University car park. He planned to sell her that night and vanish.\n\n\u201cWhen he knew that he couldn\u2019t have Zoya that night and I\u2019d find out he tampered with the tracker, he took the second best bet he could get. He sold Miriam and freed his brother. Now there are two of them out there, waiting for revenge on my family. I brought this on you all. Miriam became the collateral damage in this war for revenge, but the real target is my family. I need to catch these bastards before they harm anyone again. I won\u2019t let them hurt any of you.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t hear the rest. I ran to my room, fell on the bed and cried. He wanted me. My innocent friend died for me. And this wasn\u2019t over. He will come back. The nightmare has just begun. \n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/650vvl/they_are_stalking_me_now/)\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Series", "id": "64m9dk", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 358, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Arakiss", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64m9dk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "approved_by": null, "over_18": true, "domain": "self.nosleep", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "edited": 1492030001.0, "link_flair_css_class": "flair-series", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/64m9dk/a_latenight_assignment_saved_me_from_horrible/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491886002.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64m9dk/a_latenight_assignment_saved_me_from_horrible/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "A late-night assignment saved me from horrible death", "created_utc": 1491857202.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 26, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 358}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64m9dk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64m9dk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64m9dk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64m9dk", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64m9dk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4k9ma", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sayquam", "parent_id": "t1_dg47olq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nosleep", "name": "t1_dg4k9ma", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491959303.0, "created_utc": 1491930503.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg47olq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RainMaker323", "parent_id": "t1_dg43t6t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You wouldn't by chance believe that I've made a typo?
