[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "nosleep", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64zq21/everyone_lives_but_not_everyone_dies/\"&gt;Part one&lt;/a&gt; will tell you how I met the mysterious Mr. Jacobs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what that beetle I swallowed was, but it&amp;#39;s doing something to me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The squirming sensation had abated for awhile, and I figured it would be digested. I wasn&amp;#39;t feeling as nauseous anymore, so it probably wasn&amp;#39;t poisonous. I told myself he was just some crazy hermit who got his wrinkled old rocks off by playing tricks on people. It wasn&amp;#39;t that my Grandmother was afraid of him - she must have just known he was a fraud.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was almost home before the sharp pain in my stomach doubled me over the steering wheel. It was like an ice-cold knife trying to force its way out from the inside. I had to pull off into a gas station to wait for it to pass. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pain quickly faded into a gentle numbness, the sensation replaced by a gentle tickling working its way up my chest cavity. I lifted my shirt and fought the urge to be sick again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There was a lump under my skin. And it was moving.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I poked at it gingerly and could feel the hard carapace of the beetle underneath. It must have bitten free from my stomach and begun to crawl around. I briefly considered trying to smash it, but what if I didn&amp;#39;t kill it? What if I just made it mad and it went on a rampage &lt;em&gt;inside of me&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lump wasn&amp;#39;t moving fast, but it was persistently crawling toward my heart. I took a deep breath and felt it holding onto my rib-cage as it expanded and contracted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hospital. Now. I slowly pulled out of the gas station, trying not to turn the wheel too fast for fear of agitating the beetle. It reacted to even small movements, biting and scratching in protest. I don&amp;#39;t care if they made me drink a whole bottle of bleach, I was getting this thing out of me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled right up to the emergency room doors and left my car there. I practically had to crawl up to the desk to keep the beetle still. For every foot I made, it was wriggling a few centimeters closer to my heart. What would happen when it got there? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Somebody help me!&amp;quot; I shouted, lying down on the ground to keep it still. I stared at my reflection in the polished floor tiles, now damp with the cold sweat flowing down my face. Was I delirious? The face looking up at me couldn&amp;#39;t be my own. I was so... old. My hair was grey and patchy, my eyes sunken and hollow, and a network of lines mapped the journeys of an un-lived life. I tried to touch my skin, but the jerking movement caused the beetle to bite down &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; on one of my lungs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was coughing blood when the nurses lifted me into a stretcher. I slipped in and out of consciousness after that. The nurses later told me that I kept mumbling &amp;quot;I don\u2019t want to die. I want to live forever&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAny allergies?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMedications?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPlease think hard. It\u2019s rare for someone your age not to be on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; medications.*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glared at the doctor who perched on the end of my hospital bed. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been here, but it was afternoon when I went to visit Mr. Jacobs and the morning sun was filling my room. I squinted against it, then back at my doctor. He looked bored and annoyed and\u2026 fuzzy. I squinted again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m 19 years old,\u201d I said. The events of the other day immediately came back to me, and I clutched at my chest. Ancient withered hands held loosely together by a mesh of bulbous veins gripped my hospital gown and pulled it open. I couldn\u2019t feel any lump, but\u2026 was this really me? My skin sloughed into sagging pouches around my skeletal frame. I was more than old. I was what old could only dream about becoming when it grew up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo you remember what year it is?\u201d the doctor asked. \u201cDon\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t. It\u2019s common with cases of delirium \u2013\u201c&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s April 13th, 2017. I\u2019m not delirious. I\u2019m 19 years old, and was perfectly healthy yesterday. There\u2019s something inside of me which is causing this\u2026\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCausing what, exactly?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was writing something down in his notepad, but he wasn\u2019t really listening. He must deal with a dozen old people every day, each more blithering and nonsensical than the last. But if they could find the beetle and reverse this\u2026 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI want a full body scan \u2013\u201c &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019ve already been checked. It was probably nothing but heat exhaustion which caused you to feel dizzy. I\u2019d like to keep you here through the afternoon and get you re-hydrated, and then you\u2019ll be as good as ever. Is there anyone you&amp;#39;d like us to notify?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My grandmother.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He raised a skeptical eyebrow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just give me the damn phone.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grandmother Elis and I stared at each other. She recognized me the moment she walked in the door. She didn&amp;#39;t say a word - just pursed her lips and sat down. She opened her handbag and began fiddling with something inside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry...&amp;quot; I said. This was all my fault. I should have asked her before visiting Mr. Jacobs. I should never have gone through her stuff in the attic without permission, or pretend I was supposed to accept Mr. Jacob&amp;#39;s offer on her behalf. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She took out a hand-mirror from her purse and held it up to me. I screwed my eyes shut tight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Look at what you&amp;#39;ve become.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forced myself to look. If I - the old me - had seen someone who looked like I did now, I would have made some cruel joke about old people &amp;#39;outliving their usefulness&amp;#39;. Now I felt like I wanted to cry, if these puffy old eyes could even do that anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My Grandfather doesn&amp;#39;t know how to extend life,&amp;quot; Elis said. &amp;quot;He shifts it from one person to another. The only reason he has lasted this long is because he passes his years into a victim who must bear his burden in his stead.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So the reason you never accepted his offer...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because I couldn&amp;#39;t do that to someone else. One lifetime is more than enough if used properly, and a thousand lives aren&amp;#39;t nearly enough when used as has done.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I only want one life, I swear,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;And I can get it back, right? All I have to do -&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. You do not have the right to give your years to anyone.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But I could give them back to Mr. Jacobs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She shook her head. &amp;quot;You will not win. He has been doing this for over a hundred years. If you go back to him, he will only add to your years until you&amp;#39;ve been turned to dust.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He told me not to return without you. If you accept his deal -&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grandmother Elis put her mirror away. I hated how much her hands were shaking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry. I can&amp;#39;t do it.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please don&amp;#39;t leave me like this...&amp;quot; I said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s hardly anything left of you to leave,&amp;quot; and she was gone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to say more, but my words caught on a dry itching in my throat. I felt like I was suffocating, and if that had been the end, I would have accepted it. I&amp;#39;d rather die than live like this. But the itching turned into squirming, and the squirming into thrashing. I clutched at my throat, but I was helpless as the beetle crawled up my trachea and out of my mouth. It plopped down into my lap, and I held it in my hands. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But these weren&amp;#39;t my years - this wasn&amp;#39;t my fault. If I could just pass them off to someone else, then...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;d rather die than live like this,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;but I&amp;#39;d rather &lt;a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade\"&gt;live forever&lt;/a&gt; than either.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64zq21/everyone_lives_but_not_everyone_dies/) will tell you how I met the mysterious Mr. Jacobs. \n\nI don't know what that beetle I swallowed was, but it's doing something to me.  \n\nThe squirming sensation had abated for awhile, and I figured it would be digested.
