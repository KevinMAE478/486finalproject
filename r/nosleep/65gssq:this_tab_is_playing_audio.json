Not that it\u2019s important, but if you\u2019re curious the paper was about Walden, a topic I had absolutely no interest in. I had only read (part of... the first paragraph of, honestly) one of the eight chapters we were assigned to read and had pushed off the paper until the very last chance I had to write it. I was on a timer now, as the assignment had to be submitted through BlackBoard and was due by 11:59 PM. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was 10:45 and I was almost done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had been studying before hand for an exam that I had coming up, and my eyes were heavy from the hours I had spent going through the lecture PowerPoints. I was forcing myself through, though, but every sentence felt like it was taking me an hour to write. I had my headphones on and was blaring a Spotify playlist to keep my brain somewhat stimulated; I kept trying to turn up the volume even though it was maxed out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soon my eyelids started to droop and it started to take effort to keep my eyes focused. I leaned my head to the side to rest my head, finding the weight of it to progressively getting heavier. My blinking was slowly and I kept my eyes closed for thirty seconds max before opening them again, but I fell asleep despite my efforts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I fell asleep, I could still hear my playlist through my headphones, but it was like falling asleep with the T.V on, you know? I was starting to dream, and every now and then a lyric would make its way into the dream\u2019s dialogue. I realized that this was happening, but didn\u2019t have the energy to wake myself up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually my playlist stopped, and now that I wasn\u2019t partially focusing on the music, I plunged into a deeper sleep. My ears were still picking up on something, though, and I remember the noise I was hearing was reminding me that I was sleeping and needed to wake up, but I ignored it and it too faded as I fell asleep completely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I realized in my dream state that I had a paper due, I jolted away immediately. I looked at the clock on my computer, and it was one in the morning. I swore under my breath and rubbed my eyes. I clicked out of my paper and went to my email to come up with some piss-poor excuse to send to my professor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a quarter of a way through the email (which I was putting more effort into than my paper) when I comprehended that my headphones were playing audio of some sort, almost like white noise. I clicked on my Spotify and saw that nothing was playing, so I went back to Chrome and looked through the tabs I had opened for my paper to see if one of them was playing an ad. When I found the audio symbol on the left corner of one of the tabs, I hovered over the tab until I got the X to close it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I clicked the X, and the white noise stopped, but I was greeted with the all too familiar chime that the web page was alerting me of something before I closed out. I clicked on the tab and read the message:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you having trouble sleeping?\u201d Below the message I could click two boxes, either yes or no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I assumed that tab was a pop-up from one of the articles I had been reading. I went to exit out of the tab again, but another message popped up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you having trouble staying asleep?\u201d Again, below the message I could click either yes or no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I clicked to exit out again, and sure enough another message popped up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you afraid of going to sleep?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I clicked to exit out again and the first message popped up again. I went through the motions until I was faced with the third message again, and out of annoyance I clicked \u201cNo,\u201d and the tab finally closed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back to writing the email to my professor. I wrote for another three minutes until my head jolted back, and I woke up from falling asleep again. I looked at the clock and saw that it was 2:15 now. I couldn\u2019t recall falling asleep, but I went back to finishing the email.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finished it and sent it then went to close out of my tabs. That was when I saw the audio icon in the last tab. I took my hand from my mouse and listened, and softly I could hear the white noise playing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to exit out of the tab and was greeted by the same message. Instead of going through all three of them again, I clicked no for the first one, but to my demise the next message popped up anyway. I clicked no again, and acting before reading, I instinctively clicked no for the third message, thinking it would be the same as the previous one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you answering truthfully?\u201d I read after I clicked no, and the message disappeared and the tab closed. My headphones were silent and I stared at my computer wallpaper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I closed my laptop and went upstairs to go to bed. I had just fallen asleep when I woken up by a noise downstairs. I figured it was my roommate getting up for work and rolled over to go back asleep. After a few minutes, I remembered that my roommate was visiting her parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I jumped up in bed and went to turn my light on, but paused. I sat in the silence of my room and listened to my ears ring, waiting to hear the noise that I had heard earlier. I closed my eyes and strained my hearing, and I could definitely hear something downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I listened longer, I understood what I was hearing. I turned on my light and walked down the stairs. I walked over to where my laptop was sitting on the floor. I crouched down and opened my laptop. My playlist was playing Feel Good, Inc. by the Gorillaz. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I closed out of Spotify, closed my laptop, and turned to go back to my room. I got to the top of the stairs when my playlist started playing once again. I ran down the stairs back to my laptop. As soon as I was standing in front of it, the music stopped and the pop up alarm chimed through the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opened my laptop and the previous tab had been opened, and the message was displayed on the screen, \u201cAre you having trouble sleeping?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I clicked yes, and the tab closed. I turned on the living room lights and sat down on the couch. With my foot, I pushed my laptop away from me and grabbed the T.V remote. There was no way I was going to be able to sleep. I rationalized that I must\u2019ve had some crazy virus on my laptop and I was being stupid, but I was pretty freaked out about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned on the T.V, grabbed a blanket, and curled up on the couch for the night. I was super tired, but every time I even came close to closing my eyes, my heart would start to race and I\u2019d wake right back up. After about an hour of this, my eyes managed to close before I could realize it, and I had drifted off to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as soon as I had fallen asleep, I was woken up by my computer blaring another song. I probably jumped ten feet in the air. I pulled my laptop back over to me, put it on my lap, and opened the top. My playlist was playing once again, and I had been woken up by Breezeblocks by alt - j.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I exited out of Spotify, the Sleep tag opened again with the next message, \u201cAre you having trouble staying asleep?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I clicked yes, and the tab closed. Once it did, I slammed my laptop shut and took out the battery. I put it back on the floor and pushed it across the room. I curled back up on the couch. I was fucking terrified, but I forced myself to close my eyes. Whatever virus was on my computer, it didn\u2019t matter now. The battery was out, I told myself, I could sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I did sleep, for about three minutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slowly woke up to music playing upstairs. The song was just starting to play; Hungry Heart by Bruce Springsteen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to cry now. I didn\u2019t know what to fucking do. I didn\u2019t know where the music was fucking coming from. I got out of bed and slowly walked up the stairs as the music got louder and louder. I walked into my room and saw the my phone was lit up, and the music was coming from it. I watched my phone and listened until the song finished, too afraid to move. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the song faded out, my phone alerted me that I had a new text message. I walked over, unlocked my phone, and read the message:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you afraid of going to sleep?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Text: YES or NO.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I responded with yes, sat my phone down back on the table, and sat on the edge of the bed with my hands in my lap. I was exhausted. I looked out the window and the sky showed signs of early morning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My phone vibrated again. I looked down at the message.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you answering truthfully?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Text: YES or NO.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I responded with yes, and as soon as the message sent, my music app opened and another song started blaring from my phone: Break On Through by The Doors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went into the app and turned the song off, but it continued to play. I was in hysterics now. I threw my phone at the wall and it shattered. When it didn\u2019t stop playing, I booked it out of my house and drove to a friend\u2019s, which is where I am currently writing and publishing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re looking for a point to whatever fucking virus or hack was on my computer, I don\u2019t have one yet. I don\u2019t want to go back to my apartment and I don\u2019t want to turn my laptop back on to find out. I don\u2019t want to fucking know how whatever it was found its way onto my phone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m on my friend\u2019s laptop and have the sound off and I\u2019m only going to connect to the internet when I post this.
