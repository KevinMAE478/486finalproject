I can&amp;#39;t promise a good ending, or a good story for that matter, but I can tell you how it ended for me. Or at least how I got to where I am today. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had just graduated high school in 2013 and was enjoying my summer before college. My memories had began to fade from my previous life. My mind prioritized the important ones, but seemed to make the rest a bit fuzzy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was in the middle of July when I died next. It was simple, unexpected, and unpreventable. A fucking brain aneurysm. A brain aneurysm at nineteen. Of all my deaths, this is the one that pissed me off the most. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appeared in The White Room a few minutes after my brain fuckup. Only this time, I was alone. Death was no where to be seen, nor was the exit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up from my seat and explored the room. Having been there so many times, I had never truly explored it in detail. The wall was smooth to the touch, and whiter than any white I could imagine. It felt almost warm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The table seemed to be made of the same material, and was round with curved legs. It looked like a one of a kind art piece, if I&amp;#39;m being honest. The chairs were similar in design, and felt just as warm as the walls. In fact, the entire room was a perfect temperature. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lost in my exploration, I almost didn&amp;#39;t notice that a door had appeared. This door was not like the original door, which matched the room in both color and design. This door was black. A burnt black that seemed foreign and wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked up to it and noticed there wasn&amp;#39;t a handle or knob. Just a long, black door with a equally black frame. I placed my hand on it, resisting every bodily impulse that told me not to. I felt nothing. Not like, nothing. But literally the feeling of nothingness. When you touch something you usually have a description of it, even if that description doesn&amp;#39;t have a word. This felt like the void. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A moment later I was gone. I appeared in a new room, and it was grey. And so was I. Color had no place here. I felt a coldness that ran into my very being. Any sense of optimism I had was gone, and I no longer felt a need to move on. It was dreadful, in every meaning of the word. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you want?&amp;quot; I heard a voice say, its tone was dark and hoarse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked around the room, but I was alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot; I asked aloud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room remained silent, and the feeling of dread continued to spread. It felt like one of those moments where you accidentally entered a restricted area as a child, magnified by infinity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you want?&amp;quot; The voice bellowed even louder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about the question, trying to think of what would get me out of here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I just want to die.&amp;quot; I said, the idea of a true death seeming peaceful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room remained silent for a moment. Then a door appeared. It didn&amp;#39;t fade in or flash into existence. It was simply there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked up to it and twisted the handle that resembled the White Room&amp;#39;s. Before I could open it, I felt an immediate sense of happiness and joy. I tried to stop myself from laughing, but I couldn&amp;#39;t resist. I laughed. I laughed so hard I cried. And then I cried more. I had gone from utter dread to complete happiness. And then I was back to normal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had appeared in a hospital bed, with wires and IVs hooked up to me. I felt horrible, drained and groggy. I opened my eyes slowly, and took in the room. Before they could adjust, I heard a voice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve had quite a journey, haven&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot; I heard a voice say. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked around and saw a young man sitting before me, maybe around twenty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot; I asked, my voice barely escaping my dry mouth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m...for lack of a word you&amp;#39;ll understand, God.&amp;quot; He said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I narrowed my eyes and looked at the boy again.  He wore a hoodie, skinny jeans, and a pair of bright blue sneakers. You know, God&amp;#39;s usual outfit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, God, I think visiting hours are over.&amp;quot; I said, not in the mood for this kids jokes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I assure you, Kennon, I&amp;#39;m not joking.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That part got my attention. I looked down to my hand and noticed a scar that my original body had had. I was in my original body. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re seventeen again. We&amp;#39;re in the hospital they took you to just after your car accident. Your first death.&amp;quot; He said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to take in what had happened. I had almost forgot my last death at this point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where is Death?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He is where he always is. Moving people on.&amp;quot; God said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I mean, why am I not in The White Room?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because I wished to speak to you.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why? Am I setting a new record for accumulative deaths?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God laughed and shook his head. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not even close. I still think I hold that record.&amp;quot; He said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to ask what he meant by that, but he continued. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m here to give you a break. Anything you want, no strings. No loopholes.&amp;quot; He said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I laughed at the words. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Death beat you to it. I&amp;#39;ve been given that offer quite a few times now.&amp;quot; I said after a scoff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Death only put you onto a path that would lead back to him. Such is his job. But the path I put you onto will make a run in with Death impossible.&amp;quot; He said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about the words for a moment, but decided not to ask what he meant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What if I just want to die?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God smiled at me, and nodded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I would understand. Shall I show you what would happen?&amp;quot; He offered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought for a second, and shrugged. And then I died. I only know that because I stood in the room where my body was. I looked down upon myself, as myself. It felt infinitely weirder than it sounds. The beeping sound went flat into one long beep as I died. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked to God, and he nodded. And then I saw everything. I saw The Milky Way galaxy and it&amp;#39;s infinite expanse into other Galaxies. Then I saw where the universe ended, it&amp;#39;s edges dropping down like a waterfall of stars and planets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We kept going until we reached a space of infinite smokey clouds. I stood on nothing as we walked through the light fog. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where are we?&amp;quot; I asked, feeling numb from the pure awe of it all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It doesn&amp;#39;t have a name. It simply is.&amp;quot; He replied. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And this is where we go when we die?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He nodded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s kind of...empty.&amp;quot; I stated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s filled with more than you know. Your simply not ready to see it.&amp;quot; He said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shook my head. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what if I just live my life again?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll experience it differently, with the knowledge you have. You&amp;#39;ll be drawn to your Cae again. Jessica will die, as she was meant to. And you&amp;#39;ll find joy with her as you did the first time. You&amp;#39;ll try to explain things to her, but you&amp;#39;ll decide not to push it. You&amp;#39;ll die happy, again. Or you won&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot; He said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Or I won&amp;#39;t?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have free will. I can&amp;#39;t say what path you&amp;#39;ll go with. But I can say all the possibilities.&amp;quot; God stated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So I get one more life? Why nine ?&amp;quot; I asked, considering this death my eighth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Would you prefer a tenth?&amp;quot; He said with a laugh. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shook my head, and left it alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What was the point of all this?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To see what would happen.&amp;quot; God said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I paused, and thought about what he meant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, the point of anything, is to see what happens. I told you, I can predict which outcomes can happen, but I can&amp;#39;t tell you which one will happen. So we give you choices, and see what you will do. We may set you up for things, but your free will is what crafts your life.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gods. I am the God of this realm, for the lack of a word you&amp;#39;ll understand.&amp;quot; He said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah. So I guess the Greeks and Vikings were close to getting it right.&amp;quot; I said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not even close. There isn&amp;#39;t more than one god. But there are infinite gods.&amp;quot; He said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That...doesn&amp;#39;t make a lot of sense.&amp;quot; I retorted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He laughed and nodded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know. So, what would you like?&amp;quot; He asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought on his question, and his statements. Humans are repetitive creatures. I think we find comfort in the predictability of life. So I must defend my decision. It&amp;#39;s in my nature to want more of a good thing. Life is the ultimate drug that no one can kick. The itch it leaves you with can&amp;#39;t be scratched from beyond the grave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I guess I&amp;#39;ll go back. To my first life.&amp;quot; I said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled, and nodded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded at him, and thought of some sort of goodbye. I didn&amp;#39;t want to say &amp;quot;thank you&amp;quot;,  because the words wouldn&amp;#39;t be meant. I had earned happiness, in my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When did you become God?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I was ready.&amp;quot; He said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with that, I woke up. I was in my bed, once again. It was the morning of my first death. I smiled, feeling the familiar sheets of my bed. I looked to my phone, checking the time. 7:13, Sunday morning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without thinking, I got dressed and got into my car, not waking my parents. I drove to Jessica&amp;#39;s house, avoiding the freeway this time. I arrived without killing myself, to my surprise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I climbed up the tree I had climbed a thousand times before, and looked through Jess&amp;#39;s window. I smiled when I saw her shoulders rise as she breathed. She was alive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knocked on the window. She woke with a slight jump, looking around her room. I knocked again, and she came over to let me in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kennon? It&amp;#39;s kind of early to be sneaking in, isn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot; She said through a yawn. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Never too early to see your boyfriend, is it?&amp;quot; I said with a smirk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You big goof. Come in.&amp;quot; She said, shaking her head as she plopped back down onto her bed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I laid next to her and caressed her side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hope you know I won&amp;#39;t be waking up for another couple hours.&amp;quot; She said through another yawn. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I chuckled, nodding to her. She smiled, and I fell in love all over again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I prepared for her to spontaneously die on the spot, but she didn&amp;#39;t. She just slept in my arms for an hour or so, before we both went down stairs. Her parents joined us later, after I pretended to show up just in time to join them for breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I expected her to die any day. I had prevented the car crash, but accordingly to Death she was going to die anyway. But she didn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been two years since that day, and we&amp;#39;re still together. We go to different colleges, as she was always smarter than me. We&amp;#39;re happy. I&amp;#39;m happy, despite everything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve died a total of eight times. I can&amp;#39;t say I learned a lesson, or even the meaning of it all. I met Death, a being who believes himself a God, I&amp;#39;ve stared a Leviathan in the eye, lost two great loves, and gained one back. After all that, I never lost my will and need to live. Which says a lot about human beings if I&amp;#39;m being honest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t say there was some lesson to all this. It was all pretty random. I don&amp;#39;t know if we all go through this when we die. Maybe a smarter person would of asked better questions.  Maybe you&amp;#39;ll get you&amp;#39;re chance. But if you ever find yourself in The White Room, be careful what you ask for. And tell Death I said &amp;quot;Hello.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The questions and inconsistencies you&amp;#39;re thinking of have occurred to me as well. Death and God said things that don&amp;#39;t quite add up. Jess should be dead by their logic. My guess is that maybe they aren&amp;#39;t all powerful. Or maybe they changed their minds. Or maybe this was all a bad dream. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know. But I&amp;#39;m sure not going to waste my life thinking about it. Life is too long to worry about &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kennon02/submitted/\"&gt;Death.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64ahar/the_white_room/)\n\n[Part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64jsub/the_white_room_part_2/)\n\n[Part 3] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64sx6f/the_white_room_part_3/)\n\n[Part 4] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/652ofo/the_white_room_part_4/)\n\n[Part 5] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65bnju/the_white_room_part_5/)\n\n\nFirstly, I want to thank all of you who have read this far.

So, what would you like?\" He asked. \n\nI thought on his question, and his statements. Humans are repetitive creatures. I think we find comfort in the predictability of life. So I must defend my decision. It's in my nature to want more of a good thing. Life is the ultimate drug that no one can kick. The itch it leaves you with can't be scratched from beyond the grave. \n\n\"I guess I'll go back. To my first life.\" I said. \n\nHe smiled, and nodded. \n\nI nodded at him, and thought of some sort of goodbye. I didn't want to say \"thank you\",  because the words wouldn't be meant. I had earned happiness, in my eyes. \n\n\"When did you become God?\" I asked. \n\n\"When I was ready.\" He said. \n\nAnd with that, I woke up. I was in my bed, once again. It was the morning of my first death. I smiled, feeling the familiar sheets of my bed. I looked to my phone, checking the time. 7:13, Sunday morning. \n\nWithout thinking, I got dressed and got into my car, not waking my parents. I drove to Jessica's house, avoiding the freeway this time. I arrived without killing myself, to my surprise. \n\nI climbed up the tree I had climbed a thousand times before, and looked through Jess's window. I smiled when I saw her shoulders rise as she breathed. She was alive. \n\nI knocked on the window. She woke with a slight jump, looking around her room. I knocked again, and she came over to let me in. \n\n\"Kennon? It's kind of early to be sneaking in, isn't it?\" She said through a yawn. \n\n\"Never too early to see your boyfriend, is it?\" I said with a smirk. \n\n\"You big goof. Come in.\" She said, shaking her head as she plopped back down onto her bed. \n\nI laid next to her and caressed her side.\n\n\"Hope you know I won't be waking up for another couple hours.\" She said through another yawn. \n\nI chuckled, nodding to her. She smiled, and I fell in love all over again. \n\nI prepared for her to spontaneously die on the spot, but she didn't. She just slept in my arms for an hour or so, before we both went down stairs. Her parents joined us later, after I pretended to show up just in time to join them for breakfast. \n\nI expected her to die any day. I had prevented the car crash, but accordingly to Death she was going to die anyway. But she didn't. \n\nIt's been two years since that day, and we're still together. We go to different colleges, as she was always smarter than me. We're happy. I'm happy, despite everything. \n\nI've died a total of eight times. I can't say I learned a lesson, or even the meaning of it all. I met Death, a being who believes himself a God, I've stared a Leviathan in the eye, lost two great loves, and gained one back. After all that, I never lost my will and need to live. Which says a lot about human beings if I'm being honest. \n\nI can't say there was some lesson to all this. It was all pretty random. I don't know if we all go through this when we die. Maybe a smarter person would of asked better questions.  Maybe you'll get you're chance. But if you ever find yourself in The White Room, be careful what you ask for. And tell Death I said \"Hello.\" \n\nThe questions and inconsistencies you're thinking of have occurred to me as well. Death and God said things that don't quite add up. Jess should be dead by their logic. My guess is that maybe they aren't all powerful. Or maybe they changed their minds. Or maybe this was all a bad dream. \n\nI don't know. But I'm sure not going to waste my life thinking about it. Life is too long to worry about [Death.] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/Kennon02/submitted/)\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Series", "id": "65l10w", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 219, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kennon02", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65l10w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.nosleep", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "edited": 1492389604.0, "link_flair_css_class": "flair-series", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/65l10w/the_white_room_final/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492314438.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65l10w/the_white_room_final/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "The White Room [Final]", "created_utc": 1492285638.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 38, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 219}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l10w", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb2wb2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NoSleepAutoBot", "parent_id": "t3_65l10w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It looks like there may be more to this story.
