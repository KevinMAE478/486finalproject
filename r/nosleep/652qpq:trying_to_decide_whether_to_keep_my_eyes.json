I\u2019m a photogrammetry software designer, and I\u2019ve spent the last four years working with fashion and clothing companies. I even worked at Nike for awhile \u2013 they\u2019re already beginning to 3D print shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently had the opportunity to apply my skills to a medical laboratory where they\u2019re beginning to 3D print human tissue. It\u2019s an ingenious concept \u2013 suspending living cells in a smart gel which allows the cells to fuse together into tissue once they\u2019re in alignment. The smart gel is then washed away, leaving an organ of purely human tissue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re the first company to replicate organic vascular structures,\u201d Doctor Hansaf claimed on my first day there. He led me through the sterile halls which droned with dull florescent lighting. \u201cThe organs we print can diffuse oxygen and nutrients even more efficiently than those in your body.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several other lab technicians passed me in the hall. I smiled, but each averted their gaze immediately, finding a sudden fascination with the blank floor tiles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt sounds like you know what you\u2019re doing. What do you need me for?\u201d I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur scaffolding needs to be remodeled. One of our organs seem to be leaking, and we can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhich one?\u201d He didn\u2019t need to answer though. As soon as Doctor Hansaf opened the door at the end of the hallway, I saw the most macabre sight I could have imagined. A steel table was lined with row upon row of human eyeballs, each staring at me from their great, unblinking orbs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leaking might be an accurate term, but they would be better described as crying. The saline liquid filled each eye to overflowing before draining into a multitude of tiny pools upon the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cQuite beautiful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he said, and I jumped a little to realize how close he was behind me. \u201cAlmost perfect \u2013 almost better than perfect. This design can see 3 times sharper than a human with 20/20 vision. It can even see beyond the traditional visual electromagnetic spectrum, perceiving some of the near ultra violet spectrum as well. \u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beautiful isn\u2019t the first word I would have chosen, but I could understand his pride. They looked real enough that you wouldn\u2019t look twice if a pair of these was staring back at you from a human face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe modeling software is on that computer,\u201d he gestured to a desktop workstation in the corner which was setup beside a second door. \u201cYou\u2019ll find all the current designs on there. I\u2019ll give you some time to look everything over and see if you can\u2019t find the issue. I\u2019ll be back to check on you in an hour.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t tear my gaze away from the eyes. I nodded stiffly again, and I heard the door close behind me. I wasn\u2019t about to ditch a job just because of the unsettling environment. I averted my eyes from the table and walked over to the computer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it was booting up, I cast another glance behind me. My heart skipped a beat. Each of the eyes had turned to watch me. They were facing the door a moment before \u2013 but now they were facing me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slowly walked back to the door I came in, watching them this time. They turned to follow me. Without even realizing I was doing so, I put my hand on the door. Locked from the outside. There was a small glass viewing window in the door, but I couldn\u2019t see anything besides the hallway wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHello? Doctor Hansaf?\u201d I knocked on the door. No answer. I turned back, but the eyeballs were pointed toward the opposite door now. I took a deep breath. They weren\u2019t watching me \u2013 it was ridiculous to think they were. There must simply be some fast twitch muscles activating from the salt in the saline solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked to the second door \u2013 locked as well. it was a high security laboratory though. It wasn\u2019t unreasonable to think the doors automatically lock. The doctor must have forgotten about it, but he was going to be back in an hour. I just had to focus on my job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced back at the eyeballs, but they were still facing the door. I sat back down at the computer and loaded up the photogrammetry software. Pretty soon, I was so engrossed at inspecting the intricate scaffolding that I didn\u2019t even think about the eyes behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The secondary door opened beside me. Had an hour passed already? I turned, but I didn\u2019t see anyone in the room. Maybe he just peeked inside and saw I was still working. I turned back to the computer again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footsteps.&lt;/em&gt; I spun around, but I still didn\u2019t see anyone there. I was about to go back to work when I noticed all the eyes were moving once more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footsteps.&lt;/em&gt; Each one was slightly closer \u2013 slightly louder. The eyes were all following the empty space of ground where the sound was coming from. Something was there and I couldn\u2019t see it \u2013 but the artificial eyes could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHello?\u201d I pushed the chair between myself and the footsteps and pressed my body against the desk. \u201cIs somebody there?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chair moved, and the footsteps got closer. I lurched backward into the wall and started moving around the room toward the door I entered from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDoctor Hansaf!\u201d I screamed. \u201cLet me out of here!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pounded on the door. Still locked. Footsteps. The eyes were all pointed directly next to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSomething is in here! Help!\u201d I yelled, slamming against the door with my shoulder.\nA face appeared in the viewing window. One of the lab technicians. He watched me for a moment, then began to write something down on a clipboard. What in the hell? I pounded on the door again and he looked up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI know you can see me!\u201d I yelled. \u201cLet me out of here.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lab technician tapped the side of his left eye. Then his right. He pointed at me. What was he trying to say? I glanced over my shoulder \u2013 the eyes were all watching the ground directly behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tentatively, I reached out my hand and felt something cold and slimy in the air. It was just a couple inches from my face. Something like a hand loosely grabbed me back, but I quickly drew away. It didn\u2019t touch me again after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat are you?\u201d I asked the empty air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footsteps.&lt;/em&gt; The eyes followed them back to the corner of the room. What in the hell was going on? I turned back to the door. The lab technician was holding a piece of paper up against the glass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Would you like to be the first person to see it?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced back at the corner of the room. I nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lab technician wrote something and held it up again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;We will need to replace your eyes. Is that okay?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shook my head. He started writing again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;He\u2019s not the only one. They\u2019re everywhere. We\u2019re not safe.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard the second door open. I turned to see the eyes follow the thing out of the room. The door closed again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The primary door opened at once, and Doctor Hansaf entered. He was smiling, like we had just shared a private joke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell? What do you think?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe don\u2019t entirely know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s something which is only visible in the near ultraviolet spectrum, but machines aren\u2019t able to detect it. We only started noticing them once we printed the eyes.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo you lied to me. You brought me here as a guinea pig.\u201d\nHe shrugged and put his arm around my shoulder. I pushed him off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is a laboratory \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t be surprised to find experiments being done here. But you came voluntarily, you will leave voluntarily, and you will only continue participating if you choose. Will you take the eyes?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAbsolutely not. I want no part in this.\u201d I was already heading marching down the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019ll change your mind,\u201d he called. \u201cCome back here when you do, and we will begin the operation.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot a god-damn chance,\u201d I yelled back over my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t want to come back. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with this messed up experiment. But I was going to return anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because I heard footsteps following me all the &lt;a href=\"http://tobiaswade.com/horror-blog\"&gt;way home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "3D printing is the future, and the future is here.\n\nWe are on the verge of another industrial revolution, and I\u2019m incredibly excited to be a part of it.
