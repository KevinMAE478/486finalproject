We didn\u2019t want to keep paying for the motel, so we ended up crashing with my Mom. She was happy for the company. And she was obviously worried about me. She said I had to get a grip and not let my life slip away. \u201cJust solve this thing,\u201d she said. It was weird. It wasn\u2019t the sort of thing my Mom would say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I woke up. Because I was hearing whispering sounds. You\u2019d think louder sounds would wake you. But no. The whispers are the worst. I listened carefully. I tried not to move. I wanted to hear where they were coming from. It was a two-way conversation. I couldn\u2019t make out any of the content, though. Just a word here and there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up slowly and looked toward the corner of the room. That\u2019s where I thought the sounds were. It took a while for my eyes to adjust. When they did, I saw Milky kneeling in front of one of the electrical sockets. He\u2019d whisper something into it, then turn his head and wait. And whispers came back. He saw my looking then and said, \u201cSome trick, huh?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it was ventriloquism. But why do that alone in the middle of the night? My nerves were shot. I got out of bed and went out to the kitchen for water. I could see someone standing out on the front porch through the kitchen window. Figuring Ben couldn\u2019t sleep either, I went out to ask him if Milky was really ok. Because he didn\u2019t seem to be. I flicked on the outdoor light and stepped out. But it wasn\u2019t Ben out there. It was Milky again. He tried to tell me something about constellations, but I walked back in. Something wasn\u2019t making sense. There was no way he could\u2019ve gotten out that fast. Some trick, huh?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went into the living room. The TV was on. It was the episode of Seinfeld where George finds a doll that looks like his mother. That made me uncomfortable, so I changed to another channel. The program guide said The Ninth Gate would be showing. I always liked that one. But instead of The Ninth Gate, it was The Ten Commandments. Very different movies. Only one number off, though. I guess it was near Easter, so it\u2019s not that odd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing Heston\u2019s Moses posturing with the Egyptians struck me. I never did get to speak to HolyMoses. I let myself be distracted, chased off, or both. And everything happening just seemed to be getting more and more filled with coincidences and connections that weren\u2019t adding up. Or added up too well. Which is the same thing, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started up Mom\u2019s computer. It still ran Windows XP. It was Dad\u2019s computer and she doesn\u2019t like change. I had to download mIRC. As soon as I did, I connected to EFnet. This time I was going to talk to him. He wasn\u2019t hard to find. Just a whois and there he was, in @H1N1. He was the only one in there, besides me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I could send him a message, an email notification appeared on screen. I guess Mom had it on autostart. The notification caught my eye, because it said it was from Det. Thereault, subject \u201cInformation Requested.\u201d I shouldn&amp;#39;t have, but since it was from the detective, I felt it had to concern my situation. I clicked on it and read. He said, \u201cAs we discussed, here is the documentation on the dental records with the doctor\u2019s signature.\u201d The attached document was about the skeletal remains found in the Egypt. I felt a sudden wave of horror, because I thought I knew what was coming. Dad\u2019s bones somehow got in there. But I was wrong. They matched the skeleton up to my dental records. Mine! The detective concluded with, \u201cI don\u2019t know who that man is, but he is not your son.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was just absurd. I knew my own mother, for Pete\u2019s sake! I thought about deleting the email, but that wouldn\u2019t do any good. Then I started piecing things together. Wondering if maybe I really was dead. Or maybe I was an imposter, and that\u2019s why I had memory lapses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I remembered I was just about to message HolyMoses. Why did something always happen when I was about to message him? I went back to IRC and sent a private message asking, \u201cWho are you?\u201d No response. I got a sudden message from u47284u telling me \u201cDo you know where your mother is?\u201d I ignored him. I sent another message to HolyMoses, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s going on?\u201d No response. u47284u wrote, &amp;quot;Are you sure she&amp;#39;s ok?&amp;quot; I took a chance on what I remembered from Angelica\u2019s story. I sent HolyMoses a short message, \u201cM.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This immediately triggered a file transmission, which I accepted. It was a video file. It downloaded in about 5 minutes. If HolyMoses was as old as they claimed, this video would\u2019ve taken a day or two back then. The video was called, \u201cFreedom.mov\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Milky came in from outside, stood a few feet away from me, and stared at me. That was unnerving  enough. Then the pantry door started to open. Ben stepped out. He had to have been sitting cramped in there all that time. He also stood still and just stared at me. My Mom came in from outdoors\u2014why was she outdoors and where? She joined Milky and Ben. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked. They didn\u2019t speak. I felt the tension in the air and the assurance that something would happen. The suspense and stillness was getting worse than anything they could do to me. My heart was beating so fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I had been hearing a dripping sound for a minute or two without paying attention. Too much was going on. Now I looked to where the sound was coming from. I saw fat beetles crawling out from Milky\u2019s sleeves, over his hands, and dropping to the floor. What is going on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I was so afraid I couldn&amp;#39;t feel it anymore. Slowly, I grabbed a loose USB dongle, attached it to my phone, and to the computer. I\u2019m surprised that old computer could read the phone, but it did. While they stared at me, I transferred the video file to my phone. I unplugged the dongle, took my phone, and ran to the bathroom, where I locked myself in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard feet shuffle up to the door and stop there. I turned on the shower to drown out sound and then started watching the video. The webcam being used was severely damaged, by the looks of it. But I could make out a very sickly looking older man.  The audio was distorted. And I had the shower running. So I had to start it over and up the volume. The man said he\u2019s been trying to warn me. The dilaton distortion in the Hole allows him to send messages during brief windows. If I am listening to this, he said, I am in the Hole and have been for a while. Other things are also in here. While he spoke, I kept hearing screams in the background of the recording, some sounded closer than others. He said these things don\u2019t want me going anywhere. I need to get out before it\u2019s too late. He knows, he said, because he\u2019s me. The last thing he said before the video ended abruptly was \u201cthe birds and the bees.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t leave through the door, so I pulled up the blind to leave through the bathroom window. I almost shrieked when I saw my mother\u2019s face pressed up against the window. I was trapped. I thought about pushing through anyway. But I couldn\u2019t hit my mother. I just wasn\u2019t raised that way. I could hit Ben or Milky if I had to. So I took the door. Nobody was there. That just made me worry about where they really were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped outside and still nobody there. I hurried to my car before Mom could come around from the back. Then I heard rapid footsteps. Ben was running right toward me from way down the street. As he got nearer, he started shouting, \u201cStop hurting me!\u201d But he didn\u2019t look in pain. He looked in a rage. I got in my car and started backing. When he got to me, he was pounding on the windows, still screaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I drove straight back to my home, leaving them all behind. The only explanation could be that I\u2019m \u201cin the Hole,\u201d whatever that means. Because there was no other way Ben and my Mom would act like that. But when did that happen? What does it mean? What\u2019s real? Is any of what I\u2019m writing really making it online? I don\u2019t understand any of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I even stepped inside my home, I knew something was wrong. Waves of something\u2014just bad, pure bad\u2014were hitting me. I opened up. It looked normal. I started turning on all the lights. And I grabbed a knife from the kitchen drawer. Then I saw them. Two men in bee costumes sitting on my treadmill. Looking at the floor. Not moving. Almost like they were stuffed. Or forgot where they were. \u201cWhat do you people want from me?\u201d I asked. I kept a tight grip on the knife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They stood up. Then they both looked down the hall toward my office. I followed their gaze, but saw nothing down there. After a few seconds of wondering what they saw, I heard the song start. \u201cEarly in the Morning.\u201d While I was looking down the hall, they were already heading out the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to follow them. Because whatever started that music gave me a worse feeling than them. As I stepped out the door, I\u2019m sure I heard a dog growling behind me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I followed them across the road and into the woods. I turned my phone flashlight on to be able to follow them. It\u2019s like they could see in the dark, the way they navigated the woods. The deeper we went, the more uneasy I became. They just seemed to keep going and going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the deeper we went, the more I started to hear birds. I never even thought of it before, but I hadn\u2019t heard any birds for a long time. Weeks at least. Or locusts or any normal springtime sounds. The more I followed the bees, the more I heard the birds, until they got loud enough I figured we must be under a massive collection of nests. I kept following them until it got too loud to bear and then it sounded like machinery, like elevators.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I was back in my office, sitting at my desk, slumped over my keyboard. The corner of my mouth was wet. I picked myself up. It felt like I was just waking up from a deep sleep. The room was bright with sunlight. I could hear birds chirping up a frenzy outside. My screensaver was on. When I shifted the mouse, just to see what time it was, the last email from Angelica, with the instructions to get to the Hole was up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I know time passed. I know I wasn\u2019t just sitting in my office the whole time. Someone would\u2019ve noticed, called in a wellness check, something. It\u2019s been weeks. And you\u2019ve been reading this over a period of weeks. This didn\u2019t just show up one day. I know what I\u2019m supposed to think. I just don\u2019t know how to make sense of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat disoriented for a while, before realizing I had to urinate, eat and drink. When I had done those things, I looked around my home for clues. The knife I\u2019d taken was back where it belonged. My old computer was put up in its box. I called my Mom to ask if she was OK. She didn\u2019t remember any of the events I mentioned, nor ever encountering any men in bee costumes. I called Det. Thereault. He said I contacted him on a lead about missing children, but he was unable to substantiate my claims. I asked if there really were missing children. He said, \u201cSir, there are always missing children\u201d and hung up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was at my wit\u2019s end. I sent an email to Angelica, asking her if she was alive or missing or in need of help. She replied pretty quickly. She didn\u2019t answer my questions. She said, \u201cPretty intense, huh? You can spend the rest of your life in there.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s when I remembered the video on my phone. From HolyMoses. I checked and it was still there. I knew I wasn\u2019t dreaming. I played it back. Here would be my evidence. The video was 2 minutes of distorted audio and video. In all the distortions, no recognizable sounds or images. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was a few days ago. It\u2019s taken me some time to get calibrated to reality. Nothing strange has happened since. I can\u2019t explain what happened. Maybe I had a psychotic break. I was under a lot of stress at work. Maybe someone was gaslighting the hell out of me. Maybe there really is a secret website that uses electromagnetic waves to mess with your mind.  Or, you may think, maybe I\u2019m just making everything up, a sad internet nerd in love with usenet and gopher sites. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s over. I\u2019m glad to be going back to work like a regular person. Making banana smoothies. Not thinking about sinister internet cafes. I really do remember the Egypt and the Hole and\u2014it\u2019s like reality all twisted. I\u2019ll just end by saying I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be feeling any nostalgia for the old days of internet for a good, long while. I\u2019ll start appreciating nature and well-ordered reality a lot more instead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abracadabra.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Part 10](https://redd.it/64ba66)\n\nI woke up in the middle of the night a few nights ago.
