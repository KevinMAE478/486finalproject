I wish it was good news, but it seems like things have only gotten worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I opened the box with the video camera, I drove straight to my Mom&amp;#39;s home. There was no way I was going to stay at my own home when some creepy surgical mask fucker knew where I lived. I was slamming one fist on my Mom&amp;#39;s door, while holding the package in the other. I was knocking so hard that I&amp;#39;m surprised the whole neighborhood didn&amp;#39;t come out to see what was going on. Finally, the door swung open. But it wasn&amp;#39;t my mother who had answered it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the nurse. You see, my grandfather also lives with my mother, but he&amp;#39;s close to 100 years old and requires a special amount of attention that my mother just can&amp;#39;t give him. So, she hired a caretaker to help her throughout the day. I had met her a couple times, but I was still struggling to remember her name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, hey...you.\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHi.\u201d She said flatly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She walked back into the house, leaving the door wide open. I followed in after her and shut the door behind me, making sure to lock it. I walked into the kitchen and laid the box out on the table. The only noise in the whole house was the daytime television from the living room. I glanced over in there. My grandfather was sitting in his chair. He was asleep. The nurse was spread out on the couch, playing with her phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took out my cell phone and called the police again. I explained to them everything I had told the 911 operator earlier that day, but said that I had received an ominous package from \u201cmarbles\u201d as well. I was told that a couple of officers would come to my location and make sure everything was alright. They said to leave the package alone, as they would take it for the investigation. I understood perfectly. I hung up my phone, and turned my attention back to the box on the table. It took everything I had inside me not to tear it up, throw it against the wall, stuff it down the garbage disposal...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSomeone&amp;#39;s stalking you?\u201d I heard from directly behind me. I won&amp;#39;t lie, I jumped. But it was just the nurse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI...don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s any of your business?\u201d I said. I know that might sound rude, but I didn&amp;#39;t want anyone else getting pulled into this mess. She persisted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAlright, whatever. It&amp;#39;s just that I&amp;#39;ve been in your shoes. With creepers and all that.\u201d She said. She grabbed a mug out of the cabinet and started to make tea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, uh, what happened?\u201d I took a seat at the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust some ex-boyfriend stuff. Sending me shit at work and all that. It finally ended after I got the restraining order.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah, well I don&amp;#39;t think my problem will be solved that easily.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She asked why, and I had explained to her the entire situation. I told her about the horrible videos, and that deranged man that I now called \u201cmarbles\u201d. She actually seemed to believe me, and at least for a second I didn&amp;#39;t feel completely alone. By the time I had finished the story, we both had a cup of tea and she was eyeing the box in between us. She pulled it over and began to open it. I wanted to object, but let her do it anyways. Oh God, why did I let her?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWow. Fancy stuff.\u201d She said as she pulled out the box for the Canon Vixia. She yanked out the note from marbles, flipped it over, and then tossed it back in. \u201cSo you&amp;#39;re just going to hand this over to the cops?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI wouldn&amp;#39;t. I mean, cops are useless. This camera probably won&amp;#39;t make it an entire week in the evidence locker before being taken home or sold on ebay. I think you should keep it. Hell, maybe something&amp;#39;s on it.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you insane?\u201d I stood up from the table and grabbed the camera box right out of her hands. \u201cThe police are not useless, they&amp;#39;re my one shot to catch this bastard! And plus, I already told them I had a package from the guy, what would I tell them when they got here? It just vanished?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSure.\u201d She smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAgain, you&amp;#39;re insane.\u201d I placed the camera box back in the larger box and closed it. As I did that, my mom came through the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had texted her about what was going on earlier, and as she walked in she dropped everything and just hugged me. I hugged her back tightly. I could feel my eyes tearing up. My mom let go and looked into my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, Anthony, sweetheart, I&amp;#39;m so glad you&amp;#39;re okay.\u201d She said in a way only a mother could. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMom, I don&amp;#39;t want you to worry about me. Really.\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNonsense. You&amp;#39;re my son.\u201d My mother said. \u201cAnd you&amp;#39;re staying here until they catch this weirdo. Even if it takes years! Oh, and Heather, thank you so much for your help! You can go home for the day, honey. And don&amp;#39;t worry about coming back tomorrow, because I&amp;#39;ve already taken the day off to be with Anthony.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGotcha. Thanks.\u201d The nurse said. So that was her name. Heather. Hm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom begged me to come check out her new flowers out front, and I followed her out. She was going on and on about how fun gardening was or whatever, but all I could focus on was across the street. Someone was out walking their dog...a cocker spaniel. The images of the video flashed into my head and I felt my knees go weak. The dog looked over at me, and I swear for a brief moment we made eye contact. Then the owner tugged it away. I was freaked out by now, so I told my mom I wanted to go back inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before we could, however, a car pulled up to our street. A police car. As they were getting out of their vehicle, I noticed Heather getting into hers. She placed her giant bag of caretaker supplies on her passengers seat and then looked at me. She gave me a nod. I gave her a nod back. And then she pulled away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt&amp;#39;s about time you got here!\u201d My mom yelled at the police. There were two officers walking up to the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMom...\u201d I whispered to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSorry about that, ma&amp;#39;am. Is everyone alright?\u201d One of the officers said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI&amp;#39;m fine.\u201d I said. \u201cJust wanna catch this guy.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe all do, son. Why don&amp;#39;t you take us inside and we&amp;#39;ll check out this package you got?\u201d The officer said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother and I led them inside. The light from the television was the only thing illuminating the entire house now. I flicked on the dim light in the kitchen. The package was still on the table. One of the officers, the one who had talked to us before, grabbed the package and opened it up. He just stared inside for about a minute or so, then looked at me blankly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAm I missing something here?\u201d He asked me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI&amp;#39;m sorry?\u201d I said. He pulled out the note from marbles and set it on the table. Then he flipped over the box to show me inside. It was empty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cA big package with just a tiny note?\u201d The officer said. \u201cI remember reports that there was something else.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cA camera! He sent me a camera, in a brand new box. But I...I had it before...I...\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDoesn&amp;#39;t seem to be one here. Tell me, son, what do you do for a living?\u201d The officer asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, I explained to the woman on the phone, I review flagged Youtube videos. That&amp;#39;s how I found this marbles guy...the stalker. Why?\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, sometimes when we&amp;#39;re under a lot of stress our minds can play tricks on us.\u201d The officer seemed to be beginning some sort of lecture, but I cut him off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, other people have seen it! My grandfather&amp;#39;s caretaker saw it...I-I sent my boss photos!\u201d I said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The officer asked to see the photos of it on my phone. I pulled them up frantically on my phone, but then I realized...I had only taken a picture of the note. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo, you don&amp;#39;t have any proof that you received a camera?\u201d The officer said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell...no, I guess. But what does it matter? I still got a package from this motherfucker, why can&amp;#39;t you do your job and find out who sent it?!\u201d I raised my voice at him. My mom put her hand on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnthony...maybe you should consider what the policeman is saying.\u201d She said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo...I...Heather saw it, Mom. She saw it too.\u201d It came out like a whimper. There was a long pause between the room. Finally, the officer broke the silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe&amp;#39;ll go ahead and take what you got here, see if we can find anything and give you a call back.\u201d The officer picked up the practically empty box. \u201cIf you have any updates on the situation, give us a ring.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom thanked them and showed them out the door. For the rest of the night she seemed to talk to me like I was a fucking baby again. Like any wrong word was going to make me snap. My mom thinks I&amp;#39;m pretty much insane now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night, I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep at all. I usually go online before going to bed, but for obvious reasons I just wasn&amp;#39;t up to it right then. I tossed and turned in the twin bed I had slept in when I was a child. Every time I shut my eyes, I could see him. Covered in blood. My eyes would immediately shoot back open again. There were a lot of noises outside. Just normal rustling and clanking around. But I could swear it was him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I was laying there, just staring at my ceiling all night, it hit me. I know where the camera went. Heather had taken it. I had no proof she did, but it must have been her. She was the one who was interested in it and wanted me to keep it. I decided I&amp;#39;d get her address from my mom tomorrow, get the camera and then charge her with obstruction of justice or something, I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up from my bed in the morning. I hadn&amp;#39;t slept at all, even though I was tired as hell. My mom was already in the kitchen, making breakfast and talking about our day together. My grandfather was just sleeping on the couch again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMom, what&amp;#39;s Heather&amp;#39;s address?\u201d I asked. My mom perked up at that question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnthony, are you planning on asking her on a date?\u201d She asked, flipping a pancake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat? No! Mom, she has the camera.\u201d My mom&amp;#39;s upbeat attitude suddenly crashed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnthony...\u201d My mom said. \u201cLet&amp;#39;s just focus on having a fun day today.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI need to get the camera so I can show the police that I&amp;#39;m not crazy! Just give me her address, I&amp;#39;ll go over there and-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, Anthony. No. There&amp;#39;s no camera. But it doesn&amp;#39;t matter, sweetheart, if this guy is out there the police will catch him anyways.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf? IF?! Fuck you.\u201d I got up from the table and walked straight out the door. My mom called after me, but I ignored everything she was saying and got in my car. I had to go to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was happy to see my boss that day. He had actually seen marbles and I knew he believed me. When I got into work, he called me into his office and I almost tripped while rushing in there. I sat down and immediately started telling him about what had happened yesterday. He stopped me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnthony, we have to talk about this.\u201d He said. I nodded and he continued. \u201cThe note you found is very concerning. In fact, I actually discussed it with some of the other managers here.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh?\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah. And we&amp;#39;re all in agreement that you should take some vacation time from work. Go enjoy life a little bit.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI can still do my job, this whole stalker thing just-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnthony.\u201d My boss said. \u201cThere&amp;#39;s no way someone could have gotten your location from a Youtube comment. And ship you an Amazon package before the night was over. We understand this job can be a lot, we have both seen some really gruesome things. I think some time off would be good for you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo no no no no. You saw the note. The- the police are involved now, I...\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnthony, your mother called me before you came in this morning. I know about what happened with the police last night.\u201d He said. We sat in silence for a few minutes. Finally, I spoke up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI&amp;#39;ll just work today. Then I&amp;#39;ll take the vacation.\u201d I said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGood. It&amp;#39;s for the best. There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with needing a break.\u201d My boss said. I nodded and left the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reviewed video after video. You stay. You&amp;#39;re removed. You stay. You&amp;#39;re removed. Stay. Remove. Stay. Remove. Stay. Remove. Remove. Remove. I kept a steady rhythm to it. It hadn&amp;#39;t been a very unusual day at work so far. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, I felt a smile creep onto my face. A new video flagged for \u201cinvades my privacy\u201d. The channel name?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;marbles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t have clicked on the video any faster. But just as fast as it had started playing, it ended. The video was only one second long. I clicked replay and pause on the single frame. It was just a wall, a different wall from before. This one was more of a beige color. And it had a piece of paper taped to the middle of it. There was something written on the paper, but I couldn&amp;#39;t tell what it was. It just looked like scribbled. I decided to go into full screen mode. I could see it a little bit clearer now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was an address that I didn&amp;#39;t recognize. It seemed to be for an apartment. I took out my phone and wrote down the address in my notes. Was this where I was going to meet marbles? I was so engrossed in the video, I hadn&amp;#39;t even noticed the title. My stomach dropped when I saw it. It just said \u201churry\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get marbles&amp;#39; IP, but I knew I didn&amp;#39;t have time. I sent an IM to my coworker, Noah, with a link to the video and asked him to find the IP of the channel for me. Noah agreed to do it. I grabbed my keys and ran out of the building.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was speeding past all the traffic on the way to this address. I had 911 on the line, I was practically screaming at them to send police to the address, that there was a man there possibly hurting my mother or plans to hurt me or God knows what. They asked me not to go to the address and to let police handle it, but I knew I couldn&amp;#39;t do that. I ran a fucking red light to get to this place. I had to get there. I had to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got to the apartment complex, I didn&amp;#39;t even bother to find a spot. I parked in the middle of the street. I ran around the complex, looking for the specific apartment. I didn&amp;#39;t ask any of the locals, I didn&amp;#39;t want them to get involved. And plus, it didn&amp;#39;t take me that long to find it anyways. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The door was long and almost seemed to tower over me. No windows. The number of the apartment was posted next to the door. The numbers looked a little worn out. I grabbed the door knob and took a heavy breath. I turned it, and it was unlocked. I slowly pushed it as it creaked open. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire apartment was dark. The only light was the sun coming through the open door. In fact, I could barely see inside. I slipped in anyways, and shut the door softly behind me. It was dead silent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I crept around each room, looking each way carefully. It suddenly occurred to me, in all of the commotion I hadn&amp;#39;t even brought any kind of weapon to defend myself. I gulped and prayed I wouldn&amp;#39;t need one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard a footstep above me and jumped. I almost tripped over, before catching myself on an end table. I scraped my hand against its corner, which stung a little bit. As I rubbed my hand, I noticed something on the end table that turned my whole world upside down. It was a picture...of Heather. She was with some friends. This must have been her apartment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I picked up my pace around the apartment, still hesitant, but eager to find what was going on. I stepped into the bedroom. It seemed empty, but the closet was closed. I slowly walked up to the closet. As I did, my entire body was trembling. I placed my hand against the handle. It was cold. I pressed my ear against the closet door. There was something on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could hear some sort of weird sound. Like a low kind of grumbling noise. I backed away from the door and covered my mouth so whoever it was couldn&amp;#39;t hear me whimper. I could hear them brush against the other side of the door. Almost like they were clawing at it, begging to get out. I balled my hands into fists, strutted over there, and slid the closet door right open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was just a cat. It purred and brushed against my leg. Stupid cat. The only other thing in the closet was a shovel. It looked messy, like there was dirt on it, but it was too dark to tell. I reached to pick it up, when I heard something behind me. It was a glaring, high-pitched screeching noise, like a buzzsaw or something. I whipped around and what I saw is still a mystery to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I assume was Heather&amp;#39;s laptop, was on her bed. It was turned on, and playing a Youtube video. Weird, because I didn&amp;#39;t see it turned on before. I rushed over to the laptop and paused the video. It was a 10 minute video uploaded by...marbles. My jaw dropped. I didn&amp;#39;t want to watch the rest at that very moment, but I remember that the video was titled \u201croman\u201d and the frame I had paused on was very blurry. Too blurry to make out what was going on. I looked up from the laptop. There, on the wall, was the piece of paper with the address on it. This is where he filmed. He had been here...and still could be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stumbled back over to the closet and picked up the shovel, holding it above my head. I wanted to yell at him to come out, I wanted to be brave, but I didn&amp;#39;t have it in me. I flicked on the lights to the bedroom and things were a lot clearer now. I started backing away from the bedroom door, because I knew I couldn&amp;#39;t face him. I just knew I couldn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up backing up into the bed, and I fell backwards onto it. The shovel landed right next to my face. And for the first time, I could actually see what was on it. It wasn&amp;#39;t dirt. Dirt isn&amp;#39;t red. It was blood. Dried blood. I felt tears coming down my face, I covered my eyes and tried not to make a sound. And then...someone grabbed my throat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I screamed, and then reached for the shovel, swinging it around. They jumped back and let go, and I stood up from the bed holding the shovel like it was a staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat the FUCK are you doing?\u201d It was Heather. I dropped the shovel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHeather, oh God, Heather, I&amp;#39;m sorry.\u201d I said. \u201cHe was here...marbles was...\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYour stalker?\u201d Heather said. \u201cWhy would he be here, Anthony? And what the hell is that?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don&amp;#39;t know. I was at work and I saw a video by him with this address. I had no idea this is where you lived.\u201d I said. \u201cI found this in the closet.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I picked up the shovel and handed it to her. Before she could even get a close look at it, there was a knock at the door. The police. I had completely forgotten I called them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh shit, it&amp;#39;s the cops. I called them on my way over here, I...\u201d Heather stopped me from talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI&amp;#39;ll handle this.\u201d She said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heather answered the door and talked to the officers. She explained to them how she was actually my nurse and that I was having an episode, that she didn&amp;#39;t want to press any charges. The police seemed to understand, said their goodbyes and left. I sat there completely dumbfounded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy lie? Why not tell them?\u201d I asked. \u201cThere could be fingerprints or something! We could test the blood on the shovel!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt&amp;#39;s like I told you the other day, the cops are useless.\u201d She said. \u201cDid they even believe your story yesterday?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, I don&amp;#39;t think so. And it&amp;#39;s because you stole the camera.\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCamera?\u201d She said. \u201cI never took the camera. I left it in the box, Anthony.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat- that&amp;#39;s impossible!\u201d I stuttered. \u201cIt was gone...\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTake it from me...\u201d She grabbed me by the arms. \u201cI&amp;#39;ve been here. If you want this resolved, we&amp;#39;re going to have to do most of the work.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reluctantly nodded. What other choice did I have? She was the only one who believed me, the only one who was willing to help me 100%. Heather was my only ally in this whole situation. I couldn&amp;#39;t afford to be alone right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was willing to accept that maybe she didn&amp;#39;t take the camera. She seemed sincere, but I didn&amp;#39;t know what other explanation there could be. Had marbles been in my mother&amp;#39;s house? I still shutter at the very idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heather and I sat on her bed and just talked for a long time. We talked about my issues with marbles and her old problem with her past stalker. Apparently her ex-boyfriend really couldn&amp;#39;t let her go. He&amp;#39;d send her hundreds and hundreds of letters, come to her work, and follow her when she went around town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the conversation slowed down, Heather noticed the paper with her address on her wall. She gave a slight smile, almost like she was amused by it. She plucked it off the wall, and held it to her face. Then, my mouth dropped. I started shaking again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHeather...\u201d I said, and very weakly pointed to the back on the paper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the paper, was a handwritten message. It was written in very dark pencil, with very thin and shaky letters. And the note just read:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFilm.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65wpjc/i_have_proof_of_something_sinister_on_youtube/\"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64l3fu/i_found_something_sinister_on_youtube/)\n\nI apologize for not updating sooner, but I've been quite busy lately. I wish it was good news, but it seems like things have only gotten worse.\n\n\nAfter I opened the box with the video camera, I drove straight to my Mom's home. There was no way I was going to stay at my own home when some creepy surgical mask fucker knew where I lived. I was slamming one fist on my Mom's door, while holding the package in the other. I was knocking so hard that I'm surprised the whole neighborhood didn't come out to see what was going on. Finally, the door swung open. But it wasn't my mother who had answered it.\n\n\nIt was the nurse. You see, my grandfather also lives with my mother, but he's close to 100 years old and requires a special amount of attention that my mother just can't give him. So, she hired a caretaker to help her throughout the day. I had met her a couple times, but I was still struggling to remember her name.\n\n\n\u201cOh, hey...you.\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d She said flatly.\n\n\nShe walked back into the house, leaving the door wide open. I followed in after her and shut the door behind me, making sure to lock it. I walked into the kitchen and laid the box out on the table. The only noise in the whole house was the daytime television from the living room. I glanced over in there. My grandfather was sitting in his chair. He was asleep. The nurse was spread out on the couch, playing with her phone.\n\n\nI took out my cell phone and called the police again. I explained to them everything I had told the 911 operator earlier that day, but said that I had received an ominous package from \u201cmarbles\u201d as well. I was told that a couple of officers would come to my location and make sure everything was alright. They said to leave the package alone, as they would take it for the investigation. I understood perfectly. I hung up my phone, and turned my attention back to the box on the table. It took everything I had inside me not to tear it up, throw it against the wall, stuff it down the garbage disposal...\n\n\n\u201cSomeone's stalking you?\u201d I heard from directly behind me. I won't lie, I jumped. But it was just the nurse.\n\n\n\u201cI...don't think that's any of your business?\u201d I said. I know that might sound rude, but I didn't want anyone else getting pulled into this mess. She persisted.\n\n\n\u201cAlright, whatever. It's just that I've been in your shoes. With creepers and all that.\u201d She said. She grabbed a mug out of the cabinet and started to make tea.\n\n\n\u201cWell, uh, what happened?\u201d I took a seat at the table.\n\n\n\u201cJust some ex-boyfriend stuff. Sending me shit at work and all that. It finally ended after I got the restraining order.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well I don't think my problem will be solved that easily.\u201d\n\n\nShe asked why, and I had explained to her the entire situation. I told her about the horrible videos, and that deranged man that I now called \u201cmarbles\u201d. She actually seemed to believe me, and at least for a second I didn't feel completely alone. By the time I had finished the story, we both had a cup of tea and she was eyeing the box in between us. She pulled it over and began to open it. I wanted to object, but let her do it anyways. Oh God, why did I let her?\n\n\n\u201cWow. Fancy stuff.\u201d She said as she pulled out the box for the Canon Vixia. She yanked out the note from marbles, flipped it over, and then tossed it back in. \u201cSo you're just going to hand this over to the cops?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI wouldn't. I mean, cops are useless. This camera probably won't make it an entire week in the evidence locker before being taken home or sold on ebay. I think you should keep it. Hell, maybe something's on it.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAre you insane?\u201d I stood up from the table and grabbed the camera box right out of her hands. \u201cThe police are not useless, they're my one shot to catch this bastard! And plus, I already told them I had a package from the guy, what would I tell them when they got here? It just vanished?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d She smiled.\n\n\n\u201cAgain, you're insane.\u201d I placed the camera box back in the larger box and closed it. As I did that, my mom came through the door.\n\n\nI had texted her about what was going on earlier, and as she walked in she dropped everything and just hugged me. I hugged her back tightly. I could feel my eyes tearing up. My mom let go and looked into my eyes.\n\n\n\u201cOh, Anthony, sweetheart, I'm so glad you're okay.\u201d She said in a way only a mother could. \n\n\n\u201cMom, I don't want you to worry about me. Really.\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cNonsense. You're my son.\u201d My mother said. \u201cAnd you're staying here until they catch this weirdo. Even if it takes years! Oh, and Heather, thank you so much for your help! You can go home for the day, honey. And don't worry about coming back tomorrow, because I've already taken the day off to be with Anthony.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGotcha. Thanks.\u201d The nurse said. So that was her name. Heather. Hm.\n\n\nMy mom begged me to come check out her new flowers out front, and I followed her out. She was going on and on about how fun gardening was or whatever, but all I could focus on was across the street. Someone was out walking their dog...a cocker spaniel. The images of the video flashed into my head and I felt my knees go weak. The dog looked over at me, and I swear for a brief moment we made eye contact. Then the owner tugged it away. I was freaked out by now, so I told my mom I wanted to go back inside.\n\n\nBefore we could, however, a car pulled up to our street. A police car. As they were getting out of their vehicle, I noticed Heather getting into hers. She placed her giant bag of caretaker supplies on her passengers seat and then looked at me. She gave me a nod. I gave her a nod back. And then she pulled away.\n\n\n\u201cIt's about time you got here!\u201d My mom yelled at the police. There were two officers walking up to the house.\n\n\n\u201cMom...\u201d I whispered to her.\n\n\n\u201cSorry about that, ma'am. Is everyone alright?\u201d One of the officers said.\n\n\n\u201cI'm fine.\u201d I said. \u201cJust wanna catch this guy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe all do, son. Why don't you take us inside and we'll check out this package you got?\u201d The officer said.\n\n\nMy mother and I led them inside. The light from the television was the only thing illuminating the entire house now. I flicked on the dim light in the kitchen. The package was still on the table. One of the officers, the one who had talked to us before, grabbed the package and opened it up. He just stared inside for about a minute or so, then looked at me blankly.\n\n\n\u201cAm I missing something here?\u201d He asked me.\n\n\n\u201cI'm sorry?\u201d I said. He pulled out the note from marbles and set it on the table. Then he flipped over the box to show me inside. It was empty.\n\n\n\u201cA big package with just a tiny note?\u201d The officer said. \u201cI remember reports that there was something else.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA camera! He sent me a camera, in a brand new box. But I...I had it before...I...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoesn't seem to be one here. Tell me, son, what do you do for a living?\u201d The officer asked.\n\n\n\u201cWell, I explained to the woman on the phone, I review flagged Youtube videos. That's how I found this marbles guy...the stalker. Why?\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cWell, sometimes when we're under a lot of stress our minds can play tricks on us.\u201d The officer seemed to be beginning some sort of lecture, but I cut him off.\n\n\n\u201cNo, other people have seen it! My grandfather's caretaker saw it...I-I sent my boss photos!\u201d I said. \n\n\nThe officer asked to see the photos of it on my phone. I pulled them up frantically on my phone, but then I realized...I had only taken a picture of the note. \n\n\n\u201cSo, you don't have any proof that you received a camera?\u201d The officer said.\n\n\n\u201cWell...no, I guess. But what does it matter? I still got a package from this motherfucker, why can't you do your job and find out who sent it?!\u201d I raised my voice at him. My mom put her hand on my shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cAnthony...maybe you should consider what the policeman is saying.\u201d She said.\n\n\n\u201cNo...I...Heather saw it, Mom. She saw it too.\u201d It came out like a whimper. There was a long pause between the room. Finally, the officer broke the silence.\n\n\n\u201cWe'll go ahead and take what you got here, see if we can find anything and give you a call back.\u201d The officer picked up the practically empty box. \u201cIf you have any updates on the situation, give us a ring.\u201d\n\n\nMy mom thanked them and showed them out the door. For the rest of the night she seemed to talk to me like I was a fucking baby again. Like any wrong word was going to make me snap. My mom thinks I'm pretty much insane now. \n\n\nThat night, I couldn't sleep at all. I usually go online before going to bed, but for obvious reasons I just wasn't up to it right then. I tossed and turned in the twin bed I had slept in when I was a child. Every time I shut my eyes, I could see him. Covered in blood. My eyes would immediately shoot back open again. There were a lot of noises outside. Just normal rustling and clanking around. But I could swear it was him.\n\n\nAs I was laying there, just staring at my ceiling all night, it hit me. I know where the camera went. Heather had taken it. I had no proof she did, but it must have been her. She was the one who was interested in it and wanted me to keep it. I decided I'd get her address from my mom tomorrow, get the camera and then charge her with obstruction of justice or something, I don't know.\n\n\nI got up from my bed in the morning. I hadn't slept at all, even though I was tired as hell. My mom was already in the kitchen, making breakfast and talking about our day together. My grandfather was just sleeping on the couch again.\n\n\n\u201cMom, what's Heather's address?\u201d I asked. My mom perked up at that question.\n\n\n\u201cAnthony, are you planning on asking her on a date?\u201d She asked, flipping a pancake.\n\n\n\u201cWhat? No! Mom, she has the camera.\u201d My mom's upbeat attitude suddenly crashed. \n\n\n\u201cAnthony...\u201d My mom said. \u201cLet's just focus on having a fun day today.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI need to get the camera so I can show the police that I'm not crazy! Just give me her address, I'll go over there and-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, Anthony. No. There's no camera. But it doesn't matter, sweetheart, if this guy is out there the police will catch him anyways.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf? IF?! Fuck you.\u201d I got up from the table and walked straight out the door. My mom called after me, but I ignored everything she was saying and got in my car. I had to go to work.\n\n\nI was happy to see my boss that day. He had actually seen marbles and I knew he believed me. When I got into work, he called me into his office and I almost tripped while rushing in there. I sat down and immediately started telling him about what had happened yesterday. He stopped me.\n\n\n\u201cAnthony, we have to talk about this.\u201d He said. I nodded and he continued. \u201cThe note you found is very concerning. In fact, I actually discussed it with some of the other managers here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cYeah. And we're all in agreement that you should take some vacation time from work. Go enjoy life a little bit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can still do my job, this whole stalker thing just-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnthony.\u201d My boss said. \u201cThere's no way someone could have gotten your location from a Youtube comment. And ship you an Amazon package before the night was over. We understand this job can be a lot, we have both seen some really gruesome things. I think some time off would be good for you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo no no no no. You saw the note. The- the police are involved now, I...\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAnthony, your mother called me before you came in this morning. I know about what happened with the police last night.\u201d He said. We sat in silence for a few minutes. Finally, I spoke up.\n\n\n\u201cI'll just work today. Then I'll take the vacation.\u201d I said. \n\n\n\u201cGood. It's for the best. There's nothing wrong with needing a break.\u201d My boss said. I nodded and left the room.\n\n\nI reviewed video after video. You stay. You're removed. You stay. You're removed. Stay. Remove. Stay. Remove. Stay. Remove. Remove. Remove. I kept a steady rhythm to it. It hadn't been a very unusual day at work so far. \n\n\nAnd then, I felt a smile creep onto my face. A new video flagged for \u201cinvades my privacy\u201d. The channel name?\n\n\nmarbles.\n\n\nI couldn't have clicked on the video any faster. But just as fast as it had started playing, it ended. The video was only one second long. I clicked replay and pause on the single frame. It was just a wall, a different wall from before. This one was more of a beige color. And it had a piece of paper taped to the middle of it. There was something written on the paper, but I couldn't tell what it was. It just looked like scribbled. I decided to go into full screen mode. I could see it a little bit clearer now. \n\n\nIt was an address that I didn't recognize. It seemed to be for an apartment. I took out my phone and wrote down the address in my notes. Was this where I was going to meet marbles? I was so engrossed in the video, I hadn't even noticed the title. My stomach dropped when I saw it. It just said \u201churry\u201d. \n\n\nI wanted to get marbles' IP, but I knew I didn't have time. I sent an IM to my coworker, Noah, with a link to the video and asked him to find the IP of the channel for me. Noah agreed to do it. I grabbed my keys and ran out of the building.\n\n\nI was speeding past all the traffic on the way to this address. I had 911 on the line, I was practically screaming at them to send police to the address, that there was a man there possibly hurting my mother or plans to hurt me or God knows what. They asked me not to go to the address and to let police handle it, but I knew I couldn't do that. I ran a fucking red light to get to this place. I had to get there. I had to know.\n\n\nWhen I got to the apartment complex, I didn't even bother to find a spot. I parked in the middle of the street. I ran around the complex, looking for the specific apartment. I didn't ask any of the locals, I didn't want them to get involved. And plus, it didn't take me that long to find it anyways. \n\n\nThe door was long and almost seemed to tower over me. No windows. The number of the apartment was posted next to the door. The numbers looked a little worn out. I grabbed the door knob and took a heavy breath. I turned it, and it was unlocked. I slowly pushed it as it creaked open. \n\n\nThe entire apartment was dark. The only light was the sun coming through the open door. In fact, I could barely see inside. I slipped in anyways, and shut the door softly behind me. It was dead silent. \n\n\nI crept around each room, looking each way carefully. It suddenly occurred to me, in all of the commotion I hadn't even brought any kind of weapon to defend myself. I gulped and prayed I wouldn't need one. \n\n\nI heard a footstep above me and jumped. I almost tripped over, before catching myself on an end table. I scraped my hand against its corner, which stung a little bit. As I rubbed my hand, I noticed something on the end table that turned my whole world upside down. It was a picture...of Heather. She was with some friends. This must have been her apartment. \n\n\nI picked up my pace around the apartment, still hesitant, but eager to find what was going on. I stepped into the bedroom. It seemed empty, but the closet was closed. I slowly walked up to the closet. As I did, my entire body was trembling. I placed my hand against the handle. It was cold. I pressed my ear against the closet door. There was something on the other side.\n\n\nI could hear some sort of weird sound. Like a low kind of grumbling noise. I backed away from the door and covered my mouth so whoever it was couldn't hear me whimper. I could hear them brush against the other side of the door. Almost like they were clawing at it, begging to get out. I balled my hands into fists, strutted over there, and slid the closet door right open.\n\n\nIt was just a cat. It purred and brushed against my leg. Stupid cat. The only other thing in the closet was a shovel. It looked messy, like there was dirt on it, but it was too dark to tell. I reached to pick it up, when I heard something behind me. It was a glaring, high-pitched screeching noise, like a buzzsaw or something. I whipped around and what I saw is still a mystery to me. \n\n\nWhat I assume was Heather's laptop, was on her bed. It was turned on, and playing a Youtube video. Weird, because I didn't see it turned on before. I rushed over to the laptop and paused the video. It was a 10 minute video uploaded by...marbles. My jaw dropped. I didn't want to watch the rest at that very moment, but I remember that the video was titled \u201croman\u201d and the frame I had paused on was very blurry. Too blurry to make out what was going on. I looked up from the laptop. There, on the wall, was the piece of paper with the address on it. This is where he filmed. He had been here...and still could be. \n\n\nI stumbled back over to the closet and picked up the shovel, holding it above my head. I wanted to yell at him to come out, I wanted to be brave, but I didn't have it in me. I flicked on the lights to the bedroom and things were a lot clearer now. I started backing away from the bedroom door, because I knew I couldn't face him. I just knew I couldn't. \n\n\nI ended up backing up into the bed, and I fell backwards onto it. The shovel landed right next to my face. And for the first time, I could actually see what was on it. It wasn't dirt. Dirt isn't red. It was blood. Dried blood. I felt tears coming down my face, I covered my eyes and tried not to make a sound. And then...someone grabbed my throat. \n\n\nI screamed, and then reached for the shovel, swinging it around. They jumped back and let go, and I stood up from the bed holding the shovel like it was a staff.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the FUCK are you doing?\u201d It was Heather. I dropped the shovel.\n\n\n\u201cHeather, oh God, Heather, I'm sorry.\u201d I said. \u201cHe was here...marbles was...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour stalker?\u201d Heather said. \u201cWhy would he be here, Anthony? And what the hell is that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don't know. I was at work and I saw a video by him with this address. I had no idea this is where you lived.\u201d I said. \u201cI found this in the closet.\u201d\n\n\nI picked up the shovel and handed it to her. Before she could even get a close look at it, there was a knock at the door. The police. I had completely forgotten I called them. \n\n\n\u201cOh shit, it's the cops. I called them on my way over here, I...\u201d Heather stopped me from talking.\n\n\n\u201cI'll handle this.\u201d She said.\n\n\nHeather answered the door and talked to the officers. She explained to them how she was actually my nurse and that I was having an episode, that she didn't want to press any charges. The police seemed to understand, said their goodbyes and left. I sat there completely dumbfounded. \n\n\n\u201cWhy lie? Why not tell them?\u201d I asked. \u201cThere could be fingerprints or something! We could test the blood on the shovel!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt's like I told you the other day, the cops are useless.\u201d She said. \u201cDid they even believe your story yesterday?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I don't think so. And it's because you stole the camera.\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cCamera?\u201d She said. \u201cI never took the camera. I left it in the box, Anthony.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat- that's impossible!\u201d I stuttered. \u201cIt was gone...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTake it from me...\u201d She grabbed me by the arms. \u201cI've been here. If you want this resolved, we're going to have to do most of the work.\u201d\n\n\n\nI reluctantly nodded. What other choice did I have? She was the only one who believed me, the only one who was willing to help me 100%. Heather was my only ally in this whole situation. I couldn't afford to be alone right now.\n\n\nI was willing to accept that maybe she didn't take the camera. She seemed sincere, but I didn't know what other explanation there could be. Had marbles been in my mother's house? I still shutter at the very idea.\n\n\nHeather and I sat on her bed and just talked for a long time. We talked about my issues with marbles and her old problem with her past stalker. Apparently her ex-boyfriend really couldn't let her go. He'd send her hundreds and hundreds of letters, come to her work, and follow her when she went around town.\n\n\nWhen the conversation slowed down, Heather noticed the paper with her address on her wall. She gave a slight smile, almost like she was amused by it. She plucked it off the wall, and held it to her face. Then, my mouth dropped. I started shaking again.\n\n\n\u201cHeather...\u201d I said, and very weakly pointed to the back on the paper. \n\n\nOn the other side of the paper, was a handwritten message. It was written in very dark pencil, with very thin and shaky letters.
