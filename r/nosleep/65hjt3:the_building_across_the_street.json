I was there for a few weeks. Just doing my job, y\u2019know. It\u2019s right off the highway, so there are other buildings around. And one right across the street. Like, this three-storey office park. It looked normal enough at first. After a few weeks, I started noticing something really wasn\u2019t right about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you first start a job--for me, anyway--you&amp;#39;re enthusiastic to excel and stuff. Cause you&amp;#39;re just happy to have a job. But after a few weeks, it\u2019s like I\u2019m no longer on probation and I get drawn into mischief. Like, I enjoyed digging around in the lost and found. I always wanted to find something juicy. Not just old toothpaste. Or get into the manager\u2019s personnel files. Or I\u2019d try to figure out which guests are prostitutes. I was the only employee in the building from 11pm to 7am. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing I\u2019d do was just look out the huge, plate glass window in the lobby, see what was going on out there. Suspicious individuals and cars or whatever. That\u2019s really when the building across the street started to interest me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t even think I knew why it was captivating me at first. I kinda just kept looking, night after night, and it struck me, cause I just casually thought, \u201cI wonder what businesses are there.\u201d And that\u2019s when I realized there didn\u2019t seem to be any businesses there. I don\u2019t mean, like, it\u2019s an abandoned warehouse or the office space is for lease. I mean, the fluorescent lights are always on, there\u2019s plenty of office furniture, I could make out plants, looked like it could be picture frames on the desks and a swivelling fan. So it\u2019s set up like it\u2019s used, but it\u2019s just not. Ever. There are no cars in the parking lot. No people moving around inside. No security guards or janitors. I\u2019ve covered my co-workers for midshift. Nothing ever happens there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it\u2019s stupid for this to bother me. But it really started to bother me. A lot. I mean, the utilities bills for a three-story office block have to be pretty high. It has to be insane when there\u2019s no business inside to justify that. And it\u2019s maintained, it looks clean. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s getting renovated. No-one\u2019s carting asbestos out. Isn\u2019t that just really weird? It\u2019s just this big, stupid stone mystery sitting right across from me. And I\u2019m not ashamed to say, it gave me bad vibes. Because it just made no sense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t talk to anyone else at the hotel about it for quite a while. Generally, I just did my job and went home. I didn\u2019t have much of a relationship with them. I\u2019ve been this loner for a while. When I\u2019d have things to talk about, I\u2019d want to come home and tell my girl. But she\u2019s been gone for a long time. Ten years now. Makes you think. Ten years feels like just a little bit ago now. One time ten years ago was like, ancient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one day I chat with the shuttle driver in the morning, just kinda ask him if he ever noticed the building. He says sure, it\u2019s right in front of the hotel. I ask him if he noticed anything odd about it. He was busy logging receipts and ignored me. So I press him, did he ever see anyone going in or out of there. Maybe he was just annoyed because I was bugging him, but he seemed to get defensive and said something like, \u201cSince you\u2019re forcing me to answer, no, I never saw no-one go in.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start telling him how I\u2019ve been watching it and that it\u2019s really weird. He says it\u2019s asbestos or something and I should stop worrying about it. \u201cAll mysteries just come down to money, sex, and human stupidity,\u201d he said. I know he had no idea what he was saying, but that was such a sucker punch. I\u2019ve chatted with him just a few times before and he\u2019s the only one there that I\u2019ve told about Shayla. He musta saw the look on my face, because he apologized. I just let it go. I figured I\u2019d keep it to myself from now on, like I should have in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So\u2026 Shayla was my girlfriend ten years ago. She\u2019s just an incredible person. Creative, always optimistic, liked to be involved in things, like helping the homeless and political protests. Not a jerk like me. I\u2019d rather watch Netflix and keep to myself. And, I figured, since I was lucky enough to have her, I better put a ring on that. On spring break, we\u2019re down in Cancun, being college kids, when I plan to propose. Knee and all, y\u2019know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s our last night there. We\u2019re tired of partying and head to our cheap room around 2 AM. 3 AM, I wake up to pee. Her side of the bed is empty. I think she must be peeing too. But it was just the water left running in the sink. She\u2019s not in the room. Not out on the balcony. Now I\u2019m really worried. Nothing\u2019s missing but her cheap camera. Like, wads of money left untouched. And her room key\u2019s there on the nightstand. I got the police involved as quickly as possible. But there was just nothing. Like nothing at all to go on. One hour she\u2019s there, the next gone with just the clothes on her back and a $20 camera. Ten years later, still not a trace of her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That might be why I get so obsessed with mysteries and trying to find stuff now. So that\u2019s that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here\u2019s another one. There\u2019s this girl I figured was a prostitute. She came to the hotel once before with these two black guys. They paid for the room with a credit card. Then they left her there.  Same thing happened again. She was pale, freckled, weirdly plump lips. They looked sore or something. Whatever. It\u2019s her life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night she comes in the lobby and just starts eating Lays potato chips. She kept wiping her fingers on her jean shorts. She looked very young. Like barely 18. If that. I\u2019m inputting reservations trying to ignore her. But she asks me why I have binoculars out. I had them out watching the building. But I just say to her, \u201cI\u2019ve seen you here before.\u201d She tells me I\u2019m wrong, that it must\u2019ve been her sister. It\u2019s pretty weird for her to just lie like that. I say something like, \u201cYou two look a lot alike,\u201d and she agrees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see she keeps looking at me and the binoculars, so I tell her. I say I watch that building because it\u2019s weird how nothing ever happens there. She says nothing happens in school either. Now I know she\u2019s under 18 and I plan to call it in when she goes back up. Just then, I tell her that\u2019s not what I mean. I tell her I mean literally nothing happens. And she tells me that\u2019s bullshit, because she saw someone in there from her room. I feel my heart skip a beat. I ask her where. She just says, \u201cSomewhere\u201d and takes off to the elevator. The two black guys walk through the front doors right into the elevator after that. Almost like she was afraid to be seen in the lobby when they arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of things could\u2019ve happened to Shayla. And you play that kind of thing out in your mind, y\u2019know, when someone you love disappears. But that may have been the worst, in a way. Thinking she was \u201ctrafficked.\u201d I mean, that girl could just be one of those guys\u2019s girlfriend. What do I know? It just made me think that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept looking at the building after that. I even went up into the staircase to get a better look from the stairs windows. I should\u2019ve been manning the front desk. But I dunno, something about the way she said it\u2014I kept looking. Scanning across the floors. You know when you\u2019ve seen something a hundred times, the slightest difference stands out, even if you can\u2019t really pinpoint it? It felt like that. Like I was overlooking something. And I was. It was like a little fraction of a shadow on a wall. But I knew it wasn\u2019t there before. Whatever was casting the shadow was hidden. So I went all the way up to the roof for a better look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time in the month or two since I started watching that building, I saw someone inside. Not a janitor or businessperson like you\u2019d think. Just a girl, dressed shabbily. She was beside a floor plant staring into the office space. It was kinda spooky. Because there was nothing there to stare it. It was office furniture and white walls. She wasn&amp;#39;t moving at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s the weirdest thing. The part the creeps me out now thinking of it. The more I watched this girl, the more I became convinced that girl was Shayla. I knew I was convinced when I suddenly muttered her name outloud. Almost like she heard me, her head turned slightly right after that. It was her. I felt sure. But that made no sense at all. She disappeared ten years ago. A thousand miles away. It\u2019s just\u2026 why? Why appear now? Why there? If it really was her, think about how crazy the coincidence would have to be that she was like squatting in this building that I just happened to be staring at. That\u2019s what creeped me out so much. When I tried to answer the question, \u2018Why?\u2019 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was going through this in my head when the doors to the third floor landing banged open. The sudden noise scared the crap out of me. My nerves were rattled enough. But now I felt instinctively like I was in danger. There was no reason to feel this way, but I was more scared than I\u2019d ever been in my life. I didn\u2019t even know who opened the doors. But I kept very still and listened. I recognized the voices of the two black guys. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were talking about me. Asking why I had binoculars and saying like, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t birdwatching, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d But they went down to the lobby. I didn\u2019t feel relieved yet. Because they\u2019d see I wasn\u2019t at the desk. Would they come looking for me? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked back at the building to see what the girl was doing. She was gone. It felt like losing her all over again. Made up my mind to go across the road and search the building. I took the fourth floor to the back stairs. Because I was still afraid to go to the lobby.  I slipped around the hotel from the back. I was right, too. They were there waiting for me. One of them was milling around front of the desk. The other lounged casually in one of the lobby chairs. I watched them for a bit, hoping they&amp;#39;d just leave. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be observed. But they weren&amp;#39;t going anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I just did it. Ran across the road to the building. It was weird to actually be there, at the front door. I looked back to the hotel. The guys were looking right at me. They looked either angry or puzzled. I couldn\u2019t tell. I kept expecting someone to stop me. But the front door opened. No alarm. No lock. I walked right in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was quiet inside. The fluorescent lights hummed gently. Warm air pushed through the ventsh. My own heart made the most noise. Or it felt like it. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe squatters hadn&amp;#39;t taken up in this building. Without security or locks, warm air, it should be hobo central.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked back again. The two black guys were still in the lobby. One of them had changed, somehow. His head looked strange. I squinted and saw he had my binoculars. Except I still had my binoculars with me. So he had to have his own binoculars. And he was watching me. That disturbed me far more than it should have. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept going into the building. I came to a door with glass panes. There\u2019s a well-lit stairwell behind. I start climbing to the third floor. Still no alarms. Nothing to stop me. No-one waited at the top of the stairs. I emerged into the third floor office space and found it as dead as the first. In the spot the girl had been standing, there was just the plant now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked cautiously to the spot beside the plant. I had this intense feeling that I shouldn\u2019t be there. There was a faint outline of footprints at the spot. Not shoeprints. Footprints. I may have been reading that into the patterns in the tile, but I don\u2019t think so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked up to where the girl had been staring. The walls weren&amp;#39;t bare, actually. There was a framed motivational poster. I never noticed it before. &amp;quot;Get Ahead!&amp;quot; was the slogan. The poster itself was a photograph of a beautiful, east coast beach with some people enjoying it. I was prepared to leave the spot and explore further. But something about the poster bothered me. I kept looking at it. It was your usual, lame motivational photo. I didn&amp;#39;t know why I was so intrigued. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I saw it. The people. They looked like children playing, adults sunbathing. Very innocent. Until I looked closer. The children were laughing and dismembering a human body. A short distance away from this, a woman was buried up to her neck in the sand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned away from the awful poster. Out the window I saw the black guys still in the lobby. One of them, at any rate. He was close to the window, looking forward. The girl, Shayla, had crossed the road and was entering the hotel. I pounded the glass to get her attention, but she was already inside. I put my binoculars up to watch. She was talking to the one of the guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hurried back down the stairs, taking two steps at a time, and through the cubicles of the first floor. As I crossed the road, the elevator framed the girl. I was sure, completely sure now it was Shayla. She was between the two black guys. The doors closed before I made it across the street.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got back to the hotel lobby, I went behind the front desk for the master keycard. Then I dashed up the stairwell to the third floor, again taking two steps at a time. I remembered the room I put them in, too, because I planned to call it in, right? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hesitated at the door. I&amp;#39;m not a courageous man. I didn\u2019t want to get knifed. But I opened it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room was abandoned. I checked the bathroom. The shower had been used, but was presently unoccupied. Same with the bed. The room didn&amp;#39;t smell of sex. There were no condoms in the trash can. When I saw the room empty, I went back to check the stairwell. I heard the lobby door slam. I shot down those stairs crazy fast. But when I got down, I couldn&amp;#39;t find any sign of the guys. I didn\u2019t hear or see any car squealing off. They were just gone. With both girls. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back to the room. I knew it was the right room. I checked later, to be sure. There was only one thing left behind in that room. I don&amp;#39;t know what it means. My gut tells me I don&amp;#39;t want to know. It was a jar, left under the covers of the unmade bed. The jar was filled with a fine, light sand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worked at that hotel another four years and I never saw those guys again. Never saw the girl. Never saw anything else strange in that building. The credit card turned out to be stolen. Their names likely made up. Even the mysterious building was leased to a call center only a few weeks later and it was a normal business. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has been bothering me for a long time now. I just really wanted to get it out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So, about 8 years ago I worked nights at a hotel. I was there for a few weeks.

It was weird to actually be there, at the front door. I looked back to the hotel. The guys were looking right at me. They looked either angry or puzzled. I couldn\u2019t tell. I kept expecting someone to stop me. But the front door opened. No alarm. No lock. I walked right in.\n\nIt was quiet inside. The fluorescent lights hummed gently. Warm air pushed through the ventsh. My own heart made the most noise. Or it felt like it. I couldn't believe squatters hadn't taken up in this building. Without security or locks, warm air, it should be hobo central.\n\nI looked back again. The two black guys were still in the lobby. One of them had changed, somehow. His head looked strange. I squinted and saw he had my binoculars. Except I still had my binoculars with me. So he had to have his own binoculars. And he was watching me. That disturbed me far more than it should have. \n\nI kept going into the building. I came to a door with glass panes. There\u2019s a well-lit stairwell behind. I start climbing to the third floor. Still no alarms. Nothing to stop me. No-one waited at the top of the stairs. I emerged into the third floor office space and found it as dead as the first. In the spot the girl had been standing, there was just the plant now. \n\nI walked cautiously to the spot beside the plant. I had this intense feeling that I shouldn\u2019t be there. There was a faint outline of footprints at the spot. Not shoeprints. Footprints. I may have been reading that into the patterns in the tile, but I don\u2019t think so. \n\nI looked up to where the girl had been staring. The walls weren't bare, actually. There was a framed motivational poster. I never noticed it before. \"Get Ahead!\" was the slogan. The poster itself was a photograph of a beautiful, east coast beach with some people enjoying it. I was prepared to leave the spot and explore further. But something about the poster bothered me. I kept looking at it. It was your usual, lame motivational photo. I didn't know why I was so intrigued. \n\nThen I saw it. The people. They looked like children playing, adults sunbathing. Very innocent. Until I looked closer. The children were laughing and dismembering a human body. A short distance away from this, a woman was buried up to her neck in the sand. \n\nI turned away from the awful poster. Out the window I saw the black guys still in the lobby. One of them, at any rate. He was close to the window, looking forward. The girl, Shayla, had crossed the road and was entering the hotel. I pounded the glass to get her attention, but she was already inside. I put my binoculars up to watch. She was talking to the one of the guys.\n\nI hurried back down the stairs, taking two steps at a time, and through the cubicles of the first floor. As I crossed the road, the elevator framed the girl. I was sure, completely sure now it was Shayla. She was between the two black guys. The doors closed before I made it across the street.\n\nWhen I got back to the hotel lobby, I went behind the front desk for the master keycard. Then I dashed up the stairwell to the third floor, again taking two steps at a time. I remembered the room I put them in, too, because I planned to call it in, right? \n\nI hesitated at the door. I'm not a courageous man. I didn\u2019t want to get knifed. But I opened it.\n\nThe room was abandoned. I checked the bathroom. The shower had been used, but was presently unoccupied. Same with the bed. The room didn't smell of sex. There were no condoms in the trash can. When I saw the room empty, I went back to check the stairwell. I heard the lobby door slam. I shot down those stairs crazy fast. But when I got down, I couldn't find any sign of the guys. I didn\u2019t hear or see any car squealing off. They were just gone. With both girls. \n\nI went back to the room. I knew it was the right room. I checked later, to be sure. There was only one thing left behind in that room. I don't know what it means. My gut tells me I don't want to know. It was a jar, left under the covers of the unmade bed. The jar was filled with a fine, light sand. \n\nI worked at that hotel another four years and I never saw those guys again. Never saw the girl. Never saw anything else strange in that building. The credit card turned out to be stolen. Their names likely made up. Even the mysterious building was leased to a call center only a few weeks later and it was a normal business. \n\nThis has been bothering me for a long time now. I just really wanted to get it out there.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "65hjt3", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 383, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nazisharks", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65hjt3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.nosleep", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "trophy", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/65hjt3/the_building_across_the_street/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492262789.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65hjt3/the_building_across_the_street/", "author_flair_text": "November 2016", "quarantine": false, "title": "The Building Across the Street", "created_utc": 1492233989.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 25, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 383}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hjt3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgahuuh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 41, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Joeenid1", "parent_id": "t3_65hjt3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's a beautifully written story.
