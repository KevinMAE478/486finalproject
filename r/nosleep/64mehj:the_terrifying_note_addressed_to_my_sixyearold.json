After five or six rings, her voicemail picked up. I hung up and texted her. &lt;em&gt;Need Jay\u2019s address. Check the bulletin!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hopped off the couch and grabbed my keys in a mad rush to get to my truck. I climbed inside and waited, hand tapping on the steering wheel. I started to text Ryan to see if he knew Jay\u2019s address, or could get it, when Carrie\u2019s text dropped down at the top of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;15 franklin dr &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I texted her back: &lt;em&gt;Thank you. Is Kyle okay?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nursery at church. Fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called Detective Carr as I whipped my truck out of the garage. When he picked up, I was almost shouting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: 15 Franklin Dr. That\u2019s his address.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carr: Okay, got it. I\u2019ve already radioed it in and I\u2019m heading that way. Dean, are you on the road? (I turned down the radio, which was blasting some shitty pop song I\u2019d heard a million times.) Look, you know this guy is extremely dangerous. (I heard his siren start its piercing wail). You and Carrie need to stay where you are and\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hung up and tossed my phone onto the passenger seat. I knew he was right, but there was no way I was sitting this one out. Carrie and I had gotten Andrew into this mess and I had a sinking feeling he\u2019d need at least one of us to get him out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called Carrie twice more on the way. &lt;em&gt;This is Carrie! Leave a message.&lt;/em&gt; The second time, I did. &lt;em&gt;Carrie, where are you? Are you okay? Please call me back.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Franklin Drive was only about ten minutes from our house, per my GPS, but I made it in about eight. The streets were always empty on Sunday mornings and I hit almost every green light. If Carr was anywhere near the police station, that meant he\u2019d be several minutes behind me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as I turned onto Franklin drive, I felt like I\u2019d been punched in the gut. Carrie\u2019s white SUV was parked in front of a small brick house about three quarters of the way down the street. I recognized it immediately by the purple sticker on the back window. It was from Kyle\u2019s school. In that moment, for some weird reason, the only thing I could think was: &lt;em&gt;at least I told her I loved her.&lt;/em&gt; And that\u2019s a brutal thing to have to think about someone you love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled in behind her and jumped out of the truck. I thought I could hear sirens blaring in the distance, but I couldn\u2019t wait. Carrie was inside somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made my way toward the front door, which was closed, but then I heard some shouting coming from the back of the house, and I saw the gate on the side of the house was wide open. I ran around the side and barreled into the backyard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay was standing in the center of the yard, but he didn\u2019t quite look how I expected. He was tall\u2014 over six feet\u2014and had a baseball cap pulled down low over his eyes. The beginning of a wispy beard was showing on his jaw and neck and the hint of a belly protruded through the bottom of his one-size-too-small t-shirt. He stood as if his legs could barely hold him up anymore, like a prize fighter after a losing bout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andrew stood next to him, atop a box which sat on a tall kitchen stool. Duct tape was wrapped around both his eyes and mouth. He was standing perfectly still, hands at his sides, as Jay screamed at Carrie to stay back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a noose around Andrew\u2019s neck, tied to the branch of a sycamore tree which hung many feet above his head. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrie was standing in front of me and to the left, still in her dress from church. It billowed in the breeze around her thin frame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Jay saw me, he narrowed his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay: I wondered when you\u2019d show up, Deano! Such a rude one, you are! Didn\u2019t your mother tell you that wasn\u2019t nice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrie glanced back at me, but kept her body turned toward the threat in front of her.  She mouthed &lt;em&gt;I\u2019m sorry&lt;/em&gt; before swinging her head back around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Just let him go, Jay! (I held my empty hands up). I\u2019m sorry for being rude. No one needs to get hurt.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay: No one needs to get hurt? It\u2019s too late for that, bucko. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrie: What do you want?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay: You, Carrie. It was always YOU!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrie: Why the note to the paper, then? Surely there was a better way to have me. Instead, you ruined me. And you outted yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay: Because you lied to me! And I didn\u2019t want you to lie anymore. If &lt;em&gt;I\u2019d&lt;/em&gt; come looking for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, you never would have had to tell Dean about our little affair. So, I pushed you. And then you had a choice! Tell Dean about your little secret, so he could put the pieces together, or keep it from him and let little Andrew die. Since you\u2019re here, I guess it means you came clean. And what a wonderful little moment &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; must have been! Now &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; will know, and &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; will want you, not even your husband! (He turned away from her). How&amp;#39;s that wonderful marriage now? Do you like my sloppy seconds?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay, you won, Jay. You won. What do you want to hurt Andrew for?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay: I don\u2019t want to hurt Andrew! (He rubbed a shaking hand through his hair.) All this time. I\u2019ve been good &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; this time! When you\u2019re good you\u2019re supposed to get a treat! (He looked back at Carrie). You TOLD me you didn\u2019t want to have kids. You said that! And then I heard them call Kyle\u2019s name at his tee ball game, and I saw you in the stands, and I just\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He swayed a bit, and when his hip bumped the stool it almost went toppling over. Andrew reached out his arms, balancing himself, and the stool righted. But not before something fell from the back of the box\u2014behind Andrew\u2019s feet\u2014onto the ground. Jay leaned down and picked it up. It was a large kitchen knife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: You just what, Jay? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I needed him to keep talking. I\u2019d heard the sirens for a moment, but they\u2019d stopped. The police were outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay: Carrie was supposed to be MINE. And so was Kyle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrie: How can we fix it, Jay? (She took a step forward).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Carrie\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrie: Jay, how can we fix it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay: We can trade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrie: Okay, fine. Trade what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay: Your life, Carrie. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took a step forward, but stopped when Jay pressed the knife against Andrew\u2019s side and shook his head. Then, he pointed the knife at Carrie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay: &lt;em&gt;Your&lt;/em&gt; life for Andrew\u2019s. That\u2019s the deal. That\u2019s what all of this has come to! If I can\u2019t have you, no one can. It\u2019s the only way. And if you refuse\u2026. (He brought the knife back and pressed it against Andrew\u2019s side, harder this time). You\u2019ll have to live with\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carr: Drop the knife! Now!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carr was standing in the gate, his service weapon drawn. Jay wobbled to his left and hid himself behind Andrew, putting his foot on the first rung of the stool like he was going to kick it over. Andrew was standing pretty high off the ground and I realized that if he fell, he\u2019d probably break his neck before he had time to suffocate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carr: Touch him and you die, Jay! Listen to me! Put the weapon &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt;!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were two other officers beside him now, both with their weapons drawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrie: No, wait!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay paused, ignoring everyone but Carrie. His foot was still on the rung.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrie: It\u2019s my fault, Jay. I know that. (She took another step). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Carrie, what are you doing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carr: Both of you, stay where you are!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay: (A hint of a smile had crept onto his face). Do we have a deal?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrie: I can\u2019t ever take it back. But I can make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me:  Carrie! It\u2019s not your fault! I know he drugged you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay: DO WE?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrie: I love you, Dean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Carrie!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jay: DO WE HAVE A DEAL?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Carrie said &lt;em&gt;deal&lt;/em&gt; and charged at Jay, the entire world seemed to screech to a halt. It felt like she was running in slow motion, her tight blonde ponytail floating behind her as if gravity had no dominion over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran then, too, but I was several steps behind her. And I was too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrie\u2014 barely 120 pounds\u2014who believed  she\u2019d made a terrible mistake and was now going to right it, and Jay Fisher\u2014the 200+ pound tee ball ref\u2014who had killed before and thought he owned the life of the one who\u2019d  gotten away, collided with a force that I swear was more than the sum of its parts. Ten years of shame and guilt and vengeance exploded underneath that sycamore tree, and as their bodies twisted and fell to the ground, a wayward arm knocked Andrew from his stool. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that moment, which is now frozen in my mind, I had a choice: grab Andrew before he fell, or dive onto the pile and save Carrie. I don\u2019t remember making a conscious decision. All I know is the next moment I was holding Andrew, the rope tightened around his neck just enough to make him cough, but not to cut off his airway, as I screamed for Carr to help Carrie. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I heard two shots, one right after the other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I looked down, I saw blood. So much blood. I wondered if Carr had missed and hit Carrie. But when Jay rolled onto his back, I could see both bullet holes. One in his chest and one in his stomach. So why was there blood on Carrie?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I freed Andrew, I knelt down beside Detective Carr. He was applying pressure to a wound in Carrie\u2019s abdomen, where a red stain was spreading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I heard her cry, it was the greatest sound I\u2019d ever heard. She was alive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, my entire world almost ended. Today, things seem a little brighter, but we still have a ways to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m sitting in Carrie\u2019s hospital room with my laptop, watching her sleep. The knife pierced her large intestine but missed all other major organs. So far, there are no signs of infection, and the doctors believe with rest and time, she\u2019ll make a full recovery. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve replayed that moment right before Andrew fell in my brain a hundred times. Maybe a thousand. My heart tells me if I\u2019d chosen Carrie, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have gotten stabbed. My brain tells me Andrew would have died if I had. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be able to reconcile that choice, but one thing\u2019s for certain: now I know how Carrie felt all those years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a tough to look deeply within yourself, admit your sins (or mistakes) and seek redemption for them. I think that&amp;#39;s exactly what Carrie did yesterday beneath that sycamore tree. She made up for the past. And I&amp;#39;m proud of her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andrew was returned to his father\u2019s care completely unharmed. From what I\u2019ve heard through Ryan, Andrew\u2019s dad doesn\u2019t believe any trauma\u2014sexual or otherwise\u2014occurred. This should mean that Andrew will be just fine, too. And that\u2019s going to make Carrie very happy when she wakes up. Once their tee ball season gets started again\u2014oh yes, the dads are already trying to get it going\u2014I need to remember to sit down with his dad and explain what Jay\u2019s note about Andrew meant. I hope he\u2019ll understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Detective Carr visited the hospital earlier this morning. Jay Fisher is dead, of course, and the prevailing sentiment in the community is shock and disbelief. Apparently, Jay hid is true nature pretty well. He did use to be trim and clean cut, but word was he\u2019d let himself go over the last couple years. Oh, and he never was an accountant. He\u2019d &lt;em&gt;applied&lt;/em&gt; to be an accountant, at the only tax firm here in town, but got rejected. He didn\u2019t turn out to be a mall Santa or Easter Bunny either\u2014so Carr got that part wrong\u2014but they did find wigs and face paint in his home at 15 Franklin. He definitely had a thing for being a clown. And they found some other strange stuff, too. Other poems, just like the ones written to us, except about other people. Some written on paper, some in the white space of magazine pages, and some even on the walls. Carr\u2019s checking into the ones that contain first names and other identifying information, but I doubt I\u2019ll be privy to what he finds out. If I do, I\u2019ll let you know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We talked about 3 Orange Circle, too. Turns out there WAS a body buried down there, in a shallow grave about two feet deep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only problem was, it wasn\u2019t Suzanne Kerrington.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carr chuckled after he broke the news and he saw my face, but I knew it wasn\u2019t mirth behind his smile. It was bewilderment. In a town like ours, you rarely come across monsters like this. For some reason, they gravitate to more highly populated areas, I guess so they can blend in with the crowd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him how they knew it wasn\u2019t her. Turns out, Susie had fractured her left arm pretty badly cheerleading in junior high. Her Dad\u2014who Carr said he\u2019d called, although he hated to, asking for any features he could use to identify her\u2014 thought it was her ulna. &lt;em&gt;I didn\u2019t need those records, though&lt;/em&gt;, Carr told me. &lt;em&gt;When someone gets a bad fracture, it leaves a mark when it heals. Like a scar on the bone. Whoever was buried down there in the basement had never broken either arm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him whether he thought Jay was the one who killed the woman (it WAS a women, Carr said, you could tell by the shape of the pelvis) and whether he thought he&amp;#39;d ever find out what happened to poor Susie, and Carr said &lt;em&gt;We&amp;#39;ll try to identify the bones, but we&amp;#39;ll probably never hear the whole truth, now that Jay&amp;#39;s dead. And maybe that\u2019s for the best.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who knows how many people Jay Fisher terrorized. Or how many he killed? There will be an investigation, and people will wonder, &lt;em&gt;how did we miss this monster? Living right under our noses&lt;/em&gt;. And maybe there will even be some answers, despite what Carr thinks, but I think most of them are buried in the dirt with Jay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all your help and advice. Carrie, Kyle, and I WILL have scars from this. Not on the bone, like Susie, but deeper. And after Carrie wakes up and gets back to her normal self, I\u2019ll think we\u2019ll all be able to go on, despite them. &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxxshephard\"&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Previous update \u2013 the manhunt begins]( https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64fd6y/the_terrifying_note_addressed_to_my_sixyearold/)\n\nCarr picked up on the third ring. \n\nMe: It\u2019s Jay!

Jay leaned down and picked it up. It was a large kitchen knife.\n\nMe: You just what, Jay? \n\nI needed him to keep talking. I\u2019d heard the sirens for a moment, but they\u2019d stopped. The police were outside.\n\nJay: Carrie was supposed to be MINE. And so was Kyle. \n\nCarrie: How can we fix it, Jay? (She took a step forward).\n\nMe: Carrie\u2026.\n\nCarrie: Jay, how can we fix it? \n\nJay: We can trade.\n\nCarrie: Okay, fine. Trade what?\n\nJay: Your life, Carrie. \n\nI took a step forward, but stopped when Jay pressed the knife against Andrew\u2019s side and shook his head. Then, he pointed the knife at Carrie.\n\nJay: *Your* life for Andrew\u2019s. That\u2019s the deal. That\u2019s what all of this has come to! If I can\u2019t have you, no one can. It\u2019s the only way. And if you refuse\u2026. (He brought the knife back and pressed it against Andrew\u2019s side, harder this time). You\u2019ll have to live with\u2026.\n\nCarr: Drop the knife! Now!\n\nCarr was standing in the gate, his service weapon drawn. Jay wobbled to his left and hid himself behind Andrew, putting his foot on the first rung of the stool like he was going to kick it over. Andrew was standing pretty high off the ground and I realized that if he fell, he\u2019d probably break his neck before he had time to suffocate. \n\nCarr: Touch him and you die, Jay! Listen to me! Put the weapon *down*!  \n\nThere were two other officers beside him now, both with their weapons drawn.\n\nCarrie: No, wait!  \n\nJay paused, ignoring everyone but Carrie. His foot was still on the rung.\n\nCarrie: It\u2019s my fault, Jay. I know that. (She took another step). \n\nMe: Carrie, what are you doing?\n\nCarr: Both of you, stay where you are!\n\nJay: (A hint of a smile had crept onto his face). Do we have a deal?  \n\nCarrie: I can\u2019t ever take it back. But I can make up for it.\n\nMe:  Carrie! It\u2019s not your fault! I know he drugged you!\n\nJay: DO WE?\n\nCarrie: I love you, Dean.\n\nMe: Carrie!\n\nJay: DO WE HAVE A DEAL?\n\nWhen Carrie said *deal* and charged at Jay, the entire world seemed to screech to a halt. It felt like she was running in slow motion, her tight blonde ponytail floating behind her as if gravity had no dominion over it.\n\nI ran then, too, but I was several steps behind her. And I was too late.\n\nCarrie\u2014 barely 120 pounds\u2014who believed  she\u2019d made a terrible mistake and was now going to right it, and Jay Fisher\u2014the 200+ pound tee ball ref\u2014who had killed before and thought he owned the life of the one who\u2019d  gotten away, collided with a force that I swear was more than the sum of its parts. Ten years of shame and guilt and vengeance exploded underneath that sycamore tree, and as their bodies twisted and fell to the ground, a wayward arm knocked Andrew from his stool. \n\nIn that moment, which is now frozen in my mind, I had a choice: grab Andrew before he fell, or dive onto the pile and save Carrie. I don\u2019t remember making a conscious decision. All I know is the next moment I was holding Andrew, the rope tightened around his neck just enough to make him cough, but not to cut off his airway, as I screamed for Carr to help Carrie. \n\nThen I heard two shots, one right after the other. \n\nWhen I looked down, I saw blood. So much blood. I wondered if Carr had missed and hit Carrie. But when Jay rolled onto his back, I could see both bullet holes. One in his chest and one in his stomach. So why was there blood on Carrie?\n\nOnce I freed Andrew, I knelt down beside Detective Carr. He was applying pressure to a wound in Carrie\u2019s abdomen, where a red stain was spreading.\n\nWhen I heard her cry, it was the greatest sound I\u2019d ever heard. She was alive. \n\n***\n\nYesterday, my entire world almost ended. Today, things seem a little brighter, but we still have a ways to go. \n\nI\u2019m sitting in Carrie\u2019s hospital room with my laptop, watching her sleep. The knife pierced her large intestine but missed all other major organs. So far, there are no signs of infection, and the doctors believe with rest and time, she\u2019ll make a full recovery. \n\nI\u2019ve replayed that moment right before Andrew fell in my brain a hundred times. Maybe a thousand. My heart tells me if I\u2019d chosen Carrie, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have gotten stabbed. My brain tells me Andrew would have died if I had. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be able to reconcile that choice, but one thing\u2019s for certain: now I know how Carrie felt all those years. \n\nIt's a tough to look deeply within yourself, admit your sins (or mistakes) and seek redemption for them. I think that's exactly what Carrie did yesterday beneath that sycamore tree. She made up for the past. And I'm proud of her.\n\nAndrew was returned to his father\u2019s care completely unharmed. From what I\u2019ve heard through Ryan, Andrew\u2019s dad doesn\u2019t believe any trauma\u2014sexual or otherwise\u2014occurred. This should mean that Andrew will be just fine, too. And that\u2019s going to make Carrie very happy when she wakes up. Once their tee ball season gets started again\u2014oh yes, the dads are already trying to get it going\u2014I need to remember to sit down with his dad and explain what Jay\u2019s note about Andrew meant. I hope he\u2019ll understand.\n\nDetective Carr visited the hospital earlier this morning. Jay Fisher is dead, of course, and the prevailing sentiment in the community is shock and disbelief. Apparently, Jay hid is true nature pretty well. He did use to be trim and clean cut, but word was he\u2019d let himself go over the last couple years. Oh, and he never was an accountant. He\u2019d *applied* to be an accountant, at the only tax firm here in town, but got rejected. He didn\u2019t turn out to be a mall Santa or Easter Bunny either\u2014so Carr got that part wrong\u2014but they did find wigs and face paint in his home at 15 Franklin. He definitely had a thing for being a clown. And they found some other strange stuff, too. Other poems, just like the ones written to us, except about other people. Some written on paper, some in the white space of magazine pages, and some even on the walls. Carr\u2019s checking into the ones that contain first names and other identifying information, but I doubt I\u2019ll be privy to what he finds out. If I do, I\u2019ll let you know. \n\nWe talked about 3 Orange Circle, too. Turns out there WAS a body buried down there, in a shallow grave about two feet deep.\n\nOnly problem was, it wasn\u2019t Suzanne Kerrington.\n\nCarr chuckled after he broke the news and he saw my face, but I knew it wasn\u2019t mirth behind his smile. It was bewilderment. In a town like ours, you rarely come across monsters like this. For some reason, they gravitate to more highly populated areas, I guess so they can blend in with the crowd. \n\nI asked him how they knew it wasn\u2019t her. Turns out, Susie had fractured her left arm pretty badly cheerleading in junior high. Her Dad\u2014who Carr said he\u2019d called, although he hated to, asking for any features he could use to identify her\u2014 thought it was her ulna. *I didn\u2019t need those records, though*, Carr told me. *When someone gets a bad fracture, it leaves a mark when it heals. Like a scar on the bone. Whoever was buried down there in the basement had never broken either arm.*\n\nI asked him whether he thought Jay was the one who killed the woman (it WAS a women, Carr said, you could tell by the shape of the pelvis) and whether he thought he'd ever find out what happened to poor Susie, and Carr said *We'll try to identify the bones, but we'll probably never hear the whole truth, now that Jay's dead. And maybe that\u2019s for the best.*\n\nWho knows how many people Jay Fisher terrorized. Or how many he killed? There will be an investigation, and people will wonder, *how did we miss this monster? Living right under our noses*. And maybe there will even be some answers, despite what Carr thinks, but I think most of them are buried in the dirt with Jay. \n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart for all your help and advice. Carrie, Kyle, and I WILL have scars from this. Not on the bone, like Susie, but deeper. And after Carrie wakes up and gets back to her normal self, I\u2019ll think we\u2019ll all be able to go on, despite them.

THIS IS WHAT YOU WILL DO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s how I feel about kids in general, really. I don&amp;#39;t even like many kids who aren&amp;#39;t mine, but I&amp;#39;m a grownup and I&amp;#39;ve had my chances and choices. They haven&amp;#39;t. I would divorce my husband immediately if he protected me before he protected my daughter. And I would also likely do so if he chose me instead of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; defenseless child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You did good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, aside from the leaving Carrie alone thing. That was dumb. But morally speaking you&amp;#39;re okay. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nosleep", "name": "t1_dg3pz85", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491906849.0, "created_utc": 1491878049.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 52}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64mehj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64mehj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64mehj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64mehj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3erv7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dmotr", "parent_id": "t1_dg3e08d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 1, "body": "lol", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nosleep", "name": "t1_dg3erv7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491892757.0, "created_utc": 1491863957.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3e08d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 26, "report_reasons": null, "author": "toogonetoofast", "parent_id": "t1_dg3b8t8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You think Carrie is still getting piped on the side?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You think Carrie is still getting piped on the side?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nosleep", "name": "t1_dg3e08d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491891788.0, "created_utc": 1491862988.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3b8t8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 43, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Creeping_dread", "parent_id": "t1_dg3aqfl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you for listening.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nosleep", "name": "t1_dg3b8t8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491888483.0, "created_utc": 1491859683.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3aqfl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 42, "report_reasons": null, "author": "trizephyr", "parent_id": "t3_64mehj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks so much for this story!
