Yeah, Florida is what people say it is. It&amp;#39;s big, it&amp;#39;s hot and it&amp;#39;s traffic sucks but Florida is my home. Florida gave me her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was all the good things about Florida bottled into one small, imperfectly perfect being. A tan, hot headed, stubborn, exotic girl who would never ceased to make me laugh. I met her by chance, it was her favorite story to hear. How I watched her walk into the room and I thought she was out of my league. She liked pointing out that she knew I stared at her ass at one point too. Could you blame a guy? We were introduced because we were the only two who had a common interest that no one else seemed to have in the room. We just clicked, we had this electricity that I never had with anyone else. By the end of the first week, she was telling me she loved me crazily enough and I smiled because - Hell! I loved her too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our relationship was easy, we found happiness in making the other happy. Yeah we had fights but who doesn&amp;#39;t, most of them were my fault and she was always quick to welcome me in her arms. She could never stay mad at me. We spent so much time together anyways, we never could stay upset with each other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry. I&amp;#39;m rambling. She loved this reddit, or subreddit. She was so upset for a moment when she fell for the Aprils fools prank. Whatever it&amp;#39;s called. I&amp;#39;m not a reddit user. I prefer Creepypasta. Yes. I know.

Sunshine and I go - went to the same school. I live on campus and she lives 20 minutes away. Sometimes she&amp;#39;d spend the night but she had stayed over the night before last, so she decided just to stay late even though I could kinda tell she wanted me to ask her to stay. I didn&amp;#39;t and I&amp;#39;ll always regret it. To get home, Sunshine had two ways; Her usual way (I mean she took this way 99.75 % of the time home) and this other route that would have her go down this long road with no traffic lights, just a straight shot called Okeechobee or US 27 . &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I didn&amp;#39;t mention about Sunshine was that she was a paranoid person. She would park farther from the place if it meant not parking around other cars. She&amp;#39;d tell me to rush in the car if someone was walking in our directions. One that I&amp;#39;ll always was remember was one time, I was visiting her and I told her I was going to take Okeechobee. Her face, that usually had a huge smile on it, contorted into one of worry. &amp;quot;Will you put your windows down?&amp;quot; She asked me and I agreed. Why did I? I didn&amp;#39;t like seeing her worried. &amp;quot;Just the canals. They scare me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The night I didn&amp;#39;t ask her to stay, I had taken her to the nearby fair. I promised to her to do the cliche thing that boyfriends did: Win her a prize and I did! I took so many photos of her holding a stuffed monkey almost her size. I was so proud that when I walked her to her car, I buckled in the monkey to her passenger side. I gave her a kiss and told her to text me when she would get home. Knowing her, she&amp;#39;d make it home faster then I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 minutes after she left, I felt my phone vibrate. &lt;em&gt;A lot of traffic&lt;/em&gt;, she texted me a picture of this long line of what seemed to be endless traffic. Really weird at 11 at night. &lt;em&gt;Just found out they closed the turnpike, I&amp;#39;m going to have to take Okeechobee. I just want to get home. I&amp;#39;m exhausted. FML.&lt;/em&gt; She had woken up at 6 that morning to make it to school for her first class, and today she couldn&amp;#39;t find it in her to take a nap during the day. I was starting to get worried. This rode was dark, and she&amp;#39;s told me before where she&amp;#39;s almost fallen asleep at the wheel because she underestimated how tired she was. Why didn&amp;#39;t I just ask her to stay. I didn&amp;#39;t hear from her for a while and then I got a few texts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I love you Babe.&lt;/em&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;I love you too.

I already miss you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never got text confirming she was home, but I was so tired, I fell asleep. In fact, I never got another text. Her roommates called me the next morning, asking for Sunshine, saying she never got home and thought she was just staying over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t take long to find her car. It&amp;#39;s bright metallic blue color stood out from the murky dark colors of Florida&amp;#39;s nature. She fell asleep they say, she swerved hard, into a canal. Her windows were up, I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it. Her lips were blue and she looked so peaceful. Her wild hair was slicked down and her eyes were closed and she looked like she was just sleeping. I held her roommate as they pulled her car out of the canal and I just stared at the same car that we first had sex in become the watery casket that held my girlfriend. The monkey still in the passenger side, mocking me with that smile of his, it&amp;#39;s arm seemingly resting on the ledge that held the window controls. Why didn&amp;#39;t I just ask her to stay?
