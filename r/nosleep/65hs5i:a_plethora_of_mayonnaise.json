My breakfast had consisted of two coffees and four tic tacs, and I was due back at the office ASAP. My boss had been bitching all day, as though running the sixth-biggest rental car branch outside of a midsized airport were the most important thing in the world. Seriously, I hate that guy. He\u2019s so fat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he kind of smells like mayonnaise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had been starving since I got up and had to choose between breakfast and a shower. I had chosen the latter, because I\u2019d hate to be \u2013 you know \u2013 that person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a grilled chicken sandwich at noon was going to hit the spot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I held the wheel with one hand and delicately brought the sandwich to my mouth with the other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t you love that smell?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took a huge, juicy bite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see the mayonnaise squirting out the sides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were thick globs of it, poking through the gaps, coating the lettuce, congealing in thick globs on the trembling greens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fuck it, I thought. I\u2019m already late as it is, there way too much mayonnaise to get all of it off, and I\u2019ve already pulled away from the drive-thru.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looks like mayo\u2019s on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I was starving. So I gulped down every bite. Funny thing is, it seemed that every time I went in for another chomp, more and more mayonnaise went squirting out the sides. So they put it on after a specific request not to have it, and then clearly went overboard with the quantity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assholes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously, it was like the sandwich was producing it. Even pressing slightly onto the soft bun with my fingertips caused ever more of the ooze to come dripping from all directions. It would drip onto my blouse. I would curse and scoop it up with my finger, sucking down every last drop. I was wearing black that day (of course), and did not want to be a sloppy mess on top of being hungry and late. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I finished the sandwich, there was still extra mayonnaise on my fingers and lips. I did not have time to get cleaned up, so I wiped my face with my hand and sucked up every last drop of it as I walked from my parked car back to the office. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t even have time to think of the smell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I raced back inside and bolted to my cubicle. The phone was flashing already; five people were on the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach felt like a rock crashing down as I sat in my chair. It was not a good feeling. I tried to shake it off as I raced through the phone calls, but it persisted. No, it got worse. Progressively worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in the middle of a lovely conversation with a pissed-off man who couldn\u2019t understand why he was being charged for a third day when only rented the car for three days. I was trying to decide if he was a bigger asshole or a bigger idiot, and simply could not decide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose a general feeling of awfulness pervades my line of work. I felt completely terrible, but it simply never dawned on me that it was mostly physical at that moment. I was in the middle of explaining why he was charged for the renter\u2019s protection that he had specifically requested when the rock in my stomach metamorphasized into vertigo. \u2018How could this guy be so stupid?\u2019 I remember thinking. \u2018And which way is up?\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marcy with the annoyingly high-pitched voice in the next cubicle over was looking down at me and asking what was wrong. I opened my mouth to explain that nothing was wrong, I just couldn\u2019t find the floor, when the first wave of mayonnaise vomit erupted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only remember bits and pieces of the ambulance ride, but in reality, I wish that I had forgotten the whole thing. I was dizzy and vomity. I vaguely remember that one of the EMTs looked passably hot in his little uniform before coating his arm in puke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stomach pumping is entirely gone from my memory, thank God for that. I would not want to have looked those doctors and nurses in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what about the people whose job it is to analyze the contents? What a fucking nightmare of a task. Who wants to dive into bile and stomach chunks with the goal of finding the nastiest shit possible?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless, they found it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the drive-thru workers got it right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no mayonnaise on the burger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chicken I had eaten was ill. It had developed a metastasized tumor in its breast, and it was very malignant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn\u2019t matter for the chicken in the end, though, because it was beheaded and chopped to bits before it could die of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Funny thing, though: the cancerous breast had been removed with the tumor entirely whole, and processed with the rest of the carcasses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right into my sandwich. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was why there seemed to be more and more mayonnaise with each squish. It was pure pus from a very nasty tumor. Each bite I took caused it to erupt more and more; it turns out that there was more pus than chicken. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cancer was a bad one, and that\u2019s what caused me to be so sick. I was in the hospital for a week, and had to tell the story no fewer than twelve times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I recovered. I went back to work. I still hate my job, but my desire to vomit is purely metaphorical. And there seems to be no lingering side effects. Other than the fact that I never, ever, put anything inside my mouth that even remotely reminds me of mayonnaise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry, boys.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I never liked mayonnaise.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just one thing.
