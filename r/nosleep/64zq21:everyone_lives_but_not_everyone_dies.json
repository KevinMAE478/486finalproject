You&amp;#39;re not going anywhere.&amp;quot; There is no point in arguing with old people about absolutely anything. Even when they&amp;#39;re wrong, they&amp;#39;ve grown accustomed to being wrong too long for the facts to keep up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh I&amp;#39;m going to die,&amp;quot; she said, laboriously sitting down next to me. &amp;quot;When you get to 84, you can&amp;#39;t even put a roast in the oven without wondering if you&amp;#39;ll be around to take it out. But not everybody dies. My grandfather is 143 years old.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not possible.&amp;quot; Was it? I&amp;#39;ve heard some people lived to be ancient, but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure no-one makes it to 143 without the Devil&amp;#39;s private medical insurance.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He was born in Belgium in 1874, but he lives nearby now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How do you know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He still sends me a birthday card every year. I have them up in the attic somewhere.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But how do you know he&amp;#39;s the one sending the cards?&amp;quot; I pressed. &amp;quot;When was the last time you visited him?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I never visit. I have nothing to say to him.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all she would say about the subject, but my curiosity wasn&amp;#39;t nearly satisfied. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found the birthday card in a shoebox along with 83 other cards. &lt;a href=\"http://thegraphicsfairy.com/wp-content/uploads/blogger/_CarNcodpCMA/SkV3UDrG5aI/AAAAAAAADvg/AEz-XyI1khY/s1600/1aswallowgfairy004.jpg\"&gt;It looked like this.&lt;/a&gt;. I think they were all hand-drawn and colored, but the older ones were warped and yellowed by time and water damage.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within each card was inscribed an address alongside this verse:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One less year for you to wait,&lt;/em&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;before your sweet release.&lt;/em&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Won&amp;#39;t you shed your mortal fate,&lt;/em&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;and live with me in peace?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds to me like he was offering grandmother an escape from death. I can&amp;#39;t imagine that he really had a cure, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t turn down that offer if it was handed to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Visiting old people is a chore. Visiting &lt;em&gt;ancient&lt;/em&gt; people is an adventure. I plugged the most recent address into google maps, and it led me to a Victorian era estate house on the edge of town. It looked like nobody has lived here for years. Even if the old guy was a myth, it would be fun to just poke around and have a look. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I climbed up the rotting porch and knocked on the door, leaving an imprint in the dust the shape of my fist. I hope he doesn&amp;#39;t break a hip on his way to let me in. He probably has some live-in medical staff if he&amp;#39;s lasted this long though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the door swung open, a tall thin man with rigid posture and a pristine suit stood before me. He was wearing an old fashion plague mask and black leather gloves, so I couldn&amp;#39;t see his skin. By the way he was standing though, I figured he couldn&amp;#39;t be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Um, hi. Does Mr. Jacobs still live here?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t move. One arm was held behind his back at a perfect right angle. A corpse couldn&amp;#39;t have held more stolid composure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He sent my grandmother this card. And like, 80 other cards - one every year.&amp;quot; I produced the birthday card, and the man snatched it like a striking snake. The card disappeared into his pocket without a glance. He turned wordlessly and entered the house, leaving the door open behind him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sit.&amp;quot; The figure gestured at an elaborately embroidered arm chair which the Queen of England wouldn&amp;#39;t have looked out of place in. The whole house was absolutely magnificent - while the outside was dilapidated enough to be seen on a &amp;quot;we buy ugly houses&amp;quot; poster, the interior was immaculately preserved. Dark mahogany wood panels, crystal chandelier, intricate golden light fixtures, and shelves and alcoves stuffed to bursting with all manner of exotic dolls, carvings, and trinkets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why did Elis send you?&amp;quot; he asked. The voice had a peculiar hollow ring as it reverberated inside the mask. The words were slightly clipped, but his English was flawless. He continued to tower over me as stiff as a flag pole. My hands ran self-consciously over one another in my lap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was tempted to admit I came on my own, but the cards seemed specifically for my grandmother and I didn&amp;#39;t want to be turned away. Idle curiosity doesn&amp;#39;t open nearly as many doors as blatant lies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My grandmother - Elis - she wanted me to meet Mr. Jacobs for her.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am Mr. Jacobs.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then, um, she wanted to let me decide whether to accept your offer.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t know what it meant, but it was just vague enough to work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He bent over me, the long nose of the mask practically scratching my skin. The slow intake of breath - was he sniffing me? I fought the urge to be sick when a wave of the thick incense within the mask washed over my face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently satisfied, the man moved to sit across from me on the other side of the marble coffee-table. He poured a glass of red wine from a silver decanter for me before pouring another for himself. His long body leaned back, crossing his lithe legs with the dexterity of a dancer. Polished leather shoes flashing softly in the dull light. There is no way this guy is a 143 years old. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Drink,&amp;quot; he said, the thick perfume billowing out of the mask. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not old enough to -&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How old are you, boy?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;19. How old are you?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you old enough to fear death?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then you are old enough to drink.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was getting really uncomfortable at this point. My hands wouldn&amp;#39;t sit still. Maybe I was in over my head. I was just curious, that&amp;#39;s all. I didn&amp;#39;t really believe he was 143 years old. If he really &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have a cure for death, why wouldn&amp;#39;t my Grandmother accept it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think there&amp;#39;s been a mistake. I think I should be going now.&amp;quot; I started to stand, but he was faster. He stepped directly over the coffee table and blocked me from getting out of the over-stuffed chair.  The perfume was intoxicating. I couldn&amp;#39;t think straight. Whatever I tried to focus on just blurred out in my mind. All I could see was the piercing red wine taunting me from the table. The only sounds were my beating heart and his melodic voice echoing from the mask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is this a game to you, boy? Are you trying to play me?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No sir, I -&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you seek to fool me? To rob me? To take my secrets and sell them for your own gain?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I swear I only came because -&amp;quot; My head was spinning. The crystal chandelier flashed as bright as a lighthouse. The scent was overwhelming. It was all I could do just to avoid throwing up. Even if he wasn&amp;#39;t blocking me in, I don&amp;#39;t know if I could stand to leave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because what? Why are you here? Why have you disturbed my home?&amp;quot; He was shouting now - at least I think he was. My senses were so saturated with noise and light and smell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shut my eyes tight. I pressed my hands over my ears so tightly I could feel them pop somewhere deep within my head. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to die!&amp;quot; I shouted. I could have said anything else, but that&amp;#39;s the only thought my mind could hold onto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then drink.&amp;quot; My eyes were still closed, but I could feel the glass of wine being shoved into my face - spilling over my chest. I grabbed it with both hands and gulped it down like I had been lost in the desert for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jacob&amp;#39;s presence immediately lifted. He must have moved away to the other side of the coffee table again. That all-consuming perfume began to clear from the air, but I kept drinking. I didn&amp;#39;t want to die. I don&amp;#39;t care what happened to me in that moment. I never wanted to die. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crunch&lt;/em&gt;. Something hard slipped into my mouth from the bottom of the wineglass. I opened my eyes. The bottom of the glass was crawling with beetles. I tried to cough, but the one already in my mouth slipped down my throat. I could feel its legs struggling against my esophagus all the way down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do not worry, child.&amp;quot; Mr. Jacob&amp;#39;s voice was soft as a purring cat. &amp;quot;You never will. Now go home, and do not return without your Grandmother.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up and ran. Once outside, I fell to my hands and knees and &lt;em&gt;heaved&lt;/em&gt; on the ground. I forced my fingers down my throat, but I didn&amp;#39;t need much help to induce the vomiting. The red wine poured out in waves, splattering all over my hands and knees. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still gasping for breath, I ran my hands through my own vomit - searching. It was all liquid. I squeezed the wet dirt between my fingers. The beetle hadn&amp;#39;t come out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took off my shirt and pants (which were soaked in vomit) and put them in the back of my car. I drove home, trying my best to pretend nothing happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was hard not to think about it when I could feel the beetle crawling around &lt;a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade\"&gt;inside me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/657e6l\"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "*Everybody dies*.
