She\u2019s canceled the last two days, either not showing up or canceling. She&amp;#39;s trying to hide something, I can feel it. Anyways, It\u2019s been just two days since my last post and honestly pretty much everything has changed. It&amp;#39;s currently about 12 pm here and I thought I should give you guys a little update since my last post was written on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monday was fine- Cadie left around 1 pm for her business trip in the city, a big presentation she\u2019d been working on for a month or two. The night was easy, there was no situations at hand. Everything was normal, a pretty rushed night and the kids both went to bed early. Rainy night, exhausted, dark out.. just an early night for everyone. Case worker didn\u2019t show up to our meeting, called and said we would meet tomorrow at noon instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuesday I took the kids to school, then rove to the meeting place to meet the case worker and just as I got there and waited for 25 minutes she texted- yes texted, didnt CALL- to say that she couldn&amp;#39;t make it. Didn\u2019t reply to my text about when we could meet again and ignored my call. Cadie got back around 2 pm, and I told her I wanted to take Abel camping for the night at the park up the road. I was bored all day and already in the city for the meeting so I picked up some bait, a new fishing rod and a life Jacket for Abie, having off today and Wednesday it was really the only time I could for the next week and I didnt want to wait. She picked Ellie up from school and I got Abe around 3 and we went on our father son surprise trip. You should of seen his face, god that smile could melt the meanest of souls. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This brings us to today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of you made some good recommendations for how to handle this situation. Usually I feel like I know what to do, but its hard right now.Cadie and I are from a Perth and we currently live in outside of Sydney due to Cadie\u2019s job, so yeah not exactly close. The opposite side of the country to be exact if you aren&amp;#39;t familiar with Australia. Someone recommend sending Able to his grandparents and at first I thought that was impossible. To far, he would miss the last few weeks of school, and generally thought that wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. But now I\u2019m looking at flights for both him and Cadie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone else pitched the idea of taking Abel on a father son trip and I really liked that, so we did it. To the person who commented that- thank you. You might have saved my family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The father son trip was honestly perfect. Abel was the same kid as always, like nothing had happened at all. I got a lot of PMs saying to ask Abie how he felt about Ellie, but not to push him to much in fear of scaring him or alarming him too much. So I did. And his response scared the hell out of me and I didn\u2019t sleep at all last night because of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d asked him small questions on and off, but if you know 5 year olds you know their attention span. Our conversations pretty much go like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Abie, how do you feel about having a new sissy round now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abel: Good! Hey look dad a dragon fly! I think I have a fish on the line!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, he talks a lot about a lot of random things. He\u2019s 5, its adorable and usually I would be beaming with pride and love for him. I didn\u2019t let it go and that night while we were cooking marshmallows he crawled in my lap, still acting happy as ever. I took this as a chance to talk to him more about Ellie&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Buddy, so do you and Ellie get along alright? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abel: Oh yeah she likes to draw too daddy\u2026 but..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: But what bud? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abel: Daddy why do her eyes change colors when she comes into my room? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This made my fucking heart stop. What the hell was he talking about? Why was Ellie EVER in his room to begin with- let alone her eyes changing colors?? Ellie\u2019s room is upstairs, and Abel&amp;#39;s bedroom is downstairs and we have different bedtimes for each kid. There is no bedtime interaction for them at all. Abel goes to bed usually around 7, and Ellie goes to bed around 8:15. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Abel what are you talking about? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abel: Ellie comes into my room at night sometimes. She tells me to (he made the shh motion with his finger) and she goes into my closet and shuts the door&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: And her eyes change colors?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abel: Bright like this! (He starts laughing and bites into a hershey bar, pointing at the white flames of the fire in front of us, completely oblivious to the fact that I\u2019m freaking out)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no clue what to say. Abel acted so nonchalant about it, clearing it didnt bother him but it bothers the hell out of me. I tried calling Cadie but she didn\u2019t answer her phone. I called 3 times and nothing. She told me this morning that it was because the service in our house kept dropping all night basically fucking her phone up. Even her computer wasn\u2019t connection to the wifi. When I got back this morning, after we took the kids to school, we went and got coffee. I sat down and told her what Abel said and the look on her face made me cold to the bone. She started crying. Now my wife is the strongest person I know, she barely ever cries. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadie: Jack I thought it was just a bad dream, that I was dreaming&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Cadie what are you talking about&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadie: Last night I woke up around 4 am because I heard our door open. I sat up and saw Ellie standing in the hallway. Jack her eyes were solid white, like they were rolled back in her head except they were not. Just completely white, a blinding white. She put her finger to her lips and made a shh noise before running down the hall and into Abel\u2019s room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: And you\u2019re just now telling me this! Cadie what the hell did you follow her? Did you see what the hell she was doing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadie: I did Jack I did! I ran after her and when I got into Abel\u2019s room it was empty! I went upstairs and she was asleep in her bed, dead asleep so I went back to bed. I swear I thought it was a dream!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have absolutely no idea what to do with this. I\u2019m about to go get in my car and drive to meet the case worker I hope, if she doesn\u2019t cancel again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadie is asking off of work today and if it gets granted she&amp;#39;s going to spend a week with her parents and taking Abel with her. We can\u2019t take Ellie there and we can\u2019t just leave her. I need to figure out whats going on with her before it gets worse.
