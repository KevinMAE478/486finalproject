When I see a black cat crossing my path, I just figure he has someplace to be. Sure I&amp;#39;ve read scary stories for their thriller aspects, and I&amp;#39;ll watch horror movies with friends just so I can laugh at them for being scared, but I never personally bought into that kind of stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shh. You&amp;#39;ll wake the poor baby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After playing the tape for what felt like the hundredth time, I was ready to expand my boundaries of reality just to find some explanation. Even deciding that it was a ghost or some nonsensical shit was better than having no explanation at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Calling my friends or family though? I would be ruining decades of my carefully maintained image of &amp;#39;the chill guy who doesn&amp;#39;t let anything bother him&amp;#39;. I was resolved to give it one more night with the video recorder to see if I couldn&amp;#39;t catch the trickster before asking for help and embarrassing myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tossed and turned for hours last night. I got up about a dozen times to check my laptop to make sure the video was still recording. Just to be safe, I saved the video stream to a password protected google drive folder so it was stored on the cloud. Even if someone tampered with my computer in the night, I should still be able to see what was going on.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched the slow minutes drain through my digital clock as though they resented their obligation to pass the time. I don&amp;#39;t even remember falling asleep, but one moment I read the time as 2 AM, and the next moment it was 3:30. I must have slipped out for at least a little while. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The red recording light was off. I immediately jumped up and checked my laptop, but the video file was gone from my computer. The backup stream on the google drive was still there though, so  I scrubbed through the video.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me on my back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me on my side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh look. There&amp;#39;s me upside-down with my feet on the pillow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then a face was peering into the screen. A little girl - couldn&amp;#39;t have been more than 14 - was in front of the camera. It was difficult to tell much about her though, because her skin was charred black and flaked off all the way to her heat-splintered skull. Her hair and nose were completely burned away, and all that was left of her eyes and mouth were sticky pits of darkness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I skipped back to the moment she appeared and played the video. She rose up from below the camera angle as though she was lying on the floor. She turned her head towards my sleeping body, then to the computer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;#39;s he looking for?&lt;/em&gt; she asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He&amp;#39;s looking for us,&lt;/em&gt; the other voice said from somewhere behind the camera. &lt;em&gt;Shut it off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can&amp;#39;t we just tell him what&amp;#39;s happening? He deserves to know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jessica we agreed about this. It&amp;#39;s either you or him. Get rid of it. Now!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where the video stopped. The time-stamp read 3:21 AM. They were here just a few minutes before I woke up. I checked my window. Locked. The door? Locked from the inside. I even opened the closet and every cupboard in the small apartment kitchen. There wasn&amp;#39;t any sign. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In about five minutes, I had returned to my computer to watch the video again for clues. I&amp;#39;d left the google drive folder open though, and the backup video file was now gone too. They were still in my room somewhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless I was just going crazy and had woken from a nightmare, but I don&amp;#39;t think so. Even with the video gone, my floor was still littered with the black crumbled flakes of burned skin.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s either you or him.&lt;/em&gt; I didn&amp;#39;t like the sound of that. I couldn&amp;#39;t stay in the apartment knowing they were here, but where could I go at 4 in the morning? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called the number for the sleep lab my doctor gave me. There was a staff still on duty, but they said they were all booked up through next week. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my jacket and keys and headed out the door. As long as I stayed still, I was in too much danger of falling asleep again. I didn&amp;#39;t have any real plan, but I figured I would just walk around until the sun rose. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was more exhausted than ever after that restless night. I still couldn&amp;#39;t quite accept this was happening to me. Maybe I was just so tired that my mind had started playing tricks on me. It was hard to be afraid while walking around the familiar park near my home. Vivacious bursts of spring decorated the ground, and I gulped down deep breaths of the fresh air. I could just call in sick today, get a good long sleep, and maybe all of this would just go away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey buddy.&amp;quot; I nearly jumped out of my skin. It was just some homeless guy sleeping on a park bench. I pulled my jacket up and started walking faster. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey don&amp;#39;t be like that. Got any change?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry. Nothing to spare.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah right, bastard,&amp;quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unpleasant, but it&amp;#39;s a common enough encounter in the city. It was what he said next that made my blood run cold. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I hope the Lady burns you next. Like she did to that girl.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slowly turned to face him. But he was just a crazy hobo who would rant about anything. This couldn&amp;#39;t have anything to do with ... but the image of that burned skin was not so easily banished from my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What girl?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He grinned to have my attention. I could clearly count all five of his yellow teeth peeking through his tangled mass of facial hair. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jessica. I could hear the Lady screamin&amp;#39; her name the whole time the girl was burning alive. I hope she &lt;a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade\"&gt;gets you too&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/65snbk\"&gt;Final part&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Part one](https://redd.it/65ghjo) will tell you about the weird voices I caught on the audio recorder. \n\n---\n\n*Let him sleep.
