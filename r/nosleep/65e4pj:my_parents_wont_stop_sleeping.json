You\u2019re probably thinking they\u2019re fatigued from a 30 hour drive, trust me, I thought so too but something really awful happened today and I\u2019m in my basement writing this out on my tablet and really need advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The day they came back they both happened to take a nap at the same time on the same bed, facing each other. I was a room down on my computer when I just heard my mom casually start speaking to someone. I thought she was asleep so I called out for her but to no avail. I got up and made it halfway to her room when I suddenly heard my dad interrupt my mom and start speaking, almost yelling. I didn\u2019t understand what they were saying, it was some Sims-like mumbo jumbo, but it sounded like their sleep talk was part of a single conversation. I walked into the room and I almost screamed because they were both standing up on the floor at the foot of their bed staring at me in the doorframe. It took me a second but I realized they were still asleep \u2013 their eyes were closed and they were swaying from side to side ever so slightly. I must\u2019ve stood there for at least five minutes unsure of whether to try and wake them or leave so I decided on the latter. I carried on my day and when I went back into their room they were still asleep, an inch away from each other, and laying like they were in coffins: on their back and arms folded. I have never known them to sleep so much or even spend this time much together, even in their sleep, in my entire life. It made it all the weirder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, when I came home from school, my mom had migrated to the kitchen table and fallen asleep while eating with my dad\u2013 except my dad wasn\u2019t there, only his place setting and plate were. I noticed the door to the backyard was gaping open so I went to close it just to see my dad standing facing some shrubbery with a watering hose. I kept the door open and went to go wake up my mom but when I got close to her I stumbled backwards and almost tripped over my goddamn backpack \u2013 she had this weird looking goo over her eyes and her mouth was slightly open. Her hand was gripping onto the fork tightly and she suddenly started banging it on the kitchen table, each slam getting louder and more aggressive but by the time I covered my ears it stopped abruptly. It was quiet in the room and I thought it was a good idea to try and wake her but when my hand got close her body jerked away from me and that was that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I booked it out the back door and ran to my dad, I needed him to take me to a friends house because this was freaking me out way too much. When I grabbed my dads arm to turn him around he yelled out like I had just stabbed him and he grabbed his arm where my hand had been and he dropped the hose \u2013 he turned around and then I saw it. His eyes were covered in the goo too and I froze. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I quickly ran into the house, into the basement, locked the door, and went into this private storage room and shut the door. I started crying against the door in the dark, not sure of what to do with the situation. I really panicked for a second, trying to figure out how to survive down here for a few days, if I could leave for a friend\u2019s house somehow, or escape through a window. I wiped my eyes of the tears and turned the lights on \u2013 when I turned around I was made aware of their unpacked luggage.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I opened the luggage my nose was immediately stunned by a wretched stench that drowned my senses. I covered my nose with my collar and tried to find the source when I heard banging on the basement door. I opened the door to the room I was in and made sure they couldn\u2019t open the door, whoever it was upstairs at the door. I went back to the suitcase and dug through the clothes, unable to stop the stench from bleeding through my collar, and that\u2019s when I found it. It was a bag with two sets of eyeballs. Two sets of eye balls that happened to be the same respective colors as my parents. That\u2019s when I began hyperventilating. I couldn\u2019t cry, I couldn\u2019t scream, all I could do is have a borderline asthma attack and stare at this bag of what seemed to be my parents eyes. I put the bag back in the luggage and left the room to puke in a corner of the basement. It dawned on me that I was completely alone to fend for myself \u2013 I didn\u2019t even know if those things were still my parents. I had to go upstairs to get a phone or anything to communicate to anyone but I knew they were going to be right by the door, they had to be. I crawled up the stairs to the door and peaked underneath to look for feet. No sign of feet. I slowly turned the lock and then the handle and creaked open the door slightly and I stopped because I was so god damn terrified at this point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gathered my guts and crept out the door looking left and right to make sure they weren\u2019t around. I managed to get to the kitchen counter but the place was so god damn quiet you could hear a pin drop. I have an island in the middle of my kitchen so I grabbed the tablet that was on top of it and hid between it and the counter for a few minutes to check that it was charged and connected to the internet when WHAM the door  to the backyard rocketed open, splitting the wood some, and water started flooding the floor. I screamed and sprinted back to the basement but managed to catch a glimpse of my dad with the hose standing in the doorway. I\u2019ve been in the basement now with the tablet for a few hours, I accidentally dropped it when I nearly fell on the way down and the screen went dead for a while. There\u2019s water coming from underneath the basement door and it&amp;#39;s almost completely covered the floor at this point and I can hear them walking around upstairs. This thing doesn\u2019t have messaging on it and I\u2019m afraid the screen is gonna die again.
