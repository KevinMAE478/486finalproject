I\u2019m scared. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, I packed up my suitcase like I always do. A few pairs of shorts and t-shirts, nothing too complicated. Two bathing suits, some flip flops, and those mini toiletries you can buy from the travel aisle in Target. My running shoes and some sports bras were included, too. (I love to workout, even when I\u2019m on a vacation. It\u2019s a blessing and a curse.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slung my backpack on, packed with my iPad and a few snacks, and headed out the door. My boyfriend volunteered to chauffeur me to the airport, if not a little begrudgingly. He was a bit jealous that I was going to have a girls\u2019 weekend with my best friend. Not the fact that I was going to spend a few days with her, but that we were spending those few days in Maui. I couldn\u2019t really blame him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He dropped me off at the airport, and helped me unload my suitcase. He gave me a long kiss before sending me on my way, much to the annoyance of the traffic director that was ushering everyone along. It was a slow day, though, so there wasn\u2019t too much guilt in the kiss. We\u2019re young, we\u2019re in love; Let us have our moment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After checking in at one of the self serve kiosks and tagging my bag, I went up to have it weighed and accepted. I was shocked when the bag came up ten pounds overweight. Did someone slip a brick into it as a joke when I wasn\u2019t looking? I rolled the bag away to the designated repacking area and began to shuffle through the clothing articles in the bag. We were going to Hawaii, for Christ\u2019s sake. There was nothing in that bag that constituted it weighing sixty pounds. I stood dumbfounded in the middle of the repacking station, just staring at my bag. I could hoist it over my head, toss it, dead lift it. So what the hell was the matter?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I re-zipped the bag and made my way to a different weighing station. This time, the bag read as 30 pounds. I noticed the lane I was previously in had closed and brushed it off as an error in the equipment. The attendant where I was now paused, her brows furrowed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUm, your flight has been rescheduled due to inclement weather, Ms. \u2014-.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cInclement.... I just checked my flight information and the weather. Are you sure?\u201d I was wary of the previous mistake with my bag\u2019s weight, and felt sure something similar was happening now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. The earliest flight I can reschedule you for is departing tomorrow at the same time.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a bit flustered now. I hummed to myself in thought. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCan you give me a few minutes? I need to call someone.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped to the side to allow another customer to be helped while I dialed my boyfriend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He answered on the third ring. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up? Did you forget something?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo\u2026\u201d I knew I sounded frustrated and could imagine my boyfriend taking on a worried expression. \u201cThey\u2019re telling me that my flight is cancelled because of the weather.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat? That\u2019s crazy. Hold on, let me pull into a parking lot.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He paused for a few minutes before speaking up again. \u201cHere, let me check the flight details before heading back your way.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another pause. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing on the website or on any weather app about inclement weather for your flight.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLet me ask the customer service assistant one more time, okay?\u201d I considered putting the phone on mute, but decided against it so that my boyfriend could hear the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The flight attendant offered me the same information again, and called her supervisor over to verify. The supervisor even made a call to triple check. I nodded and thanked them for rescheduling my flight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I picked the phone back up, I could hear the confusion in my boyfriend\u2019s voice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s so weird. I\u2019m on my way back. Hang tight, I\u2019ll text you when I\u2019m there, okay?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThanks, babe. I really appreciate it. This is so annoying...\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend picked me up and we drove home chatting about the cancellation and my bag\u2019s weight. We joked and then sang along to music. I gave my friend a call to tell her about my flight; She didn\u2019t pick up. I figured she was probably already on her plane, and would get the call when she landed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later is when things got weird. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took a nap (I got up early to pack). When I woke up, I had a few missed calls from my friend and a note from my boyfriend that he left to get Chinese take out. I listened to the voicemails from my friend and realized she had obviously not gotten my call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2014\u2014-. Jesus Christ, please, please answer. I saw the news\u2026. Please tell me that wasn\u2019t your flight. Please.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second voicemail was similar \u201cPlease, \u2014- just\u2026. Answer\u2026. They aren\u2019t releasing details. Please be landing any minute. Please\u2026. just\u2026.\u201d The line crackled with her sobs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third voicemail was eerie. It was silent for minutes until the very end. The voice was deep and electronic sounding: \u201cYou owe us.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A shiver ran up my spine and my blood froze in my veins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned the TV on and there it was. The flight I was supposed to be on went missing over the ocean. Gone. Vanished. My heart raced as I thought of the recent downed planes that were never recovered. Could this really be happening?
