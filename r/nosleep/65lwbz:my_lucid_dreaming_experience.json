[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "nosleep", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found nosleep about a week ago, and since this is place is full of people who have experience with the paranormal and \u201cunusual\u201d, I thought I would post about my unusual experience. But anyways, here\u2019s my story:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since the 6th of November, 2015, I haven&amp;#39;t slept a full night. That\u2019s because on the night between the 5th and 6th, my older brother, who i\u2019m going to call B, died. He was older than me by 4 years, and died from a medicine-related overdose. He had a long history of drug abuse and mental illness, and he was constantly plagued in his teens by anxiety, depression and eating disorders. So he started to self-medicate. Cannabis and various online-drugs were his choice. The drugs and psychedelics, combined with a later abuse of alcohol, took a toll on his brain. He started to have visions, hallucinations. Things were disappearing and changing colours. He saw shadowy people in the corner of his eye, but when he turned to face them, they were gone. And he saw the walls \u201cBreathing\u201d and \u201cPulsating\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To counter these horrible feelings and visions, he took more drugs. And got even worse. He started abusing and misusing the medicine that was prescribed to him, and it was most likely an overdose on his anti-depressants he died from. It showed traces of those specific chemicals in his blood after the autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The crime scene investigators also found out how he died. He had fainted after standing up from his computer, fallen on his face, and as a result of the drugs, puked. But because of his position, the puke didn\u2019t leave his mouth. He tried to breathe, but he couldn\u2019t move. So he suffocated to death while unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a relief to me when I heard that he didn\u2019t suffer. And he experienced no pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned all this from his doctors and psychiatrists that he regularly spoke to. I have even read every summarization from every therapist he ever spoke to about his addiction. All of his medical records were available to me and my family after B died. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the word about his death at 16:35 on the 6th of november through a phone call from my dad. The full month of november is a blur in my memory. Twisted faces and voices. Choices and options of where and how he should be buried. I heard the same line over and over from different people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThats horrible, I hope you understand that i\u2019m here if you need to talk to someone, about anything.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over and over again. It was insanity. All my relatives said it. All my friends and my classmates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all was lies, whenever I tried to communicate that I felt like shit, they dismissed me. I had noone to talk to, so after some time I just stopped trying. I learned to smile and politely say \u201cThanks. You\u2019re a good friend.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s what they all wanted to hear anyways. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to my sleeping, Or, well\u2026 Lack thereof. I stopped sleeping for a week after B\u2019s death. I would twist and turn. Wet the bed with my own sweat and tears and sometimes blood from my nose. Whenever I tried to sleep, my bed sheets felt like razor blades slicing away at my skin. The air felt thick and dry at the same time. And when I tried to breathe, I breathe in fire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was drying out. Exhausted and emptied. Hollow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After one week had passed, B was buried. A coffin that my family and I chose. It was beautiful. It smelled nice too. It was beige and slightly green around the edges of the top. It was made out of birchwood. B always loved the look of birch. The funeral was held on the 13th of November. It is the only day of november I remember perfectly. But I won\u2019t go into detail in this post. Because I remember every detail, and it would be too painful to try to replicate this memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, the night after the funeral, I got a little sleep. Just around and hour. I didn\u2019t dream or remember sleeping at all. But I saw the clock on my wall suddenly jump from 5:12 AM to 6:04 AM in what felt like the blink of my eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I blinked twice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time I opened my eyes, I saw a dark figure standing if front of the clock on my wall. I could just barely make out the shape in the dark, but it was human I guess. It looked human. After the second blink, it was gone. And I saw the clock. There was complete silence in my room. I had a digital clock, so there was no ticking noise. But there was one change that stood out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bed didn\u2019t burn anymore. The air felt refreshing. My eyes didn\u2019t burn, and I wasn\u2019t sweating. I didn\u2019t get more sleep that night, but I felt well rested when I had breakfast in the morning. I went to school that day too. For the first time in a while. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It continued to happen, again and again. Night after night. I slept for an hour, and it seemed like the blink of my eye. But I never saw that figure again. I tried to keep my eyes open after the short amount of sleep. But I just saw the clock. One hour more than a second ago. It felt strange, but I didn\u2019t complain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After half a year, it had gotten to three hours a night, still the instantaneous sleep as before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I never saw the figure again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had spoken to my therapist about my unnatural way of sleeping, and he recommended some pills, which only made matters worse. So I quit the pills. But then he recommended a way of sleeping i\u2019d never heard of before. Lucid dreaming. A way of sleeping where you have 100% control over what happens in your dream. A dream where you can do anything. He had had patients before who never slept because of nightmares. And when you are lucid dreaming, you can kill your monsters and fight the demons that plague you. Apparently it had worked wonders. And with my curious case, it should be interesting to see what effect it had on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He hoped that this would help me start sleeping more, or potentially lucid dream for real. And maybe this would help me fight the grief from the loss of my brother, B. Which still haunts me to this day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The process is simple really. You go to bed at regular times. And you map your dreams in a \u201cjournal\u201d, or a \u201cdream diary\u201d of sorts. And even though I hadn\u2019t had a dream in over half a year, I wrote down anything that happened during the night in a google drive document. Even during the day, I should document my thoughts. I would need to train my brain to understand when i\u2019m awake, and asleep. To better gain control of my unconscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are all the things I wrote in my \u201cjournal\u201d. Starting with the night after the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night between 13th - 14th november 2015.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I woke up I saw a strange figure in front of my clock on the wall. It was humanoid and dark. I could barely distinguish it in the darkness of my room. After I blinked once again, it was gone. This was at 6:04 AM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The document consisted of random scattered thoughts like: \u201ci saw a flower\u201d or \u201ci did my homework\u201d. But after getting better and better at documenting my thoughts during the day; I had dreams again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wrote all my dreams in &lt;em&gt;cursive&lt;/em&gt; and later reflections in normal text, to better differentiate between them. I ALWAYS wrote down my dreams immediately after I woke up, to make the documentation as fresh as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is what I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night between 10th - 11th march 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Cold. I\u2019m standing in a forest. It\u2019s only birch trees in sight. I heard crying above me, muffled. Like if someone cried in the room next to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I woke up; I didn\u2019t feel well rested at all. I felt uneasy\u2026 And bloated. And i had a nosebleed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was my first dream in over one and a half years. I had no idea why I remembered it so well. I guess the habit of trying to dream payed off at last. So I kept documenting and writing down further dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night between 11th - 12th march 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warm. Calm and easy. A steady rocking surrounds me. Like a baby in a cradle. Slowly swinging from side to side. Sinking deeper into sleep. Then I opened my eyes. Still in the dream. I looked down at my hands. They were distant. They looked fuzzy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had been told this was the case when lucid dreaming. Your hands are blurred. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I got excited. This is it! I\u2019m in control!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For some reason I decided that I wanted to visit my mother in my dream. But I couldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t in control of my dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Someone else is in control of my dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I blinked once, and saw my mother. Sobbing. Leaning over something. It was a fallen tree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I looked over my mother\u2019s shoulder, she held something in her hands. It was a photograph of a face, My face. But it wasn\u2019t my face, not my real face. But it felt like it was my face. But it wasn\u2019t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I tried to hug my mother, but I couldn\u2019t move.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I woke up with a nosebleed. The feeling of unease was present again. And I felt bloated the entire day, more so than yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night between 12th - 13th march 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was standing in front of a wall. It was made out of stone. Big, one meter tall blocks of stone. It stretched towards the horizon on both sides of me and reached far into the sky. Behind me was a long line of people. Waiting for me to do, something.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cReach into your pocket\u201d said the girl directly behind me. I turned around and saw her face. It was my cousin. She looked me in the eyes. Calm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cReach into your pocket.\u201d She repeated. I did, and I found a chisel. One that you use to carve stone. I looked at her again with a questionable look on my face. But she just stood there. Looking me in my eyes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cWrite something.\u201d She said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cWhat? What should I write?\u201d I asked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cWhatever you feel like.\u201d was the answer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I sighed, nodded, and walked closer to the wall. I raised the chisel and let it touch a block. It instantly did a small cut. You usually need a hammer to make a dent in stone I thought. But I wrote with big letters: \u201cDREAM\u201d. Then I gave the chisel to my cousin, and she walked forward. She wrote, again with small letters: \u201cFORGIVING\u201d. And gave the chisel to the next in line. It was one of my friends from kindergarten a long time ago. He wrote with massive letters: \u201cFRIEND\u201d. And the procedure continued.\nIn the line of people were everyone i\u2019ve ever cared about. They all wrote something. I noticed some words such as \u201cFAIR\u201d, \u201cKIND\u201d, \u201cCONCERNED\u201d and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But I suddenly froze in place. After everyone finished writing a word. They all looked at me, and I didn\u2019t see B.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up. Not feeling Uneasy or bloated today. I felt nothing unusual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night between 15th - 16th march 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im adding this now when posting, because this is where things go\u2026 crazy. The following nights I would wake up after writing my dreams down. Because when woke up, my computer was already turned on. And when i opened the document to write everything down, it was already written. And in some sporadic, crazy detailing. Things even I didn\u2019t remember from the dream. everything written here is still a 100% quote from my journal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crawling crawling creeeeepy crawling\u2026\u2026\u2026. it\u2019s my face, place space my face. There\u2019s fire. Oil and gasoline. My blood is oil. My veins are pumping battery acid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I see the tree. It waves to mmmeeee\u2026 The old man waves to me. He has old old old old toes. they grow in the ground. he is the ground. he is in me. In my face. He calls me \u201c\u00f6BnrJ\u201d. He points toward the sea. I down. I D ROW N. Deep down there where things don\u2019t think.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was seriously scared when I woke up to this. I remembered the tree from the dream, but not the \u201cold man\u201d, or that he called me \u201c\u00f6BnrJ\u201d. I did remember the drowning part, but that didn\u2019t feel like drowning at all. It felt more like, suffocation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night between 16th - 17th march 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The burning cold EarTH. Juust a maggot in a corpse. I\u2019m sitting in a tree made of ice, the man calls me \u00f6BnrJ. He calls for me. When I jump I fall down down downDOwn doown nwod.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My bones snap in place. It feels good. He lifts me on his shoulders and we go fishing. He catches nothing, but I catch them all. All mine. He is happy for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After seeing this I have no idea what\u2019s happening. the \u201cold man\u201d is still not present in my dreams now. But this lucid dreaming doesn\u2019t seem to be working at all, because i\u2019m not in control of my dream. And I mentioned in the dream between 11th and 12 march that \u201cSomeone else is in control of my dream\u201d. And that seems to be the case, because I no longer dream. And I just woke up to this. I don\u2019t even remember going to bed. I seem to have fallen asleep in front of my computer, and when I woke up I was sitting in my chair, with the computer still humming. And when I moved my mouse the screen turned on and I was greeted with an already documented dream. I\u2019m starting to think that i\u2019m sleepwalking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that night I was too afraid to even get tired. I downed six energy drinks every day to stay awake. And I was speaking to my therapist about this, and he was concerned. He practically begged me to start sleeping again, but I refused. until we struck a deal. I would have a camera in my room, recording me sleeping. If I stood up and started typing on my computer, we would know that it was just a serious case of sleepwalking. But if anything else happened, we would see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I set up the camera the following night. It was in a corner of my room almost at the roof. It was pointed at an angle that captured both my bed and my computer in one screen. I didn\u2019t go to school that day, and I didn\u2019t drink any energy drinks or coffee, and at 10:30 PM, I went to bed, but I didn\u2019t fall asleep until 4:53 AM. But here\u2019s what happened: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will describe everything the recording captured in these [] brackets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[RECORDED] Night between 12th - 13th april 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[I see myself turning sometimes in my sleep, sleeping on my back, then my left side, then on my stomach, then my right side, and on my back again. I go through this cycle for about thirty minutes. Then weird shit starts happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start to breath very heavily, and I start to mumble. Luckily the camera has a pretty decent microphone so I pick up some of the words I say, but most of it is just gibberish; \u201c...Hair...Mag...gesture...morning sun\u2026cold\u2026 snap\u2026\u201d I mumbled for about ten minutes. But then I stopped. And slowly a pillar of something dark rose from my chest, straight up towards my roof. It left my chest after becoming about 180cm/6feet tall. And out of the darkness  if formed things that looked like arms and legs. And a head. It all looked like that shadowy figure I had seen the night after the funeral. Only more, black. It was as if a hole had an even darker hole inside it. And I noticed that my breathing had stopped. I wasn\u2019t breathing at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The figure just floated above me for a while, until it went down from the air and stood on the floor next to my bed. It looked at me, or well, it didn\u2019t have eyes, but it turned it\u2019s head towards my body in the bed. And then it moved towards my computer, and turned it on. The monitor lit up the room slightly and I could see the contours of the figure better in the light, it didn\u2019t have any sharp edges, it was more like a fuzzy shadow. It leaned over my desk and started typing on my keyboard, very slowly. Maybe one or two keypresses every second. It somehow knew my password, since it obviously typed more, and it was typing in my journal. It was typing for around ten minutes. Then it just left my computer and stood at the end of my bed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I know that it stood in a way so that it blocked my view of my clock on the wall. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s what I had seen the night after the funeral!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After about one minute of just standing there, it slowly pulled its arms towards its sides and closed it\u2019s legs, and became that pillar again. It floated over my body for a while, and returned into my chest. As soon as it was inside my body, I started breathing again. After 43 minutes of just me breathing, I woke up. However I only remember this night as another instantaneous blink.]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is what the figure wrote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The world spins, around a star. Around a cluster. Around a hole. Around a cluster. Around a hole. Then what? What does everything spin around??? We only see what we can see. I can see the old man. \u00f6BnrJ is my name. He calls me that. He is the ground, he is the tree, he is me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A wall of stone surrounds the all. A wall of words. Blocking our view of truth. We need to all let go. We neeeeeed to stop spinning. We must stop the wall from becoming blank.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stone surrounds me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I now understand that all of the dreams i\u2019ve had are connected. With the old man, the tree and the wall of stone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what about the spinning? Is the figure talking about the universe? How stars rotate around each other, and around in a galaxy\u2019s black hole? How galaxies rotate in clusters and superclusters? Maybe the \u201cWall of stone\u201d is the observable universe? And the words are our limited information of the universe?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[RECORDED] Night between 13th - 14th april 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[It all happened just like the night before, I twist and turn for a while, then I mumble some words. This time I could only hear these words: \u201cSpace\u2026 face\u2026 screws...bees in\u2026 strange\u2026solid...macabre\u2026\u201d And then the dark pillar arises from my chest, floats for a bit, and becomes a figure. It stands next to my bed and observes my non-breathing body. And then it starts typing on my computer. Just as slowly as before.]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up to this text:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You have found me. They understand nottt who I is. What I is. Why call me it? I am \u00f6BnrJ. The old man calls me \u00f6BnrJ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing more, nothing fewer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The one who lives in darkness must dream. Or he will not sleeeeeep. He will drownn and fall. I am born from birch. I am dead in fire. I will not sleep until the words are gone, and the wall crumbles at my toes. Be one with the ground and I shall rest forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[It returned to my body, but not through my chest, but my nose. And I saw myself wake up instantly after it returned, and illuminated by the monitor, I saw that I was bleeding from my nose.]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I clearly remember waking up with a nosebleed that morning. And that feeling of being bloated was present again. Maybe it\u2019s \u00f6BnrJ (the figure wants to be called that apparently) who is still awake in my body, making me feel bloated?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[RECORDED] Night between 14th - 15th april 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spoke with \u00f6BnrJ this night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I somehow woke up when it was observing me from the side of my bed. I gasped for air and I felt very cold. It didn\u2019t move at all, but I was terrified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDon\u2019t scared\u201d \u00f6BnrJ said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was still petrified from fear. But \u00f6BnrJ didn\u2019t move. \u00f6BnrJ\u2019s voice was strange, I didn\u2019t hear it as if it spoke to me. I heard it in my brain, and felt it as a soft vibration in my lungs.\nI gulped and said:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUm\u2026 why am i\u2026 awake?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou woke up\u201d \u00f6BnrJ said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was now sitting upright in my bed, staring at this unimaginably dark figure, almost invisible here in the dark of my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI know, I woke up. But why now? I wasn\u2019t breathing at all.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou were just asleep. But different. Feel your heart.\u201d \u00f6BnrJ said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I carefully placed my hand on the left side of my chest, still staring into the void in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart had stopped. I had no pulse either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat the fuck...Am I dead!?\u201d I almost shouted. But my voice was also unusual, I only heard my voice in my own head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAlmost\u201d \u00f6BnrJ said \u201cBut not really.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOkay so, what do I do now? Will I die?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot if you don\u2019t wish it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, I don\u2019t wish to die.\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThen you won\u2019t.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I blinked. And woke up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was lying in my bed. I instantly checked my pulse and chest. I had a heartbeat. I sighed in relief, and laughed a bit. I heard my own voice\u2019s slight echo in my room. Was that just another dream? Or did it really happen? Did I really wake up and speak to \u00f6BnrJ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rushed to check the recording of the camera, and there I saw it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[I was talking to \u00f6BnrJ. But my mouth wasn\u2019t moving at all. Only my body. I saw myself panicking when I checked my heartbeat, and when I blinked. But in that moment of me blinking, it was very strange. Because I could see my eyes closing, and in the next frame on the recording I was lying down. It was as if I had teleported back to my sleeping position. I has stopped breathing again. And this time \u00f6Bnrj only typed five letters on my computer. Before returning into my body, through my chest.]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DREAM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where my journal ends so far, people of nosleep. I am in awe and shock after this night. I want to know if any of you have had any similar experiences, or if you could help me figure out what \u00f6BnrJ wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit1: Formatting&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I found nosleep about a week ago, and since this is place is full of people who have experience with the paranormal and \u201cunusual\u201d, I thought I would post about my unusual experience. But anyways, here\u2019s my story:\n\nEver since the 6th of November, 2015, I haven't slept a full night. That\u2019s because on the night between the 5th and 6th, my older brother, who i\u2019m going to call B, died. He was older than me by 4 years, and died from a medicine-related overdose. He had a long history of drug abuse and mental illness, and he was constantly plagued in his teens by anxiety, depression and eating disorders. So he started to self-medicate. Cannabis and various online-drugs were his choice. The drugs and psychedelics, combined with a later abuse of alcohol, took a toll on his brain. He started to have visions, hallucinations. Things were disappearing and changing colours. He saw shadowy people in the corner of his eye, but when he turned to face them, they were gone. And he saw the walls \u201cBreathing\u201d and \u201cPulsating\u201d. \n\nTo counter these horrible feelings and visions, he took more drugs. And got even worse. He started abusing and misusing the medicine that was prescribed to him, and it was most likely an overdose on his anti-depressants he died from. It showed traces of those specific chemicals in his blood after the autopsy.\n\nThe crime scene investigators also found out how he died. He had fainted after standing up from his computer, fallen on his face, and as a result of the drugs, puked. But because of his position, the puke didn\u2019t leave his mouth. He tried to breathe, but he couldn\u2019t move. So he suffocated to death while unconscious.\n\nIt was a relief to me when I heard that he didn\u2019t suffer. And he experienced no pain.\n\nI learned all this from his doctors and psychiatrists that he regularly spoke to. I have even read every summarization from every therapist he ever spoke to about his addiction. All of his medical records were available to me and my family after B died. \n\nI got the word about his death at 16:35 on the 6th of november through a phone call from my dad. The full month of november is a blur in my memory. Twisted faces and voices. Choices and options of where and how he should be buried. I heard the same line over and over from different people.\n\n\u201cThats horrible, I hope you understand that i\u2019m here if you need to talk to someone, about anything.\u201d\n\nOver and over again. It was insanity. All my relatives said it. All my friends and my classmates.\n\nBut all was lies, whenever I tried to communicate that I felt like shit, they dismissed me. I had noone to talk to, so after some time I just stopped trying. I learned to smile and politely say \u201cThanks. You\u2019re a good friend.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what they all wanted to hear anyways. \n\nBack to my sleeping, Or, well\u2026 Lack thereof. I stopped sleeping for a week after B\u2019s death. I would twist and turn. Wet the bed with my own sweat and tears and sometimes blood from my nose. Whenever I tried to sleep, my bed sheets felt like razor blades slicing away at my skin. The air felt thick and dry at the same time. And when I tried to breathe, I breathe in fire.\n\nI was drying out. Exhausted and emptied. Hollow.\n\nAfter one week had passed, B was buried. A coffin that my family and I chose. It was beautiful. It smelled nice too. It was beige and slightly green around the edges of the top. It was made out of birchwood. B always loved the look of birch. The funeral was held on the 13th of November. It is the only day of november I remember perfectly. But I won\u2019t go into detail in this post. Because I remember every detail, and it would be too painful to try to replicate this memory.\n\nStrangely enough, the night after the funeral, I got a little sleep. Just around and hour. I didn\u2019t dream or remember sleeping at all. But I saw the clock on my wall suddenly jump from 5:12 AM to 6:04 AM in what felt like the blink of my eye.\n\nBut I blinked twice. \n\nThe first time I opened my eyes, I saw a dark figure standing if front of the clock on my wall. I could just barely make out the shape in the dark, but it was human I guess. It looked human. After the second blink, it was gone. And I saw the clock. There was complete silence in my room. I had a digital clock, so there was no ticking noise. But there was one change that stood out. \n\nI felt comfortable. \n\nThe bed didn\u2019t burn anymore. The air felt refreshing. My eyes didn\u2019t burn, and I wasn\u2019t sweating. I didn\u2019t get more sleep that night, but I felt well rested when I had breakfast in the morning. I went to school that day too. For the first time in a while. \n\nIt continued to happen, again and again. Night after night. I slept for an hour, and it seemed like the blink of my eye. But I never saw that figure again. I tried to keep my eyes open after the short amount of sleep. But I just saw the clock. One hour more than a second ago. It felt strange, but I didn\u2019t complain.\n\nAfter half a year, it had gotten to three hours a night, still the instantaneous sleep as before. \n\nAnd I never saw the figure again.\n\nUntil recently.\n\nI had spoken to my therapist about my unnatural way of sleeping, and he recommended some pills, which only made matters worse. So I quit the pills. But then he recommended a way of sleeping i\u2019d never heard of before. Lucid dreaming. A way of sleeping where you have 100% control over what happens in your dream. A dream where you can do anything. He had had patients before who never slept because of nightmares. And when you are lucid dreaming, you can kill your monsters and fight the demons that plague you. Apparently it had worked wonders. And with my curious case, it should be interesting to see what effect it had on me.\n\nHe hoped that this would help me start sleeping more, or potentially lucid dream for real. And maybe this would help me fight the grief from the loss of my brother, B. Which still haunts me to this day. \n\nThe process is simple really. You go to bed at regular times. And you map your dreams in a \u201cjournal\u201d, or a \u201cdream diary\u201d of sorts. And even though I hadn\u2019t had a dream in over half a year, I wrote down anything that happened during the night in a google drive document. Even during the day, I should document my thoughts. I would need to train my brain to understand when i\u2019m awake, and asleep. To better gain control of my unconscious mind.\n\nThese are all the things I wrote in my \u201cjournal\u201d. Starting with the night after the funeral.\n\n**Night between 13th - 14th november 2015.**\n\nWhen I woke up I saw a strange figure in front of my clock on the wall. It was humanoid and dark. I could barely distinguish it in the darkness of my room. After I blinked once again, it was gone. This was at 6:04 AM.\n\nThe document consisted of random scattered thoughts like: \u201ci saw a flower\u201d or \u201ci did my homework\u201d. But after getting better and better at documenting my thoughts during the day; I had dreams again.\n\nI wrote all my dreams in *cursive* and later reflections in normal text, to better differentiate between them. I ALWAYS wrote down my dreams immediately after I woke up, to make the documentation as fresh as possible.\n\nHere is what I wrote:\n\n**Night between 10th - 11th march 2017.**\n*Cold. I\u2019m standing in a forest. It\u2019s only birch trees in sight. I heard crying above me, muffled. Like if someone cried in the room next to me.*\n\nWhen I woke up; I didn\u2019t feel well rested at all. I felt uneasy\u2026 And bloated. And i had a nosebleed.\n\nThis was my first dream in over one and a half years. I had no idea why I remembered it so well. I guess the habit of trying to dream payed off at last. So I kept documenting and writing down further dreams.\n\n**Night between 11th - 12th march 2017.**\n\n*Warm. Calm and easy. A steady rocking surrounds me. Like a baby in a cradle. Slowly swinging from side to side. Sinking deeper into sleep. Then I opened my eyes. Still in the dream. I looked down at my hands. They were distant. They looked fuzzy.*\n\nI had been told this was the case when lucid dreaming. Your hands are blurred. \n\n*I got excited. This is it! I\u2019m in control!*\n\n*For some reason I decided that I wanted to visit my mother in my dream. But I couldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t in control of my dream.*\n\n*Someone else is in control of my dream.*\n\n*I blinked once, and saw my mother. Sobbing. Leaning over something. It was a fallen tree.*\n\n*Birch.*\n\n*I looked over my mother\u2019s shoulder, she held something in her hands. It was a photograph of a face, My face. But it wasn\u2019t my face, not my real face. But it felt like it was my face. But it wasn\u2019t.*\n\n*I tried to hug my mother, but I couldn\u2019t move.*\n\nThen I woke up with a nosebleed. The feeling of unease was present again. And I felt bloated the entire day, more so than yesterday.\n\n**Night between 12th - 13th march 2017.**\n\n*I was standing in front of a wall. It was made out of stone. Big, one meter tall blocks of stone. It stretched towards the horizon on both sides of me and reached far into the sky. Behind me was a long line of people. Waiting for me to do, something.*\n\n*\u201cReach into your pocket\u201d said the girl directly behind me. I turned around and saw her face. It was my cousin. She looked me in the eyes. Calm.*\n\n*\u201cReach into your pocket.\u201d She repeated. I did, and I found a chisel. One that you use to carve stone. I looked at her again with a questionable look on my face. But she just stood there. Looking me in my eyes.*\n\n*\u201cWrite something.\u201d She said.*\n\n*\u201cWhat? What should I write?\u201d I asked.*\n\n*\u201cWhatever you feel like.\u201d was the answer.*\n\n*I sighed, nodded, and walked closer to the wall. I raised the chisel and let it touch a block. It instantly did a small cut. You usually need a hammer to make a dent in stone I thought. But I wrote with big letters: \u201cDREAM\u201d. Then I gave the chisel to my cousin, and she walked forward. She wrote, again with small letters: \u201cFORGIVING\u201d. And gave the chisel to the next in line. It was one of my friends from kindergarten a long time ago. He wrote with massive letters: \u201cFRIEND\u201d. And the procedure continued.\nIn the line of people were everyone i\u2019ve ever cared about. They all wrote something. I noticed some words such as \u201cFAIR\u201d, \u201cKIND\u201d, \u201cCONCERNED\u201d and more.*\n\n*But I suddenly froze in place. After everyone finished writing a word. They all looked at me, and I didn\u2019t see B.*\n\nI woke up. Not feeling Uneasy or bloated today. I felt nothing unusual.\n\n**Night between 15th - 16th march 2017.**\n\nIm adding this now when posting, because this is where things go\u2026 crazy. The following nights I would wake up after writing my dreams down. Because when woke up, my computer was already turned on. And when i opened the document to write everything down, it was already written. And in some sporadic, crazy detailing. Things even I didn\u2019t remember from the dream. everything written here is still a 100% quote from my journal.\n\n*Crawling crawling creeeeepy crawling\u2026\u2026\u2026. it\u2019s my face, place space my face. There\u2019s fire. Oil and gasoline. My blood is oil. My veins are pumping battery acid.*\n\n*I see the tree. It waves to mmmeeee\u2026 The old man waves to me. He has old old old old toes. they grow in the ground. he is the ground. he is in me. In my face. He calls me \u201c\u00f6BnrJ\u201d. He points toward the sea. I down. I D ROW N. Deep down there where things don\u2019t think.*\n\nI was seriously scared when I woke up to this. I remembered the tree from the dream, but not the \u201cold man\u201d, or that he called me \u201c\u00f6BnrJ\u201d. I did remember the drowning part, but that didn\u2019t feel like drowning at all. It felt more like, suffocation.\n\n**Night between 16th - 17th march 2017.**\n\n*The burning cold EarTH. Juust a maggot in a corpse. I\u2019m sitting in a tree made of ice, the man calls me \u00f6BnrJ. He calls for me. When I jump I fall down down downDOwn doown nwod.*\n\n*My bones snap in place. It feels good. He lifts me on his shoulders and we go fishing. He catches nothing, but I catch them all. All mine. He is happy for me.*\n\nAfter seeing this I have no idea what\u2019s happening. the \u201cold man\u201d is still not present in my dreams now. But this lucid dreaming doesn\u2019t seem to be working at all, because i\u2019m not in control of my dream. And I mentioned in the dream between 11th and 12 march that \u201cSomeone else is in control of my dream\u201d. And that seems to be the case, because I no longer dream. And I just woke up to this. I don\u2019t even remember going to bed. I seem to have fallen asleep in front of my computer, and when I woke up I was sitting in my chair, with the computer still humming. And when I moved my mouse the screen turned on and I was greeted with an already documented dream. I\u2019m starting to think that i\u2019m sleepwalking. \n\nAfter that night I was too afraid to even get tired. I downed six energy drinks every day to stay awake. And I was speaking to my therapist about this, and he was concerned. He practically begged me to start sleeping again, but I refused. until we struck a deal. I would have a camera in my room, recording me sleeping. If I stood up and started typing on my computer, we would know that it was just a serious case of sleepwalking. But if anything else happened, we would see.\n\nI set up the camera the following night. It was in a corner of my room almost at the roof. It was pointed at an angle that captured both my bed and my computer in one screen. I didn\u2019t go to school that day, and I didn\u2019t drink any energy drinks or coffee, and at 10:30 PM, I went to bed, but I didn\u2019t fall asleep until 4:53 AM. But here\u2019s what happened: \n\nI will describe everything the recording captured in these [] brackets.\n\n**[RECORDED] Night between 12th - 13th april 2017.**\n\n[I see myself turning sometimes in my sleep, sleeping on my back, then my left side, then on my stomach, then my right side, and on my back again. I go through this cycle for about thirty minutes. Then weird shit starts happening.\n\nI start to breath very heavily, and I start to mumble. Luckily the camera has a pretty decent microphone so I pick up some of the words I say, but most of it is just gibberish; \u201c...Hair...Mag...gesture...morning sun\u2026cold\u2026 snap\u2026\u201d I mumbled for about ten minutes. But then I stopped. And slowly a pillar of something dark rose from my chest, straight up towards my roof. It left my chest after becoming about 180cm/6feet tall. And out of the darkness  if formed things that looked like arms and legs. And a head. It all looked like that shadowy figure I had seen the night after the funeral. Only more, black. It was as if a hole had an even darker hole inside it. And I noticed that my breathing had stopped. I wasn\u2019t breathing at all.\n\nThe figure just floated above me for a while, until it went down from the air and stood on the floor next to my bed. It looked at me, or well, it didn\u2019t have eyes, but it turned it\u2019s head towards my body in the bed. And then it moved towards my computer, and turned it on. The monitor lit up the room slightly and I could see the contours of the figure better in the light, it didn\u2019t have any sharp edges, it was more like a fuzzy shadow. It leaned over my desk and started typing on my keyboard, very slowly. Maybe one or two keypresses every second. It somehow knew my password, since it obviously typed more, and it was typing in my journal. It was typing for around ten minutes. Then it just left my computer and stood at the end of my bed. \n\nAnd I know that it stood in a way so that it blocked my view of my clock on the wall. \n\nThat\u2019s what I had seen the night after the funeral!\n\nAfter about one minute of just standing there, it slowly pulled its arms towards its sides and closed it\u2019s legs, and became that pillar again. It floated over my body for a while, and returned into my chest. As soon as it was inside my body, I started breathing again. After 43 minutes of just me breathing, I woke up. However I only remember this night as another instantaneous blink.]\n\nHere is what the figure wrote:\n\n*The world spins, around a star. Around a cluster. Around a hole. Around a cluster. Around a hole. Then what? What does everything spin around??? We only see what we can see. I can see the old man. \u00f6BnrJ is my name. He calls me that. He is the ground, he is the tree, he is me.*\n\n*A wall of stone surrounds the all. A wall of words. Blocking our view of truth. We need to all let go. We neeeeeed to stop spinning. We must stop the wall from becoming blank.*\n\n*Stone surrounds me.*\n\nI now understand that all of the dreams i\u2019ve had are connected. With the old man, the tree and the wall of stone.\n\nBut what about the spinning? Is the figure talking about the universe? How stars rotate around each other, and around in a galaxy\u2019s black hole? How galaxies rotate in clusters and superclusters? Maybe the \u201cWall of stone\u201d is the observable universe? And the words are our limited information of the universe?\n\n**[RECORDED] Night between 13th - 14th april 2017.**\n\n[It all happened just like the night before, I twist and turn for a while, then I mumble some words. This time I could only hear these words: \u201cSpace\u2026 face\u2026 screws...bees in\u2026 strange\u2026solid...macabre\u2026\u201d And then the dark pillar arises from my chest, floats for a bit, and becomes a figure. It stands next to my bed and observes my non-breathing body. And then it starts typing on my computer. Just as slowly as before.]\n\nI woke up to this text:\n\n*You have found me. They understand nottt who I is. What I is. Why call me it? I am \u00f6BnrJ. The old man calls me \u00f6BnrJ.*\n\n*Nothing more, nothing fewer.*\n\n*The one who lives in darkness must dream. Or he will not sleeeeeep. He will drownn and fall. I am born from birch. I am dead in fire. I will not sleep until the words are gone, and the wall crumbles at my toes. Be one with the ground and I shall rest forever.*\n\n[It returned to my body, but not through my chest, but my nose. And I saw myself wake up instantly after it returned, and illuminated by the monitor, I saw that I was bleeding from my nose.]\n\nI clearly remember waking up with a nosebleed that morning. And that feeling of being bloated was present again. Maybe it\u2019s \u00f6BnrJ (the figure wants to be called that apparently) who is still awake in my body, making me feel bloated?\n\n**[RECORDED] Night between 14th - 15th april 2017.**\n\nI spoke with \u00f6BnrJ this night.\n\nI somehow woke up when it was observing me from the side of my bed. I gasped for air and I felt very cold. It didn\u2019t move at all, but I was terrified.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t scared\u201d \u00f6BnrJ said.\n\nI was still petrified from fear. But \u00f6BnrJ didn\u2019t move. \u00f6BnrJ\u2019s voice was strange, I didn\u2019t hear it as if it spoke to me. I heard it in my brain, and felt it as a soft vibration in my lungs.\nI gulped and said:\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 why am i\u2026 awake?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou woke up\u201d \u00f6BnrJ said.\n\nI was now sitting upright in my bed, staring at this unimaginably dark figure, almost invisible here in the dark of my room.\n\n\u201cI know, I woke up. But why now? I wasn\u2019t breathing at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were just asleep. But different. Feel your heart.\u201d \u00f6BnrJ said.\n\nI carefully placed my hand on the left side of my chest, still staring into the void in the darkness.\n\nMy heart had stopped. I had no pulse either.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck...Am I dead!?\u201d I almost shouted. But my voice was also unusual, I only heard my voice in my own head.\n\n\u201cAlmost\u201d \u00f6BnrJ said \u201cBut not really.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay so, what do I do now? Will I die?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if you don\u2019t wish it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t wish to die.\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI blinked. And woke up.\n\nI was lying in my bed. I instantly checked my pulse and chest. I had a heartbeat. I sighed in relief, and laughed a bit. I heard my own voice\u2019s slight echo in my room. Was that just another dream? Or did it really happen? Did I really wake up and speak to \u00f6BnrJ?\n\nI rushed to check the recording of the camera, and there I saw it:\n\n[I was talking to \u00f6BnrJ. But my mouth wasn\u2019t moving at all. Only my body. I saw myself panicking when I checked my heartbeat, and when I blinked. But in that moment of me blinking, it was very strange. Because I could see my eyes closing, and in the next frame on the recording I was lying down. It was as if I had teleported back to my sleeping position. I has stopped breathing again. And this time \u00f6Bnrj only typed five letters on my computer. Before returning into my body, through my chest.]\n\n*DREAM*\n\nThis is where my journal ends so far, people of nosleep.
