You shop at the thrift store, or you don&amp;#39;t shop. Or, in my case, you work at the thrift shop or you don&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, the pay sucks and I basically sort the crap other people don&amp;#39;t want anymore, but there are perks. As a broke art student, I find both material and inspiration in the cast off items I sift through daily. I mean, people donate the weirdest shit. Some of it is pretty nice, but other times it&amp;#39;s just odd. It&amp;#39;s fascinating to get a glimpse into someone else&amp;#39;s life like that. \nUsually, things are more or less generic dime store junk. They kind of blend into each other. So the odds and ends that I find that peak my interest become twice as appealing. And there have been quite a few noteworthy donations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time I found a really neat old locket. A little tarnished but this thing was heavy. It wasn&amp;#39;t the cheaply crafted glass and nickel pendant that I saw daily in the donation bins. No uniformly cut and unnaturally perfect chunks of glass or shiny tangled chains on this locket. The silver was mottled and blackened, even the finely cut stones looked real.\n The chick up front put it in the locked display case as soon as she got it up there. If she hadn&amp;#39;t priced it so high, I would have bought it myself, I have a really bad habit of turning around and returning some of my paycheck to my employer if the item is cheap and intriguing enough. And even if the quality and age hadn&amp;#39;t been enough to draw my attention, the inside of the locket definitely got me. When I opened it up, there was an old picture. Which is pretty much to be expected, but this one had been all scratched up. It was an antique sepia toned photo of a girl, but her face had been scratched through. The other half was engraved with initials in some fancy script font &amp;quot;F. S.&amp;quot; Looked like calligraphy. And someone had crossed it out with a jagged\u201d X\u201d through the letters. But it just added to the worn, vintage look everyone loves now, so I pocketed the picture and sent it out.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other thing I really enjoy about my job is going through the pockets on donated clothes. It&amp;#39;s kind of uncomfortable, I mean, sometimes I do feel a bit weird going through someone else&amp;#39;s clothes. And you can find some disgusting shit, like the time Tami got jabbed by a syringe in some old coat. God, she flipped over that. Kept screaming she would get AIDS or Hepatitis A, B and C. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I never found anything like that, but sometimes I find some interesting notes and lists. Often, I simply move them into my own pocket as I go; no one has noticed yet, and they make for great additions to my collages. Usually it&amp;#39;s pretty boring, grocery lists, reminders about the dry cleaning and old receipts. But not always.\n One time, I found two or three drafts of a suicide note crumpled into a ball in the pocket of a ladies bolero. Apparently, her high stress job, her lover&amp;#39;s decision to stay with her milquetoast hubby and end their affair, combined with her pomchi&amp;#39;s untimely death were all too much for her. I wonder if she ever actually did it, or if the notes were just stuffed in her pocket and forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another time, I found a grocery list with insane instructions in the back pocket of a pair of shorts.&lt;br/&gt;\n &amp;quot;Get milk from the Dollar General on Marks and Ghent Dr. \nDon&amp;#39;t check out if third register open. This is where they can see you. \nGrab magazine in top row closest to you at 1st register. Turn it around to throw them off.\n Don&amp;#39;t forget Listerine and Kleenex.&amp;quot; \nI stopped reading after a bit because I was falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another time I found someone&amp;#39;s daily schedule in an overcoat. There were three copies of three different schedules. \n&amp;quot;Lacy: 7 am, wakes up, goes jogging to Elm St Park. 8 am, gets ready for work. 8:45 am, heads for the bus on 5th and Main. 9 am, arrives at work in the front office of Revner and Sons on Carowin Blvd. 5 pm, Leaves work on the 5:15 bus.&amp;quot; The next one was &amp;quot;Amanda:9 am, wakes, readies for the day. 10 am, heads to class at WCC.  12:45 pm, leaves class and bikes to work. 1 pm, evening shift at Marcel&amp;#39;s Bistro begins. 9 pm, shift ends, bikes home down Oaks to Larkspur.&amp;quot;  Then came Billie. &amp;quot;Billie: 5pm, wakes. 6 pm, orders takeout from Panda Express. 8 pm. Gets ready for the night shift on 11th St. 9 pm, is picked up in a burgundy Pontiac, lic # ALF1096.&amp;quot;\nI thought about mentioning it to someone, but all of our donations are anonymous so no one would know anything about the owner anyway. However, I pocketed the lists and made a mental note to look into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Folded up neatly in a black rain coat, I found the award winner. Two pages of crisp, lined note paper, filled entirely front and back with the same words over and over again. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be a bad boy today.&amp;quot; Cursive, print, all caps, slanted and spidery, small and neat. The handwriting varied wildly. Kind of like several people had taken turns writing it down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Books and heirlooms are a whole new level of weird. Family albums are great. The things people will memorialize. Posing with your smiling toddler over the bloody carcass of the year&amp;#39;s first buck? Great. Pictures of Great Aunt Louise at her open casket funeral? Lovely. Children crying while being encouraged to pose with a guy in a blank faced Easter Bunny costume? Definitely.\n One album was just off. Not creepy, but really strange. It was one of those ridiculously bright and cheerful pastel photo albums that were everywhere in the 90s. You know, the powder blue and candy pink striped ones with a rubber ducky or teddy bear in the top corner? That style. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I leafed through it to make sure that the pages were intact, no tears, spills, that kind of thing. Part of the job with books. The album was full of pictures, but they weren&amp;#39;t of anything.  Just one bright blur in the corner of an otherwise black background. But that was all of them. None of them had anything else in the picture, just a blur over and over. From the look of them, they were a collection of double exposures, the kind common with early disposable cameras.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another album that comes to mind looked fairly mundane at first glance. Family events, birthday parties, holidays. That kind of thing. But ordinarily scrapbook photos are more candid, not as staged as these ones seemed to be. It was a slow day, so I leafed through it a few times. That&amp;#39;s when I noticed all of the pictures were taken in a windowless room, and the oldest girl in the picture never moved from her seat at the head of an old table.\n  And these pictures were obviously taken over a period of years. You could only see her hands in one or two of the pictures, and she was always wearing really heavy silver bangles that were so big in the 80s. You know, either that or she had on handcuffs. As it was priced at .99 cents, I bought it on lunch so I could review the pictures later. \n Then there was the Baby So Real album. That one freaked us all out, even my manager. It was one of the Baby&amp;#39;s First Year Albums, but instead of a real baby the pictures were all of a Baby So Real doll. It was propped up in a high-chair with a birthday cake in front of it and a party hat on its head in one pic.\n Another one was captioned &amp;quot;Getting so big!&amp;quot; And it showed the doll propped up against a door frame like it was standing, a chalk mark above its\u2019 plastic head, showing that it still, in fact, stood 14 inches tall. Tons and tons of pictures of this doll, literally a year&amp;#39;s worth. I don&amp;#39;t know what happened to that one, it just stayed on my manager&amp;#39;s desk for a while, and became the newest office joke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another album was entirely composed of &amp;quot;Sleeping Beauties&amp;quot; and accompanying poems. Just dozens and dozens of random people sleeping, and small sonnets written in a block style sharpie. I really don&amp;#39;t know what to think about that one... It was bought by an elderly woman before I could snag it, otherwise I would have studied it more thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The album that bothered me most was the most inoffensive looking one in the list. It was large, brown and plain in nice faux suede. No identifying marks, nothing interesting. At first, the photos looked like they were taken by an uninspired amateur nature photographer. Tall brown grasses and a tree were in the foreground, and a large white two story home stood in the distance. All of the pictures featured the tree and the house. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After several pages, the tree was gone and the house became the focus. There was a picture of that house taken from every possible angle, and at every possible time of day and night. The house seems to age, and the seasons are obviously passing through the eye of the lens. Several pictures show the house lit up with holiday decor, and others feature a garden in the middle of April bloom. Each picture seemed a bit closer than the last. In the last two pictures, you can make out a figure in the downstairs window. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The arts and crafts items are fantastic. The things people will make! Much of it is just sad, like children&amp;#39;s paintings, hand painted &amp;quot;World&amp;#39;s Best Mom&amp;quot; mugs with little smudged finger prints. Or clay hand prints with names and dates scratched underneath. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea of tossing out those little mementos is just sad to me. It&amp;#39;s like leaving your memories out on display, to be reviewed and discarded by the indifferent world before being tossed in the bin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then you have the obviously creepy stuff, like sad clown paintings, a faintly smiling portrait of Jesus hanging on the cross done on velvet, or taxidermied ducks. They are bizarre and gruesome in an utterly conventional way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, I&amp;#39;m talking about the cool &amp;quot;Michael&amp;#39;s Craft Store should start a watch list&amp;quot; kind of creepy stuff. There was the infamous serial killer collage. Cliche, but interesting in its own way. Someone had covered a 32&amp;quot; by 28&amp;quot; piece of poster board in plaster and had then pressed hundreds of doll&amp;#39;s eyes into it. It was an ever-watchful mosaic of disturbing. Blue, brown, green and grey. Unblinking, unnerving, staring glass eyes. It was brilliant. \nThis prime example of schizophrenic art stayed on the floor for almost two months before I broke down and bought it for a whopping $ 1.99. My co-workers had all been betting on how long it would stay on the store shelf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One trinket that I found particularly intriguing was a family mold statuette. You may have seen the kits in the store, or on the cheesy &amp;#39;As seen on TV! &amp;quot; ads. Essentially, the concept is that the participants clasp hands and cover them in the plaster to form a mold. Then I guess you place your disembodied phantom hands on the mantle, or dashboard or something. I don&amp;#39;t know, really, it&amp;#39;s a weird family thing.\n Anyway, this pair of hands was oddly formed. I couldn&amp;#39;t quite understand why they looked so unnaturally proportioned until I noticed that all 10 digits were missing the third knuckle. The forefinger of one set was missing the finger nail entirely, and only two of the ten fingers bore prints of any kind. The pads were smooth and devoid of any mark or identifying markers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Monday we receive the rejected remains of estate sale inventory. Some weeks our Mondays are full of Aunt Ernestine&amp;#39;s cowboy tea pot collections, or Grandpa Melville&amp;#39;s bins of gospel records. But sometimes I find real treasures. Daguerotypes, silver shaving sets, boxes of vintage jewelry and steamer trunks of clothes and embroidered linens. At the bottom of a musty cedar chest I once found four tiny, yellowing Christening gowns and traveling coats. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One traveling coat, a rust red boiled wool number with sterling silver buttons down the breast looked to be sewn to fit a six year old boy. The left shoulder was cut in several places, the fibers frayed and rough with some dried black stain covering the sleeve and back in large uneven patches. Just under this marred little coat lay a white dressing gown with splatters of reddish brown in spider-webbing streaks across the bodice and skirt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tag was embroidered with a small, graceful L. D. I. I looked for any indication of the date on the trunk itself, but there was no way of knowing much of anything aside from what the vague auction tag stated. &amp;quot;Cedar Chest, 1930s, #7665&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, after three years of curiously perusing the discarded memories that people have carelessly left behind, someone has donated a truly fascinating item. An item I am not allowed to see at all. An entire bag of them, in fact. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This morning, when I pulled into the pothole-ridden parking lot behind the store I saw three police cars and yellow crime scene tape liberally spread across the back entrance. My manager was excitedly babbling, and the officers were listening with exasperated faces. I noticed two or three co-workers having a smoke and watching the scene with great interest. I asked Mac if we had been robbed, or if someone had left a bundle of drugs in our drop off bin. He wordlessly offered me a Marlboro black, which I accepted with only a hint of feigned reluctance. \nHe took an overly long drag on his shrinking cigarette before responding. &amp;quot;Well, according to Wendy someone left us a bag of skulls last night. She thought they were Halloween props, but props aren&amp;#39;t likely to come with bits of skin still attached.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Being poor means you have limited options.
