It\u2019s like deja vu, but it\u2019s more than just a feeling--I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I\u2019ve been in this situation before. My sense of time is all messed up because I honestly feel I\u2019ve been in this situation more than once--maybe more than just a few times--even though I also know I just boarded this train earlier this afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start to sweat. I don&amp;#39;t feel well, but I shake my head and try to focus. This nagging feeling that I\u2019ve done this before won\u2019t go away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I get a flash of cold metal at my neck and a loud bang.  I rub my palms into my eyes and try to calm down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, I get a flash of  myself falling hard onto the tracks as a train approaches. I shake my head again. What the hell is going on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, for a split second, I sense myself running, but I hear another loud bang and feel a searing pain at my back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The images are so disjointed. They make no sense, but they won\u2019t stop coming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see dozens of scenarios, all ending in violence. It won&amp;#39;t stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In another flash, I feel myself breaking free from restraint, but I hear another bang and see a man fall ahead of me. My ears are ringing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I close my eyes tightly and try to focus on something else--anything else. I make a challenge out of it, recalling to myself details about everyone in the train car with me just based on another vague memory. The thoughts are hard to hold onto. It\u2019s like noticing something in your peripheral vision, but when you focus on it, it disappears. Still, I concentrate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, so there\u2019s hardly anyone onboard. But I know there\u2019s an older guy and a lady. And they\u2019re both busy with\u2026 I don\u2019t know, something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wow, Rachel. How descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take a deep breath and try harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man is older--maybe in his 60s--and he\u2019s reading a newspaper. The woman is reading a kindle or using an iPad or something. I think she\u2019s closer to 50. He\u2019s got on a navy blue parka. She\u2019s wearing a green-and-beige striped scarf, probably hand-knitted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start to feel dizzy and I\u2019m sweating harder now. What is this? The flu? This has to be what hallucinating feels like. What is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try to compose myself and squeeze my eyes shut again. There\u2019s someone else on the car but I don\u2019t want to see him. He\u2019s young... and there\u2019s something wrong with him. I start to panic and just as I begin to lose my focus again-- &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRachel? Oh, Raaachel?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was\u2026 that the driver? I open my eyes and see the passengers I\u2019ve just described, all seemingly in their own worlds, waiting for the car to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRaaaachel?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is this creepy weirdo singing my name? What is going on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart is pounding and I feel as though I\u2019m about to pass out, but I dig my fingers into my thighs and take another deep, slow breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I make myself turn my head slowly toward the back of the car. That other person in the train car with us--he\u2019s young. There\u2019s something weird about him. I can see now that he looks like he\u2019s coming down hard from a high, but there\u2019s something else about him that I can\u2019t place. I\u2019m afraid of him, but I just don\u2019t know why. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh Raaachellll??? Is this thing on?\u201d The voice laughs, taunting me. \u201cOh, I know it is!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one else seems to notice the sounds coming from the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take off my parka and stand up. It\u2019s mid-January, but it\u2019s just so hot on this train and my throat feels like it\u2019s tightening up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy with the newspaper looks at me, and I glare back. I\u2019m trying to stay alert, but I\u2019m starting to sway. This dude can fuck right off with his stare because I need to concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start pacing around my section of the car. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRachel? Tsk, tsk. You know you shouldn\u2019t ignore me!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWHAT?!\u201d I finally scream toward the speakers as if the voice can hear me. Everyone is staring at me now, but I don\u2019t care. \u201cWHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT?!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAh, now I have your attention! Think about where you are. Where are you Rachel?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pace more frantically, making eye contact with the newspaper guy again, daring him with my expression to say a single word to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I yell to the voice, \u201cI\u2019m on a fucking train!\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGood, Rachel,\u201d he responds, sounding pleased. \u201cBut where are you really? Think. Think.\u201d He laughs again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m feeling nauseated, so I sit down and grab my thighs again, squeezing so hard my knuckles turn white. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get another flash of something. It\u2019s quick at first. It\u2019s the newspaper guy, but he\u2019s facing away from me, walking. I see him drop. It\u2019s almost comical--one second he\u2019s upright and then he\u2019s just not. And then I see the woman, and she drops, too. And I know something is wrong. I see\u2026 red. I see blood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start to gasp harder for air, and I feel like I\u2019m going to throw up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my mind\u2019s eye, I see a flash of the teenager and he seems upset.  He\u2019s arguing someone on his headset. Or wait, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s wearing a headset. I guess he\u2019s arguing with himself?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like the train car is starting to spin around me, but I force myself to keep remembering as the sweat from my forehead trickles into my eyes, making them burn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can feel him grabbing me. I can\u2019t move my arms. He\u2019s too strong. I see something metal. I feel it cold against my chin. It\u2019s--it\u2019s a gun. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh my god. No, this can\u2019t be real. These can\u2019t be memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if reading my thoughts, the driver chimes in again, this time sounding more serious. \u201cRachel, it\u2019s real. It\u2019s all real. You just need to figure it out. You\u2019re almost there. Look around you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t think. I look around for something. Anything. A clue. I scan advertisements and route maps, graffiti and gum wrappers. Finally, I see see it--an emergency alert button. I use what strength I have left to stand up so I can push it to contact the T authorities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The train jerks and I nearly fall, but I catch myself--just barely. I take another step and the train jerks again, and this time I stumble to my knees. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use a metal grab bar to pull myself up. I&amp;#39;m there now. I can reach it! I have reached it! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The train jerks violently again and I lose my footing, banging my head hard against the bar...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next:   &lt;a href=\"https://redd.it/65jrle\"&gt;Part 3 - Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Previous: [Part 1](https://redd.it/6567hn) \n\n\n\nSomething feels weirdly familiar about all of this.
