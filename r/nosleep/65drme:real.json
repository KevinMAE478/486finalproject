I was excited to see her more often, but apart from helping her moving in and one brunch together on a Sunday about a month ago, we barely saw each other. Not that I&amp;#39;m blaming her. I know how demanding her job is and I&amp;#39;m aware she&amp;#39;d rather be drinking beers with me on friday evenings than work until 10pm, but when you&amp;#39;re young and ambitious, you&amp;#39;ve got to make sacrifices. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after 3 months of cancelled dinner plans, we finally managed to schedule a dinner tonight! I&amp;#39;m taking her to one of my favorite restaurants in London, a real italian trattoria (ie no \u00ab\u00a0Alfredo\u00a0\u00bb pasta nonsense on the menu and no garlic bread as a side- that&amp;#39;s rare in London). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed immediately that she seems absolutely exhausted. Her new job was definitely taking a toll on her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been talking about everything and anything for a solid hour, when she whispers\u00a0:&lt;br/&gt;\n\u00ab-\u00a0Alexander, I have something I&amp;#39;d like to tell you about.&lt;br/&gt;\n-Sure, go ahead\u00a0!&lt;br/&gt;\n-It&amp;#39;s going to sound weird, but I know I can trust you... I swear I&amp;#39;m not going crazy, I&amp;#39;m not sleep deprived - I&amp;#39;m not having a burn-out, or anything like that\u00a0!&lt;br/&gt;\n-What&amp;#39;s going on\u00a0? You&amp;#39;re getting me worried here\u00a0!&lt;br/&gt;\n-You have to believe me. All this... It&amp;#39;s not...\u00a0\u00bb \u00a0She whispers\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0It&amp;#39;s not real.\u00a0\u00bb&lt;br/&gt;\n-\u00ab\u00a0What&amp;#39;s not real\u00a0?\u00a0\u00bb&lt;br/&gt;\nBut she doesn&amp;#39;t answer. She&amp;#39;s looking at me, looking absolutely terrified. For a second, I don&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;br/&gt;\nBut then I notice the silence.&lt;br/&gt;\nA second before, the restaurant was filled with sounds of conversation, laughter, cutlery...&lt;br/&gt;\nNow there isn&amp;#39;t a single sound.&lt;br/&gt;\nI look around, and what I see chill me to the bone.&lt;br/&gt;\nEveryone is staring at us.&lt;br/&gt;\nEveryone.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe couples eating their pasta, the family with their four kids, the group of friends sharing an aperitivo platter and wine, even the waiters... Everyone.&lt;br/&gt;\nStaring at us, not saying a word, just staring blankly at us, unmoving. Some of them have their mouths full of food, but they&amp;#39;re not chewing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hear Alice say, in a fake joyful voice\u00a0:&lt;br/&gt;\n\u00ab\u00a0Wow, those pasta are really delicious\u00a0!\u00a0\u00bb.&lt;br/&gt;\nConfused at hell, I shoot her a look. Her eyes are pleading.&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;m so scared.&lt;br/&gt;\nTo her obvious relief, I play along \u00ab\u00a0Yes, yes, they sure are...\u00a0\u00bb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the noise resumes. Once again, we are surrounded by happy chatter and everything looks like your normal, average friday night at the restaurant.&lt;br/&gt;\nNo one mentions it. It&amp;#39;s as if it never happened.&lt;br/&gt;\nI can see that Alice is scared, too, but it&amp;#39;s obvious that speaking about it isn&amp;#39;t smart. I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s happening, but it&amp;#39;s not ok.&lt;br/&gt;\nAlice keeps talking about mundane subjects\u00a0: the food, the wine, how she bought a really nice dress online today... I try to keep the conversation going, but my mind is racing and I really struggle to focus. The way they were staring at us... It was unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We quickly finish our dinner, pay and go out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once on the pavement, I start\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0Alice, what...\u00a0\u00bb, but she grabs my hand, squeeze it really hard, and exclaims \u00ab\u00a0What a nice night, isn&amp;#39;t it\u00a0? I love spring in London\u00a0!\u00a0\u00bb. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to be alone tonight. I don&amp;#39;t want Alice to be alone either, but she refuses categorically to come to my place or to let me sleep at hers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m scared shitless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I wake up exhausted. I barely slept. I felt like I was followed the whole journey home, and I still feel watched even in my appartment, even though nothing out of the ordinary happened. I still don&amp;#39;t know what to think of what happened last night.&lt;br/&gt;\nI know I didn&amp;#39;t hallucinate, because Alice definitely saw it.&lt;br/&gt;\nI tried texting her, but she keeps answering as if we were having a totally different conversation. It&amp;#39;s unnerving.&lt;br/&gt;\n-&lt;em&gt;Alice are you ok\u00a0? What the hell was that\u00a0?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n-&lt;em&gt;Yeah I got home safe, thanks for chekcing up on me\u00a0!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n-&lt;em&gt;Alice what&amp;#39;s happening\u00a0? Should I call the police\u00a0?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n-&lt;em&gt;It was lovely to see you tonight\u00a0! We should definitely go out more\u00a0!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n-&lt;em&gt;Is there any way we can talk\u00a0? Please\u00a0? I&amp;#39;m worried out of my mind\u00a0! Are you in danger\u00a0?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n-&lt;em&gt;Going to sleep now\u00a0! Talk to you soon\u00a0!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something is very wrong. I don&amp;#39;t know what she got herself into, but I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;s safe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was making myself some coffee, in hope that it would help me wake up, when I got a phone call from Alice.&lt;br/&gt;\nI grab my phone and answer immediately, and all I hear is her screams.&lt;br/&gt;\nI start yelling into the phone\u00a0:&lt;br/&gt;\n\u00ab\u00a0ALICE\u00a0!!! ALICE WHAT&amp;#39;S GOING ON\u00a0?? WHERE ARE YOU\u00a0?\u00a0\u00bb \n More screams.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u00ab\u00a0ALICE PLEASE SAY SOMETHING\u00a0!\u00a0\u00bb&lt;br/&gt;\nThere&amp;#39;s a sudden silence.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u00ab\u00a0ALICE\u00a0! ALICE\u00a0!\u00a0\u00bb&lt;br/&gt;\nWhen she finally talks, it&amp;#39;s a whisper.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u00ab It&amp;#39;s all fake, Alexander. Everything.

She&amp;#39;s being hurt\u00a0! Or kidnapped\u00a0! I don&amp;#39;t know, she was screaming, I don&amp;#39;t know where she...&lt;br/&gt;\n-Have a nice day, Alexander.\u00a0\u00bb Beep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What.. What\u00a0?&lt;br/&gt;\nI call the police again, but there&amp;#39;s only static.&lt;br/&gt;\nSomething is wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did Alice discover something about the government\u00a0? The MI-5\u00a0?! Her firm is a huge one, they must be involved in some sketchy legal stuff. Maybe she learned something she shouldn&amp;#39;t and they&amp;#39;re trying to shut her up\u00a0? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to her place now. I have to start somewhere. I have to help her. She&amp;#39;s like family to me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pratically run to the Tube station. I catch a train, sit and try to think about where she could be, if I don&amp;#39;t find her at her flat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I notice the silence.&lt;br/&gt;\nThey&amp;#39;re staring at me. No one is moving. I freeze, and as soon as the doors open, I run out and escape to the surface. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I come out of the station, panting, my heart racing, sweat dripping off my forehead.&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;ve never been that scared in my life. An old lady bumps into me, as I&amp;#39;m standing in the middle of the stairway. \u00ab\u00a0Sorry\u00a0\u00bb, I mutter (I&amp;#39;m British, saying sorry is an automatic reflex for me).&lt;br/&gt;\nShe answers with a sweet smile \u00ab\u00a0No problem, Alexander.\u00a0\u00bb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start running again, bumping into people left and right. I don&amp;#39;t stop, but I hear them all say \u00ab\u00a0Be careful, Alexander\u00a0\u00bb. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to get thirsty, with all that running. I could really do with some fresh drink. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decide to stop at a little caf\u00e9 down the road. I&amp;#39;ve heard they make great smoothies\u00a0! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to decide which one to get (the tropical one sounds really delicious\u00a0: mango, pineapple\u00a0; papaya, and coconut water, and you can even add kale if you want to make it healthier!), when I notice my best friend Alice sitting at the counter\u00a0! \nI&amp;#39;m so happy to see her. It&amp;#39;s been like, a month since I last saw her, what with her busy job and crazy work hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s such a beautiful spring morning here in London\u00a0!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s weird, though, that I got a text from Alice&amp;#39;s number while we were drinking our smoothies together. When I told her, she said someone stole her phone last night on the Tube. The text was short, but it was strange.
