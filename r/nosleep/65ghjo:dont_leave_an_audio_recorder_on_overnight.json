He took the box and said &amp;quot;Thanks Mr.&amp;quot; Hearing that almost made me feel dirty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now at 27, I know I must be an adult because I&amp;#39;m tired all the time. I go to bed tired, I wake up tired, and in that brief blur of confused social awkwardness in-between? I&amp;#39;m spending that day-dreaming about actual dreaming back in bed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to a doctor to see if he could prescribe me something (since apparently self-medicating on adderall like I did in college is discouraged and anyway I couldn&amp;#39;t find a dealer). No I wasn&amp;#39;t depressed. Yes I was getting at least 8 hours a night. No I didn&amp;#39;t have congenital heart failure or explosive herpes (wtf?). So why didn&amp;#39;t I ever have any energy? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doctor said I might have sleep apnea, a condition which obstructs my breathing while sleeping and causes me to wake up multiple times in the night. I didn&amp;#39;t remember waking up, but he said that was common. He wanted me to spend the night in a sleep lab and get a nocturnal polysomnography which measures my heart rate and oxygen levels for detection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screw that.&lt;/em&gt; I may be an adult, but I&amp;#39;m not &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt;. It was hard enough getting everything done while being tired. The last thing I wanted was trying to get some rest in a lab. I opted instead to just leave an audio recorder on overnight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently the periods of obstructed breathing would audibly contrast with the heavy breathing which compensated afterward, thus potentially allowing me to detect the issue. No downside, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used an Android app which is a sound activated audio recorder. I messed around with the calibrations a bit, and finally reached a sensitivity which detected heavy breathing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Giggling&lt;/em&gt;. Like a little girl. That&amp;#39;s what I heard when I played back the audio. I could faintly hear myself breathing in the background. There were three distinct instances during the night where I heard it. I was getting more tired every day though, and this still seemed like an easier solution than going into the lab. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously this was a joke from the app developers. There weren&amp;#39;t many reviews on this one, so I downloaded a new recorder and tried again the following night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t he a precious thing?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shh.
