It started up in August, 1991, when the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory finally turned on its sound surveillance system. From the very first second, the sound was there, odd, eerie, unexplainable. They named it &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Upsweep_20%C3%97.ogg\"&gt;Upsweep&lt;/a&gt; since\u2014when sped up\u2014it sounds like a continuously rising note. And, ever since its initial discovery, it\u2019s been there, sounding up around the same time every year, still as odd and unexplainable as before. Its stayed relatively consistent throughout the years, only diminishing slightly in strength and loudness, still anomalous. Yesterday, though, yesterday this changed. Yesterday the world as we know it changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve worked as a marine geologist for the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) for almost a decade now and I\u2019ve always been wholly fascinated by Upsweep, so much so that I studied it officially as one of my many projects. It baffled me, consumed my imagination, and left me speculating late into the night. Which is why I was awake when I got the call at two in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDr. Pike?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cY-yes,\u201d I breathed, sitting up, turning on the light, then squinting in the sudden brightness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSorry to wake you. Should I call back later?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo\u2026I mean, who is this?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSorry, this is Matt Miller, I work for the Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research\u2014JIMAR\u2014I was told to call you, let you know what\u2019s happening\u2014\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I leaned over and grabbed my glasses, flicking them open and shoving them on my face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUm\u2026well, it\u2019s actually quite &lt;em&gt;exciting&lt;/em&gt; I think. It\u2019s Upsweep.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I froze, my heart pounding in my chest, \u201cUpsweep?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The voice on the other end sounded eager, breathless when it said, \u201cIt\u2019s changing.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left at 2:43AM and got to Santa Barbra twenty minutes later, pulling onto an almost deserted University of California campus. I was told that my project head and some of my colleagues would be meeting me at Webb Hall to discuss the implications of Upsweep\u2019s changes, but when I entered the room, there were only two people inside, one I recognized and one I didn\u2019t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAh, Dr. Pike, I\u2019m the director of Marine Geology here at UCSB\u2014\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDr. Joan Leo, yes, I\u2019ve admired your work for years.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leo smiled, shaking my hand warmly in both of hers before saying, \u201cAnd this is\u2014\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The middle-aged man next to her took a step forward, grasping my hand in his. He was wearing a smooth black suit and looked like he had been awake for days. \u201cCooper.\u201d We shook once, twice, then let go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leo turned to me. \u201cCooper called me early this morning with some, um, &lt;em&gt;concerning&lt;/em&gt; information. Please,\u201d she gestured to one of the padded seats surrounding the conference table and I sat down along with Cooper and Leo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He took out a black folder and pulled out three photographs, sliding them towards me without saying a word. I picked them up, not knowing what to expect, not expecting my mouth to drop and my skin to prickle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat is this?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leo and Cooper looked at each other. \u201cWe were hoping you could help us find out.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first picture was a map of the soundwave fluctuations, and I could clearly see that Upsweep was getting louder, faster. I set it down. The next was a blurry sonar image of something strange, something large. I turned it sideways, then upside down, unable to make it out. The third, and final, picture made me audibly gasp. It was another sonar image, clearer this time. It looked like an entire section of the ocean floor had come unhinged and was rising towards the surface. It was huge. Fascinating. The image was still relatively indistinct, but it looked oblong, cigar-shaped. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is\u2026this is &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cooper nodded gravely. \u201cWe thought so too, until we organized an emergency dive with our fellows at JIMAR. They, um, well, I\u2019ll just let you listen.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He pulled out his phone, placing it on the table, and pressed play. At first, the sound coming from it was barely audible. And then\u2014like a dirge rising up from the grave\u2014I heard it, a deep resounding booming noise unlike anything I\u2019ve ever heard before. It sounded like there was some intelligence to it, like it was trying to speak. Suddenly the sound shifted and it was higher, more recognizable as the sound I had come to know as Upsweep. But it sounded more urgent, and it was quicker, like it was calling out for\u2026something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cooper picked up his phone when the sound stopped, leaving us in an eerie, palpable silence. Beside him, Leo\u2019s eyes were distant, her elbows resting on the table, her fingers steepled. I glanced at both of them, voiceless, stunned, before looking back down at the pictures in front of me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d it was Leo. I looked up at her and she continued, \u201cJIMAR has observed a multitude of marine creatures congregating to that area. Whole pods of whales, schools of fish, hundreds of sharks. They all seem to be swimming the same direction, in a spiral over where that sound and that\u2026&lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;,\u201d she pointed to the photo of the cigar-shaped monstrosity, \u201cwere triangulated in the Pacific.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cleared my throat. \u201cIf I may ask\u2026how did you get all this information,\u201d I was looking directly at Cooper, \u201cDo you work for NOAA, for JIMAR?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m affiliated with them. A liaison if you will. And I was given the data by a colleague at JIMAR, he thought I would be best equipped to, um, handle the situation. But I wasn\u2019t, so I called Joan here, and we were referred to you by the director of NOAA. Here we are.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDr. Pike,\u201d Leo said, neatly stacking the photographs together, \u201cYou\u2019ll be given full access to all the data we collect and all our resources will be at your disposal. We want to help you find out what this thing may be. Even if it\u2019s just a totally natural but never observed occurrence. Here\u2019s my card,\u201d she slid a light blue card towards me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd mine,\u201d the man said, taking a matte black card from his wallet and placing it atop the photographs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, not knowing what else to say. \u201cThis is all so\u2026strange. Horrific really. The implications of what that might be\u2026what it might &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. Earthquakes, tsunamis\u2026\u201d my voice tapered off. \u201cWhere do we go from here?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cooper sighed and shrugged on his jacket, standing up and collecting all the papers. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said resolutely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat about tomorrow?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He looked at me. \u201cTomorrow we go out there, dive, see what it might be. Now, we\u2019ve all got work to do before that. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d He walked towards the door, stopped, and added, \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to get some sleep.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGoodnight, Dr. Pike,\u201d Leo gave me a tight-lipped smile and followed Cooper out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can\u2019t sleep. I can\u2019t stop thinking about what that thing might be, why it has gotten louder, what it all means. It\u2019s been almost exactly twenty-four hours since I found out about Upsweep and the anomaly causing it. I\u2019ve spent the past day collecting and observing the data JIMAR sent us, trying to piece together the puzzle, my mind is reeling. Soon, we\u2019ll be sailing off into the literal unknown. I can\u2019t sleep.
