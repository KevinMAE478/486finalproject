Step-siblings hate each other? Mom\u2019s fucking the gardener?

I\u2019ll tell you how many kids live there, what genders they are, and their ages within a year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I prefer their bedrooms, for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now YOU think that you\u2019d be safe from me, that you\u2019d be able to spot my kind from a mile away. You wouldn\u2019t, for a couple of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, I look like a nice guy. Yes, I know you think that it wouldn\u2019t fool you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think of how many plumbers have been inside your home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can\u2019t remember, can you? And you surely don\u2019t remember what most, if any, of them looked like. Even if they were a little fat or odd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t you see how easy it is for a generic \u2018nice guy\u2019 to slip right past?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when your child goes missing, you would remember! Of course! A stranger was in my house this week!

If I know phone numbers and travel plans, I can keep tabs. Swiping the house keys is comically simple; I can make copies in an hour, and most of the time you don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re missing. On the occasion that it\u2019s noticed, you just think you misplaced them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s why I always leave them inside the deadbolt. You\u2019ll just think you forgot them there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With everything in place, I can easily monitor up to thirty homes at once. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And every so often, the stars align. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going on a trip and leaving the kids with an ex? Heading out and putting an idiot babysitter in charge? Had a party and drank a little too much?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No big deal on their own. But mix that shit with a domestic dispute, and you\u2019ve got gold. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kids are always the most important part, though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it all comes together if it\u2019s a kid who loves a clown. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve walked right into a house at night, taken a child by the hand, and walked out the front door not three minutes later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dad ended up in jail.
