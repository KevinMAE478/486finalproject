For the third time. Obviously this pissed me the hell off and I\u2019d had enough so I called the agency itself and demanded to have an urgent meeting with anyone who could give me information on the child I was fostering, since they hadn\u2019t given me any to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I know, I probably should of called earlier, or I should of been suspicious when Ellie came to us with basically no back ground information. But I give people chances, I know people are busy and have shit so thats what I assumed with the case worker but damn canceling 3 times? Thats ridiculous. Abel came to us with no other background information than that his mom was in prison and was literally the biggest scum on the earth. Kids background aren&amp;#39;t always easily accessible for a multitude of reasons so we didnt think much of it, we just were happy to have her here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That feeling of happiness has changed tho.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because guys, last night was the most horrifying night of my life. Lets start with the beginning of the day. The caseworker stood me up again so I called the agency and was a huge asshole and demanded to meet someone today and after a few threats (as a aggressively well tempered relaxed person, this was new for me and felt kinda good to stand up for myself for once) I was able to get an appointment around 1 pm. I picked up Cadie from work and together we went to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The womans office we met was dull, messy, and kind of depressing. Grey walls, empty. No plants, no picture frames, not exactly the place you would want to be discussing children. The lady sitting in front of us wore an overly fake smile and would only direct her conversation towards Cadie, something we noticed immediately. The fake gold name plate told us her name was Lisa Simpson, because she didnt even introduce herself and just jumped right into the fake nice persona she was wearing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess me being a dick on the phone had been the office talk of the day resulting in this cold shoulder towards me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa: So Cadie, tell me dear, whats the childs name again? Full birth name please. I\u2019ll pull up any information on her that we have. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: It\u2019s Eloise Fitzpatrick&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa: &lt;em&gt;staring blankly at Cadie, waiting her response&lt;/em&gt; (even though I just fucking answered)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadie: What Jack just said, Eloise Fitzpatrick. Age 8 if that helps anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa: Mhm\u2026 &lt;em&gt;starts typing on keyboard&lt;/em&gt; let me just search for that\u2026 &lt;em&gt;pauses after a few minutes&lt;/em&gt; Oh?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sudden change in her upbeat tone brought confusion over us both, what did she mean by \u201coh?\u201d It\u2019s not that I liked her obviously fake attitude, but hell I dont like how that \u201coh\u201d sounded!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa: It seems that there is an error with the online database &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadie: What do you mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa got up quickly and started rummaging through files and desk drawers, not answering Cadie or I as we asked what was going on. Looking frustrated she exited the room saying she would be back with her file in a moment. That moment turned into almost 25 minutes and to the point where I was about to get up and find out what was going on for myself, but right as I was about to get up she returned empty handed and took a seat behind the desk again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked nervous, almost shaking which I couldn&amp;#39;t understand why. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa: It seems that a file on Eloise Fitzpatrick does not exist&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: So you lost the file? Are you serious! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadie: Look whatever it is just show us her file. Is it at another agency by accident? We\u2019ve had a few caseworkers maybe it got passed around someho-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa: The file was never lost because there was never a file to begin with. The child is not in the foster care system at all and from the looks of it she never was&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadie and I exchanged a look that can only be described as someone shouting \u201cWHAT THE FUCK?\u201d. Ellie is not in the foster care system? How the hell is that even possible, she was brought to us a foster child with a case worker! There was paper work, all the normal things you have to do when fostering a child! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I\u2019m sorry but I cant understand this. She\u2019s not in the system? The system that brought her to us in the first place? How is that even possible! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa: What did you say your case workers name was again?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadie: Angelica Rorro&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lisa: &lt;em&gt;went back to typing on her computer and took a deep sigh&lt;/em&gt; I\u2019m sorry but there is no Angelica Rorro employed here&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was that. There was nothing else Lisa or the agency could do for us since our case worker wasn\u2019t a member of their company and they asked us to leave. No questions were answered, nothing. We left with more confusion than we came with and a lot more questions. There was never a reason to suspect anything about the Angelica. Ever. The fostering process was exactly the same as it\u2019s always been! My mind wandered to a million places but it kept coming back to one scary thought. That someone had sent this child to us for a reason, and that reason was most defiantly a sinister one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could no longer allow my wife and son to be in the same house as Ellie. Cadie fully believed me now about the incident and felt horrible for even doubting me. I don\u2019t blame her though, not at all. She wanted to see the best in Ellie. She\u2019s a good person, I can\u2019t be mad at her for being a good person. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought two plane tickets to Perth for Abel and Cadie since her work approved her immediate leave, claiming she had a family crisis in Perth she had to deal with. Not a lie, there was a family crisis going on, just not in Perth. Cadie wanted to stay at least until the next day, but I didnt want to put Abel to bed in the house another night, especially knowing that Ellie has been coming into his room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of things started to add up that I had never thought about before. Like how Abel had never been afraid of the dark until Ellie was brought to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014\u2014\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadie and Abel left around 4 pm, taking a cab to the airport. As much as it hurt to have them leave so abruptly I knew it was for the best. Abel didnt understand fully why he was leaving but damn if he wasn&amp;#39;t excited to go see all of his grandparents! Both Cadie and I are children of divorce, so we had 6 grandparents waiting for Abel whom all loved him more than anything in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was left to pick up Ellie from after school day care at 6, which is the time I am done with work. I work from home. Part stay at home dad and part business manager for the law firm I used to work for in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in a Skype business meeting with 4 other people in our firm when my phone started ringing. I didn\u2019t recognize the number so I ignored it, trying not to get fired from my job. Strict no phone policy here. A few minutes later the number called again, sending my phone ringing. Again, I ignored it and shoved it into my pocket. Our boss looked a little annoyed but ignored it and carried on. Not even a minute later the phone blared again&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boss: Wagner just take the damn phone call&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He seemed annoyed, but my boss is a friend of mine who happens to be my boss, so he would live. I pressed mute on the conference call and answered the phone&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unknown woman: Jack Wagner?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Yeah this is him, who&amp;#39;s calling?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unknown woman: Jack this is Sherri Thorwtan. I\u2019m one of the staff members at Delia Day care. We need you to come down immediately, there has been an horrible incident with one of the children and Ellie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: You\u2019re kidding, what happened? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sherri: An occurrence took place on the playground. An ambulance has just left and its taking the child to the hospital. I was told that she\u2019s in critical condition. Please get here as soon as you can.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sherri hung up without saying anything else. Fuck! Ellie had harmed another kid, Is that what she was saying? I thought it was a little odd that the number wasn\u2019t the same as the number I had saved for the day care, but just assumed that because of all the chaos that was probably going on she had used her cell to call me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I unmuted the conference call and explained that I had to leave, and quickly made my way to the day care. The drive was a quick one, and before I knew it I was running up the steps to the big house. Right when I stepped in I knew something was off. There was no chaos, no crying, no upset parents screaming in my face. Nothing except what I new to be normal here. I\u2019ve only ever picked the kids up once before (Cadie likes to get them) so I really didnt know how this place worked, but it looked like what I expected a day care too. Kids running around playing with airplanes, reading books, doing homework, and a happy Miss Maggie Baker (who runs the place) watching over them all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maggie: Jack you&amp;#39;re early! Here to get Ellie already?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I was just called to come get her, that there was an accident involving Ellie\u2026 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could hear the pure confusion in my voice. I had just been told that a kid was being rushed to the damn hospital! Maggie looked at me as confused as I looked at her, then let out a laugh&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maggie: Nope, everything has been lovely here today Jack. Ellie is out back playing on the playground with all the older kids. She&amp;#39;s been a doll all day. Finished her homework for the week!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked over to the back window and looked outside. It was a spacious yard with a big playground set, a garden, swing, sandbox and lots of toys. A childs paradise really. Sure enough, there was Ellie running around playing tag with a few other girls, a big ole smile on her pretty face. There were no tears, no yelling, no pain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I\u2019m sorry Maggie I guess I misunderstood, its just that Sherrie called me saying-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maggie: Sherrie who?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Sherrie Thorwtan, thats what she said her name was. She said she was a staff member here&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maggie: I\u2019m the only one who runs this place. Other than my kids who help out its just us, no staff members&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t even have a chance to reply, not that there would of been anything I could have said. Nothing about this situation made sense. I got a phone call from a woman who didnt work here about a incident that didnt happen. I felt almost bad for believing that Ellie had hurt another kid, but that guilt went away just as quick as it came, because just as Maggie opened the sliding glass door to go into the yard something horrible happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were walking down the steps when we heard a scream followed by the most disturbing cracking noise I\u2019ve ever heard. Think of every time you cracked your neck and amplify that by a million and turn the volume up to max. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bunch of tiny voices started to scream and the kids ran to the back of the yard, forming a circle around the trunk of a giant oak tree that was against the fence. Maggie and I ran over and what we saw made me almost cry. Maggie shouted for an older child to call a medic and get help and started screaming at the other kids to go away.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didnt need to see this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maggie screamed, falling to her knees weeping the name of the child who laid still on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laying before us was a girl in a mangled mess. Her neck was almost completely to the left side, snapped. Dark crimson blood poured out of her mouth by the pint it seemed, eyes rolled back in her head. Her tiny body had twisted in ways I never knew limbs could ever be turned. Her chest was still. This child was dead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSam just wanted to see the birds\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maggie and I both jumped from the voice coming from above us. I looked up, already knowing what I was going to see. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There she sat, like she was sitting on the edge of a dock. Hands folded neatly in her lap, ankles crossed. Her face had no expression, but her eyes glistened a shiny bright blue I hadn\u2019t noticed before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Ellie get the hell down here right now!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She climbed down so gracefully, and jumped over the childs body and walked over to the fence and faced us. I walked over to her and kneel down, grabbing her tiny little arms in mine and shaking her gently&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Ellie what happened to Sam? For Gods sake why were you in a tree! Tell me right now&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie: Sam wanted to see the birds in the nest but they were all gone. She got sad and fell&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Dont give that crap Ellie! Tell me what really happened &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie: SHE WANTED TO SEE THE BIRDS! SHE WANTED TO SEE THE BIRDS! SHE WANTED TO SEE THE BIRDS!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She kept shouting the same sentence over and over, her face turning red but her expression never changed except for the faint smile that formed on her lips. I backed away, I\u2019d never felt shock like that before. To be honestly scared of someone like that. Prior to this I was freaked out by Ellie but this was down right horrifying. A child was dead and Ellie was shouting like a maniac at me while smiling &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She kept shouting for almost a minute before stopping. Her eyes locked with mine and she smiled wide, putting a finger to her lips and whispered \u201cshe deserved it\u201d before her eyes rolled back in her head and fainted just as the ambulance arrived. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014\u2014\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day went by in a flash. The medics came and confirmed that Sam was dead. Her body was taken away and everyone said it was a tragic accident- but an accident. That she slipped and fell, and the blame fell on Maggie. That she was being irresponsible and that it was her fault for not watching them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Parents came one by one to get their kids, some were just sad about what happened, but some were screaming that they would never be bringing their child back here. That Maggie was irresponsible and a harm to the children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stayed until the last child was gone for a few reasons. One, I didn\u2019t want to leave Maggie alone to face these parents. She was a wreck and needed someone, even someone who was basically a stranger. Also, I didn\u2019t want to go home with Ellie where we would be alone. She cut Abel, she pushed someone who was her friend out of a tree, god knows what she would do to me! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the kids were gone Ellie and I returned home. Not a word was said the entire car ride home. It\u2019s currently night and she&amp;#39;s watching a movie in the living room. I\u2019ve stayed in the kitchen where I can keep an eye on her the entire time. She&amp;#39;s not leaving my sight until she goes to bed, and I\u2019m locking myself in my bedroom right after. I would consider locking her in her room but there are too many danger possibilities of that and I cant risk it. Even if she is evil.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cadie has been traveling all day so I\u2019ve yet to tell her what happened, but she should be able to talk on the phone soon. I\u2019m at a loss here guys, I really am. I feel like my will and who I am is being broken down. Something is going on with Ellie, she was brought to us on purpose and I feel that purpose was to ruin our family. The caseworker and whoever the hell Sherrie is has to be a part of it. For fucks sake she knew an accident was going to happen before it even did! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is all just too much for me to deal with. I\u2019m trying to be strong but It\u2019s hard. Thats all I have for now, i\u2019ll let you guys know more tomorrow about how tonight goes. Im going to pick up some nanny cams from shop tomorrow and set them up around the house as some of you suggested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also thank you to all the support I\u2019ve been getting for this, you dont know how much it helps. Feeling like you&amp;#39;re going insane is numbing, and just having a message \u201cbest wishes\u201d helps more than you would know. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64lio5/i_think_there_is_something_wrong_with_our_foster/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit\n\npart 2: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64v9q5/i_think_there_is_something_wrong_with_our_foster/\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\nSo yesterday a few\u2026 interesting\u2026 things happened.\n\n\nThe caseworker canceled again.

I\u2019ve only ever picked the kids up once before (Cadie likes to get them) so I really didnt know how this place worked, but it looked like what I expected a day care too. Kids running around playing with airplanes, reading books, doing homework, and a happy Miss Maggie Baker (who runs the place) watching over them all. \n\n\nMaggie: Jack you're early! Here to get Ellie already?\n\n\nMe: I was just called to come get her, that there was an accident involving Ellie\u2026 \n\n\nYou could hear the pure confusion in my voice. I had just been told that a kid was being rushed to the damn hospital! Maggie looked at me as confused as I looked at her, then let out a laugh\n\n\nMaggie: Nope, everything has been lovely here today Jack. Ellie is out back playing on the playground with all the older kids. She's been a doll all day. Finished her homework for the week!\n\n\nI walked over to the back window and looked outside. It was a spacious yard with a big playground set, a garden, swing, sandbox and lots of toys. A childs paradise really. Sure enough, there was Ellie running around playing tag with a few other girls, a big ole smile on her pretty face. There were no tears, no yelling, no pain. \n\n\nMe: I\u2019m sorry Maggie I guess I misunderstood, its just that Sherrie called me saying-\n\n\nMaggie: Sherrie who?\n\n\nMe: Sherrie Thorwtan, thats what she said her name was. She said she was a staff member here\n\n\nMaggie: I\u2019m the only one who runs this place. Other than my kids who help out its just us, no staff members\n\n\nI didn\u2019t even have a chance to reply, not that there would of been anything I could have said. Nothing about this situation made sense. I got a phone call from a woman who didnt work here about a incident that didnt happen. I felt almost bad for believing that Ellie had hurt another kid, but that guilt went away just as quick as it came, because just as Maggie opened the sliding glass door to go into the yard something horrible happened. \n\n\nWe were walking down the steps when we heard a scream followed by the most disturbing cracking noise I\u2019ve ever heard. Think of every time you cracked your neck and amplify that by a million and turn the volume up to max. \n\n\nA bunch of tiny voices started to scream and the kids ran to the back of the yard, forming a circle around the trunk of a giant oak tree that was against the fence. Maggie and I ran over and what we saw made me almost cry. Maggie shouted for an older child to call a medic and get help and started screaming at the other kids to go away.  \n\n\nThey didnt need to see this.\n\n\nMaggie screamed, falling to her knees weeping the name of the child who laid still on the ground. \n\n\nLaying before us was a girl in a mangled mess. Her neck was almost completely to the left side, snapped. Dark crimson blood poured out of her mouth by the pint it seemed, eyes rolled back in her head. Her tiny body had twisted in ways I never knew limbs could ever be turned. Her chest was still. This child was dead. \n\n\n\u201cSam just wanted to see the birds\u201d \n\n\nMaggie and I both jumped from the voice coming from above us. I looked up, already knowing what I was going to see. \n\n\nThere she sat, like she was sitting on the edge of a dock. Hands folded neatly in her lap, ankles crossed. Her face had no expression, but her eyes glistened a shiny bright blue I hadn\u2019t noticed before. \n\n\nMe: Ellie get the hell down here right now!\n\n\nShe climbed down so gracefully, and jumped over the childs body and walked over to the fence and faced us. I walked over to her and kneel down, grabbing her tiny little arms in mine and shaking her gently\n\n\nMe: Ellie what happened to Sam? For Gods sake why were you in a tree! Tell me right now\n\n\nEllie: Sam wanted to see the birds in the nest but they were all gone. She got sad and fell\n\n\nMe: Dont give that crap Ellie! Tell me what really happened \n\n\nEllie: SHE WANTED TO SEE THE BIRDS! SHE WANTED TO SEE THE BIRDS! SHE WANTED TO SEE THE BIRDS!\n\n\nShe kept shouting the same sentence over and over, her face turning red but her expression never changed except for the faint smile that formed on her lips. I backed away, I\u2019d never felt shock like that before. To be honestly scared of someone like that. Prior to this I was freaked out by Ellie but this was down right horrifying. A child was dead and Ellie was shouting like a maniac at me while smiling \n\n\nShe kept shouting for almost a minute before stopping. Her eyes locked with mine and she smiled wide, putting a finger to her lips and whispered \u201cshe deserved it\u201d before her eyes rolled back in her head and fainted just as the ambulance arrived. \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nThe rest of the day went by in a flash. The medics came and confirmed that Sam was dead. Her body was taken away and everyone said it was a tragic accident- but an accident. That she slipped and fell, and the blame fell on Maggie. That she was being irresponsible and that it was her fault for not watching them.\n\n\nParents came one by one to get their kids, some were just sad about what happened, but some were screaming that they would never be bringing their child back here. That Maggie was irresponsible and a harm to the children.\n\n\nI stayed until the last child was gone for a few reasons. One, I didn\u2019t want to leave Maggie alone to face these parents. She was a wreck and needed someone, even someone who was basically a stranger. Also, I didn\u2019t want to go home with Ellie where we would be alone. She cut Abel, she pushed someone who was her friend out of a tree, god knows what she would do to me! \n\n\nOnce the kids were gone Ellie and I returned home. Not a word was said the entire car ride home. It\u2019s currently night and she's watching a movie in the living room. I\u2019ve stayed in the kitchen where I can keep an eye on her the entire time. She's not leaving my sight until she goes to bed, and I\u2019m locking myself in my bedroom right after. I would consider locking her in her room but there are too many danger possibilities of that and I cant risk it. Even if she is evil.  \n\n\nCadie has been traveling all day so I\u2019ve yet to tell her what happened, but she should be able to talk on the phone soon. I\u2019m at a loss here guys, I really am. I feel like my will and who I am is being broken down. Something is going on with Ellie, she was brought to us on purpose and I feel that purpose was to ruin our family. The caseworker and whoever the hell Sherrie is has to be a part of it. For fucks sake she knew an accident was going to happen before it even did! \n\n\nThis is all just too much for me to deal with. I\u2019m trying to be strong but It\u2019s hard. Thats all I have for now, i\u2019ll let you guys know more tomorrow about how tonight goes. Im going to pick up some nanny cams from shop tomorrow and set them up around the house as some of you suggested.\n\n\nAlso thank you to all the support I\u2019ve been getting for this, you dont know how much it helps. Feeling like you're going insane is numbing, and just having a message \u201cbest wishes\u201d helps more than you would know. \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Series", "id": "652wua", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 198, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ex202", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_652wua", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.nosleep", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "flair-series", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/652wua/i_think_there_is_something_wrong_with_our_foster/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492080673.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/652wua/i_think_there_is_something_wrong_with_our_foster/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "I think there is something wrong with our foster child PART 3", "created_utc": 1492051873.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 49, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 198}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652wua", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg715zo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NoSleepAutoBot", "parent_id": "t3_652wua", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It looks like there may be more to this story.
