When my situation was still simple, and I could wrap my head around the idea that I was just some crazy guy who imagined his whole family. I know that\u2019s not the case now. I know what I need to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t do much after posting my last update. I just drove to a nearby McDonald&amp;#39;s and ordered some food, then sat there until they kicked me out. I was there for a few hours, doing nothing but trying to lose myself in some video games I had on my computer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was about noon when I was finally kicked out. I decided I had to go to the police. There was a murder involved now. I didn\u2019t care if they locked me up in some asylum, feeding me pills until my eventual death. I just wanted this to be over with, and the awful person behind this to be caught.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled into the parking lot just outside of the police station when my computer gave the same notification ding from earlier. \u201cScrew it.\u201d I thought \u201cWhy not entertain this one last message?\u201d I wish I hadn\u2019t. I opened up my computer and my heart sank. The picture was from an alleyway, most of the shot was blocked by a rifle equipped with a scope. The rifle was pointing at my car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A second message appeared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DO NOT GO IN THERE UNLESS YOU WANT A JANITOR PICKING YOUR SKULL OUT OF THE CARPET.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I froze. I started to look around and noticed an alley across the street. A shadow was casted along the alleyway, so I couldn\u2019t see whoever 000000000 was. I clicked my seatbelt back in and then sped off down the street. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does this guy want with me? What role does he play in this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was just driving around trying to compose my thoughts, when I started getting a stream of notifications on my laptop. I pulled into a Starbucks parking lot, and decided to respond to the messages in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him what he wanted. I didn\u2019t want to piss him off, so I wanted to make sure that our conversation would be brief and strictly informative. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He responded with a \u201cYou know why.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started thinking back to everyone I had wronged in life. There were a few people I could imagine wanting to give me a solid punch in the gut, but nothing that would cause any reasonable human to go to this extent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told him that I really didn\u2019t know what was going on. All he told me was that I\u2019d be receiving a call over Facebook Messenger explaining everything. I threw what was left of my coffee away, and walked out to my car and awaited the call. It was a call I won\u2019t ever forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I received an audio call from 000000001 and answered. It was a woman\u2019s voice who began talking. She didn\u2019t say hello, or any pleasantries for that matter. She went immediately into explanation. She told me that I would be emailed a photo of a man and his family, and then proceeded to outline something that made my heart sank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was going to have to kill this man\u2019s family if I ever wanted to see mine again. He was given a similar task and must kill mine. It was a murderous race.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked what would happen if I told her to fuck off, and she said that my family would be dead. She ended the call with the ominous \u201cYou better find them\u201d before hanging up. A sense of dread washed over me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a notification bubble form over my email app. I opened it and saw a bald man with his face blurred out, a man who I assume was 00000000. He had a muscular arm around a beautiful asian woman, boasting her toned body in a two-piece bikini. In front of the couple, were two adorable, smiling little girls who looked to be the same age as my own children. Above the image were the words: \u201cFirst his family, then him. Kill him first, and your family dies.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt vomit gushing up towards my mouth. I stared at the family. Happy, smiling. I can\u2019t kill these people, but what choice do I have?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My state has loose gun laws, so purchasing a .22 hunting rifle was not hard. I couldn\u2019t believe I was doing this. I had no choice. It was this man\u2019s family, or mine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I had finished all my errands it was 11:30PM. I pulled into a rest stop nearby, and fell asleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I awoke, I had received 3 new emails. They were addresses. Above them were the names (I\u2019m assuming) of the innocent family that I was about to break apart. Michelle, Isabelle, and Jasmine. I stared at those names for a while. They were such pretty names.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned my car on, and started making my way to Michelle. I tried not to think about what I was doing. I couldn\u2019t shake the image of that family out of my head. They looked so happy together. Their intertwined shadows were extended across the beach by the setting sun behind them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a torturous 5 minute drive, I arrived at what looked like a 5-star hotel. The rooms on the top floor had balconies for those who wanted to soak in the city scape. Just then, I noticed a sliding door open, and a woman stepped out onto one. It was her. The mother I was about to kill. She sat down onto a fabric-draped chair and began taking selfies with her phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled my car into a construction site just across her balcony. It was dark and empty, the construction workers must have the day off. I pulled the hunting rifle out of the trunk of my car and placed her in the crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed every feature about her in that scope. Her well-kept eyebrows, her cute smile and perfectly white teeth. I noticed how one corner of her mouth pulls back just a little bit farther from the other when she smiles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed how she raises her eyebrows at the sound of a distant gunshot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65wn2h/my_wife_and_kids_never_existed_part_five/\"&gt;Read Part 5 Here!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Read Part 1 Here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/63hyrq/my_wife_and_kids_never_existed/)\n\n[Read Part 2 Here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/641qml/my_wife_and_kids_never_existed_part_two/)\n\n[Read Part 3 Here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64yl8w/my_wife_and_kids_never_existed_part_3/)\n\nSometimes I\u2019ll go back and read my first post, and wish I was back there.
