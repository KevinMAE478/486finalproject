He\u2019s wearing a blue coat. The woman mid-way down the car, bundled in an ugly scarf she probably made herself, is glued to her iPad. There\u2019s a teenager at the end of the car  looking as annoyed as I feel, hands stuffed in his jacket pockets and eyes darting around like he\u2019s jonesing for something. And here I am, twiddling my thumbs, waiting, growing impatient, with no one to complain to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The driver starts talking again in his rehearsed and far-too-cheery way:\n\u201cWe apologize for the delay due to police action at Harvard Square.

It.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I swear I\u2019ve heard this guy say this same exact phrase at least 30 times by now, and my agitation is growing. I feel restless in my seat and get up to walk around, but I sit as soon as the coughing guy with the paper looks up at me. I search my bag for a bottle of water, but as I already know, I don\u2019t have one on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m starting to sweat, so I finally take off my parka even though it\u2019s the middle of January. It\u2019s below freezing outside, but it never fails--once you board the T, you\u2019re doomed to either freezing, sweating, or being exposed to some unidentifiable smell. Sometimes you get the smell and the terrible excuse for climate control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m frustrated. If I can get a signal, I really need to call Klein, Ericson, and Smith and tell the receptionist why I\u2019m late. It\u2019s just for a gig as a legal assistant and the pay is next to nothing, but I seriously need cash if I\u2019m going to ever enroll in law school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look at my phone, hoping for at least one merciful bar, and thank God--I see it! I dial the law firm and\u2026 Nothing. No ringing tone, just dead silence. Great. Perfect. Maybe Mercury is in retrograde or something because today just sucks. I check Safari, and when Reddit loads I known I can get online at least. I go to my email and type out a quick and polite \u201cMy sincerest apologies, but I\u2019m stuck on the fucking train\u201d email to Mr. Smith. Only, with less profanity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I\u2019ve scanned the email ten times for typos, I hit send and\u2026 of course\u2026 Nothing. The message just hangs out in my outbox. My chances at this job are screwed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe apologize for the delay due to police action at Harvard Square. We should be moving momentarily.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I groan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The speaker cracks to life again, and I hold my breath, hoping that we might actually make it to the next station sometime, oh, I don\u2019t know--today?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe apologize for the delay due to police action at Harvard Square.

What is going on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRachel? Rachel?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look around the car, but no one seems to notice what the driver is saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRachel? I know you can hear me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I speak up, a little embarrassed to be the person on the train talking to a disembodied voice.  \u201cY--yes?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDo you know where you are, Rachel?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I respond: \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 on the train.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRachel? Rachel?\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d I start to feel dizzy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The driver starts laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sings my name like he\u2019s taunting me:  \u201cRachel? Rachel? Do you know where you are?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything around me starts spinning. I\u2019m sweating harder now and I can\u2019t see straight. I hear him sing my name again--\u201dRachel, Rachel, silly little Rachel\u201d--and I black out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I come to, the train is moving again. The man near me still has his nose in his paper and the woman is probably in her 100th round of Candy Crush by now. The teenager is the only other person seemingly feeling anything about this trip, but he clearly needs a fix and I am not going to risk getting knifed by starting up a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must be coming down with the flu or something. The sweat on my clothes is making me shiver now, so I put my parka back on and wait for us to reach the next station.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The driver chimes in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNow entering Harvard Square. Doors will open on your right.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank. God.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grab my bag and get up to leave the train. My interview is downtown, but I\u2019d rather take my chances with an Uber at this point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I leave the train, the teenager who was on board with me shoves past me and darts toward the exit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few yards, he turns around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s talking to himself and pacing. I move to hurry past him, but he stops me by grabbing my arm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhoa, hey--I don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He speaks nonsense. All I can make out is the odd phrase here or there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He says,  \u201cI can\u2019t do it! I can\u2019t!\u201d He presses against his forehead with this free palm. \u201cI know. I know. Ok. Ok.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he looks at me. And he smiles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try harder to pull away, but I can\u2019t. \u201cLook man\u2026 I don\u2019t have any money or any drugs or--.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He speaks with a new calmness. \u201cI don\u2019t do drugs.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOk, sorry. I just need to go. I--\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He spins me around so his arm is around my chest, restraining me and my own arms. He pulls out a pistol from his jacket. He wraps his other arm around me and points the gun upward toward my chin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s no one on the platform by now except for me. The train is gone and the other passengers have long since left. The station feels deserted.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The teenager is laughing now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe voices say that if I make a sacrifice, they will finally leave me alone. I need to make a sacrifice. I need to!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He kisses me on the temple and whispers into my ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to scream, but I can only manage a shaky whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s Rachel.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just then, I hear footsteps. It must be passengers coming for the next train. I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t notice what\u2019s happening, but I guess with our backs toward them, we might just look like a couple in an embrace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is how cities are, anyway. Most people will look at you, but they won\u2019t really see you. You\u2019re either an annoyance in the way of their commute, or you\u2019re inconsequential, and they forget you as quickly as they noticed you, if they noticed you at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The passengers walk past us. They look familiar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think they\u2019re the other man and woman from the train. The man even has a newspaper trucked under his arm. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s too late now, Rachel. It\u2019s too late.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, he fires two shots at the man and the woman, and they drop instantly. He then points the gun toward my chin again, and I beg. I plead! Just let me go!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou failed, Rachel.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou failed.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And before I can scream out, before I can tear myself away, before I can do anything, I just... black out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been on this train forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got on at Davis I-don\u2019t-know-how-long-ago and we\u2019re stuck in the tunnel between Porter and Harvard Square.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every five minutes, the driver chimes in with the same announcement: \u201cWe apologize for the delay due to police action at Harvard Square.
