It sorta comes with the territory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I want to make it clear I don\u2019t mean the regular weird shit you see when you work for the mob. I\u2019ve seen people get murdered and shit like that, Hell, one time stumbled on two of our guys that had been hit right before a pickup. There\u2019s a difference, though. Weird\u2019s subjective, and two guys strung up from chains on the ceiling with \u201cIrish Pigs\u201d written on the wall isn\u2019t weird to me \u2013 not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before you start to think I\u2019m some sorta hitman or something, I\u2019m just a courier. A well-paid runner, that\u2019s it. I needed a job and my friend just, well, he knew a guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m no drug-runner, either, before that pops into your head. The guys I work for are a lot more old-school than that. Think the Godfather movies with less Italians and more Irish. I mean \u2013 I work for the mob, yeah, but I\u2019m not a bad guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conner always had a shit-eating grin. I think his face was stuck that way, if I\u2019m gonna be honest. It probably wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if his breath didn\u2019t always stink and his teeth weren\u2019t stained from the coffee and coffee stouts he always drank. I hated it when I started working under him, but I got used to it after a while. He\u2019s a pretty good guy, if I\u2019m gonna be honest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou okay for a pickup tonight, Jackie boy?\u201d he asked, smiling cheekily as he walked out of the bail-bonds shop he ran. I use the term \u201cran\u201d as absolutely lightly as I can, too, because apart from occasionally bailing one of us out, all he did was give us assignments and sit on his ass drinking IPAs all day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t like that you\u2019re so happy about this,\u201d I said. Anything that made Conner happy usually made me miserable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a vacation, actually.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I raised an eyebrow at him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat\u2019s not making me feel better,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, relax, crabass,\u201d he said. \u201cEasiest pickup you\u2019ll get all month.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He handed me an envelope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLeave your bike outside with the disc in the saddlebags and the next morning, it\u2019ll be replaced with cash. It\u2019s maaaaAAAAAgic,\u201d he said. He made \u201cwooOOOOOOooooo\u201d sounds and wiggled his fingers at me menacingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded. Blackmail stuff was pretty common for us. Business guy grabbed one of the local whores on vacation or something, went back to her place, badda bing badda boom, she made sure the dirty was in front of the camera and the guy pays us twice, once for the pleasure, once to keep a secret.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He turned around and walked back into the shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHave fun!\u201d he called over his shoulder. He walked back in and I was left to look after him, apprehensive about that damn grin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home, I changed into some jeans and a maroon t-shirt and entered the address in the envelope into my computer. Now \u2013 in East Tennessee, there\u2019s quite a few places most people would consider \u201cin the middle of nowhere\u201d but, take it from me when I say that this place was above and beyond the middle of nowhere. This place was nowhere cubed. I had to pull the map eight times following the little yellow line on the screen before it hit an actual main road. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alongside the little slip of paper with the address was a nondescript disc in a yellow case and a folded piece of paper with instructions written in Conner\u2019s cramped, chicken-scratch handwriting:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check in in Pigeon Forge. It\u2019s under your name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leave your bike outside where it can be seen. (I already checked the weather and you\u2019ll be fine \u2013 no more rain till next week).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leave the disc in one of the saddlebags. (Don\u2019t watch it, you know the drill blah blah blah).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No hookers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I laughed at the last part. If you ever saw the hookers in Pigeon Forge, you\u2019d understand why. It was like telling me not to stick my dick in a drainpipe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my old canvas bag and strapped it to the luggage rack on my bike, made sure my 1911 was loaded and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally when people think of vacation cabins up in the mountains, they think of solitary cabins up in the woods looking over picturesque mountain peaks, like Thoreau\u2019s cabin. In East Tennessee, they\u2019re not usually all that secluded. They\u2019re sort of built in communities so you\u2019re surrounded by other cabins and people. This one, though \u2013 wasn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked in a bit later than I would have liked since traffic in Pigeon Forge is always shit near the weekend, so the sun was starting to go down as I turned onto the long road the wound up the mountain. It was a little two lane that was so narrow, I ended up riding the middle line most of the time, and I tried not to look at the edge or think about the fact there wasn\u2019t a guard rail. I\u2019ve rode motorcycles my entire life, but the road was so curvy that I began to wonder if I should have borrowed a car from Conner. I didn\u2019t see a single other driveway the entire way up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did try to enjoy the ride, though. The leaves were just beginning to change and it was just cool enough up in the mountains to feel amazing. My old Vulcan felt good underneath me, and I decided that the next day, I would ride up to Cades Cove and just, ya know, enjoy it. Conner did call it a vacation, so if he got mad, I\u2019d just say I misunderstood him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The road just sort of ended in a big circle at the cabin. There wasn\u2019t really a driveway, just a little brick path that led from the road to the door. The cabin itself was a tiny little thing. It didn\u2019t actually sit on the hilltop, but had the characteristic stilts so that one side could sit suspended in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled the bike to the side of the circle of pavement and put the kickstand down. When I cut the engine off, I took a second to listen to the silence. I couldn\u2019t even hear the cars from the valley below, just the wind rustling the trees and blowing in dark clouds. The air had the sickly sweet smell of fall, and I loved it. I pulled out my phone to text Conner to tell him if it rained, he was paying for the leather on my seat to get treated and felt stupid realizing that of course I wouldn\u2019t have signal where I was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was nearly at the door to the cabin and grumbling about the rain when I actually noticed it. I was so damned startled, I\u2019m sure my heart stopped for a second or two. The door was one of those that had part of the upper half replaced with glass and when I looked up from the brick path, there was a figure standing at the door, staring at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I jerked backward so quickly I couldn\u2019t pull my foot back quick enough to catch myself and I fell right on my ass on the little brick walkway. I was still trying to scramble backward and pull my 1911 out of its holster when my mind finally registered that the figure wasn\u2019t moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped moving for a second and watched it closely \u2013 but it never moved, so I got to my feet and crept closer to investigate, my gun gripped so tightly that my knuckles were turning white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a fucking carved indian statue. Like, the kind carved out of a huge piece of wood with the colorful headdress and the somber face and stereotypical indian vest with beads carved into its clothing and mocassins carved as shoes. It had its hand held over its face like it was looking at something far away or was in bright sunlight. I opened the door and moved the thing out of the way with a bit of difficulty. It must have been carved out of oak or some other kind of heavy wood because the damn thing was heavy as all hell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered the time as a teenager when my friends and I had wrapped up the sheets in our hotel room to look like a corpse and how funny we thought it would be. I figured some kids had probably gotten a similar laugh out of this. When my heart finally quit threatening to jump out of my chest, I actually let out a shaky laugh. They got me, after all. I could respect the little shitheads for that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the cabin was pretty standard. The door opened onto a single room, half of which was the kitchen and the other the living room with a futon, some tables with lamps made of antlers and a television sitting on the mantelpiece of a little brick fireplace. The floors were brightly polished wood and the coffee table was carved with a scene of three baby black bears playing in a mountain stream. Directly opposite from the entrance door the wall consisted of large glass panes running from floor to ceiling so one could see the balcony outside. A door directly in the center of the wall, led out onto the balcony, and, on the left wall, a door led to the only bedroom with, you guessed it, a bed with a carved wooden frame and a quilt with little black bears on it and a brightly polished wooden dresser and the same wall consisting of glass panels separating the bedroom from the balcony. Strangely, it didn\u2019t smell like wood. It smelled like dust and lemon Pine-sol. The warm light from the setting autumn sun made the wood seem warm and comfy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I threw my bag down on the bed and took my coat off and draped it over the wooden Indian by the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped outside onto the balcony and looked out over the valley. Far away I could just make out the glow of Gatlinburg as dusk continued to settle, but apart from that, I was fairly sure I was alone. No cabins, no traffic, the road didn\u2019t even approach from beneath the cabin, so the long slope down was unbroken trees and foliage. Made sense for someone picking up what was probably a sextape, or for keggers, but I couldn\u2019t see it being used for much else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Far down in the valley, I noticed a black bear lumbering up one of the opposite hills. I took my 1911 out and aimed at it. I lined up the shot and then pulled the gun up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBang,\u201d I said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bear continued climbing  \u2013 not giving a flying fuck about me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned around to walk back inside and was startled by the indian \u2013 again. My coat had slipped off and so, once again, it was staring at me. I draped my leather jacket over it again, much more securely this time, and wondered just who in the fuck would buy a life-sized Indian statue, especially for such a small damn place. If it was local, the thing was probably several hundred dollars at least. It just didn\u2019t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned on the television and put Die-Hard on pay-per-view. I wasn\u2019t footing the bill, so eh. I called and ordered a pizza with the cabin\u2019s phone and waited until the little teenager drove up in his sputtering little Honda to give it to me. I tipped him a twenty for making him drive so far but I still think he thought I was a bit of a douche.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I waited, my jacket slipped off the wooden Indian two more times. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t exactly sure how it was slipping off, but nevertheless, it happened, and I finally threw the jacket down beside me on the futon instead. It wasn\u2019t worth dealing with it. I did, however, turn the statue around to face the wall again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it got dark \u2013 and it gets dark that far up in the mountains, things began to get worse. I had sat the pizza box on the counter in the kitchen part of the main room, and when I got off the futon to grab a second slice, the statue had somehow turned itself around. It never made a sound, but it was, nevertheless, facing the futon again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized I didn\u2019t know how long it had been like that and I imagined myself blissfully watching tv for the past few minutes with it just staring at me. Of course, I know that statues can\u2019t stare \u2013 but I didn\u2019t like it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved the statue outside by rocking its weight back and forth and sort of walking it out the front door. I pushed it down the little set of steps just outside the door, and it thudded as it rolled down the small set of steps and came to rest face-down on the little brick path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know you\u2019re probably saying I was silly and I admit I did feel kind of silly. I thought about how I would explain to Conner how I managed to strain my back at a secluded cabin where I literally just had to hang out for the night. The thing is, though, there was something stronger than the feeling of being silly \u2013 something I couldn\u2019t really put a finger on, but that kept telling me that moving that wooden statue was a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to sit down and get back into the end of Die Hard, but the wind began to pick up even more and I could hear it whistling and moaning outside as it relentlessly tugged at the trees, pulling leaves off one by one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere is nothing wrong with that goddamn statue,\u201d I said through gritted teeth, trying to force myself to watch Bruce Willis. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wind grew louder the more I tried to ignore it, though, demanding my attention with everything it had, until I heard a metallic crashing sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran to the front door, only to have my heart stutter. The cabin had an LED light above the door that faced the small circle of road where I\u2019d parked, and in that bright white light, I could see my bike toppled sideways on the ground. My motorcycle being tipped over made me a little nauseous, but the wooden indian statue standing beside it made me want to vomit violently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was still in the same position, it\u2019s hand casting a deep shadow over its face, but it was clearly staring at the door \u2013 at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my pistol from the coffee table and walked outside. I grabbed the statue and pushed it over. I was so scared and angry that it didn\u2019t seem so heavy as I rolled it to the edge of the hill. I remember it smelled like pine as I pushed it, but not like the pine-sol the rest of the cabin smelled like. It smelled like strong gin or a Christmas tree that had just started to turn brown. I pushed it over the edge and let it tumble into the valley below, thudding hollowly against the trees and swishing through the carpet of leaves as it slid and rolled into the darkness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had had enough. I pulled my bike upright, determined to leave that very second \u2013 but I realized with a lurch that my headlight had shattered when the bike fell over. My mind jumped to the winding road and tried to imagine riding down it in the dark. The clouds overhead meant there was almost no moonlight and I knew I\u2019d probably careen off the side well before I made it even halfway down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked back inside, trying to figure out what I was going to do, and found the indian statue on the balcony outside, staring through the glass panes directly at me. I jumped and almost fell again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWHAT DO YOU FUCKING WANT!?\u201d I shouted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The statue didn\u2019t move. It never fucking moved. The old yellow bulb on the balcony made the shadows on the indian\u2019s long, sullen face even deeper and darker.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was an axe beside the fireplace and I quickly walked over and grabbed it, intent on hacking the thing to pieces. Unfortunately, I think it realized that, because when I looked up, the statue was gone, and the light had gone out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned around, and walked toward the front door, knowing the answer without even needing to look. The bright LED spotlight on the front of the house was out too. Beyond the reach of the lights inside the cabin, it was pure black. I was surrounded by almost interminable darkness \u2013 and even though I had never minded such a thing before, knowing so made me stomach curl even more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won\u2019t pretend I was brave. I was terrified. Beyond all else, I was terrified. I was sure if the fucking statue didn\u2019t get me, my heart would surely give out. I could feel it threatening to burst out of my chest already and run screaming into the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked onto the balcony again and, from the lights inside that managed to spill out, I could barely make out the shape of the statue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rummaged through the cabinets until I found a large container of salt. If ever there was a time where I needed pop culture to have a grain of truth, I needed it to be right then. I guess if some ghost hunter or something ever reads this, you can tell me I was an idiot, but it was the only thing I could think of. I finally found one in the cabinet beside the fridge and decided I would sprinkle it along the walls and doors to try and keep the statue out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I turned around, it was already inside, standing just in front of the panes of glass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked slowly toward the bedroom door, the axe in one hand and the salt in the other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou afraid of this, you fucking bitch!?\u201d I shouted. Strangely, I was hoping it would respond. I don\u2019t know why, but I just wanted it to say \u2013 something. Even if it had just been that I was going to die or something in some demonic voice, that would have been better than that silence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I backed into the bedroom, not taking my eyes off of it, and shut the door behind me as quickly as I could. I poured a line of salt across the bottom of the door and ran to do the same to the windows facing the balcony. When I turned, the statue was already there, his hand held over his sullen face, making it darker. I poured the salt as quickly as I could. Behind me, I heard the television in the main room shut off \u2013 no more Die Hard tonight. When I looked at the space beneath the door, I realized the lights in the main room had all gone out. All I had was the television in the bedroom, which I quickly turned on, and a small little antler lamp on the bedside table that gave off a warm yellow glow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked back and forth as quickly as I could between the door and the balcony, but the Indian never reappeared outside. I tried to take deep breaths and think of a plan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the door to the bedroom slowly. The small amount of yellow light didn\u2019t stretch far into the thick coffee blackness, but it did a little. I stepped as far away from the door as I could and braced my back against the wall. I put the salt on the bed and gripped the axe with both hands. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. I had an idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opened my eyes and braced myself to swing the ax as soon as I opened them, but, instead of being in the room with me, the Indian was just on the other side of the door \u2013 on the other side of the salt line, staring at me in front of a sea of black.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I let out a shaky breath and grabbed the salt off the bed. I still wasn\u2019t sure if the salt had any effect, but I thought that the sign that it hadn\u2019t passed the line I\u2019d made was probably a good sign. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sprinkled salt all around the statue\u2019s base. I consciously turned away from the statue to put the salt back on the bed to see if it would move again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the axe in both hands and got as close to the statue as I dared before swinging it over my head and burying it in the statue\u2019s headdress. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It let out a single ear-piercing shriek that I will never, ever forget. As it shrieked, the lights shuttered back on, one by one, filling the cabin with warm, yellow light, and flooding the pavement outside with a bright blue glow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to pull the axe free but, no matter how much I pulled, it wouldn\u2019t budge. I considered putting my foot on the statue to pull it free, but something told me not to, so I let it be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good thing about log cabins \u2013 they burn easily, and that one did. It burned high and bright and my breath shook when I set the fire. I called 911 on the cabin phone before I did, said some sparks from the fireplace had jumped out and I couldn\u2019t contain it. They told me to quickly leave and they would send a crew out to me. By the time they got there it was too late to save the cabin \u2013 I made sure of it. They helped me get my bike to a motel in Gatlinburg and I left the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conner gave me shit for being an idiot, but I let him think that. Way better than telling him the truth. Second generation Irish immigrant, he\u2019s a pretty superstitious guy, but I don\u2019t think even he would\u2019ve believed me. We rescheduled with the guy at a cheap motel at the outskirts of town and he got his sex tape or whatever the fuck it was, although he wasn\u2019t happy about it. Eh, fuck him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I\u2019m writing this down now is because I saw an article recently. One of those \u201cTen amazing things nobody can explain\u201d lists or whatever on some site that probably gave my computer a virus. Number four was a picture of a wooden indian statue beside an older couple, who were both smiling brightly. The text beneath the photo read:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCalifornia couple Jane and Austen Hollingsworth lost their East Tennessee cabin in a fire six months ago. The fire consumed the entire cabin and would have spread to surrounding forests if not for firefighters\u2019 efforts to contain the blaze. The strange part, though, is that the statue that the couple purchased from a local carver when they first built the cabin somehow survived the raging inferno. It was found mostly unharmed in the remains of the cabin, with only a large indentation in the statue\u2019s headdress and some mild soot marks. While some have speculated the statue merely survived due to a random fluke of the cabin collapsing on top of it, smothering part of the fire before it could do any serious harm to the statue, many have pointed out just how unlikely such an event is. Either way, Mr. and Mrs. Hollingsworth are glad their old friend survived the blaze, as one can see from the picture above.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ya know, fear is a funny thing. The odds of me being murdered by a supernatural statue are slim to none. The very thought of it is actually a bit silly, especially the idea of a statue somehow travelling all the way down from Gatlinburg to get me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet \u2013 as I type this, the thought of looking behind me fills me with absolute unbridled dread.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I\u2019ve seen a lot of weird shit over the years. It sorta comes with the territory.\n\nAnd I want to make it clear I don\u2019t mean the regular weird shit you see when you work for the mob.

I use the term \u201cran\u201d as absolutely lightly as I can, too, because apart from occasionally bailing one of us out, all he did was give us assignments and sit on his ass drinking IPAs all day.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that you\u2019re so happy about this,\u201d I said. Anything that made Conner happy usually made me miserable.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a vacation, actually.\u201d\n\nI raised an eyebrow at him. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not making me feel better,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOh, relax, crabass,\u201d he said. \u201cEasiest pickup you\u2019ll get all month.\u201d\n\nHe handed me an envelope.\n\n\u201cLeave your bike outside with the disc in the saddlebags and the next morning, it\u2019ll be replaced with cash. It\u2019s maaaaAAAAAgic,\u201d he said. He made \u201cwooOOOOOOooooo\u201d sounds and wiggled his fingers at me menacingly.\n\nI nodded. Blackmail stuff was pretty common for us. Business guy grabbed one of the local whores on vacation or something, went back to her place, badda bing badda boom, she made sure the dirty was in front of the camera and the guy pays us twice, once for the pleasure, once to keep a secret.\n\nHe turned around and walked back into the shop.\n\n\u201cHave fun!\u201d he called over his shoulder. He walked back in and I was left to look after him, apprehensive about that damn grin.\n\nWhen I got home, I changed into some jeans and a maroon t-shirt and entered the address in the envelope into my computer. Now \u2013 in East Tennessee, there\u2019s quite a few places most people would consider \u201cin the middle of nowhere\u201d but, take it from me when I say that this place was above and beyond the middle of nowhere. This place was nowhere cubed. I had to pull the map eight times following the little yellow line on the screen before it hit an actual main road. \n\nAlongside the little slip of paper with the address was a nondescript disc in a yellow case and a folded piece of paper with instructions written in Conner\u2019s cramped, chicken-scratch handwriting:\n\n\n1.\tCheck in in Pigeon Forge. It\u2019s under your name.\n\n2.\tLeave your bike outside where it can be seen. (I already checked the weather and you\u2019ll be fine \u2013 no more rain till next week).\n\n3.\tLeave the disc in one of the saddlebags. (Don\u2019t watch it, you know the drill blah blah blah).\n\n4.\tNo hookers.\n\n\nI laughed at the last part. If you ever saw the hookers in Pigeon Forge, you\u2019d understand why. It was like telling me not to stick my dick in a drainpipe. \n\nI grabbed my old canvas bag and strapped it to the luggage rack on my bike, made sure my 1911 was loaded and headed out.\n \n\n-\n\n\nNormally when people think of vacation cabins up in the mountains, they think of solitary cabins up in the woods looking over picturesque mountain peaks, like Thoreau\u2019s cabin. In East Tennessee, they\u2019re not usually all that secluded. They\u2019re sort of built in communities so you\u2019re surrounded by other cabins and people. This one, though \u2013 wasn\u2019t.\n\nI checked in a bit later than I would have liked since traffic in Pigeon Forge is always shit near the weekend, so the sun was starting to go down as I turned onto the long road the wound up the mountain. It was a little two lane that was so narrow, I ended up riding the middle line most of the time, and I tried not to look at the edge or think about the fact there wasn\u2019t a guard rail. I\u2019ve rode motorcycles my entire life, but the road was so curvy that I began to wonder if I should have borrowed a car from Conner. I didn\u2019t see a single other driveway the entire way up. \n\nI did try to enjoy the ride, though. The leaves were just beginning to change and it was just cool enough up in the mountains to feel amazing. My old Vulcan felt good underneath me, and I decided that the next day, I would ride up to Cades Cove and just, ya know, enjoy it. Conner did call it a vacation, so if he got mad, I\u2019d just say I misunderstood him.\n\n\n-\n\n\nThe road just sort of ended in a big circle at the cabin. There wasn\u2019t really a driveway, just a little brick path that led from the road to the door. The cabin itself was a tiny little thing. It didn\u2019t actually sit on the hilltop, but had the characteristic stilts so that one side could sit suspended in the air.\n\nI pulled the bike to the side of the circle of pavement and put the kickstand down. When I cut the engine off, I took a second to listen to the silence. I couldn\u2019t even hear the cars from the valley below, just the wind rustling the trees and blowing in dark clouds. The air had the sickly sweet smell of fall, and I loved it. I pulled out my phone to text Conner to tell him if it rained, he was paying for the leather on my seat to get treated and felt stupid realizing that of course I wouldn\u2019t have signal where I was. \n\nI was nearly at the door to the cabin and grumbling about the rain when I actually noticed it. I was so damned startled, I\u2019m sure my heart stopped for a second or two. The door was one of those that had part of the upper half replaced with glass and when I looked up from the brick path, there was a figure standing at the door, staring at me.\n\nI jerked backward so quickly I couldn\u2019t pull my foot back quick enough to catch myself and I fell right on my ass on the little brick walkway. I was still trying to scramble backward and pull my 1911 out of its holster when my mind finally registered that the figure wasn\u2019t moving.\n\nI stopped moving for a second and watched it closely \u2013 but it never moved, so I got to my feet and crept closer to investigate, my gun gripped so tightly that my knuckles were turning white.\n\nIt was a fucking carved indian statue. Like, the kind carved out of a huge piece of wood with the colorful headdress and the somber face and stereotypical indian vest with beads carved into its clothing and mocassins carved as shoes. It had its hand held over its face like it was looking at something far away or was in bright sunlight. I opened the door and moved the thing out of the way with a bit of difficulty. It must have been carved out of oak or some other kind of heavy wood because the damn thing was heavy as all hell. \n\nI remembered the time as a teenager when my friends and I had wrapped up the sheets in our hotel room to look like a corpse and how funny we thought it would be. I figured some kids had probably gotten a similar laugh out of this. When my heart finally quit threatening to jump out of my chest, I actually let out a shaky laugh. They got me, after all. I could respect the little shitheads for that. \n\nThe rest of the cabin was pretty standard. The door opened onto a single room, half of which was the kitchen and the other the living room with a futon, some tables with lamps made of antlers and a television sitting on the mantelpiece of a little brick fireplace. The floors were brightly polished wood and the coffee table was carved with a scene of three baby black bears playing in a mountain stream. Directly opposite from the entrance door the wall consisted of large glass panes running from floor to ceiling so one could see the balcony outside. A door directly in the center of the wall, led out onto the balcony, and, on the left wall, a door led to the only bedroom with, you guessed it, a bed with a carved wooden frame and a quilt with little black bears on it and a brightly polished wooden dresser and the same wall consisting of glass panels separating the bedroom from the balcony. Strangely, it didn\u2019t smell like wood. It smelled like dust and lemon Pine-sol. The warm light from the setting autumn sun made the wood seem warm and comfy.\n\nI threw my bag down on the bed and took my coat off and draped it over the wooden Indian by the door.\n\nI stepped outside onto the balcony and looked out over the valley. Far away I could just make out the glow of Gatlinburg as dusk continued to settle, but apart from that, I was fairly sure I was alone. No cabins, no traffic, the road didn\u2019t even approach from beneath the cabin, so the long slope down was unbroken trees and foliage. Made sense for someone picking up what was probably a sextape, or for keggers, but I couldn\u2019t see it being used for much else. \n\nFar down in the valley, I noticed a black bear lumbering up one of the opposite hills. I took my 1911 out and aimed at it. I lined up the shot and then pulled the gun up quickly.\n\n\u201cBang,\u201d I said. \n\nThe bear continued climbing  \u2013 not giving a flying fuck about me.\n\nI turned around to walk back inside and was startled by the indian \u2013 again. My coat had slipped off and so, once again, it was staring at me. I draped my leather jacket over it again, much more securely this time, and wondered just who in the fuck would buy a life-sized Indian statue, especially for such a small damn place. If it was local, the thing was probably several hundred dollars at least. It just didn\u2019t make sense.\n\nI turned on the television and put Die-Hard on pay-per-view. I wasn\u2019t footing the bill, so eh. I called and ordered a pizza with the cabin\u2019s phone and waited until the little teenager drove up in his sputtering little Honda to give it to me. I tipped him a twenty for making him drive so far but I still think he thought I was a bit of a douche.\n\nWhile I waited, my jacket slipped off the wooden Indian two more times. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t exactly sure how it was slipping off, but nevertheless, it happened, and I finally threw the jacket down beside me on the futon instead. It wasn\u2019t worth dealing with it. I did, however, turn the statue around to face the wall again.\n\nWhen it got dark \u2013 and it gets dark that far up in the mountains, things began to get worse. I had sat the pizza box on the counter in the kitchen part of the main room, and when I got off the futon to grab a second slice, the statue had somehow turned itself around. It never made a sound, but it was, nevertheless, facing the futon again.\n\nI realized I didn\u2019t know how long it had been like that and I imagined myself blissfully watching tv for the past few minutes with it just staring at me. Of course, I know that statues can\u2019t stare \u2013 but I didn\u2019t like it. \n\nI moved the statue outside by rocking its weight back and forth and sort of walking it out the front door. I pushed it down the little set of steps just outside the door, and it thudded as it rolled down the small set of steps and came to rest face-down on the little brick path.\n \nI know you\u2019re probably saying I was silly and I admit I did feel kind of silly. I thought about how I would explain to Conner how I managed to strain my back at a secluded cabin where I literally just had to hang out for the night. The thing is, though, there was something stronger than the feeling of being silly \u2013 something I couldn\u2019t really put a finger on, but that kept telling me that moving that wooden statue was a good thing.\n\nI tried to sit down and get back into the end of Die Hard, but the wind began to pick up even more and I could hear it whistling and moaning outside as it relentlessly tugged at the trees, pulling leaves off one by one. \n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with that goddamn statue,\u201d I said through gritted teeth, trying to force myself to watch Bruce Willis. \n\nThe wind grew louder the more I tried to ignore it, though, demanding my attention with everything it had, until I heard a metallic crashing sound.\n\nI ran to the front door, only to have my heart stutter. The cabin had an LED light above the door that faced the small circle of road where I\u2019d parked, and in that bright white light, I could see my bike toppled sideways on the ground. My motorcycle being tipped over made me a little nauseous, but the wooden indian statue standing beside it made me want to vomit violently.\n\nIt was still in the same position, it\u2019s hand casting a deep shadow over its face, but it was clearly staring at the door \u2013 at me. \n\nI grabbed my pistol from the coffee table and walked outside. I grabbed the statue and pushed it over. I was so scared and angry that it didn\u2019t seem so heavy as I rolled it to the edge of the hill. I remember it smelled like pine as I pushed it, but not like the pine-sol the rest of the cabin smelled like. It smelled like strong gin or a Christmas tree that had just started to turn brown. I pushed it over the edge and let it tumble into the valley below, thudding hollowly against the trees and swishing through the carpet of leaves as it slid and rolled into the darkness. \n\nI had had enough. I pulled my bike upright, determined to leave that very second \u2013 but I realized with a lurch that my headlight had shattered when the bike fell over. My mind jumped to the winding road and tried to imagine riding down it in the dark. The clouds overhead meant there was almost no moonlight and I knew I\u2019d probably careen off the side well before I made it even halfway down.\n\nI walked back inside, trying to figure out what I was going to do, and found the indian statue on the balcony outside, staring through the glass panes directly at me. I jumped and almost fell again. \n\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU FUCKING WANT!?\u201d I shouted.\n\nThe statue didn\u2019t move. It never fucking moved. The old yellow bulb on the balcony made the shadows on the indian\u2019s long, sullen face even deeper and darker.  \n\nThere was an axe beside the fireplace and I quickly walked over and grabbed it, intent on hacking the thing to pieces. Unfortunately, I think it realized that, because when I looked up, the statue was gone, and the light had gone out. \n\nI turned around, and walked toward the front door, knowing the answer without even needing to look. The bright LED spotlight on the front of the house was out too. Beyond the reach of the lights inside the cabin, it was pure black. I was surrounded by almost interminable darkness \u2013 and even though I had never minded such a thing before, knowing so made me stomach curl even more.\n\nI won\u2019t pretend I was brave. I was terrified. Beyond all else, I was terrified. I was sure if the fucking statue didn\u2019t get me, my heart would surely give out. I could feel it threatening to burst out of my chest already and run screaming into the darkness.\n\nI looked onto the balcony again and, from the lights inside that managed to spill out, I could barely make out the shape of the statue. \n\nI rummaged through the cabinets until I found a large container of salt. If ever there was a time where I needed pop culture to have a grain of truth, I needed it to be right then. I guess if some ghost hunter or something ever reads this, you can tell me I was an idiot, but it was the only thing I could think of. I finally found one in the cabinet beside the fridge and decided I would sprinkle it along the walls and doors to try and keep the statue out. \n\nWhen I turned around, it was already inside, standing just in front of the panes of glass.\n\nI walked slowly toward the bedroom door, the axe in one hand and the salt in the other. \n\n\u201cYou afraid of this, you fucking bitch!?\u201d I shouted. Strangely, I was hoping it would respond. I don\u2019t know why, but I just wanted it to say \u2013 something. Even if it had just been that I was going to die or something in some demonic voice, that would have been better than that silence. \n\nI backed into the bedroom, not taking my eyes off of it, and shut the door behind me as quickly as I could. I poured a line of salt across the bottom of the door and ran to do the same to the windows facing the balcony. When I turned, the statue was already there, his hand held over his sullen face, making it darker. I poured the salt as quickly as I could. Behind me, I heard the television in the main room shut off \u2013 no more Die Hard tonight. When I looked at the space beneath the door, I realized the lights in the main room had all gone out. All I had was the television in the bedroom, which I quickly turned on, and a small little antler lamp on the bedside table that gave off a warm yellow glow.\n\nI looked back and forth as quickly as I could between the door and the balcony, but the Indian never reappeared outside. I tried to take deep breaths and think of a plan. \n\nIn.\n\nOut.\n\nIn.\n\nOut.\n\nI opened the door to the bedroom slowly. The small amount of yellow light didn\u2019t stretch far into the thick coffee blackness, but it did a little. I stepped as far away from the door as I could and braced my back against the wall. I put the salt on the bed and gripped the axe with both hands. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. I had an idea.\n\n1\u2026\n\n2\u2026\n\n3\u2026\n\n4\u2026\n\n5\u2026\n\n6\u2026\n\n7\u2026\n\n8\u2026\n\n9\u2026\n\n10\u2026\n\nI opened my eyes and braced myself to swing the ax as soon as I opened them, but, instead of being in the room with me, the Indian was just on the other side of the door \u2013 on the other side of the salt line, staring at me in front of a sea of black.\n\nI let out a shaky breath and grabbed the salt off the bed. I still wasn\u2019t sure if the salt had any effect, but I thought that the sign that it hadn\u2019t passed the line I\u2019d made was probably a good sign. \n\nI sprinkled salt all around the statue\u2019s base. I consciously turned away from the statue to put the salt back on the bed to see if it would move again.\n\nIt didn\u2019t.\n\nI grabbed the axe in both hands and got as close to the statue as I dared before swinging it over my head and burying it in the statue\u2019s headdress. \n\nIt let out a single ear-piercing shriek that I will never, ever forget. As it shrieked, the lights shuttered back on, one by one, filling the cabin with warm, yellow light, and flooding the pavement outside with a bright blue glow.\n\nI tried to pull the axe free but, no matter how much I pulled, it wouldn\u2019t budge. I considered putting my foot on the statue to pull it free, but something told me not to, so I let it be.\n\nThe good thing about log cabins \u2013 they burn easily, and that one did. It burned high and bright and my breath shook when I set the fire. I called 911 on the cabin phone before I did, said some sparks from the fireplace had jumped out and I couldn\u2019t contain it. They told me to quickly leave and they would send a crew out to me. By the time they got there it was too late to save the cabin \u2013 I made sure of it. They helped me get my bike to a motel in Gatlinburg and I left the next day.\n\nConner gave me shit for being an idiot, but I let him think that. Way better than telling him the truth. Second generation Irish immigrant, he\u2019s a pretty superstitious guy, but I don\u2019t think even he would\u2019ve believed me. We rescheduled with the guy at a cheap motel at the outskirts of town and he got his sex tape or whatever the fuck it was, although he wasn\u2019t happy about it. Eh, fuck him.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m writing this down now is because I saw an article recently. One of those \u201cTen amazing things nobody can explain\u201d lists or whatever on some site that probably gave my computer a virus. Number four was a picture of a wooden indian statue beside an older couple, who were both smiling brightly. The text beneath the photo read:\n\n\n\u201cCalifornia couple Jane and Austen Hollingsworth lost their East Tennessee cabin in a fire six months ago. The fire consumed the entire cabin and would have spread to surrounding forests if not for firefighters\u2019 efforts to contain the blaze. The strange part, though, is that the statue that the couple purchased from a local carver when they first built the cabin somehow survived the raging inferno. It was found mostly unharmed in the remains of the cabin, with only a large indentation in the statue\u2019s headdress and some mild soot marks. While some have speculated the statue merely survived due to a random fluke of the cabin collapsing on top of it, smothering part of the fire before it could do any serious harm to the statue, many have pointed out just how unlikely such an event is. Either way, Mr. and Mrs. Hollingsworth are glad their old friend survived the blaze, as one can see from the picture above.\u201d\n\n\nYa know, fear is a funny thing. The odds of me being murdered by a supernatural statue are slim to none. The very thought of it is actually a bit silly, especially the idea of a statue somehow travelling all the way down from Gatlinburg to get me.\n\n\nAnd yet \u2013 as I type this, the thought of looking behind me fills me with absolute unbridled dread.\n \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "65dhu3", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 152, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BigbyWolf343", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65dhu3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.nosleep", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/65dhu3/that_old_cabin_up_in_the_hills/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492215768.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65dhu3/that_old_cabin_up_in_the_hills/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "That old cabin up in the hills", "created_utc": 1492186968.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 12, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 152}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dhu3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dhu3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga3dvg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Danielgordon343", "parent_id": "t1_dga0c16", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Middle Tennessee here too! \ud83d\ude00", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle Tennessee here too! \ud83d\ude00&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nosleep", "name": "t1_dga3dvg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492249049.0, "created_utc": 1492220249.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga0c16", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Brescious", "parent_id": "t3_65dhu3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Love this, as someone who lived in central Tennessee and has travelled to the gatlinburg/ pigeon forge area pretty often, you hit the nail on the head on the descriptiveness of this story!
