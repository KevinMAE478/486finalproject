The stereotypical stainless-steel trapezoid that only rusts if you let the blood sit too long. I stole it from my father&amp;#39;s workshop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father picked me up from school that day after the principal called to inform him of my &amp;quot;grandiose hysterical behavior&amp;quot; - I believe that was the exact quote. I was inconsolable. A wreck. A hot mess. A twelve year old who shouldn&amp;#39;t have been carrying the emotional burden that I was. When he came into the principal&amp;#39;s office it became clear to me that I was alone. Mrs. Rollins, for being a rather voluptuous black woman in an all white town, should have had some empathy. The townsfolk didn&amp;#39;t want a &amp;quot;nigger&amp;quot; there just like the girls in my class didn&amp;#39;t want...me...learning alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mr. Halls, your daughter has been causing an &lt;em&gt;excessive&lt;/em&gt; disturbance lately.

That was the first time I laughed since school started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is not a joke!&amp;quot; Rollins erupted, and my father stopped hiding his smile. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right, Donna. It isn&amp;#39;t. My wife and I are paying you nine-&lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt; dollars a year for our daughter to attend this school. Do you know why we pay that, Donna?&amp;quot; His cheeriness began to fade. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re paying that so Ellie here can get a good education at a good school around good people so she can grow up and have a good life. Are you following my theme here?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She nodded and returned to her chair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good. We don&amp;#39;t pay you nine-&lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt; dollars for our daughter to come home every single day in tears because some snotty little bitches hate that she eats more than a carrot stick for dinner.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; appropriate to talk about children that way!&amp;quot; She popped up and slammed her hands onto her desk again, this time knocking over a pile of papers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right,&amp;quot; my dad sat down and crossed his arms, &amp;quot;it isn&amp;#39;t. No one should be talking about any child that way. Why do these girls get to call my daughter fat, Mrs. Rollins?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t recall much of the meeting after that. I think hearing my father, my hero, acknowledging that I had a weight problem made me suppress the rest. That&amp;#39;s what my therapist said, at least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The clearest memory I have after that meeting is stealing the blade from dad&amp;#39;s yellow toolkit while I sat in his shop waiting for him to finish a desk. He had so many that I was confident he would have no idea he was missing it. We went home that evening and my mother had dinner ready for us. Meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and carrots. I ran to my room in a fluster of &amp;quot;grandiose hysterical behavior.&amp;quot; No one followed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I expected the first cut to hurt. My hands were shaking as I tried to hold the blade steady while my insides seeped out from behind it. The second cut came with greater ease. Whether that was from the loss of blood or the willingness to die I can&amp;#39;t say. I wanted to keep going until the end, but as foolish as it was, I freaked out when the blood starting pooling on the carpet. My mother would kill me for leaving a stain in her house. I wanted sympathy...someone to care. Not chastise me. I stopped. The blood didn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I panicked and shouted for help as loud as I possibly could. I didn&amp;#39;t realize how unprepared I was to die. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. McKinney was the nicest person I think I have ever met in my life. He wasn&amp;#39;t like any of my teachers, bosses, or &lt;em&gt;typical&lt;/em&gt; therapists. For five years on Tuesdays and Fridays I &lt;em&gt;mattered.&lt;/em&gt; McKinney understood me and my struggles. In fact, he was like me. He was made fun of in school because no one wanted him there. Girls didn&amp;#39;t breathe in his direction and boys spared no expense reminding him of what he was. That&amp;#39;s why he became a therapist - to help kids who were dealing with what he what went through. I loved that man. I always will. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On my first visit after turning seventeen we experimented with a new form of therapy that McKinney created. The first step was hypnosis. Not put-you-in-a-trance style, but rather a light, drug induced state of lucidity. While in this calm state, he would attempt physical stimulation to manifest activity in my dream state. For the first few sessions, he would perform various pokes and rubs on my feet to see if I would make myself run while lucid. We then moved onto my thighs, where he would tickle the insides with his fingers to make me kick. He&amp;#39;d massage my shoulders and kiss my neck to get me to look in a particular direction. Mr. McKinney would fuck me because he was a monster. I loved every second of it. We had a real connection, and to this day he&amp;#39;s truly the only man besides my father that I loved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My second attempt was not long after I told my parents about the relationship Mr. McKinney and I were having. I pleaded and pleaded with them not to do anything. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re in love!&amp;quot; was my stump phrase when they would use their word for us. I tried explaining that I wanted it. I wanted him. Rape is only rape if it wasn&amp;#39;t consensual. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within a short month of being arrested, McKinney lost his office and his entire career. As we were waiting in the courtroom for the first of many trials to begin my father collapsed onto the cold, marble floors. Dead on arrival. There was no hope for resuscitation, according to the paramedics. It didn&amp;#39;t stop me from trying CPR until I had to be physically restrained. \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hospital held me overnight due to my &amp;quot;grandiose hysterical behavior.&amp;quot; I believe the official listing for my stay was due to a mental breakdown which, looking back on things now, was a horribly mild diagnosis considering my mental state. After my nurse left my mother and I with discharge papers, I ripped the pen from my mom&amp;#39;s hand and shoved in into my neck as far as I could until my world went white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t see anything for those two minutes of being legally deceased. I only heard a voice - a child&amp;#39;s voice. He told me his name was Jonah and that we were best friends now. Jonah said he would help me get through the hard times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jonah wasn&amp;#39;t real, as far as I know. Five years after we first met, I&amp;#39;m now quite confident of that. He was a figment of my imagination that manifested itself during a time of peak stress. He did, however, give me the confidence to make it through my last year of school after my father died. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My second round of senior year started in September, a couple weeks after the rest of the kids started. My new therapist believed that all of the hustle and bustle of kids getting acclimated to their classes would be too stressful for me. I also had to have my teachers sign off that I attended every class, and then turn my sheet into the principal&amp;#39;s office at the end of each day where my mother would meet me and take me home. I was a prisoner living under a disguise they called freedom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My grand return to school started with homeroom, where all of my life-long &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; also happened to be. A failed subtle attempt at keeping tabs on me. They could have at least found actual friends of mine. Instead, the class was filled with boys only looked at me like a freak and girls who moved on from making fun of my appearance to reminding me of how I killed my dad by being a whore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t make it to my next class. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jonah came to me while I was sleeping that night. He wiped my tears and handed me a slip of paper - the address of one Isabella DeSantis, also known as the girl who lead the bitches that made me how I was. Jonah told me how we could handle it. I disagreed, but he was just as persuasive as he was persistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Together, Jonah and I walked to her house. I slid in through a window and he followed close behind. We explored the house until we found her bedroom, all white with stupid gold decorations. She was a diva, alright. As I stood over her, looking down at the source of my years of self-hatred I lost my confidence. I wept and backed away. I couldn&amp;#39;t go through with it. Jonah became angry at my flaking. He took the razor blade from my hand and slit both of her wrists while holding his hand over her mouth. She only struggled for a couple of minutes, thankfully. I went home with Jonah and he held me while I slept soundly for the first time in years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t seen Jonah since I fell asleep that night, but I know he&amp;#39;s still watching me. This morning I found an address and a date in my planner. The release date of Jim McKinney, and the return of my best friend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10/18/17. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll see you soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/MikeyKnutson\"&gt;Love,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellie&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "It started with a razor blade.
