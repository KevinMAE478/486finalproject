Soon my lungs were burning and I chanced a small breath through pressed teeth. Her hand was swift, slapping at my Adam&amp;#39;s apple and I gagged, gasping for air. The fork found its way inside before I could blink and my stomach turned once again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just being on my tongue sent tears streaming down my cheeks and my gag reflex increased to a code red.

I could feel the juices sliding down my throat and the stringy meat coated my teeth. Two quick bites to mash it up as best as I could before tilting my head back and forcing it down.
