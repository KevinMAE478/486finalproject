With a groan, I reached over and grabbed my phone and blinked a couple of times to adjust my eyes to the bright led screen. It was a text from a number I didn\u2019t know. Still shaken up from the visit earlier by my family members, I slowly tapped on the screen and opened up the text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cNot sure what I\u2019m doing, but here goes. I\u2019m the girl at the front counter. Kathy.  I just can\u2019t get your face out of my head and it\u2019s driving me crazy. God. This is so weird but. and I swear. This isn\u2019t like what I usually do, but can I come up to your room?\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pleasantly surprised by the text I replied back and told her yes and went to the restroom to make sure I didn\u2019t have any noticeable bed head. As soon as I looked at the mirror I had to do a double-take. I was far better looking than I originally was. My face was completely symmetrical and my body was in perfect shape. There wasn\u2019t an ounce of fat visible on my body. The last thing I noticed my clothes were now too small on me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the middle of trying to find another outfit, I heard a soft knock outside of my door. I looked out the peephole and saw a very nervous looking girl standing outside. After a couple of deep breaths, I slowly opened the door and gave her a little smile. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slightly stuttering she muttered out, \u201cY-you\u2019re the guy that just checked in, but you look a lit-little different.\u201d I laughed and told her that I was just a bit tired when I first checked in. She gave me a nervous smile and. Well. You know what we did. I really don\u2019t want to give you THAT much information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She started to fall asleep on my arm after we finished, but I slowly shook her awake and told her that she should leave. After a couple of protesting grunts, she got up and started to get dressed. I told her she was more than welcome to contact me at any time, but she just gave me a chuckle in response. After she put on her shirt she turned to me and the moment I saw her face I knew I was fucked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was still chuckling but her face was scrunched up from what seemed like various emotions running through her. I got up from bed to ask her what was wrong, but she pushed me back on the bed and pointed at me. She was trying to say something but she let out a loud sob while giving me a smile. I looked away for a second and looked back at her right as she started to laugh while her face was fixed into a frown filled with sorrow. Tears were dripping down her face as she continued to fall into a more and more intense laughing fit. I tried to help her, but every time I got close she would just push me back down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it was just a smaller woman acting completely bat shit crazy, but I was completely scared out of my mind. I closed my eyes and covered my ears. After a couple of minutes, I heard the sound stop. With caution, I slowly turned my body around and saw that she had stopped moving. Without a second thought, I called 911 and reported a death in my room. They told me to wait there, but I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran out of the hotel and caught the first cab. He asked me where I wanted to go and I quickly said, \u201cRaleigh.\u201d  He looked back at me and asked, \u201cYou know how much that\u2019s gonna be right? That\u2019s about an hour and a half drive.\u201d I gave him a nod and leaned back into the chair. He shrugged his shoulders and started to drive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The driver was quiet for the first five minutes so I started to daydream about being back at home with my family. My thoughts were disrupted by the sound of the driver coughing. I looked up and his eyes met mine before he asked me, \u201cNow don\u2019t get me wrong, but damn man. You are about the best looking guy I have ever seen in my life. Do you model?\u201d When I didn\u2019t reply back to him he just kept talking to me about how handsome I was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around 30 minutes later he chuckled and said, \u201cHell. If I was into dudes I would be all over you.\u201d I let out a nervous laugh and said, \u201cThanks, man.\u201d It was silent for a little longer before the driver stopped the car and parked it in the middle of the highway. I started to ask him what was wrong, but he just turned around and asked me, \u201cHow about this. You give me some pleasure with that pretty mouth of yours and I\u2019ll just give you the ride for free.\u201d He gave me a mischievous smile while putting out his hand urging me to shake it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shocked, I looked at him for a couple of seconds before replying back, \u201cI\u2019m okay man. I just need to get to Raleigh. I\u2019ve had a rough day.\u201d He gave me a nod and turned around and continued to drive. He was completely silent for the rest of the ride. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we got into the first rest area past the \u201cWelcome to Raleigh\u201d sign I handed the driver two hundred dollars and told him to keep the change. He grunted thanks and I got out of the car. While I walked up to the building I heard him calling after me. I turned around and saw the taxi driver holding a gun to his head. He yelled out before pulling the trigger, \u201cIf I can\u2019t have you. I don\u2019t want to live. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d As the sound of the gun went off, I ran into the rest area and sat on the ground next to an outlet for the next 2 hours. Trying to think of someone to contact, but I already knew I did not have anyone else I could trust. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I charged up my phone I walked out to the street where the bus stop was and silently waited with the others. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is when an unbearable heat started to come from my pocket. I reached in and took out the candy and threw it on the ground, but they wouldn\u2019t leave my hand. I tried everything from shaking to scraping it on the ground but nothing worked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should have been in pain, but all I could feel was raw anger. Anger that was building up since everything started to go to shit and the good looks that I never asked for. I wanted to be ugly again. I just wanted my life back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bus came and I sat in the middle of the bus. I didn\u2019t know where I was going but I knew I had to be on this bus. I don\u2019t know why, but there was something I just had to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally figured it out after the fifth stop. A happy little shit got on the bus. He looked around and saw that the only available seat was next to mine. He walked up to me and asked me if he could sit, but I spat back, \u201cCan\u2019t you just stand?\u201d He shrugged and jumped over me and took a seat by the window. I don\u2019t know why, but all of my anger was directed at him for the rest of the ride. I kept digging my elbows into his ribs as well as \u201caccidentally\u201d stepping on his foot. Right as he started to ask me to stop hitting him I experienced the worst smell of my life. It was coming from his mouth. I gagged and said, \u201cCan\u2019t you take care of your breath before talking to someone?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He became quiet and stared out the window. The candy started to get cold and I took them out of my pocket. I ate one, but there was still five in my pocket. There wasn\u2019t any time to second guess myself. When the bus got to the last stop I threw the candy on the guy\u2019s lap and rushed off of the bus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m in a hotel now. The candy has not returned. I\u2019m still good looking, but people are not freaking out or killing themselves over me. It\u2019s a fresh start for me now. Hopefully, the next guy will figure out what he &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HayongNoSleep/\"&gt;has to do.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64ygus/five_pieces_of_candy_ruined_my_life_part_1/)\n\nI woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of my phone buzzing.
