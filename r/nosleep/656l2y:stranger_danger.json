It was a summer evening. We had just eaten dinner, and my parents had decided that we should all go out for ice cream. We were going to walk into town as a family and get ice cream cones. Boyd and I were standing outside, waiting for my parents to finish with the dishes. I was standing on the steps, my back to the street, staring up at our house and thinking about how nice a chocolate ice cream cone with rainbow sprinkles would taste. Boyd stood a few steps above me, glowering at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He moved suddenly, as if he was lunging towards me. I faltered, stumbling and nearly losing my balance. His eyes gleamed. I pictured my small, thin body hurtling backwards, bouncing as it hit each brick step. If he kicked me down the stairs, I would surely break every bone in my body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved instinctively. I didn\u2019t have time to turn and run down the stairs, onto the sidewalk where I\u2019d be safe. No, if I turned around, it would give him time to kick me square in the back, and then I\u2019d fall down the brick steps face-first. I couldn\u2019t charge up past him. He was so much bigger than I was, and if I moved towards him, he\u2019d just have an easier time reaching out and kicking me down the brick stairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I jerked my leg, lashing out preemptively. My foot collided with Boyd\u2019s crotch. He crumpled, sitting down hard on the step that he\u2019d been previously standing on. He began to wail. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents rushed out of the house. Boyd was enveloped by our mother\u2019s loving arms while I tried frantically to explain to my father what had happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe said he was gonna kick me down the stairs!\u201d I sobbed, \u201cand then he came towards me!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNO!\u201d wailed Boyd. \u201cI said I was excited for ice cream, and Ethan kicked me!\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents\u2019 features darkened as they ushered us into the house. The neighbors across the street, responding to the sound of Boyd\u2019s wails, were looking out their windows now. No one had heard my brother threaten me. No one had seen the look of dark hatred in his eyes as he had, completely unprovoked, threatened to kick me down a flight of brick stairs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents didn\u2019t believe me when I told them that he had threatened to hurt me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe were going out for ice cream,\u201d my mother scolded, \u201cand you ruined it. You\u2019re a ruiner, Ethan.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was not the first time my brother had threatened me. I think he resented me. Up until my arrival, he\u2019d been an only child, doted on by my parents and grandparents. After I\u2019d come home from the hospital pink and screaming, he\u2019d had to share the attention. Some kids don\u2019t mind sharing the attention with a younger sibling, but Boyd was not one of those kinds of kids. What he wanted more than anything was attention, and he didn\u2019t really care what he had to do to get it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though I\u2019d just blown our chances at going out for ice cream, Boyd\u2019s injury at my hands (or rather, my foot) meant that our parents would be fawning over him for the rest of the night while I was sent to my room in solitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, my father took Boyd out for ice cream. I stayed behind with my mother. She glowered at me, shaking her head. \u201cWe all could\u2019ve gone out for ice cream together,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut no, you had to go and ruin it. Now you don\u2019t get to have ice cream, and neither do I! I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but I\u2019m being punished because of your actions, Ethan.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hung my head, knowing that there was no use arguing with her. Instead, I slouched up to my room and tried to entertain myself with puzzles. Maybe kicking my older brother had been a good thing, I reasoned. Sure, I wasn\u2019t getting any ice cream, but maybe my brother would realize that he couldn\u2019t threaten or bully me anymore. Maybe he would become afraid of the mighty strength in my feet and legs. I snapped puzzle pieces together, imagining him sheepishly apologizing to me and promising never to hurt me again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My reverie was broken by Boyd\u2019s appearance in my doorway. I looked up. Despite having a belly full of ice cream, his eyes blazed with anger and hate. He stomped over to me, kicking aside puzzle pieces as he came.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDon\u2019t you ever kick me again, worm-face,\u201d he snarled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to get up, but he pushed me, forcing me down onto the floor again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m bigger than you,\u201d he said, balling his hand into a fist and slamming it into my shoulder. \u201cAnd I\u2019m stronger than you.\u201d He hit me again. Tears prickled at my eyes, threatening to roll down my cheeks. \u201cAnd if you ever kick me again, I\u2019ll come into your room while you\u2019re asleep and put a pillow over your face and smother you til you\u2019re dead.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He punched me a third and final time before turning and stomping out of my room. I sat on the floor, rubbing my aching shoulder and crying quietly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt alone and unsafe. If I told my parents, they wouldn\u2019t believe me unless they actually saw Boyd physically tormenting me. Even if they did believe me, there was nothing they could really do that would make things better. They would send Boyd to his room and he\u2019d sulk for a few hours. Then, when their backs were turned, he\u2019d come after me and punch me again. Or worse, he\u2019d make good on his threat and actually kill me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no way I could keep Boyd out of my bedroom. My room didn\u2019t have a lock on the door. That night, I lay awake in bed, too terrified to go to sleep, knowing that the moment I did, I\u2019d be completely and utterly vulnerable. If I fell asleep, nothing would stop Boyd from coming into my room and pressing a pillow over my face. I stared up at the ceiling, drifting between wakefulness and fitful dreams where Boyd threw me down the brick steps leading up to our house or pressed a pillow against my mouth and nose, laughing while I suffocated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, our parents left for work. Boyd and I would start summer camp in a week, and, until then, our next-door neighbor, Peggy, would babysit us. Peggy was sixteen. To me, she seemed like an adult. My best friend, Patrick, had a different babysitter who would bring over a big black bag full of games and toys. He loved it whenever she came over, because it meant that they would play for hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Peggy wasn\u2019t like that. She\u2019d sit on the couch and read a book, looking up every now and again to tell me and Boyd to be quiet. Whenever she came over, I would sit in the living room with her and play quietly with puzzles until my parents got home, never daring to leave her side. The second I was out of eye- or ear-shot, Boyd would swoop in with a punch or a kick or a taunt. Sitting in the living room with Peggy all day was mind-numbingly boring, but it was the only way I was safe from Boyd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hated Peggy, but Boyd was indifferent to her. He would play in our backyard or in his bedroom, moving through our house freely while I remained tethered to Peggy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCan we go to the park or something?\u201d I asked, trying my very best not to make it seem like I was whining. I looked wistfully at the sunny backyard. Boyd had taken a stick and was running it along the fence, making a rhythmic thonk-thonk-thonk noise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Peggy looked up from her book and checked her watch. \u201cOK,\u201d she said, getting up off the couch. I watched, stunned, as she walked to the back door and called out to Boyd. \u201cBoyd! You wanna go to the park?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boyd tossed the stick aside. \u201cOK.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The park was only a few blocks away. Even though Peggy didn\u2019t have her driver\u2019s license, we could still walk there. I walked alongside Peggy as Boyd trotted excitedly ahead. I loved the park. It was big and was always crowded with kids of all ages. Boyd usually found a group of older boys to hang out with, leaving me alone. My heart soared in my chest as we neared the park and I saw the throng of kids running around in what looked like a massive game of tag. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I barely paid attention as Peggy settled onto a bench with her book. I ran over to a crowd of boys and girls my own age and quickly joined their game, forgetting about Peggy and Boyd. We were playing hide-and-seek tag when I felt the first pebbles hit my shoulder. I looked over from my hiding spot behind a massive wooden tunnel and saw Boyd grinning at me. He bent down and scooped up another handful of gravel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCatch!\u201d he laughed as he pelted me with it. I flinched as tiny pebbles rained down on me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cStop it!\u201d I told him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laughing, Boyd scooped up another fistful of dirt and pebbles and threw them at me. I raised my hands in time to prevent them from flying into my face. At that moment, I felt a light slap on my back and turned around. A girl with blonde hair and pigtails grinned playfully at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTag!\u201d she yelled, \u201cyou\u2019re it!\u201d A smaller boy was standing next to her. He goggled up at her with wide blue eyes and pointed at me with a sticky finger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou it!\u201d he mimicked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A shower of pebbles rained down on myself, the girl, and the boy. The boy stumbled, pawing at his eyes and bawling. The girl turned to Boyd, her pigtails whipping as she spun her head at him. She glowered then, much to my surprise, marched over to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDon\u2019t you dare throw rocks at my little brother!\u201d she shouted, her hands on her hips.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boyd just laughed and picked up another fistful of pebbles. \u201cWhat are you gonna do about it, retard?\u201d he asked as he lobbed the rocks directly at the sobbing little boy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBoyd, stop it!\u201d I jerked back, not wanting to be pelted with pebbles. Boyd only laughed. I felt my face growing hot with anger. I bent down and scooped up a handful of pebbles. If Boyd was going to throw rocks, then so was I. I was sick and tired of being pushed around by him. I had a grand vision in my head of rallying the other kids and pelting Boyd with rocks, dirt, and pebbles until he ran away crying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I threw the rocks at Boyd. It felt good to watch them bounce off his chest and arms. I bent down to scoop up another handful and heard a sharp, angry voice yelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey!\u201d A tall teenage girl was marching over to us. I looked over at the blonde girl, who was trying her best to comfort the crying boy. The blonde girl ran over to the teenager, pointing at me and Boyd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey\u2019re throwing rocks!\u201d she cried, \u201cand they hit Jimmy in the eye and he has rocks in his eyes now!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The teenage girl glowered at me and Boyd and I felt my heart sink. I looked down at the rocks I had clutched in my hands and let them fall back to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d demanded the teenager, her hands on her hips. \u201cPicking on little kids and throwing rocks!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhatever, butt-face,\u201d sneered Boyd, rolling his eyes. \u201cWe were just playing.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The teenager glared at him. \u201cThat\u2019s not playing, that\u2019s attacking,\u201d she scolded. I felt my face flush with shame. She scooped the little boy up. \u201cStop rubbing, Jimmy,\u201d she soothed, \u201cwe\u2019ll use some water to rinse out your eyes.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019M BLIND!\u201d wailed Jimmy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo,\u201d soothed the teenager. \u201cYou just have some dust in your eyes.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat a retard,\u201d muttered Boyd under his breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much to my surprise, the little blonde girl began to shriek. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad word!\u201d she yelled, \u201cthat\u2019s a bad word! Don\u2019t you dare say it! Don\u2019t you dare!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The teenager took her by the hand. She continued to glower at me and Boyd. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you playing with these rotten kids.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t want you playing with these rotten kids,\u201d mimicked Boyd, his voice a shrill falsetto. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou are a rotten kid,\u201d said the teenager calmly. \u201cAnd if I ever see you bothering the little kids again, I\u2019m not gonna be as nice.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d smirked Boyd, \u201cyou gonna tell my mommy on me?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The teenager rolled her eyes. \u201cYour mommy didn\u2019t love you enough to teach you good manners,\u201d snapped the little blonde girl. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCome on,\u201d said the teenager. \u201cHe\u2019s just a rotten little boy whose mother doesn\u2019t love him.\u201d The little girl followed her as she walked over to one of the benches. I hung my head, blinking back tears. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that moment, I hated Boyd. I hated him so fiercely, I thought my chest would explode. I hated being associated with him and his meanness. Boyd rolled his eyes and stomped away, muttering about the whole group being stupid retards. I watched as the teenage girl walked back to one of the benches, set the little boy down, and fished a bottle of water out of a backpack. She tipped the little boy\u2019s head back and then gently poured the water into his eyes. He shrieked and flailed his arms. The blonde girl hugged him, wrapping her arms around him tightly and holding him still while the teenager rinsed dirt from his eyes. After a few minutes, he calmed down and the blonde girl wiped his face with her hands. I watched as she took him by the hand, led him over to the swingset, and began pushing him on the swings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that moment, I realized that this was how an older sibling was supposed to act. Older brothers weren\u2019t supposed to threaten to kick their little brothers down the stairs. They weren\u2019t supposed to punch them or stomp on their puzzles or throw rocks at them or threaten to smother them in their sleep. Older brothers were supposed to be good and kind to their little brothers. They were supposed to be protective, the way the blonde girl was protecting her little brother. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crying, I walked back to Peggy and sat down beside her. She looked up from her book. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You fall down?\u201d she asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBoyd was throwing rocks,\u201d I sobbed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Peggy set her book down in her lap. \u201cBoyd!\u201d she yelled exasperatedly, \u201cdon\u2019t throw rocks!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without waiting for a response, she got up, stretching. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said, \u201cif you\u2019re gonna be bad, we\u2019ll just go home.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boyd whined, but after a few minutes, half-heartedly followed Peggy and me home. Peggy settled down on the couch with her book, and I reluctantly took up my customary place on the floor with my puzzle. Boyd flopped down on the couch beside Peggy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCan I watch TV?\u201d he asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSure,\u201d she muttered, not looking up from her book. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to protest, to tell her that Boyd had been throwing rocks at me and other kids at the park and that he should be punished for it. He should be sent to his room. But Peggy hadn\u2019t seen any of it. I had thrown a fistful of pebbles and dirt right back at Boyd. I had been a part of the rock fight, minor as it was. If I told on Boyd, he\u2019d just tell on me, and we\u2019d both be sent to our rooms. And, once we were away from Peggy, Boyd would punch me in the arm or threaten to smother me with a pillow again. He might actually do it, too, after everyone else was asleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat on the floor quietly while Peggy read and Boyd watched TV. When our parents got home, no one mentioned what had happened at the park.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI hate seeing them watch TV on such a nice day,\u201d my mother told Peggy as she left. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take them to the park tomorrow?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart sank as Peggy agreed. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of going back to the park. Unless I remained by Peggy\u2019s side the entire time, Boyd would find ways to torment me, and other kids would get caught up in it. That night, I dozed fitfully, tossing and turning as I tried to come up with ways to avoid the park the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Peggy arrived at the usual time and took me and Boyd straight to the park. I watched as she sat down on one of the benches and immediately took her book out. Boyd wandered off, heading towards a group of older boys. I watched him go, desperately hoping that he\u2019d stay with them and leave me in peace. I saw most of the kids that I had seen the day before running around the park. The blonde girl and her little brother were holding hands as they ran past the see-saw. I approached them. I\u2019d had so much fun playing with them until Boyd had shown up. Maybe they\u2019d let me play with them again as long as Boyd was occupied with the older children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The girl saw me and glared. She stepped protectively in front of her little brother. \u201cWe don\u2019t play with rock-throwers,\u201d she said firmly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat was my brother,\u201d I said. \u201cI promise not to throw rocks.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I heard gravel crunching behind me and knew that Boyd was approaching. \u201cYou gonna play with the retards again?\u201d asked Boyd, punching my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The girl\u2019s face grew bright red. \u201cDon\u2019t say that word!\u201d she yelled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cRetard!\u201d shouted Boyd. \u201cRetard! Retard! Retard!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little boy burst into tears. The girl scowled at Boyd. \u201cI\u2019m telling!\u201d she yelled as she grabbed the little boy\u2019s hand and fled, running off through the playground. Boyd laughed as we watched them go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat was mean,\u201d I said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be so mean to people.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boyd rolled his eyes. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he said. He reached out and slapped my shoulder hard. \u201cTag! You\u2019re it! Now you have to chase me!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He turned and bolted, still laughing. I sighed heavily and plodded after him. If I didn\u2019t, he\u2019d just come back and taunt me. I also had the feeling that the blonde girl was informing her babysitter of what Boyd had said, and I didn\u2019t want to feel her wrath a second time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I trudged along, walking towards the edge of the playground. The playground was surrounded on three sides by a wooden fence. The fence was half-hidden by shrubs, probably in a weak attempt to discourage kids from climbing on it. The older kids had no problem finding foot- and hand-holds, and I had seen at least a dozen different people climb up over it. The fence blocked off a thickly wooded area. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, Boyd had climbed the fence and was wandering along the treeline. I sighed, knowing that I\u2019d never be able to scale the fence and not really wanting to anyway. Part of me wished that the fence would magically double in size, stretching up towards the sky and forbidding Boyd from returning to the playground. I crouched in the shrubs along the fence and watched him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every now and then Boyd would stop and pick something up off the ground. It looked like he was picking up small rocks. My stomach clenched. Boyd wasn\u2019t content to throw tiny pebbles at me and the other kids in the park. He was picking up bigger rocks and putting them into his pockets, stocking up ammo for an impending war that he fully intended to win. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was debating whether or not to go and tell Peggy when the trees and bushes at the edge of the woods rustled. A man stepped out of the woods. He smiled broadly at Boyd and called out to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHello there!\u201d he called. His voice seemed too happy, as if he was about to start laughing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHi.\u201d Boyd seemed disinterested. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something about the man scared me. He didn\u2019t scare me the way Boyd did when he threatened to smother me with my pillow or when he punched me in the arm. There was something worse about the man. Something darker and more dangerous. Even though Boyd had threatened to smother me with my pillow while I slept, he had never come into my room at night. Whenever he punched me, he never left a mark or a bruise. He never hurt me that badly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But something about this man scared me more than Boyd ever had. Something about him made me break out into goosebumps and shiver despite the heat. He reminded me of the Big Bad Wolf who lured Little Red Riding Hood further and further off the path until she was lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI was hiking in the woods and lost my dog,\u201d said the man. He chuckled. \u201cShe slipped her leash and ran off. You think you could help me find her?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had learned all about stranger danger in school. A policeman had come into my classroom and told us that if a man ever asked us to get in a car to help him find a dog, we should run to the nearest adult and tell them. The policeman had said that we should never take candy or accept rides from men we didn\u2019t know. He told us that if a strange man ever came to pick us up at school and say that our parents had sent him, we had to tell a teacher right away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This man wasn\u2019t asking Boyd if he wanted candy or if he wanted a ride anywhere. In fact, he didn\u2019t have a car at all. He had come out of the woods. Maybe that was why I didn\u2019t do or say anything when Boyd shrugged and agreed to help the man find his dog. Though stranger danger had been hammered into my head, it always involved a man with a car. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My vague sense of dread was instantly swallowed by relief when Boyd vanished into the woods. He was busy helping the man find his lost dog. He wouldn\u2019t be at the playground to throw rocks or insult the other kids or pick on me. I got up and ran back to the park. A pack of kids was running around. I could see the blonde girl and her little brother; she still held his hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCan I play, too?\u201d I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The girl frowned. \u201cWe don\u2019t play with rock-throwers,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut that was my brother!\u201d I said, \u201cI promise not to throw rocks or call names or anything! I just want to play!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The girl studied me. \u201cIs your brother gonna come and throw rocks or call names?\u201d she asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shook my head. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. The girl pursed her lips, frowning at me as she thought. I held out my hand, balling it into a fist and extending my little finger. \u201cI pinkie-swear.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The girl linked her pinkie with mine, forming the solemn bond of \u201cpinkie-swearing.\u201d Then she tagged me and ran away giggling. Laughing, I chased after her and was quickly enveloped by the other kids. I laughed and ran and climbed all over the playground, never once thinking of Boyd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so busy playing that I didn\u2019t notice the thunder rumbling overhead until I felt the first raindrop on my skin. I looked up at the sky, shocked to see that it had grown dark and gray. The kids scattered, running back to parents or babysitters. I made my back to Peggy, who was in the process of stuffing her book into her purse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d she asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shrugged. Boyd was a forgotten shadow in the back of my mind. All I could remember was that he had spent the previous day throwing rocks at me and making another little boy cry. For the life of me, I couldn\u2019t remember seeing Boyd at all today. Peggy was looking around worriedly. Something nagged at the back of my mind, something telling me to head towards the fence and look out at the woods, but I brushed the thoughts aside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The playground emptied quickly as the rain intensified. Peggy ran through the wooden structures, shouting for Boyd. Eventually, she ran to a house across the street and, sobbing, asked to use their phone. The police arrived within minutes. My parents were called shortly after. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother was hysterical. She screamed at Peggy, who sobbed uncontrollably. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you watching my son?\u201d she shouted, \u201cI\u2019m paying you to watch my sons, you stupid idiot! What the hell were you doing? You were supposed to be watching him!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Peggy apologized profusely, shaking and sobbing. Tears streamed down her cheeks. I watched in horror as my mother reached out and slapped Peggy hard across the face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhere is my son?!\u201d she screamed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father rushed forward, grabbing my mother by the arms and pulling her back. Policemen swarmed around her and Peggy, separating them. My mother sobbed, burying her face in my father\u2019s chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father led my sobbing mother away from Peggy. When she looked up and saw me, her eyes lit up and she scrambled out of my father\u2019s arms. My mother grabbed me by the shoulders, her voice frantic as she demanded to know where Boyd was. \u201cEthan, did you see Boyd? Were you playing with him?\u201d she asked, \u201cwhere did you see him last? Did you see any strangers at the park today?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The word \u2018stranger\u2019 jolted my memory, and I remembered the man from the woods. If I told my mother, she\u2019d be furious with me. She\u2019d demand to know why I hadn\u2019t called an adult the minute I saw the stranger. She\u2019d demand to know why I hadn\u2019t stopped Boyd from going with him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She\u2019d slap me the way she had slapped Peggy. Peggy was now speaking with policemen, her voice too low for me to hear. Would she go to jail? If she went to jail for failing to watch me and Boyd, what would happen to me? If everyone found out that I had seen Boyd walk off into the woods with a stranger, they\u2019d probably put me in jail too. I\u2019d be locked up and I\u2019d never get to come out. I\u2019d never get to play or watch TV or eat dessert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, my parents would hate me. They\u2019d never love me again if they knew that I had seen Boyd walk away and done nothing. They wouldn\u2019t just punish me. They\u2019d stop loving me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shook my head. I didn\u2019t want to get in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The search for Boyd lasted for months. The park was closed. Kids weren\u2019t allowed to play outside anymore. I sat in my room, listening to my parents worriedly talking with policemen in the living room. I\u2019d occasionally hear my mother shrieking and sobbing, demanding to know why her son hadn\u2019t been found yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though the search for Boyd only lasted for a few months, my parents\u2019 constant sobbing, their own personal torment, lasted for ten years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have never told a soul that I had seen what had happened to Boyd. I know how much it hurt my parents. I know that my silence caused them unimaginable pain and suffering, and that I can never undo that. It is something that I deeply regret with every fiber of my being. I would gladly risk my mother\u2019s hatred if it meant taking away the pain she\u2019s suffered these last ten years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boyd\u2019s body was found last month. A group of Girl Scouts had been out hiking in the woods. One girl had gotten separated from the group and had stumbled upon the remnants of a human corpse. The corpse was that of a ten-year-old boy. He\u2019d been tied to a tree with a dog leash. The police were called in immediately. The body was badly decomposed, having been mostly exposed to the elements and scavengers for a decade, but the dental records matched those of my older brother. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try hard not to remember the day Boyd went missing. I try not to think about the way he sneered at the little girl and her brother or the feeling of dread and dull anger that rose up in my chest as they glowered at us. I try not to think about the intense relief I felt when Boyd vanished into the woods. I try not to think about how much fun I had playing with the other kids while he was gone. I try not to think about the smiling man with the missing dog. I try not to think about the fact that the man wasn\u2019t holding a leash when he asked for Boyd&amp;#39;s help. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "\u201cI\u2019m going to kick you down the stairs.\u201d\n\nThis threat from my older brother was delivered with deadly seriousness and came completely out of nowhere. It was a summer evening. We had just eaten dinner, and my parents had decided that we should all go out for ice cream. We were going to walk into town as a family and get ice cream cones. Boyd and I were standing outside, waiting for my parents to finish with the dishes. I was standing on the steps, my back to the street, staring up at our house and thinking about how nice a chocolate ice cream cone with rainbow sprinkles would taste. Boyd stood a few steps above me, glowering at me. \n\nHe moved suddenly, as if he was lunging towards me. I faltered, stumbling and nearly losing my balance. His eyes gleamed. I pictured my small, thin body hurtling backwards, bouncing as it hit each brick step. If he kicked me down the stairs, I would surely break every bone in my body.\n\nI moved instinctively. I didn\u2019t have time to turn and run down the stairs, onto the sidewalk where I\u2019d be safe. No, if I turned around, it would give him time to kick me square in the back, and then I\u2019d fall down the brick steps face-first. I couldn\u2019t charge up past him. He was so much bigger than I was, and if I moved towards him, he\u2019d just have an easier time reaching out and kicking me down the brick stairs.\n\nI jerked my leg, lashing out preemptively. My foot collided with Boyd\u2019s crotch. He crumpled, sitting down hard on the step that he\u2019d been previously standing on. He began to wail. \n\nMy parents rushed out of the house. Boyd was enveloped by our mother\u2019s loving arms while I tried frantically to explain to my father what had happened. \n\n\u201cHe said he was gonna kick me down the stairs!\u201d I sobbed, \u201cand then he came towards me!\u201d\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d wailed Boyd. \u201cI said I was excited for ice cream, and Ethan kicked me!\u201d \n\nMy parents\u2019 features darkened as they ushered us into the house. The neighbors across the street, responding to the sound of Boyd\u2019s wails, were looking out their windows now. No one had heard my brother threaten me. No one had seen the look of dark hatred in his eyes as he had, completely unprovoked, threatened to kick me down a flight of brick stairs. \n\nMy parents didn\u2019t believe me when I told them that he had threatened to hurt me.\n\n\u201cWe were going out for ice cream,\u201d my mother scolded, \u201cand you ruined it. You\u2019re a ruiner, Ethan.\u201d\n\nThis was not the first time my brother had threatened me. I think he resented me. Up until my arrival, he\u2019d been an only child, doted on by my parents and grandparents. After I\u2019d come home from the hospital pink and screaming, he\u2019d had to share the attention. Some kids don\u2019t mind sharing the attention with a younger sibling, but Boyd was not one of those kinds of kids. What he wanted more than anything was attention, and he didn\u2019t really care what he had to do to get it. \n\nEven though I\u2019d just blown our chances at going out for ice cream, Boyd\u2019s injury at my hands (or rather, my foot) meant that our parents would be fawning over him for the rest of the night while I was sent to my room in solitude.\n\nThe next day, my father took Boyd out for ice cream. I stayed behind with my mother. She glowered at me, shaking her head. \u201cWe all could\u2019ve gone out for ice cream together,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut no, you had to go and ruin it. Now you don\u2019t get to have ice cream, and neither do I! I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but I\u2019m being punished because of your actions, Ethan.\u201d\n\nI hung my head, knowing that there was no use arguing with her. Instead, I slouched up to my room and tried to entertain myself with puzzles. Maybe kicking my older brother had been a good thing, I reasoned. Sure, I wasn\u2019t getting any ice cream, but maybe my brother would realize that he couldn\u2019t threaten or bully me anymore. Maybe he would become afraid of the mighty strength in my feet and legs. I snapped puzzle pieces together, imagining him sheepishly apologizing to me and promising never to hurt me again. \n\nMy reverie was broken by Boyd\u2019s appearance in my doorway. I looked up. Despite having a belly full of ice cream, his eyes blazed with anger and hate. He stomped over to me, kicking aside puzzle pieces as he came.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you ever kick me again, worm-face,\u201d he snarled. \n\nI started to get up, but he pushed me, forcing me down onto the floor again. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m bigger than you,\u201d he said, balling his hand into a fist and slamming it into my shoulder. \u201cAnd I\u2019m stronger than you.\u201d He hit me again. Tears prickled at my eyes, threatening to roll down my cheeks. \u201cAnd if you ever kick me again, I\u2019ll come into your room while you\u2019re asleep and put a pillow over your face and smother you til you\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\nHe punched me a third and final time before turning and stomping out of my room. I sat on the floor, rubbing my aching shoulder and crying quietly.\n\nI felt alone and unsafe. If I told my parents, they wouldn\u2019t believe me unless they actually saw Boyd physically tormenting me. Even if they did believe me, there was nothing they could really do that would make things better. They would send Boyd to his room and he\u2019d sulk for a few hours. Then, when their backs were turned, he\u2019d come after me and punch me again. Or worse, he\u2019d make good on his threat and actually kill me.\n\nThere was no way I could keep Boyd out of my bedroom. My room didn\u2019t have a lock on the door. That night, I lay awake in bed, too terrified to go to sleep, knowing that the moment I did, I\u2019d be completely and utterly vulnerable. If I fell asleep, nothing would stop Boyd from coming into my room and pressing a pillow over my face. I stared up at the ceiling, drifting between wakefulness and fitful dreams where Boyd threw me down the brick steps leading up to our house or pressed a pillow against my mouth and nose, laughing while I suffocated. \n\nThe next day, our parents left for work. Boyd and I would start summer camp in a week, and, until then, our next-door neighbor, Peggy, would babysit us. Peggy was sixteen. To me, she seemed like an adult. My best friend, Patrick, had a different babysitter who would bring over a big black bag full of games and toys. He loved it whenever she came over, because it meant that they would play for hours. \n\nPeggy wasn\u2019t like that. She\u2019d sit on the couch and read a book, looking up every now and again to tell me and Boyd to be quiet. Whenever she came over, I would sit in the living room with her and play quietly with puzzles until my parents got home, never daring to leave her side. The second I was out of eye- or ear-shot, Boyd would swoop in with a punch or a kick or a taunt. Sitting in the living room with Peggy all day was mind-numbingly boring, but it was the only way I was safe from Boyd. \n\nI hated Peggy, but Boyd was indifferent to her. He would play in our backyard or in his bedroom, moving through our house freely while I remained tethered to Peggy. \n\n\u201cCan we go to the park or something?\u201d I asked, trying my very best not to make it seem like I was whining. I looked wistfully at the sunny backyard. Boyd had taken a stick and was running it along the fence, making a rhythmic thonk-thonk-thonk noise. \n\nPeggy looked up from her book and checked her watch. \u201cOK,\u201d she said, getting up off the couch. I watched, stunned, as she walked to the back door and called out to Boyd. \u201cBoyd! You wanna go to the park?\u201d\n\nBoyd tossed the stick aside. \u201cOK.\u201d\n\nThe park was only a few blocks away. Even though Peggy didn\u2019t have her driver\u2019s license, we could still walk there. I walked alongside Peggy as Boyd trotted excitedly ahead. I loved the park. It was big and was always crowded with kids of all ages. Boyd usually found a group of older boys to hang out with, leaving me alone. My heart soared in my chest as we neared the park and I saw the throng of kids running around in what looked like a massive game of tag. \n\nI barely paid attention as Peggy settled onto a bench with her book. I ran over to a crowd of boys and girls my own age and quickly joined their game, forgetting about Peggy and Boyd. We were playing hide-and-seek tag when I felt the first pebbles hit my shoulder. I looked over from my hiding spot behind a massive wooden tunnel and saw Boyd grinning at me. He bent down and scooped up another handful of gravel.\n\n\u201cCatch!\u201d he laughed as he pelted me with it. I flinched as tiny pebbles rained down on me. \n\n\u201cStop it!\u201d I told him. \n\nLaughing, Boyd scooped up another fistful of dirt and pebbles and threw them at me. I raised my hands in time to prevent them from flying into my face. At that moment, I felt a light slap on my back and turned around. A girl with blonde hair and pigtails grinned playfully at me.\n\n\u201cTag!\u201d she yelled, \u201cyou\u2019re it!\u201d A smaller boy was standing next to her. He goggled up at her with wide blue eyes and pointed at me with a sticky finger.\n\n\u201cYou it!\u201d he mimicked. \n\nA shower of pebbles rained down on myself, the girl, and the boy. The boy stumbled, pawing at his eyes and bawling. The girl turned to Boyd, her pigtails whipping as she spun her head at him. She glowered then, much to my surprise, marched over to him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare throw rocks at my little brother!\u201d she shouted, her hands on her hips.\n\nBoyd just laughed and picked up another fistful of pebbles. \u201cWhat are you gonna do about it, retard?\u201d he asked as he lobbed the rocks directly at the sobbing little boy. \n\n\u201cBoyd, stop it!\u201d I jerked back, not wanting to be pelted with pebbles. Boyd only laughed. I felt my face growing hot with anger. I bent down and scooped up a handful of pebbles. If Boyd was going to throw rocks, then so was I. I was sick and tired of being pushed around by him. I had a grand vision in my head of rallying the other kids and pelting Boyd with rocks, dirt, and pebbles until he ran away crying.\n\nI threw the rocks at Boyd. It felt good to watch them bounce off his chest and arms. I bent down to scoop up another handful and heard a sharp, angry voice yelling.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d A tall teenage girl was marching over to us. I looked over at the blonde girl, who was trying her best to comfort the crying boy. The blonde girl ran over to the teenager, pointing at me and Boyd.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re throwing rocks!\u201d she cried, \u201cand they hit Jimmy in the eye and he has rocks in his eyes now!\u201d\n\nThe teenage girl glowered at me and Boyd and I felt my heart sink. I looked down at the rocks I had clutched in my hands and let them fall back to the ground.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d demanded the teenager, her hands on her hips. \u201cPicking on little kids and throwing rocks!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever, butt-face,\u201d sneered Boyd, rolling his eyes. \u201cWe were just playing.\u201d\n\nThe teenager glared at him. \u201cThat\u2019s not playing, that\u2019s attacking,\u201d she scolded. I felt my face flush with shame. She scooped the little boy up. \u201cStop rubbing, Jimmy,\u201d she soothed, \u201cwe\u2019ll use some water to rinse out your eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019M BLIND!\u201d wailed Jimmy. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d soothed the teenager. \u201cYou just have some dust in your eyes.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat a retard,\u201d muttered Boyd under his breath.\n\nMuch to my surprise, the little blonde girl began to shriek. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad word!\u201d she yelled, \u201cthat\u2019s a bad word! Don\u2019t you dare say it! Don\u2019t you dare!\u201d\n\nThe teenager took her by the hand. She continued to glower at me and Boyd. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you playing with these rotten kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you playing with these rotten kids,\u201d mimicked Boyd, his voice a shrill falsetto. \n\n\u201cYou are a rotten kid,\u201d said the teenager calmly. \u201cAnd if I ever see you bothering the little kids again, I\u2019m not gonna be as nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d smirked Boyd, \u201cyou gonna tell my mommy on me?\u201d\n\nThe teenager rolled her eyes. \u201cYour mommy didn\u2019t love you enough to teach you good manners,\u201d snapped the little blonde girl. \n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said the teenager. \u201cHe\u2019s just a rotten little boy whose mother doesn\u2019t love him.\u201d The little girl followed her as she walked over to one of the benches. I hung my head, blinking back tears. \n\nIn that moment, I hated Boyd. I hated him so fiercely, I thought my chest would explode. I hated being associated with him and his meanness. Boyd rolled his eyes and stomped away, muttering about the whole group being stupid retards. I watched as the teenage girl walked back to one of the benches, set the little boy down, and fished a bottle of water out of a backpack. She tipped the little boy\u2019s head back and then gently poured the water into his eyes. He shrieked and flailed his arms. The blonde girl hugged him, wrapping her arms around him tightly and holding him still while the teenager rinsed dirt from his eyes. After a few minutes, he calmed down and the blonde girl wiped his face with her hands. I watched as she took him by the hand, led him over to the swingset, and began pushing him on the swings.\n\nIn that moment, I realized that this was how an older sibling was supposed to act. Older brothers weren\u2019t supposed to threaten to kick their little brothers down the stairs. They weren\u2019t supposed to punch them or stomp on their puzzles or throw rocks at them or threaten to smother them in their sleep. Older brothers were supposed to be good and kind to their little brothers. They were supposed to be protective, the way the blonde girl was protecting her little brother. \n\nCrying, I walked back to Peggy and sat down beside her. She looked up from her book. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You fall down?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cBoyd was throwing rocks,\u201d I sobbed.\n\nPeggy set her book down in her lap. \u201cBoyd!\u201d she yelled exasperatedly, \u201cdon\u2019t throw rocks!\u201d\n\nWithout waiting for a response, she got up, stretching. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said, \u201cif you\u2019re gonna be bad, we\u2019ll just go home.\u201d\n\nBoyd whined, but after a few minutes, half-heartedly followed Peggy and me home. Peggy settled down on the couch with her book, and I reluctantly took up my customary place on the floor with my puzzle. Boyd flopped down on the couch beside Peggy. \n\n\u201cCan I watch TV?\u201d he asked. \n\n\u201cSure,\u201d she muttered, not looking up from her book. \n\nI wanted to protest, to tell her that Boyd had been throwing rocks at me and other kids at the park and that he should be punished for it. He should be sent to his room. But Peggy hadn\u2019t seen any of it. I had thrown a fistful of pebbles and dirt right back at Boyd. I had been a part of the rock fight, minor as it was. If I told on Boyd, he\u2019d just tell on me, and we\u2019d both be sent to our rooms. And, once we were away from Peggy, Boyd would punch me in the arm or threaten to smother me with a pillow again. He might actually do it, too, after everyone else was asleep. \n\nI sat on the floor quietly while Peggy read and Boyd watched TV. When our parents got home, no one mentioned what had happened at the park.\n\n\u201cI hate seeing them watch TV on such a nice day,\u201d my mother told Peggy as she left. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take them to the park tomorrow?\u201d\n\nMy heart sank as Peggy agreed. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of going back to the park. Unless I remained by Peggy\u2019s side the entire time, Boyd would find ways to torment me, and other kids would get caught up in it. That night, I dozed fitfully, tossing and turning as I tried to come up with ways to avoid the park the next day.\n\nThe next morning, Peggy arrived at the usual time and took me and Boyd straight to the park. I watched as she sat down on one of the benches and immediately took her book out. Boyd wandered off, heading towards a group of older boys. I watched him go, desperately hoping that he\u2019d stay with them and leave me in peace. I saw most of the kids that I had seen the day before running around the park. The blonde girl and her little brother were holding hands as they ran past the see-saw. I approached them. I\u2019d had so much fun playing with them until Boyd had shown up. Maybe they\u2019d let me play with them again as long as Boyd was occupied with the older children.\n\nThe girl saw me and glared. She stepped protectively in front of her little brother. \u201cWe don\u2019t play with rock-throwers,\u201d she said firmly.\n\n\u201cThat was my brother,\u201d I said. \u201cI promise not to throw rocks.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I heard gravel crunching behind me and knew that Boyd was approaching. \u201cYou gonna play with the retards again?\u201d asked Boyd, punching my shoulder.\n\nThe girl\u2019s face grew bright red. \u201cDon\u2019t say that word!\u201d she yelled.\n\n\u201cRetard!\u201d shouted Boyd. \u201cRetard! Retard! Retard!\u201d\n\nThe little boy burst into tears. The girl scowled at Boyd. \u201cI\u2019m telling!\u201d she yelled as she grabbed the little boy\u2019s hand and fled, running off through the playground. Boyd laughed as we watched them go.\n\n\u201cThat was mean,\u201d I said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be so mean to people.\u201d\n\nBoyd rolled his eyes. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he said. He reached out and slapped my shoulder hard. \u201cTag! You\u2019re it! Now you have to chase me!\u201d\n\nHe turned and bolted, still laughing. I sighed heavily and plodded after him. If I didn\u2019t, he\u2019d just come back and taunt me. I also had the feeling that the blonde girl was informing her babysitter of what Boyd had said, and I didn\u2019t want to feel her wrath a second time. \n\nI trudged along, walking towards the edge of the playground. The playground was surrounded on three sides by a wooden fence. The fence was half-hidden by shrubs, probably in a weak attempt to discourage kids from climbing on it. The older kids had no problem finding foot- and hand-holds, and I had seen at least a dozen different people climb up over it. The fence blocked off a thickly wooded area. \n\nSure enough, Boyd had climbed the fence and was wandering along the treeline. I sighed, knowing that I\u2019d never be able to scale the fence and not really wanting to anyway. Part of me wished that the fence would magically double in size, stretching up towards the sky and forbidding Boyd from returning to the playground. I crouched in the shrubs along the fence and watched him. \n\nEvery now and then Boyd would stop and pick something up off the ground. It looked like he was picking up small rocks. My stomach clenched. Boyd wasn\u2019t content to throw tiny pebbles at me and the other kids in the park. He was picking up bigger rocks and putting them into his pockets, stocking up ammo for an impending war that he fully intended to win. \n\nI was debating whether or not to go and tell Peggy when the trees and bushes at the edge of the woods rustled. A man stepped out of the woods. He smiled broadly at Boyd and called out to him.\n\n\u201cHello there!\u201d he called. His voice seemed too happy, as if he was about to start laughing. \n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Boyd seemed disinterested. \n\nSomething about the man scared me. He didn\u2019t scare me the way Boyd did when he threatened to smother me with my pillow or when he punched me in the arm. There was something worse about the man. Something darker and more dangerous. Even though Boyd had threatened to smother me with my pillow while I slept, he had never come into my room at night. Whenever he punched me, he never left a mark or a bruise. He never hurt me that badly. \n\nBut something about this man scared me more than Boyd ever had. Something about him made me break out into goosebumps and shiver despite the heat. He reminded me of the Big Bad Wolf who lured Little Red Riding Hood further and further off the path until she was lost.\n\n\u201cI was hiking in the woods and lost my dog,\u201d said the man. He chuckled. \u201cShe slipped her leash and ran off. You think you could help me find her?\u201d\n\nI had learned all about stranger danger in school. A policeman had come into my classroom and told us that if a man ever asked us to get in a car to help him find a dog, we should run to the nearest adult and tell them. The policeman had said that we should never take candy or accept rides from men we didn\u2019t know. He told us that if a strange man ever came to pick us up at school and say that our parents had sent him, we had to tell a teacher right away.\n\nThis man wasn\u2019t asking Boyd if he wanted candy or if he wanted a ride anywhere. In fact, he didn\u2019t have a car at all. He had come out of the woods. Maybe that was why I didn\u2019t do or say anything when Boyd shrugged and agreed to help the man find his dog. Though stranger danger had been hammered into my head, it always involved a man with a car. \n\nMy vague sense of dread was instantly swallowed by relief when Boyd vanished into the woods. He was busy helping the man find his lost dog. He wouldn\u2019t be at the playground to throw rocks or insult the other kids or pick on me. I got up and ran back to the park. A pack of kids was running around. I could see the blonde girl and her little brother; she still held his hand.\n\n\u201cCan I play, too?\u201d I asked.\n\nThe girl frowned. \u201cWe don\u2019t play with rock-throwers,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut that was my brother!\u201d I said, \u201cI promise not to throw rocks or call names or anything! I just want to play!\u201d\n\nThe girl studied me. \u201cIs your brother gonna come and throw rocks or call names?\u201d she asked.\n\nI shook my head. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. The girl pursed her lips, frowning at me as she thought. I held out my hand, balling it into a fist and extending my little finger. \u201cI pinkie-swear.\u201d\n\nThe girl linked her pinkie with mine, forming the solemn bond of \u201cpinkie-swearing.\u201d Then she tagged me and ran away giggling. Laughing, I chased after her and was quickly enveloped by the other kids. I laughed and ran and climbed all over the playground, never once thinking of Boyd. \n\nI was so busy playing that I didn\u2019t notice the thunder rumbling overhead until I felt the first raindrop on my skin. I looked up at the sky, shocked to see that it had grown dark and gray. The kids scattered, running back to parents or babysitters. I made my back to Peggy, who was in the process of stuffing her book into her purse.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d she asked.\n\nI shrugged. Boyd was a forgotten shadow in the back of my mind. All I could remember was that he had spent the previous day throwing rocks at me and making another little boy cry. For the life of me, I couldn\u2019t remember seeing Boyd at all today. Peggy was looking around worriedly. Something nagged at the back of my mind, something telling me to head towards the fence and look out at the woods, but I brushed the thoughts aside. \n\nThe playground emptied quickly as the rain intensified. Peggy ran through the wooden structures, shouting for Boyd. Eventually, she ran to a house across the street and, sobbing, asked to use their phone. The police arrived within minutes. My parents were called shortly after. \n\nMy mother was hysterical. She screamed at Peggy, who sobbed uncontrollably. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you watching my son?\u201d she shouted, \u201cI\u2019m paying you to watch my sons, you stupid idiot! What the hell were you doing? You were supposed to be watching him!\u201d\n\nPeggy apologized profusely, shaking and sobbing. Tears streamed down her cheeks. I watched in horror as my mother reached out and slapped Peggy hard across the face. \n\n\u201cWhere is my son?!\u201d she screamed.\n\nMy father rushed forward, grabbing my mother by the arms and pulling her back. Policemen swarmed around her and Peggy, separating them. My mother sobbed, burying her face in my father\u2019s chest.\n\nMy father led my sobbing mother away from Peggy. When she looked up and saw me, her eyes lit up and she scrambled out of my father\u2019s arms. My mother grabbed me by the shoulders, her voice frantic as she demanded to know where Boyd was. \u201cEthan, did you see Boyd? Were you playing with him?\u201d she asked, \u201cwhere did you see him last? Did you see any strangers at the park today?\u201d\n\nThe word \u2018stranger\u2019 jolted my memory, and I remembered the man from the woods. If I told my mother, she\u2019d be furious with me. She\u2019d demand to know why I hadn\u2019t called an adult the minute I saw the stranger. She\u2019d demand to know why I hadn\u2019t stopped Boyd from going with him. \n\nShe\u2019d slap me the way she had slapped Peggy. Peggy was now speaking with policemen, her voice too low for me to hear. Would she go to jail? If she went to jail for failing to watch me and Boyd, what would happen to me? If everyone found out that I had seen Boyd walk off into the woods with a stranger, they\u2019d probably put me in jail too. I\u2019d be locked up and I\u2019d never get to come out. I\u2019d never get to play or watch TV or eat dessert.\n\nWorst of all, my parents would hate me. They\u2019d never love me again if they knew that I had seen Boyd walk away and done nothing. They wouldn\u2019t just punish me. They\u2019d stop loving me.\n\nI shook my head. I didn\u2019t want to get in trouble.\n\nThe search for Boyd lasted for months. The park was closed. Kids weren\u2019t allowed to play outside anymore. I sat in my room, listening to my parents worriedly talking with policemen in the living room. I\u2019d occasionally hear my mother shrieking and sobbing, demanding to know why her son hadn\u2019t been found yet.\n\nThough the search for Boyd only lasted for a few months, my parents\u2019 constant sobbing, their own personal torment, lasted for ten years.\n\nI have never told a soul that I had seen what had happened to Boyd. I know how much it hurt my parents. I know that my silence caused them unimaginable pain and suffering, and that I can never undo that. It is something that I deeply regret with every fiber of my being. I would gladly risk my mother\u2019s hatred if it meant taking away the pain she\u2019s suffered these last ten years.\n\nBoyd\u2019s body was found last month. A group of Girl Scouts had been out hiking in the woods. One girl had gotten separated from the group and had stumbled upon the remnants of a human corpse. The corpse was that of a ten-year-old boy. He\u2019d been tied to a tree with a dog leash. The police were called in immediately. The body was badly decomposed, having been mostly exposed to the elements and scavengers for a decade, but the dental records matched those of my older brother. \n\nI try hard not to remember the day Boyd went missing. I try not to think about the way he sneered at the little girl and her brother or the feeling of dread and dull anger that rose up in my chest as they glowered at us. I try not to think about the intense relief I felt when Boyd vanished into the woods. I try not to think about how much fun I had playing with the other kids while he was gone. I try not to think about the smiling man with the missing dog. I try not to think about the fact that the man wasn\u2019t holding a leash when he asked for Boyd's help.
