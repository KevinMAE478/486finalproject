Around six months after my second death, life was moving on for me. My former girlfriend and recent wife had given birth to little Kaia, a seven pound, six ounce ball of perfection. To say she was a good distraction from Death would be an understatement. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A brief bit of information on my situation. When I have been brought back from the edge of death, or beyond the edge it would seem, I have not simply been given a fresh, healthy body. I have been given the one I seemingly wished for. The one I awoke with before my death. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a visit to the doctor for what seemed like a random seizure, I had to go through a variety of pet scans, head CTs, and the annoying process of an MRI. After over a week of testing, I was given the news that I had an aggressive tumor. A rare form of astrocytoma (Are any tumors common? I mean come on, it&amp;#39;s always a rare tumor). It had progressed to the point of being inoperable. Not that it had a high operable rate to begin with. So, they gave me around four months to live, with chemo. Which I would have normally rejected, and lived out my days in a drunken haze. But I was a father now, and those choices weren&amp;#39;t just my own anymore. So I took the treatments. I tell you, I would take a car accident and a tree falling on me any day over cancer treatment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say I fought the long fight, and lived far longer than the doctors said I would. But I slowly lost control of my motor functions. Vomiting became a normal part of my schedule. Headaches, seizures, the works. I wish I could say I had a day of clarity in the end, but that would be lying. I died a slow, excruciating death for almost three months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then it was over. I awoke in The White Room in my chair, sitting across from Death himself. Well, herself this time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Death had taken the form of a young woman, maybe around twenty. She had a long scar down her face, loose blonde hair, and wore a strange looking tunic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was wondering when I would wake up here. You sure dragged this one out.&amp;quot; I said, enjoying my ability to breath and talk freely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was only there in the last moments, I&amp;#39;m afraid. What happens in your life is out of my hands, Kennon.&amp;quot; Death said, her voice calm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought on that, trying to keep my mind objective. I was actually happy to be out of my misery, and to relieve my family of the burden. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have thought about our conversations here. My wording is the only thing I can think of that has gotten me out of here, into my revival. So, anything I ask for is what I get?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That would be a way of looking at it, I suppose.&amp;quot; Death stated with a nod. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So if I ask to be revived, without the cancer, I would continue to live? I could see my baby girl grow up?&amp;quot; I asked, making sure not to make a request. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Death simply nodded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what if I asked to simply move on? To pursue whatever afterlife there is?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your choices are your own. Free will does not stop being relative in your afterlife. I am simply here to show you the door.&amp;quot; Death stated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded, thinking of another question. I had thought of many throughout my life, but only now did they seem to escape me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why are you a different person every time I come here?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They are different parts of me, as they are of you. To explain would be useless, I&amp;#39;m afraid. Just know that I am not bound to one form, let alone one physical form. I simply am.&amp;quot; She stated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What came before you?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I cannot say. Before me was the absence of life. When I took the first living being, I had only be in existence as a thought. I, or another power, simply willed myself into existence. There is no scientific explanation, if that is what you are searching for.&amp;quot; She stated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what about God? I would like to know his play in all this.&amp;quot; I asked, nearly excited for an answer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;God, as you know him, does not exist. A creator of the universe does, however. He, if he can be addressed as such, does not take a form such as I. I am here for life. His existence cannot be simplified with one reason, or any for that matter. He simply is, and isn&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot; Death said with a light shrug. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what about...&amp;quot; I began, but was cut off when Death raised her hand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kennon. It is time.&amp;quot; She said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded. My relationship with Death was growing into an odd one for sure. The more I asked, the more I understood that I didn&amp;#39;t understand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You already know my choice I guess. A scholar might wish for greater things, but I just want to live again, with my wife and child. Just...give me my life back. And take away any of my illnesses. Just, make me healthy.&amp;quot; I said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The words I spoke seemed a bit vain in hindsight. I could of asked for a world without war, or disease. Possibly. I still don&amp;#39;t know the full capabilities of Death&amp;#39;s powers, and I&amp;#39;m not sure I want to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Very well.&amp;quot; She said with a nod. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, once again, she was gone as if she had never been there to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked up to the door, twisting the handle quickly before stopping. I paused to think on my choice for a moment, and looked behind me. The room remained empty, but I was sure Death was watching. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you...&amp;quot; I said, and took my step back into life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I awoke with a start once again, life spreading throughout my body. Once I regained my composure, I made my way out of bed and into the hall. The door to my daughters room creaked open as I pushed it, and I watched my wife cradle our daughter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How&amp;#39;re the two most amazing women in my life doing?&amp;quot; I said,  my worries going to the back of my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just...perfect.&amp;quot; My wife said, whispering little coos to our child. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat across from them and just watched. It was a perfect scene, one I would remember forever. Moments of clarity are rare in our lifetime, and I would suggest you all sit down and smell the roses, at least once. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third time I met Death, it was one of the worst deaths I had to endure. Not because of the pain, or loss of my bodily functions, but because I had to leave behind the one thing I couldn&amp;#39;t. Many of you have said I keep coming back because I couldn&amp;#39;t let go of my worldly attachments. You may are right in a sense. But I have died a total of eight times. I ask that you save your judgements until you hear about the eighth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have experienced a lot in my lifetimes, more than I care to share honestly. I can\u2019t promise an ending full of answers and clarity, reality isn\u2019t as giving as we would like to think. I can promise a resolution though, and I hope you stick with me until then. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/652ofo/the_white_room_part_4/\"&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64ahar/the_white_room/)\n\n[Part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64jsub/the_white_room_part_2/?st=J1C8BVDM&amp;sh=f13d4b68)\n\nUnfortunately it would not be quite so long until my third death.
