I\u2019m a midnight listener.  There are many of us around the world, but as far as I\u2019m aware of, I\u2019m the only one on my campus.  During the day, I\u2019m your ordinary college student. But at night, more specifically during the hours of midnight to 2AM, I\u2019m the school\u2019s midnight listener. What I do is simple. I listen.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During these hours, students come into my \u201coffice\u201d \u2013 an old storage room in the top floor of my dormitory. They sit infront of a large black curtain that separates me and the student. That way, they can\u2019t see me, and neither can I see them. That\u2019s why students like to come to me instead of the school counsellors. They enjoy the anonymity, the privacy of being able to speak their mind about their worries and troubles without judgment or repercussions. So they lock the door, sit infront of the curtain, and then they speak. What they say is entirely up to them. Most of my sessions revolve around people talking about their family, relationship, and academic problems. Some speak about their mental illnesses and how they\u2019re coping. Some tell me secrets they\u2019re too ashamed to speak publicly of. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been running my sessions for a while now. I\u2019ve heard from many different people. Usually I listen, and then I forget. It\u2019s my coping technique for not empathising too strongly. However, there have been a couple of instances that particularly piqued my interest. This is one of them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Mike O\u2019Brien, a senior in my college. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A month ago, Mike vanished. At first, nobody batted an eyelid. This was college after all and people were bound to go AWOL for a while. But when all calls and messages to Mike went unanswered, people started panicking. The school was notified, who called Mike\u2019s parents, who called the police. Statements were taken and posters were printed. Search parties were organised, but none were successful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A week later, the police received an anonymous phone call about Mike\u2019s return to his dormitory. The caller was unable to provide any concrete proof. The call was subsequently treated as a prank, and was ignored. That same night, at around 4AM, the police received a second call about Mike. This time, it was from the school\u2019s residence office. The student living next to Mike\u2019s room had called up the office and complained about loud and repeated thumping noises coming from Mike\u2019s room. Half an hour later, the office sent someone up with a key, and Mike\u2019s body was subsequently discovered. He was hanging from the makeshift pull-up bar in his room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to the office staff, Mike\u2019s body was swaying from the rope, even though there was no breeze in the room. His feet made loud, steady thumping noises as they hit against the wall. The swaying promptly stopped right after Mike was discovered. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A review of the CCTV footage showed Mike stumbling back to his room. His body movements were consistent with that of a drunk. Nothing was amiss, except the fact that Mike was walking with a pronounced limp. Mike never had a limp at any point in his life. The coroners were unable to explain this, however. Mike\u2019s death was subsequently ruled as a suicide, although his one-week disappearance remained unexplained. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now up until this point, I\u2019d no personal interest at all in Mike\u2019s case. It was shocking, sure, but I didn\u2019t know the guy personally. So I didn\u2019t care. But that all changed the night Ryan came to speak with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a couple of nights after Mike\u2019s body was found. I\u2019d just settled down in my office when I heard the door squeak open. I couldn\u2019t see the door from my seat, but could make out a shadow drifting across the room before plopping loudly onto the chair across the curtain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMidnight listener here. How may I address you?\u201d I called out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence, and then an uncertain chuckle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou don\u2019t have to use your real name if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d I continued. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The silence continued, before a reply: \u201cRyan, I guess.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey, Ryan. Whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t know how to start. I guess \u2013 I just wanna make sure. You can\u2019t see me, right?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNot at all.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGood. I don\u2019t wanna be judged or anything, you know? I\u2019m gonna sound crazy but I gotta get this out of me. I can\u2019t tell the police or whatever, they\u2019ll just laugh at me. My mates, they\u2019ll put me in the loony bin or something.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI can\u2019t see you at all, Ryan.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGood, good. OK. I wanna talk about Mike. Mike O\u2019Brien. You know who he is, yeah?\u201d Ryan asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYes.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMike was my mate. We were good friends. I was with him, you know. When he was last seen alive. Heck, I was the one who brought him back to his dorm. We were coming back from a night out with some of the other guys. We were hanging out at the old campsite outside the town, you know the one?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSure.\u201d I knew what he was referring to. There was an old, abandoned campsite just a half hour\u2019s drive outside of town. It had been pretty well-frequented until a decade ago after a new campsite opened just further down the road. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah. It was our first time there, you know? We brought booze, food, music, and all that. Had a grand time. Then it was 4AM and we decided to leave. So we were on our way out and there was this huge tree just at the side of the path. The kind with lots of low and thick branches. So Mike, he gets this idea of doing pull-ups on it.\u201d Ryan laughed softly. \u201cYou know Mike?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou mean personally? No, I\u2019ve never met him.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, one thing you gotta know about Mike. He loves his body. Always working out at the gym, doing pull-ups and all that. Whenever he gets a chance, he shows off. That\u2019s Mike for ya. Anyway he jumps up and grabs the branches. A bunch of leaves came falling down. Was mad funny, really. Then I noticed something by the side of the tree, the side facing away from us. It was dark so I really couldn\u2019t be sure. But it looked like flowers and I don\u2019t know. Fruits? Like, just laying there.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFlowers and fruits. Like an offering?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah that\u2019s it. It looked just like an offering. So that obviously ain\u2019t a good idea right? To swing from the damn tree like that. But I didn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t wanna ruin the fun for everyone. Maybe I should have said something. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Ryan paused. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I waited patiently as he composed himself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSorry. Shit. I\u2019m sorry. Anyway the branch breaks. The one Mike was doing his pull-ups on. It breaks, and then Mike goes tumbling all over the offering. Steps right all over it. Fruits rolling away and all that. But he didn\u2019t know, he was too drunk. I should have said something. But I didn\u2019t. So that was that and then we left. On the way back, it felt weird. I can\u2019t say for sure why, just felt weird. Like everyone was having a good time in the car, but Mike was all quiet. Like contemplative, you know? It wasn\u2019t like him at all.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo Mike wasn\u2019t acting like Mike.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah. Exactly. He had this glassy kind of expression. So we figured, Mike was too drunk. I dropped everyone off at their dorms, but I personally brought Mike back to his room. I wanted to make sure he was okay, you know? And then he disappeared and we just about lost our minds. He\u2019d never go MIA without telling one of us. We were mates.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The conversation from then on veered towards Ryan\u2019s feeling of guilt for not warning Mike about the offerings. We continued to speak for over an hour, and then he left. It wasn\u2019t the most shocking of all sessions, but this was definitely one of the most interesting. It\u2019d piqued my interest. Ryan\u2019s account held elements of mystery and the paranormal \u2013 two things I\u2019d always been greatly interested in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That very night, upon returning back to my room, I proceeded to \u2013 for the lack of a better phrase \u2013 \u201cGoogle the shit\u201d out of the campsite. I wanted to know if there was anything about the strange offerings by the tree. It wasn\u2019t until the third page of the Google results that I noticed something interesting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a link to an old article, written about eight years ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read the article, and knew what had happened to Mike O\u2019Brien. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eight years ago, there was a man named Roger Oliver. He had worked in a woodchipping factory over in the next town. He had a wife and two sons, and was the sole breadwinner of his family. One day, he caught his foot in a woodchipper. The factory workers managed to pull him free, and he survived. But they couldn\u2019t save his foot. The factory declared him no longer fit for work and fired him. He was unable to find another job. Facing intense pressure from his wife and kids, he could no longer cope and snapped, emotionally. He grew depressed and suicidal. He drove up to the old campsite, where he\u2019d used to bring his family for hiking trips. It was the one place he had truly felt happy and loved. It was there at the campsite, two months after losing his job, that Roger Oliver hung himself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His body was found hanging from the tree, swaying gently in the breeze. His feet thumped steadily against the tree trunk. Thump, thump, thump. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His family, understandably distraught, had since visited the campsite monthly. Each time they visited, they would bring flowers and Roger\u2019s favorite fruits, and leave them by the tree that he had hung himself from. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After reading the article, I knew exactly what I had to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The very next morning, I got into my car and drove out of town \u2013 but not before taking a detour along the way to the grocery store. Half an hour later, I was at the campsite. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the gruesome event that had transpired in the campsite, I felt no sense of fear as I trekked inwards. The camp exuded a sense of sereneness and tranquillity. The air was quiet and still. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn\u2019t difficult to find the site of Mike\u2019s last night out. Unlike the rest of the campsite, the area was scattered with empty beer cans, food wrappers, and cigarette butts. I cleared up the area the best I could, cleaning the benches with wet wipes and tossing all the trash into a trash bag. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I went to look for the tree. As Ryan had mentioned, there were indeed offerings by the side of the tree. Trampled flowers laid by their side at the tree\u2019s base, while several slightly mouldy oranges and apples were scattered around. I rearranged these the best I could, before putting my own flowers and fruits at the side. \nAs I stood back up, something in the tall grass caught my eye. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a noose. An old, rotting noose. And next to it was a broken tree branch. The noose must have fallen down together with the branch that night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bent down and picked the noose up. I didn\u2019t really know what to do with it. But I knew that it didn\u2019t belong to the ground. I contemplated for a moment before hooking the noose back onto what was left of the broken branch on the tree. It just felt right, putting the noose back to where it was before Mike had brought it down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I stepped back, and cleared my throat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t really know what to say. All I knew was that I had to come and make things right. I know you loved the campsite, and you loved your family. So hopefully these,\u201d I gestured to the trash bag and the offerings, \u201cfixes things.\u201d I paused and sighed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAlso, I\u2019m sorry. For everything that happened. Mike was a good guy. People really liked him. But we all do stupid things sometimes. He didn\u2019t mean to step on your fruits and flowers, and to trash the place like that. But anyway, that\u2019s all history now. I hope I\u2019ve fixed things for you.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not really sure what to say anymore, I decided to leave. I grabbed the trash bag and headed for my car. As I neared the exit, a strong urge overcame me. For some reason, I felt the need to turn back, one more time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The noose was swinging. Back, and forth. Back, and forth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stood there, transfixed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, a coarse whisper emanated from all around me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThank you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "First, an introduction on what I do.

All I knew was that I had to come and make things right. I know you loved the campsite, and you loved your family. So hopefully these,\u201d I gestured to the trash bag and the offerings, \u201cfixes things.\u201d I paused and sighed. \n\n\u201cAlso, I\u2019m sorry. For everything that happened. Mike was a good guy. People really liked him. But we all do stupid things sometimes. He didn\u2019t mean to step on your fruits and flowers, and to trash the place like that. But anyway, that\u2019s all history now. I hope I\u2019ve fixed things for you.\u201d \n\nNot really sure what to say anymore, I decided to leave. I grabbed the trash bag and headed for my car. As I neared the exit, a strong urge overcame me. For some reason, I felt the need to turn back, one more time. \n\nAnd so I did. \n\nThe noose was swinging. Back, and forth. Back, and forth. \n\nI stood there, transfixed. \n\nAnd then, a coarse whisper emanated from all around me. \n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "64z9a3", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 539, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fifteenhours-creepy", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64z9a3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.nosleep", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/64z9a3/i_know_what_happened_to_mike_obrien/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492043555.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64z9a3/i_know_what_happened_to_mike_obrien/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "I Know What Happened to Mike O'Brien", "created_utc": 1492014755.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 37, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 539}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z9a3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z9a3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z9a3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z9a3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z9a3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8srx6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "howtochoose", "parent_id": "t1_dg74v19", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've read a couple of nosleep thatd fit this description though I can't remember them...\n\nThere was one about an old couple I think...cant remember what happens exactly...\n\nWould the justic/avenging stories fit in that sub?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read a couple of nosleep thatd fit this description though I can&amp;#39;t remember them...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was one about an old couple I think...cant remember what happens exactly...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would the justic/avenging stories fit in that sub?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "nosleep", "name": "t1_dg8srx6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492175637.0, "created_utc": 1492146837.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg74v19", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 21, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mymonstersprotectme", "parent_id": "t1_dg6zidv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nosleep", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Also kind of adorable\nLike the whole \"supernatural thing rescues you from something fucking scary\" thing so far.
