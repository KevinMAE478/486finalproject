In bitter cold weather, I tried to entice him into the basement (which didn't smell like my other cats because they aren't allowed down there), but he wanted nothing to do with being inside. Wasn't tempted at all. I knew there was no way I would ever, ever be able to bring him in. Five years is a long time for a feral cat to live around here, but still I was heartbroken when he stopped coming around. I miss George Foreman.\n\nPart 2: One summer day I looked outside and saw George, lazing and soaking in the sun. Draped on top of him, just as comfortable as could be, was an orange kitten. I was floored. George didn't like other cats (as evidenced by his nicked ears and occasional scratched nose). I could not believe my eyes. I figured the kitten must be his son--why else would he allow a kitten to hang around like that? The orange kitten, being much younger, was so much easier to socialize. It got used to being petted and picked up, but like George it didn't want anything to do with coming inside over the winter. It was energetic, jumpy, talkative, and squeaked at me every time it saw me. I named it Squiggy--because it was a squiggy little thing.\n\nPart 3: The following spring, I was sitting on the porch, petting Squiggy, and when I started petting at the base of the tail, his hind end raised. I looked down, and I saw something. Or rather, I *didn't* see something--testicles. Squiggy wasn't a boy--Squiggy was a girl. A year old unneutered orange girl. And it was springtime. That meant Squiggy was more than likely pregnant.\n\nPart 4: I didn't give Squiggy a choice. George Foreman had disappeared, and I couldn't bear the thought of her being alone, outside, with kittens. So I brought her in. Took her to the vet, got her the rabies shot, checked her for feline leukemia (negative!), and introduced her to the other cats. Then I waited. A couple weeks later, in a box in my bedroom, Squiggy gave me six babies. Beautiful babies. I eventually found homes for three of them, but each time I gave one away it took a piece of my heart with it. When there were three left, I knew I couldn't give any more away, so they stayed with me. \n\nPart 5: Squiggy never totally adjusted to being in a house with other cats. She's a jumpy, shy, skittish girl--she's still a squiggy little thing. I have to keep her and another, more aggressive female separated. Squiggy's not miserable by any means, but she's not as confident or outgoing as my other cats. Sometimes I think she might have been happier if I had left her outside, but if I had, she would probably be dead by now. And of her six kittens, probably only one or two would have survived to reach its first birthday. So although I sometimes wonder if I maybe should have left her outside, I always come to the same conclusion: I would make the same decision again, even knowing how things turned out. There's no alternate universe where I leave a sweet pregnant orange girl outside.\n\nSorry for how long this is. It's got to be way more than you ever wanted to know, but I felt compelled to share it. And now you know the story of how George Foreman brought Squiggy to me before he disappeared, and Squiggy gave me babies.\n\nI'm glad you took in a feral cat and made him a good home.
