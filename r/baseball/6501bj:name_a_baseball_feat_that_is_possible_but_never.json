I know that Burhle for example had a game where he faced the minimum (27) but only 26 of those batters had an at bat, which is &lt;a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHA/CHA200704180.shtml\"&gt;this game&lt;/a&gt;, where he walked 1 and then induced a double play.  According to bref there are a few other games similar to this (or better), but unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t have a baseball reference account so I can&amp;#39;t find the full information necessary to find out what game had the fewest at bats total.  Also, remember that these are just the games where the minimum was faced, which isn&amp;#39;t that important, a game with 5 walks and 4 GIDP would yield only 24 at bats for the opposing team for instance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: doing another search for just AB against and 9ip, there are a host of 24AB faced listed with box scores seen &lt;a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/play-index/game_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=basic&amp;amp;series=any&amp;amp;series_game=any&amp;amp;min_year_game=1913&amp;amp;max_year_game=2017&amp;amp;Role=anyGS&amp;amp;DEC=any&amp;amp;WL=any&amp;amp;team_id=ANY&amp;amp;opp_id=ANY&amp;amp;game_length=any&amp;amp;throws=any&amp;amp;HV=any&amp;amp;is_birthday=either&amp;amp;temperature_min=0&amp;amp;temperature_max=120&amp;amp;wind_speed_min=0&amp;amp;wind_speed_max=90&amp;amp;wind_direction_tolf=1&amp;amp;wind_direction_tocf=1&amp;amp;wind_direction_torf=1&amp;amp;wind_direction_fromlf=1&amp;amp;wind_direction_fromcf=1&amp;amp;wind_direction_fromrf=1&amp;amp;wind_direction_ltor=1&amp;amp;wind_direction_rtol=1&amp;amp;wind_direction_unknown=1&amp;amp;precipitation_unknown=1&amp;amp;precipitation_none=1&amp;amp;precipitation_drizzle=1&amp;amp;precipitation_showers=1&amp;amp;precipitation_rain=1&amp;amp;precipitation_snow=1&amp;amp;sky_unknown=1&amp;amp;sky_sunny=1&amp;amp;sky_cloudy=1&amp;amp;sky_overcast=1&amp;amp;sky_night=1&amp;amp;sky_dome=1&amp;amp;as=result_pitcher&amp;amp;class=player&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;type=p&amp;amp;c1criteria=AB&amp;amp;c1gtlt=lt&amp;amp;c1val=26&amp;amp;c2criteria=IPouts&amp;amp;c2gtlt=eq&amp;amp;c2val=9&amp;amp;c3gtlt=gt&amp;amp;c4gtlt=gt&amp;amp;c5gtlt=gt&amp;amp;c5val=1.0&amp;amp;location=pob&amp;amp;locationMatch=is&amp;amp;orderby=AB&amp;amp;number_matched=1&amp;amp;order_by_asc=1\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  There are also a bunch with lower than 24AB faced that I don&amp;#39;t have access to.  Point being there might&amp;#39;ve been a game with fewer AB or exactly that many AB already.  Just one such game from above is a nolan ryan game where he walked 6, gave up 1 hit, with 2 caught stealing, a GIDP, and a pickoff (yielding 24 AB for the opposing team, despite facing 30 batters).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "baseball", "name": "t1_dg6hznx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492057547.0, "created_utc": 1492028747.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6f24p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 51, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jherik", "parent_id": "t1_dg6duye", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/baseball", "controversiality": 0, "body": "so basically a perfect game and a pitcher who loses his perfect game to a 9th inning walk off solo shot. wow, losing that game would be the most heartbreaking thing ever.\n\nEdit: another thing I love about this is the only way it works is if the 9th hitter hits the walk off.
