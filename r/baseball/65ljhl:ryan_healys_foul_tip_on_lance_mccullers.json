In this case,  with the bases loaded, all the catcher would need to do is pick up the ball and step on the bag. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "baseball", "name": "t1_dgbk665", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492338973.0, "created_utc": 1492310173.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbjj4r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "El_Cholo", "parent_id": "t1_dgbj9m6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/baseball", "controversiality": 1, "body": "I understand.
