The drag on the ball as it travels at nearly 100 mph is pretty significant, so it loses several mph before reaching the plate, where it needs to be fouled (usually) to hit someone in the mask, taking away even more energy.\n\nFootball players who suffer helmet-to-helmet contact are taking as much force as the impacting player can generate, and concentrated in a small area comparable to a baseball's impact size. Impulse is certainly a factor, so the faster the impact happens, the more energy is transferred in a short time, thus increasing the severity of the hit and the likelihood of an injury.\n\nI opted for a lighter football player because linemen aren't usually moving very fast when they tackle players. Defensive backs are pretty much the only ones making open-field tackles at full speed, and they're generally pretty light comparatively. Even with a light player, the impact is more than 100x that of a baseball.

Impulse is certainly a factor, so the faster the impact happens, the more energy is transferred in a short time, thus increasing the severity of the hit and the likelihood of an injury.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opted for a lighter football player because linemen aren&amp;#39;t usually moving very fast when they tackle players.

As unreasonable as that may be, I just can&amp;#39;t stand them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a catcher myself. I notice that many catchers don&amp;#39;t even discard the traditional style masks when they&amp;#39;re making plays anymore. I&amp;#39;m not sure what the shift in ideology is on that, but for years and years the proper technique was to discard your mask if you were going to be involved in the play. &lt;em&gt;Especially&lt;/em&gt; on pop ups because you&amp;#39;re looking up and that is when the bars will block your view the most. The goalie style masks are cumbersome and\u200b not easy to get off and discard. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "baseball", "name": "t1_dgadt76", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492266613.0, "created_utc": 1492237813.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgad58p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hiei2k7", "parent_id": "t1_dgaczlt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/baseball", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Because the old mask doesn't stop them from your pocket sand, Dale?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the old mask doesn&amp;#39;t stop them from your pocket sand, Dale?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "baseball", "name": "t1_dgad58p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492265130.0, "created_utc": 1492236330.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaczlt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RustyShackleford14", "parent_id": "t1_dga9dda", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/baseball", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hopefully at least 1,000 years.
