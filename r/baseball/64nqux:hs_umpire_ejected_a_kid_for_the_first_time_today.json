High school senior year, slide into second, called safe.  Give a woo(ric flair style) to our bench as we were in the process of a huge rally on our rivals.  Our bench was going nuts, bases clearing double.  The umpire tossed me immediately for taunting.  I was in shock as I just hit the biggest hit of my career to that point.  By no means was I trying to show up the pitcher, or second baseman who tagged me.  We ended up winning the game, and I was suspended a game for being tossed.  My coach wasn't mad, and recognized it was a bad decision by an umpire that was being rode by the other team's coaches and crowd all day.  It sucked that I couldn't finish up a big win against a rival, and I had to leave the bench and hit the showers because of a rash decision by an ump.  He was having a bad day (had some questionable calls that went in our favor) and the crowd had been letting him know it all game.\n\n1. First time I was ever thrown out I was a hot shot 14 year old on the mound.  Our team was down big, as our starter had put us in a 7 run hole, and I came in with the bases loaded no outs.  I threw pretty hard for a 14 year old (high 70s maybe low 80s on a hot day), and was able to get away with just blowing kids away.  First two kids struck out no problem, third batter I couldn't buy a strike.

I said I do have a problem, you have no idea what a strike is nor do you understand the fact that the strike zone is defined as knees to the letters black to black over that plate 60 feet 6 inches from where I stand. He tossed me. ... and as he turned to toss me, i flipped the ball at his back.  It hit him harmlessly on the shoulder, but he lost it(understandably so).

Give a woo(ric flair style) to our bench as we were in the process of a huge rally on our rivals.  Our bench was going nuts, bases clearing double.  The umpire tossed me immediately for taunting.  I was in shock as I just hit the biggest hit of my career to that point.  By no means was I trying to show up the pitcher, or second baseman who tagged me.  We ended up winning the game, and I was suspended a game for being tossed.  My coach wasn&amp;#39;t mad, and recognized it was a bad decision by an umpire that was being rode by the other team&amp;#39;s coaches and crowd all day.  It sucked that I couldn&amp;#39;t finish up a big win against a rival, and I had to leave the bench and hit the showers because of a rash decision by an ump.
