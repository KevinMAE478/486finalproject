Runner is in foul territory.  Pretty good angle.  At 40, most of my catching time is behind me, but I want to get our catcher to try this play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Irony is, this play makes it somewhat easy to steal home.  It pulls the catcher out from directly behind the plate, meaning more of a reach tag than just dropping the glove.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree on the pitch and the excellent bunt.  I&amp;#39;m curious as to the number of walk-off bunts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit:\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-2AvH-3umY\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-2AvH-3umY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rare though, as my difficulty sifting through a google search is telling me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walk off bunt is a much more common play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXu6rsTbCoY\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXu6rsTbCoY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "baseball", "name": "t1_dg69khz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492048899.0, "created_utc": 1492020099.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg69189", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tulowithskiis", "parent_id": "t1_dg5pyk0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/baseball", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hard to catch a fastball way outside then throw behind the runner at third.  \nThe batter is right handed, and the pitch takes you to your right.  \n\nThe pitch was a low breaking ball outside, it was a very nice bunt or a very tough pitch to bunt - only thing that might've been better would've been a high fastball, but those are easy to drive into the OF for a sac fly so if they called that and the batter doesn't square for a bunt it's not looking good.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hard to catch a fastball way outside then throw behind the runner at third.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe batter is right handed, and the pitch takes you to your right.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pitch was a low breaking ball outside, it was a very nice bunt or a very tough pitch to bunt - only thing that might&amp;#39;ve been better would&amp;#39;ve been a high fastball, but those are easy to drive into the OF for a sac fly so if they called that and the batter doesn&amp;#39;t square for a bunt it&amp;#39;s not looking good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "baseball", "name": "t1_dg69189", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492048352.0, "created_utc": 1492019552.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5pyk0", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jjc55", "parent_id": "t1_dg5l2b0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/baseball", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Catcher misplayed.
