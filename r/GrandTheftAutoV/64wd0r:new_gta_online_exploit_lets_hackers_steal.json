And why if some one wants to find some one to play with it is hard to find anyone who won&amp;#39;t just assume that they aren&amp;#39;t some one like you and don&amp;#39;t just shoot first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will say you will get my friend who I keep trying to tell to stop even responding to trolls though (he will send nasty notes or try to kill them. I only do when I&amp;#39;m bored and don&amp;#39;t really care and actually do want to start a fight. People like you are useful that way cause I don&amp;#39;t enjoy trolling people as I want them to be having as much fun as I am having but I figure you want to play like that so I don&amp;#39;t feel bad messing with you. And hell... people like you, I wouldn&amp;#39;t feel bad if some how you aren&amp;#39;t having fun and get pissed off. I find people who enjoy pissing people off have really thin skin when they find the other person isn&amp;#39;t an easy kill or even just manages to get a kill on them. Hell... I&amp;#39;m not a good player but I did manage to kill some one who had killed me 20 times over... you should have heard him whine like crazy over that one lucky shot I got... it was really sad. He was so pissed and acted like I was in the wrong for actually killing him (hell, he could have even gloated that it was a lucky shot but instead he decided to get all pissy because I dared actually manage to kill him once). Oh yeah, and there are the ones who disappear soon as they realize that you might actually get a hit on them... as i said, I find people who like pissing people off are really thin skinned about getting shot back. They can dish it out but they sure can&amp;#39;t take it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GrandTheftAutoV", "name": "t1_dg6bhr0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492050869.0, "created_utc": 1492022069.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6516e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Thebillofrights", "parent_id": "t1_dg5yplx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GrandTheftAutoV", "controversiality": 1, "body": ".....you're my favorite person to troll in GTA", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;.....you&amp;#39;re my favorite person to troll in GTA&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "GrandTheftAutoV", "name": "t1_dg6516e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492044300.0, "created_utc": 1492015500.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5yplx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tigress666", "parent_id": "t1_dg5w1kz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GrandTheftAutoV", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Well blame the randoms that make it really unfun to play in a public server.
