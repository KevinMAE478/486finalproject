I'm talking about deep south construction yard racism. Most of the time it is just humor and off color jokes. Literally the only difference between 85% of their racist shit and racist jokes you find on that sub are that they really do believe what they're saying. They wouldn't admit it if you called them out on it because they're not morons and understand that it's social suicide to be labelled a racist, but if you don't call them out and you let them prattle on they eventually get to the \"Black people used to know their place\" sorts of sentiment that they hide beneath their humor. \n\nRacist jokes are racist. There are people who are frankly just a little racist (most of us have some level of racism in us whether we're aware of it or not) who love their racist jokes but know they're just jokes. Those people generally feel the intent of what they say should be the major factor in how people interpret their humor, but the problem with that is that people who are tremendously racist (these people sometimes also have a hard time seeing themselves as such) are to varying degrees indistinguishable from people who are just telling jokes. The only way you'll really ever know that a person has deep seated and truly disgusting racist views is to know them long enough that they think they can trust you to not destroy their career and life by telling other people what they're like when it's just them and their racist as shit friends. That's why when I see racist jokes now I can't see them as just jokes anymore. It's a red flag.

I&amp;#39;m talking about deep south construction yard racism. Most of the time it is just humor and off color jokes. Literally the only difference between 85% of their racist shit and racist jokes you find on that sub are that they really do believe what they&amp;#39;re saying. They wouldn&amp;#39;t admit it if you called them out on it because they&amp;#39;re not morons and understand that it&amp;#39;s social suicide to be labelled a racist, but if you don&amp;#39;t call them out and you let them prattle on they eventually get to the &amp;quot;Black people used to know their place&amp;quot; sorts of sentiment that they hide beneath their humor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Racist jokes are racist. There are people who are frankly just a little racist (most of us have some level of racism in us whether we&amp;#39;re aware of it or not) who love their racist jokes but know they&amp;#39;re just jokes. Those people generally feel the intent of what they say should be the major factor in how people interpret their humor, but the problem with that is that people who are tremendously racist (these people sometimes also have a hard time seeing themselves as such) are to varying degrees indistinguishable from people who are just telling jokes. The only way you&amp;#39;ll really ever know that a person has deep seated and truly disgusting racist views is to know them long enough that they think they can trust you to not destroy their career and life by telling other people what they&amp;#39;re like when it&amp;#39;s just them and their racist as shit friends.

Subs like that, intentionally or not, provide a safe space for racist people to air out their views&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as they aren&amp;#39;t organizing raids and impacting people in real life, ... which generally just means abiding by reddits rules, this really isn&amp;#39;t a problem even if its true. Plus as far as I can tell I haven&amp;#39;t seen them ban people for random arbitrary reasons, so at least you can disagree with them on their own grounds. Granted it will get you banned from &lt;a href=\"/r/offmychest\"&gt;/r/offmychest&lt;/a&gt; but there you go&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Claiming it&amp;#39;s just humor is the number one defense that actually racist people will fall back on when they&amp;#39;re called out, so a sub that is largely about being able to tell racist jokes does inevitably support the racist community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right... but I feel if we broke down your &amp;#39;genuinely racist&amp;#39; definition I feel like it would hit a lot of things I don&amp;#39;t consider racist and be so all-encompassing that the word stops meaning anything. I also reject your claim that this type of humor somehow supports a racist narrative, if anything it breaks down the subject to point out its absurdity. You know a lot of people of all sorts of colors like this kind of humor right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And bare with me a second (and ignore me lumping a bunch people into one term), lets do a thought experiment. I don&amp;#39;t know where the stereotype comes from to be honest, but what if someone makes a &amp;quot;asians are shitty drivers&amp;quot; joke on reddit? Or youtube? Is this allowed or should they be banned? What about in real life? To the gulags for them or what? I&amp;#39;ve heard numerous asian comedians of all stripes do this routine, is it fine when they do it? Come to think of it I&amp;#39;ve heard a few black comedians make these jokes, are they allowed to? Or is it only white people or anonymous people (because they might be white) that aren&amp;#39;t allowed? Just trying to find your line, because my line was at the beginning with &amp;quot;Its all ok because its humor&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now to go a little further, what if insurance companies start charging all asian people more because according to their statistical data Asians get into far more accidents (for the sake of argument, I dont know if that is true) Would this be acceptable? At this point its not humor its an actual action. Heck, what if you replaced &amp;quot;asians&amp;quot; with a gender instead, would that still be acceptable or unacceptable?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "mildlyinfuriating", "name": "t1_dgdzaod", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492486191.0, "created_utc": 1492457391.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdurce", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "All_Fallible", "parent_id": "t1_dgdq92n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mildlyinfuriating", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I know where you're coming from, but that's not so far removed from \"If you don't like the racism you see in the south then just don't live there.\"\n\nIt's not about seeing it.
