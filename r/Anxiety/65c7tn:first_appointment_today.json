I wasn&amp;#39;t able to focus much on work before I went, but I thought I was handling it pretty well (not panicking or crying). But then I got to the office and had to fill out initial paperwork that asked me to discuss why I was going to therapy and started to panic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me what helped (a little anyways) was realizing, I&amp;#39;m going to a psychologist and they&amp;#39;re the ones trained to handle anxiety (and depression in your case). They&amp;#39;ve seen people like me before and they will understand (a lot better than somebody who doesn&amp;#39;t even understand anxiety). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, better close to the beginning, my therapist mentioned I would probably be feeling pretty anxious the first few sessions and that was normal/okay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure if it helps in your case, but it definitely did in mine!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "name": "t1_dg9lwu3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492226470.0, "created_utc": 1492197670.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
