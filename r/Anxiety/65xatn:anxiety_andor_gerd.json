I went the ER and for the millionth time my heart was fine but they did mention that I had acid reflux. I\u2019m not sure how they could tell. I went to my primary care dr and he thought I had functional dyspepsia.  He started me on a course of different antacids all of which didn\u2019t work, even half a year on them without a change in my symptoms. I eventually had every test known to man ran to try and find the cause as started to impact my life on the same level as my anxiety. Long story short, there is absolutely nothing wrong with me it seems. No hiatal hernia, bacterial infection, no abnormalities with my lower esophageal sphincter. My kidneys, gallbladder and liver are all perfectly fine. The thing that puzzles me is that when I had my upper GI endoscopy the gastroenterologist said he couldn\u2019t even see any signs of acid damage and ruled out even having reflux. Just prior to this test I honestly felt like my stomach was going to split open it felt so bloated. His diagnosis was that my issues were anxiety related. My primary doctor agreed with his results. This leaves me at a loss on how to continue towards a fix. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t make sense that it only happens just after I eat and not during one of my anxious episodes.
