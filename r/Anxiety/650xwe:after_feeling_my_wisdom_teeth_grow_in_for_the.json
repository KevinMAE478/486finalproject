She is one of the nicest people I&amp;#39;ve ever met and working for her is absolutely amazing. I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to tell her my fears about the dentist and ask her if she&amp;#39;d be willing to take me on as a patient but have never had the courage. About a month ago I felt two pokey nubs in the backs of my mouth and sure enough they&amp;#39;ve formed into little teeth. My stomach has been in knots everyday since.

My wonderful boyfriend listened to me as I cried about how worried I was and he asked what other things I&amp;#39;m feeling anxious about.

Wednesday morning as I pulled into her driveway I thought &amp;#39;fuck it. Ask her now of continue to feel like shit.&amp;#39; I told her about my lack of dentistry in the past few years, how stupid I feel because of it, how scared I am in general, how I know I need extensive work.

She wants to get me back and track and feels horrible that I&amp;#39;ve had such negative dental experiences. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on cloud nine today.
