I find sometimes I&amp;#39;ll just be driving along and then suddenly can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about the black void.  It used to haunt me for like an hour after that.  But now I try to think my way out of it instead of pushing the thoughts away (which just make them stronger).  One thing I find helpful is talking to a friend about my fear.  She provides different perspectives that help me think of it a little differently. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing I try is thinking two very specific thoughts.  I have the ability to live my life to it&amp;#39;s fullest right now.  And if I do that, maybe when it comes time that will be enough.  Maybe I will have seen and done enough and be ready for it then.  The second thought is this is the anxiety beast trying to control me and I try to compartmentalize those thoughts.  It takes a lot of practice but now when I have those thoughts I can think my way out of them in a couple of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also try r\\aww.  Seriously.  Looking at cute and happy pictures really helps&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps and doesn&amp;#39;t make it worse!

Another perspective from Wittgenstein:\n\n&gt; Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death.
