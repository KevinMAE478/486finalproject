For most my life, I had to prepare all the food I ate or at the very least, eat alone in my room.\n\nAnd just FYI, I am a 29year old male. This wasn't body image issues. This was a specific intense anxiety hovering around eating. It made it so I would sometimes go as long as 6 to 7 days without any food. It would make me gag. I could still drink things luckily.\n\nFor me, when I was on the right medication and at a particularly smooth part of my life, I had little-to-no issues eating infront of others at all. In my recent relapse, it's come back in full force.\n\nI don't know what the root cause of your anxiety is. Mine was based on an intense fear of vomiting, based on an early childhood traumatizing near-asphyxiation event. The logic started with a simple \"If I dont eat, I cant be sick.\"\n\nThis toxic thought grew as I did, unabated, turning into a crippling phobia. \n\nI hate to mention them but Benzodiazapines fixed it nearly instantly. Its what the hospital always used to get me out of a 7 day fast. I don't like this solution, but if you had a \"take as needed\" prescription for a very occasional xanax or klonopin, that would be the most immediate help.\n\nBut most importantly, you need to find peace on this issue. You need to accept it. There's nothing wrong with you. You aren't doing anything wrong. It's very simple and not the least bit complex. You, like others, have a fear of eating in public. And that's ok. \n\nTo reduce nausea for me without medication, meditation was key. Minutes into a mindfulness meditation, with deep breathing, my stomach would growl and start to crave food. The deep breaths bring fresh oxygen to your system. It reduces Cortisol and Adrenaline and stops the panic system. You start to relax and find peace. \n\nYou learn that you are who you are. It's not a flaw. As I accepted it, and continued to meditate and practice ACT therapy, my symptoms would lessen and I would be more able to eat and feed myself.\n\nYou are safe. If you don't eat that night, its ok. You're allowed. You're not broken. Accept it. Don't fight your thoughts.
