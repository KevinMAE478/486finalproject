It&amp;#39;s a warning so that when you start taking these, the first week will feel funny. Hang in there, it usually stabilizes after a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, that&amp;#39;s the nice thing about Lexapro: it appears to hit full effect in as little as 2 weeks. Most SSRIs take 3 to 6 to reach full effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing about Lexapro is that it&amp;#39;s probably a love-it-or-hate-it drug. If it works for you, it&amp;#39;ll work great. Otherwise, it&amp;#39;ll probably be not-so-fun and you should try a different drug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Definitely give it at least 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was on it, I was only taking 5mg / day. Worked great. Full emotional range and all my worrying thoughts seemed to have this abstract &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot; to them so that I could think about them rationally, rather than panic and obsess about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, my mood when on Lexapro usually comes back to upbeat and relaxed, rather than depressed and anxious. It&amp;#39;s a Good drug in my opinion. Virtually no side effects, as far as I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "name": "t1_dgcza0e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492425153.0, "created_utc": 1492396353.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rgir", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rgir", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcvypm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "oddreyjo", "parent_id": "t1_dgct74n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Anxiety", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Unfortunately I can't answer this question properly, as I'm lucky to still be under my parent's health insurance right now, which is pretty good.
