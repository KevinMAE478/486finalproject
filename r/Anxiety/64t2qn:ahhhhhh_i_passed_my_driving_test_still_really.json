I got my learner&amp;#39;s permit in October, and have been practicing more or less once a week since then, even if its just driving to the store or something. Every single time I drive I&amp;#39;m extremely anxious from start to finish. Stoplights make it worse, going 35+ makes it unbearable and there are any cars around me it makes it a lot worse.

It doesn&amp;#39;t make me high or euphoric or speedy or anything, but it makes me wayyy more calm, alert, and a noticeably better driver. The past few weeks leading up to the actual road test have been absolutely miserable. I don&amp;#39;t even care about getting my license or not, I was just really worried about having to sit for two+ weeks in dread until I can take the test again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My driving test was this morning at 9:30. Didn&amp;#39;t have much sleep since I had a panic attack the night before because of the test, but I took some Vyvanse at around 8:00am since I sure as hell didn&amp;#39;t want to chance this. My Grandpa picked me up at 8:30am to warm up a bit before the test. I was so nervous I could barely even talk. There were two people there giving the test, a nice friendly black lady and then a bigger guy with resting bitch face. I was praying that I got the girl and thank god that I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we go out to the car and have some friendly small talk, just about how I&amp;#39;m nervous and her saying &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t worry just pretend we&amp;#39;re going to a basketball game together, it&amp;#39;s going to be a good time!&amp;quot;. We get in the car and I start getting super nervous and realizing that this is actually happening &lt;strong&gt;right now at this exact moment&lt;/strong&gt;  and the next 10-15 minutes will decide my life for the next few weeks. I knew I was exaggerating at the time but my anxiety didn&amp;#39;t think so lmao. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The test went okay for the most part. She kept quickly jotting down things and circling them in her notepad so I was getting super nervous thinking I kept fucking up a bunch of things, but when we got back to the DMV I saw that it was just her writing &amp;quot;OK&amp;quot; on every section. She told me I only had three points (you can have up to 25, more is bad) and that I passed!!! That was probably one of the most relieving moments of my life especially because of how terrible the past few weeks have been.
