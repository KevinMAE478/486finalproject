Being on medication and doing yoga/exercise has gotten my anxiety to a very manageable state, but what you've described above is something that I still struggle with. It's been the hardest thing for me to overcome. And I am a person who has made more than a few life-altering mistakes. Some mistakes I've made could've resulted in way worse of an outcome than they did, but I got away by the skin of my teeth somehow. I worry that some day my luck will run out. But I digress. You aren't alone in how you feel and please don't feel like a failure for not being able to overcome it because it is hard! \n\nWhat has helped me is the realization that the feelings of guilt and shame are actually a good thing. It means you've grown as a person, that you possess the self-awareness to understand the impacts of the choices that you make, or have already made, and that you are mature enough to take responsibility for those choices. Congratulations, you've leveled up! Seriously though, the older I get, the more I realize how many people DON'T possess those traits. Sometimes, I wish I didn't because it causes anxiety. But be thankful that you do, because this is how we become better people and move forward in life. Some people honestly never do and blame others for their shortcomings, repeat the same mistakes, and end up becoming their own worst enemy. \n\nMaking mistakes is simply a part of being human. It doesn't make you stupid, reckless, careless, or a bad person. It's wonderful to feel things such as pride, happiness and contentment. It makes our lives feel worth living. But it's not realistic to expect to feel those good things all of the time. Shame, guilt, and anxiety are also part of life and part of being human. I know it's hard, but you've got to accept that. It's OKAY! Nobody on this planet handles every situation perfectly or makes all the right decisions. Everybody has been at the receiving end of undesirable consequences from poor choices they've made. It's what makes us human. \n\nAllow yourself to feel these bad feelings, but know that dwelling on them is unproductive. Turn it into a positive by extracting a lesson from it. Every mistake has a positive side. \n\nThe mistake itself doesn't matter. It's over and done with. You can't go back and change it. All that you have control over now is how you choose to proceed: do you choose to dwell on it and continue to beat yourself up over it (which will accomplish nothing), or do you choose to learn, grow, and move on a wiser and more humble person? Notice the word \"choose\". It is a choice that you can make, that you have control over NOW. No matter which option you choose, it won't change the mistake, so you may as well choose to move on and be happy, and be wiser the next time around and let the past bury its dead. I know that's easier said than done, but sometimes just realizing that can help. \n\nAnyway, I hope this has helped. I wish you the best of luck. Every mistake has a positive side to it, even if it's hard to find...remember that! Forgive yourself and stay optimistic about the future.

You could even go to counseling if it is offered on your campus. People will understand. You are not alone in your struggles. Besides that, I had to really get a hold of my negative thought patterns. Now when I begin to have negative self-talk, I stop myself and correct the thought. Would you call your friend a loser? Would you consider a family member who made a mistake a total failure? Don&amp;#39;t treat yourself worse than you would treat them in the same situation.

It's a prominent train-of-thought that I run into and I can't really answer it very well.\n\nWhat I've been told that helps combat this worldview:\n\n1) People are obviously more critical of themselves than of anyone else.  This means in a way you and I are not alone in being self-critical, but also that people aren't even focusing on your own self-criticism.  If you're self-critical about something in the present, it helps to realize the likelihood of anyone else being super-critical of you is very very low.  They're too focused on themselves.  They'll notice their shoes are untied before they notice yours are, if they even notice yours at all.\n\n2)  There's a middle-ground to find between self-examination and just letting life live.  Though I'm stuck in this \"best-person-I-can-possibly-be\" mindset, I can at least admit I'm not the best person I can possibly be if I'm too stuck in my room contemplating my mistakes to even be an active individual.\n\n3)  I don't know why the fuck I'm so afraid of making mistakes.  Mistakes are fantastic.  They are what makes us grow as humans.  I should be making more mistakes, to be frank.  Sometimes my anxiety is so bad I'm scared of tripping in a public place; but in retrospect it would actually be fucking hilarious if I fell flat on my face.  I would laugh about that if it actually happened.  I mean, I always thought of myself as a person who doesn't take himself too seriously, but wow my anxiety really challenges that idea of myself.\n\n4)  I often don't trust myself enough.  Most mistakes we make in life we'll never repeat, but I still often keep myself on my toes about making some dumb mistake again when really, in reality, I more than likely won't make that mistake ever again.  This doesn't apply to every mistake in the world, but it applies to most of them.  So it's like being too ready, to cautious, when you really don't need to be.  I'm slowly working my way out of this.\n\nIt took a lot of repetition to learn most of these principles, funnily enough.
