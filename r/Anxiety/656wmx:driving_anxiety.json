Think school parking lots after hours, church parking lots, Walmart parking lots when it's not busy, etc.  You can practice skills like turning, merging, parking, and staying in your lane over and over, as many times as you need, as slowly as you want, without worrying about hitting anyone or driving off the road. That way, you can build up your confidence in a 100% safe environment, so when you go out on the road, you have the muscle memory and the confidence to help you do well and not panic.\n\n- Getting someone besides my parents to help me practice.  My parents are awesome, but when I was learning to drive, my mom had recently been in a car accident, so she had major anxiety around driving and being in cars, which made everything more stressful for me, and my dad's teaching style was also incredibly stressful.  When I realized practicing with them wasn't helping me, I ended up doing most of my practice with my brother-in-law, who was a super patient teacher, and it was so much better!  Do you have any local uncles or aunts, cousins, neighbors, adult friends or siblings who are more calming, and would be willing to help you get your practice in?\n\n- My mantra when learning to drive was \"what one man can do, another can do\".  Reminding myself of all of the people I know who are much younger than me, or seem less capable than me, but who still manage to safely drive every day was a helpful way to remind myself that the issue wasn't with my ability, but with my state of mind.  People from all backgrounds and abilities successfully drive every day, and so can you!\n\n- Tina Fey, who is very successful and generally awesome, doesn't have a drivers license.
