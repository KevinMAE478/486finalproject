I ended up setting up my own Selenium testing environment and writing scripts for testing different websites.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I feel comfortable with how to break a problem down and how best to solve it with code, I&amp;#39;ve dabbled with javascript (frustrating at first, but I&amp;#39;m fairly comfortable with it now) and my next &amp;quot;for fun&amp;quot; thing will be &lt;a href=\"https://www.fullstackpython.com/\"&gt;Full Stack Python&lt;/a&gt;  I might be interested in web development so I&amp;#39;ll give it a try, but I really, really enjoy writing up automated test scripts and working on things from that angle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tldr: Find tutorials online. Go through them. Figure out what you like working with. Go deeper on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And thank you codyloydl for reminding me about The Odin Project!
