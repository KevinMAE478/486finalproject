You can see that the each lesson is well categorized or divided making it simple for beginners to understand and also you don't need to read like 3-5 pages before you code, Just read some few sentences and examples then the tutorial will give you a problem to solve. It teaches you well on small steps and I believe anyone who wants to learn to code will be able to understand this tutorial well. Also I don't used a lot of reference for now since I'm on the Part-I of [mooc.fi](http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/material.html)  which I find a very convenient way to learn for someone like me who is just starting. For me its easy to remember and I absorb the information well. \n\n**By Watching Videos:**\n\nThere are some lessons or topic that I need a good simulation or break down from it which I find some videos really useful. I was having problems understanding a control structure before and it was the \"For Loops\" then I found these videos: [example1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJSshtWdXRY), [example2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jA9mPPoXu0), and those simulation on videos help me to understand things in a much clearer way.\n\n**CONS:**\n\n**By Reading &amp; By Watching Videos:**\n\nFor me its not really which material you used its how the material is made. So there are some reading tutorials I found that I need to read like 5 pages of a book or PDF before I can do some coding, same on a video, I attended an online tutorial which there is a instructor (live) and he teaches things fast and just writes code and let us code after the tutorial and he want us to rewrite the code that he wrote which I find so boring and I ended up quitting on it. Lessen the boredom as much as possible by making things clear and simple, and if necessary make \"real-world\" examples to help some people that are just starting.\n\nA well categorized and well divided lessons will help a lot of newbies  coder like me and also by doing this I find my self getting less or avoid being bored, I still get bored when I get stuck on a problem and I find it normal now I just take a break and get back to it later, but not like the one I mentioned that I quit because I felt like I'm reading a novel or watching a non-stop movie. Don't get me wrong I enjoy what I'm doing but getting bored sometimes is unavoidable. **By doing** is the best way for me to learn with a well structured material.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nNOTE: English is not my first language :)\n\nEDIT: edited/added some missing words.", "edited": 1492323180.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me both:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Reading:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently learning Java and I&amp;#39;m still on basics and the one that I&amp;#39;m using is &lt;a href=\"http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/material.html\"&gt;mooc.fi&lt;/a&gt; and just by looking/reading on that tutorial you will know what I mean.
