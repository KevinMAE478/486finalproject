Suggest the book, it doesn't matter if people pirate it or not, because the publisher has nothing to do with it, they buy at random places, where they find the book, or pirate it.\n\nBy adopting a book as a required textbook we get access to the resources that come with the book.  There are dozens of books on just about every topic, publishers aren't giving all of that stuff away without some presumption of revenue.\n\n&gt;What? So? That makes no sense, corporations can spend hundreds of thousands to use a software or to follow the law, the students shouldn't, they are individuals trying to learn, they are not earning money from that, they will when they work for a company, so the company will gladly pay the license.\n\nWhy should students not be expected to pay for things?  Teachers and profs are getting paid to be there after all, why should the people who create course material not get paid? \n\n&gt;You want to use slides making a deal? Pay from your pocket, not the students. Or the university can pay, we have nothing to do with it.\n\nYou realise that students would pay either way right?  Just like with software, for us to make it available to you on university computers means we need to pay for it.  If universities started paying (and it would have to be the university, since I'm working in my capacity as a university employee), that is just one more cost that gets passed on to students.  \n\nAt least you can keep the book and have it for later.  \n\n&gt;Why isn't that done in the US?\n\nI'm not in the US.\n\n&gt;That book was made in 1981, seriously, just because they republished changing some details it doesn't make it recent, it's old asf, that just gives them the copyright for more than 40 years, it's fucked up.\n\nThere's no question parts of the book are from the 1980's, but quite a lot has changed since the 1980's too.  The WWW wasn't even a thing back then, all of the standards bodies that have come into being since, all of wireless networking, modernizing security etc.  \n\nThe biggest problem with the book is that, being from 2011, there are some new technologies it doesn't cover (or cover enough), and it covers a number of technologies that for never really caught on, which was why they kept revising the book since the 1980's.  \n\n&gt;They are classical for a reason, they shouldn't profit from the book after 40 years, we shouldn't have to pay a huge fee for that.\n\nAs though revising new versions of the book is no effort.  \n\nAlso, copyright is life of the author + 50 or + 70 years, depending on which country you are in.   And if you're in the business of writing books that's how you make your living.  Even then though, the 5th edition of Tanenbaums book is a separate copyright from the first.  Copyright law benefits you as much as it does book aut\n\n&gt;, like that book or the one about OS, or many others, don't change.\n\nPretty much all of the disciplines of CS have evolved both in what is important and how to teach it over time.  Certainly, like other sciences there are core concepts which get pretty solidly understood, but you're not going to find a book from the 1980's teaching anything about hardware virtualization, or anything about how to write modern device drivers.  \n\n\n\nAgain though, the thing is, students don't buy books, and really, can you blame them?  Books cost money, and like you, they don't believe in paying people for work.  So what do you do?   If you want profs to spend more time making their own course notes that means less time for research or other courses, so either you need more profs to cover the same number of courses (more money) or you get less research done.    Or you just have profs hack together some crappy notes and students then don't know that operating systems and networks have in fact changed in the last 37 years.

Pay from your pocket, not the students. Or the university can pay, we have nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You realise that students would pay either way right?  Just like with software, for us to make it available to you on university computers means we need to pay for it.  If universities started paying (and it would have to be the university, since I&amp;#39;m working in my capacity as a university employee), that is just one more cost that gets passed on to students.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least you can keep the book and have it for later.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why isn&amp;#39;t that done in the US?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not in the US.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That book was made in 1981, seriously, just because they republished changing some details it doesn&amp;#39;t make it recent, it&amp;#39;s old asf, that just gives them the copyright for more than 40 years, it&amp;#39;s fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no question parts of the book are from the 1980&amp;#39;s, but quite a lot has changed since the 1980&amp;#39;s too.  The WWW wasn&amp;#39;t even a thing back then, all of the standards bodies that have come into being since, all of wireless networking, modernizing security etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with the book is that, being from 2011, there are some new technologies it doesn&amp;#39;t cover (or cover enough), and it covers a number of technologies that for never really caught on, which was why they kept revising the book since the 1980&amp;#39;s.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are classical for a reason, they shouldn&amp;#39;t profit from the book after 40 years, we shouldn&amp;#39;t have to pay a huge fee for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As though revising new versions of the book is no effort.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, copyright is life of the author + 50 or + 70 years, depending on which country you are in.   And if you&amp;#39;re in the business of writing books that&amp;#39;s how you make your living.  Even then though, the 5th edition of Tanenbaums book is a separate copyright from the first.  Copyright law benefits you as much as it does book aut&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;, like that book or the one about OS, or many others, don&amp;#39;t change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty much all of the disciplines of CS have evolved both in what is important and how to teach it over time.  Certainly, like other sciences there are core concepts which get pretty solidly understood, but you&amp;#39;re not going to find a book from the 1980&amp;#39;s teaching anything about hardware virtualization, or anything about how to write modern device drivers.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again though, the thing is, students don&amp;#39;t buy books, and really, can you blame them?  Books cost money, and like you, they don&amp;#39;t believe in paying people for work.  So what do you do?   If you want profs to spend more time making their own course notes that means less time for research or other courses, so either you need more profs to cover the same number of courses (more money) or you get less research done.    Or you just have profs hack together some crappy notes and students then don&amp;#39;t know that operating systems and networks have in fact changed in the last 37 years.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "name": "t1_dgasvo2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492300804.0, "created_utc": 1492272004.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgarid8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pleurplus", "parent_id": "t1_dga3ahz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/learnprogramming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, where I live I've never seen any slide from a book, the professor always makes their slide, and they don't make a deal with the publisher, they just use the book because they think it's good, not because they made a deal.\n\n&gt;Making a good book is hard though, and the people making them, well, need to get paid or they won't make them.\n\nSure, but why does that have anything to do with the deal with the school?

In a computer architecture course you will learn about how CPUs work, how RAM is designed, the difference between a von-neumann architecture and harvard architecture. CISC vs RISC, SISD vs SIMD vs MIMD. All of these are nice to know but not necessarily a must when it comes to learning to program.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "name": "t1_dgahokm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492277499.0, "created_utc": 1492248699.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga0het", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nergoponte", "parent_id": "t3_65d4zo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/learnprogramming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Will taking a computer architecture course help me with C++?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will taking a computer architecture course help me with C++?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "name": "t1_dga0het", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492245089.0, "created_utc": 1492216289.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d4zo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga0oxq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Chestnut_Bowl", "parent_id": "t3_65d4zo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/learnprogramming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "C++ Primer 5th Edition is a great book, but it's terse as hell.
