I think the actual process is a bit more complicated than this because the infrastructure for creating these shadow DOMs has improved (with some browser support as well), but that's the gist of it.\n\nIn jQuery, if you clicked a button that you wanted to update several components, you'd have to register event handlers, and then fire off the appropriate callbacks... Anyone who's done advanced jQuery knows what a pain in the ass this can be at times.\n\nIn React, you would simply have a callback function that is just a normal Javascript function (which is what literally everything in React is). That function would update a state value (which is basically just JSON), and then React sees this change, and re-renders your component.\n\nYour component will have some logic in it that renders things a different way depending on what the various state values are. For example, it might calculate which class to put on a div, or what value goes in a text input.\n\nContrary to some of the hell I went through with overly configurable and very easily complicated Angular components, I want to say that there's a huge contrast to React in that I have found React components can actually be reusable.\n\nAlso, FLUX lets me continue viewing React in a stateless, one-directional way while also being able to make requests to web services and persist things beyond the component level. (So the SPA - single page application - level, still just JSON, or local storage if you please.)\n\nSo I'm able to use React to build complex desktop and mobile applications where single storage areas can be the controlling values that dictate how views are rendered that may even share or combine overlapping datasets.\n\nI can do it without having to think about complicated callback chains, which in jQuery and even Angular were sometimes node graphs rather than one-directional flows, or they required me to care a lot more about the lifecycle of the framework than I wanted to...\n\nYou'll still need to import libraries for stuff like web requests, and these days, it's also important to know something like babel or webpack. Any serious web project is going to have a client-side build process that takes all your JSX files (react) and compiles them down to cross-browser compatible JavaScript, for example. It's good to have those tools anyways, since it lets you use the most recent edition of JavaScript and have something transpile that to ES4 or whatever.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;React + FLUX allows for viewing your web components in a &amp;quot;stateless&amp;quot; manner, which is why you&amp;#39;ll sometimes see people call React &amp;quot;functional&amp;quot; (like pure functions that only turn a result).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;React is able to accomplish this by creating a &amp;quot;shadow DOM&amp;quot; that mimics the real DOM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any time you update one of your component&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;state&amp;quot; values, it refreshes the relevant components in the shadow DOM and then replaces the corresponding real COM components. I think the actual process is a bit more complicated than this because the infrastructure for creating these shadow DOMs has improved (with some browser support as well), but that&amp;#39;s the gist of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In jQuery, if you clicked a button that you wanted to update several components, you&amp;#39;d have to register event handlers, and then fire off the appropriate callbacks... Anyone who&amp;#39;s done advanced jQuery knows what a pain in the ass this can be at times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In React, you would simply have a callback function that is just a normal Javascript function (which is what literally everything in React is). That function would update a state value (which is basically just JSON), and then React sees this change, and re-renders your component.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your component will have some logic in it that renders things a different way depending on what the various state values are. For example, it might calculate which class to put on a div, or what value goes in a text input.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contrary to some of the hell I went through with overly configurable and very easily complicated Angular components, I want to say that there&amp;#39;s a huge contrast to React in that I have found React components can actually be reusable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, FLUX lets me continue viewing React in a stateless, one-directional way while also being able to make requests to web services and persist things beyond the component level. (So the SPA - single page application - level, still just JSON, or local storage if you please.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m able to use React to build complex desktop and mobile applications where single storage areas can be the controlling values that dictate how views are rendered that may even share or combine overlapping datasets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can do it without having to think about complicated callback chains, which in jQuery and even Angular were sometimes node graphs rather than one-directional flows, or they required me to care a lot more about the lifecycle of the framework than I wanted to...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll still need to import libraries for stuff like web requests, and these days, it&amp;#39;s also important to know something like babel or webpack.
