I started knowing the basics of HTML, and very little CSS. It&amp;#39;s been a pretty good course so far, and I think the course has been teaching me very well. Have not had too many moments where I had to Google something to find a better, more clear explanation or example. I&amp;#39;d recommend their HTML/CSS course to anyone. After I get more in depth with the HTML/CSS I am going to start with JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "name": "t1_dg565mh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491984962.0, "created_utc": 1491956162.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4vwn2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "trg0819", "parent_id": "t1_dg4rsyn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/learnprogramming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have heard the codeacademy's strongest showing is in teaching html/css, so if that's mainly what you're using it for it's probably fine.

If you were writing a professional document, say for publication, the html/css side of creating this document would be how it looks. Knowing how to bold things, make bullet points, choosing the correct font style and size, knowing how to properly layout an image in the middle of text, proper line spacing, and etc. The programming side of creating this document is what the document actually says and how well it says it. Well constructed sentences using a well formed thought process where the points made in writing build upon each other so that the author can convey a coherent point to the reader.
