You can use it on your own machine, on servers, in web dev. IMO C++ wouldn&amp;#39;t be a good language for scripting. I would recommend something like python or perl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;App development is good, but to really make powerful apps you would want it to interact with a server somewhere, which goes back to scripting and web dev in a sense.
