Reading about languages, APIs, etc. is not enough to learn programming: you have to write programs. Don&amp;#39;t worry about the project not being innovative or unique, that&amp;#39;s not the goal. If you&amp;#39;re looking for ideas there are tons in the FAQ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If, despite that, you&amp;#39;re still not interested in writing programs take a step back and ask yourself why you&amp;#39;re interested in learning how to program.

Trust me: many professional projects begin without a &amp;quot;clear enough&amp;quot; idea, if by that you mean a clear &lt;em&gt;specification.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Of course, it&amp;#39;s nothing to be proud of, and few people will actually admit this.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were you, I would just start a project. Figure out what will be the core functionality of a project and try implementing that part of it. If you manage to do that, you&amp;#39;ll have a clearer idea of what the rest should look like than you did before you started. If you don&amp;#39;t manage to implement the core of a project, then you&amp;#39;ll know that you don&amp;#39;t have the capability for such a project and should look for another one. This is called &lt;em&gt;prototyping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just get started. Solve problems. This is how you learn and get better. If after a while you have only half a dozen half-finished projects, that&amp;#39;s not the end of the world. You&amp;#39;re only that much closer to understanding your capabilities, conceiving of a doable project, and implementing that project.
