Started with Python, then realized C++ was more dynamic so I replaced my tutorials with C++. I made a post on my Facebook asking for who worked at home. A friend that I never really interacted with offered a job as a product manager for database software. I told him I had 0 experience and he said he started with the same. He told me what language to learn, SQL, so I've switched my focus to learning SQL. Then a client of his asked if he knew any freelance programmers, and he lead the guy to me.\n\nSo I was hired as a freelance but it was for creating questionaires on SPSS Professional, which I had only just heard of. They gave me a test project and it became apparent that I had no idea what I was doing. The guy called me and said I might not be ready yet, but he still wants to keep me around, I'm assuming because I presented ambition. So he told me what I needed to learn (visual basic) and I immediately ran to Barnes and nobles to get a \"learn in 24 hours\" book. I also informed him when I was first hired that I'm moving in a few weeks and would be more prepared to work, as well as have gained knowledge by the time I move.\n\nHe agreed to a follow-up once I complete my move and I've been studying as much as I can about visual basic. Then I'll have to do the same for SQL.\n\nAll I can say is I got lucky. The initial job offer is from a guy that has been on my friends list for 2 years and loves all of my posts. He said he can tell I am smart and can handle all of this, so I'm doing the best I can to meet expectations.\n\nIt's exciting, terrifying, and a relief all at the same time. If I pull this off right I'll have 2 jobs lined up for right when I move making double what I make in NYC but while working from home.\n\nIf anybody has any resources for visual basic or SQL, I am all eyes!

Started with Python, then realized C++ was more dynamic so I replaced my tutorials with C++. I made a post on my Facebook asking for who worked at home. A friend that I never really interacted with offered a job as a product manager for database software. I told him I had 0 experience and he said he started with the same. He told me what language to learn, SQL, so I&amp;#39;ve switched my focus to learning SQL.
