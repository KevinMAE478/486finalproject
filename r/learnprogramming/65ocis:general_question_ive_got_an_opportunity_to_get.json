another time.\n\n\nSo, I personally would make the node backend simple, and beef out the React stuff, because for small apps I don't quite get whats accomplished by having a complex backend as well as a complex frontend framework. A simple backend to receive params and send data with AngularJS to do all the cool stuff? Good stuff. A complex backend framework with a frontend that just does some simple JS to manipulate stuff and a bit of AJAX? Makes sense. My advice is to just focus on one of those being complex.\n\n\nBasically, your HTML won't be static, so either you do your html templating (displaying parameters and applying logic to what is seen) in the backend or the frontend framework. It sounds like you've chosen the frontend to do that job, so stick with that. All that's left for your backend is the sending and receiving of data then. You're worrying about the backend the most but you're wanting to code the frontend first, I'd suggest focusing on your worry first. Once you've sent some data and retrieved some data you'll probably feel more confident. Work on an AJAX request to send a message to the backend, and a function in the backend to send a response to your frontend.\n\n\nNow, you want to save data, so you need a database. Have you worked with them before? There's basically SQL or NoSQL. If you don't know much about it, just go with MySQL, go get something like MySQL Workbench. It's about relational tables. If you're saving data for a user for them to get later you'll need a users table, and there's lots of resources about for login systems, you can work on that first or second. The other tables depend on your app, but it's really important to think about how they'll pull together. For a simple forum for example, it'll have a 'post' table, and a 'comment' table. Your 'post' table will store a user id, so it can connect with your 'users' table, and your 'comment' table will store a post id to connect with your 'post' table. So either work on that, or get your 'users' table going. \n\n\nNow practice calling for data in the backend, get it to select some data. Did it work? Now get your frontend to request your backend to select some data and return it - pretty much a GET request if you've heard that before. Next get your backend to insert some data into your table, then get your frontend to request your backend... - pretty much a POST request (there's also PUT and DELETE requests, don't bother about them for now, just know that they exist). Once all that is done, it's just that expanded. What does your frontend need to get? What does it need to save? When you're confident in that, look into security a bit, you don't want just anyone to send data to your backend, and you don't want your frontend to send something damaging to your backend, like [little bobby tables](https://xkcd.com/327/).\n\n\nAnd that's it.
