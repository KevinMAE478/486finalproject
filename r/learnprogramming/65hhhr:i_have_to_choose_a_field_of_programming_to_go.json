Luckily, I also really like computers and technology, and I&amp;#39;ve been pursuing a programming job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As part of my CS course in school I&amp;#39;ve learned a bit of C and Java, dabbling in Python. Let me make it clear, I&amp;#39;m NOT a completely right-brained sort of person. While most of my passions are artistically inclined, I&amp;#39;m very proficient at learning coding, and I enjoy programming too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, my dad has given me a ton of talking-to about how even in programming, the only way to really get a secure, high paying job is to really distinguish myself by getting into a field where few other people really work in. He&amp;#39;s made it clear to me that the only viable field for a great career is by going into data (big data, neural networks, A.I. Learning). EDIT: He didn&amp;#39;t say it in those exact words but essentially he says that if I do something more conventional I&amp;#39;ll pretty much be disposable in the workforce and constantly be forced to keep up with and learn new technologies or run out of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know what he&amp;#39;s saying is true, but again, I&amp;#39;m an artistically inclined person. I want to CREATE things. I know that if I work for years doing complex math and engineering work I&amp;#39;ll work myself into depression. My dad tells me that if I think doing math is hard, what&amp;#39;s really hard is being afraid of being laid-off, and working late weekends doing a regular programming job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;#39;t need a six-figure salary. It&amp;#39;d sure be nice, but all I want is the kind of job where I can live comfortably while funding my artistic efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve looked at going into being a game developer, mobile developer, web developer, etc. I want to do a type of computer work that involves programming a tangible creation that appeals to the intuition that can be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other thing is, since I like to create things, I also have a great interest in 3D printing, working with circuit boards, using a Raspberry pi to make cool gadgets. I like to modify mechanical keyboards, and I like using LED&amp;#39;s and technology to design really cool environments for my living spaces. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to sum it up, I want a programming job that involves a great deal of creation. Mobile, game and web development interests me because it involves creating something that other people will use, and gives me an opportunity to let my connection to the intuition shine.
