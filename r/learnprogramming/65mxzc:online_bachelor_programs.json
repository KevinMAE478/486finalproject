I figure even if their program takes up all of my time and I don&amp;#39;t have time to work on that other stuff, If I get done way quicker than the program I am in right now I can work on projects and Algos after I get that piece of paper, and still be in the workforce sooner.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dunno, I don&amp;#39;t think my path is for everybody, and it might even be wrong for me. I guess I am counting on my ability to talk and connect(Ive waited tables and tended bar the last decade) and my ability to create some dope as fuck personal projects. I also live in a area that has a lot of tech companies, google, amazon, both have offices here, tons of defense contractors, plenty of smaller dev shops, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "name": "t1_dgbqxhe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492350266.0, "created_utc": 1492321466.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbpd8v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Elithekitty", "parent_id": "t1_dgboh3f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/learnprogramming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's pretty interesting.
