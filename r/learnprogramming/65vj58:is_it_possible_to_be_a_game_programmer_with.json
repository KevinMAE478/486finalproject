I used Youtube, Udemy (cannot stress how great udemy is), Treehouse, Codecademy and I have about 10 programming books that I purchased off Amazon. I also went back to college and spent 2 years upgrading all of my Maths and ended up in the high 80's/low 90's for literally every course I took which is insane because in highschool I graduated with a 51% in math 10.. when I was 18! (I had to repeat a year) and you know what? I've come a really long way.

Now, as others stated people can have varying degrees of dyscalculia.. for instance some people with dyscalculia struggle *immensely* to determine the larger number of two integers so as you can imagine, for loops are a nightmare for said individual.

I can honestly say my brain has changed dramatically in the past 4 years but it doesn't happen magically. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to achieve this. I wish you the best of luck, I can tell you there are many programmers with dyscalculia and they are incredibly talented and write some great code. It's also my personal belief (trigger warning) that a dycscalculic, dyslexic, blindfolded retard can write better code than most East Indian programmers that graduate from their Indian colleges.. not racist just seen some horrendous code before.
