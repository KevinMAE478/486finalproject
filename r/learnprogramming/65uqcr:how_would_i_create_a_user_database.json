How that information is stored? Or how it's accessed? \n\nIn the case #1 - this generally means hashing and salting a password of a user. It's NOT something you should code yourself (unless you happen to have a PHD in math and specialize in cryptography). Good approach is to use already existing libraries/frameworks. \n\nAs for accessing it - what end user should always see is HTML/CSS. You should never in any way expose database to them. In general it's 3 layers:\n\nDatabase &lt;-&gt; Back-end (for instance PHP) &lt;-&gt; Front-end (HTML/CSS). \n\nSo your end users can talk to back-end (for instance when they use a search bar on a site it sends a query like so: `http://example.com?query=cats`. Your back-end looks at this query, ensures it's valid (so for instance it won't allow a query that translates to `give me admin password to your panel plx`) and queries a database. It receives said answer from the database, formats it in a way you want and returns as HTML to the end user. There's never a direct communication between users and database, that thing shouldn't be even accessible from the internet. Or you [would end up like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5mq3y4/mongodb_apocalypse_is_here_as_ransom_attacks_hit/). \n\nJumping from basic front-end to back-end is a fairly daunting task, at least if you want to make REAL websites rather than some hacky trash. My recommendation if you want PHP - go get a good book on it, read it. This will teach you basic syntax of that language. Then find a book on a web FRAMEWORK using it - like Laravel for example. That's when you will learn how building actual web projects looks like. PHP alone is not a tool good enough to building professional websites. You can't just jump from HTML to using databases unless you want to both kill yourself (it will be like trying to read a book in a language you've practiced for a year in high school - you won't understand 90% of what's going on) and other programmers to kill you (because your code will be too horrid to even call code). \n\nThere are other paths available too, they all lead to the same path - right now you can find a really good set of books on [Python on humblebundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/python-book-bundle). Once you learn that language you can learn it's web frameworks, like Django or Flask. Reddit for instance runs on Django. \n\nOr if you want all necessary knowledge to be condensed in one place - look at [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/). This one teaches Ruby with Rails framework (used for instance to power Github). \n\nConsidering you are building your own project I would recommend you to look at Python or Ruby honestly. PHP has a plethora of its little quirks and in a way it's **too** \"connected\" to the internet so it feels like it can be used to make sites directly (as you get connecting to your mysql database as a part of core language via like 2 lines of code). But this way of thinking will lead to your site being a horrible creation full of security and design errors alike. You can't run before you learn how to walk.
