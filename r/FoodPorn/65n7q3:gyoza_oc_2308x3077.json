Whatever it's more important to buy strong or very strong than whether it's plain or bread)\nFind a large dry mixing bowl\nAdd a few cups of flour ~200g\nFill a mug with some tap water\nGet some chopsticks\nStart stirring the flour with the chopsticks fast and add a quarter of the mug of water. The pastry will start to form, it will form stringy clusters always keep stirring.\nAdd a little bit more water until the clusters get larger, but you don't want any puddles. The end point, to stop adding water, is where all the flour has joined some cluster and the bowl is therefore full of pastry clusters and no powdery flour is left. The amount of water added to get to this stage and the amount needed to go beyond this stage to \"too wet\" is a very small window so once you get close add a tiny amount of water at a time. Next, stop stirring with the chopsticks and work the pastry with your hands to make it all stick together and nead it so that you infuse air into the dough/pastry (whatever you want to call it)\n*don't buy pre-made dough it tastes rubbish\n\nWhen making the pastry it's tempting to add too much water and then the pastry becomes too sticky so this can be rescued with more flour but the neading process will take the most time and is quite hard work. In the end the dough should hold together nicely and not be too sticky to handle. Place it in a normal sized bowl and cover.\n\nThe above process will make dough from 3-4cups or 150-200g of flour. But you will need to repeat this 3 times for the amount of filling described above.\n\nOnce you have made the dough you can either stick all the batches together or keep them all separate and cover them all and leave to rest for an hour or 2.\n\nNow to make the dumplings...\n1) create the pastry cases\nTake one of the dough batches and it's currently a sphere. Puncture a hole in the middle to form a donut then initially put a couple of fingers from each hand through the middle and start spinning the centre out. The hole gets bigger so you can put your arms in their and you spin it out into a round tube (like a bike's inner tube without the wheel on). Next cut it so it's now a cylinder. Then cut pieces off the cylinder, I usually cut little pyramids off then roll them into spheres. The size of these pieces will determine the size of your dumplings so some trial and error is required. Ideally they should all be the same mass but I've never achieved this and it doesn't matter too much unless you're doing this for a restaurant.\n\nOnce you cut off the pieces and roll them into spheres place them on a floured sheet of baking paper. I use baking paper because it's none stick, also don't let them touch each other because they might stick together.\n\nNext on a floured bread board take a sphere and press it down to flatten it into a disc. Then take a floured rolling pin and thin it out into a circle. Make as many of these in one go as you like while keeping to the principle of putting them on a floured non-stick surface and not letting them touch one another. A thinned out, floured circle of dough is the end point of this process. How thin again will be trial and error, too thin and it won't hold the filling or may burst during cooking and too thick and it will taste a little stodgy. You'll have to perfect this over time accounting for your tastes.\n\n2) take your circle of dough and place it on the palm of your non-dominant hand.\nNext. Take a tea-spoon of dumpling filling and put it in the middle of your dough circle being careful not to get the edges wet.\nThen bring the two arbitrary middles of the dough together, over the filling being careful not to touch the filling and pinch them closed. Then bring the centre of each side opening to the pinched centre and again pinch it closed. Now you have 4 smaller openings one top left, one top right, one bottom right and one bottom left. Next pinch these holes closed by bring their centres together (i.e. Pinch them together not to the previously pinched middle of the dumpling) and in doing so shape the ridge of the dumpling into a curved semi circle like the crescent of the moon. It's important the final dumpling is sealed how it looks is less relevant and the aesthetics are something you can work on with time and experience!\n\nOnce the dumpling is formed place it back on a non-stick floured surface like a baking paper sheet and make sure the dumplings don't touch each other. Once the sheet is full cover with a damp cloth to keep them moist while you make the other batches.\n\nCooking the dumplings\nThe curved half moon shape kind of helps to put them in the frying pan. Traditionally they are actually boiled but that's just yuck!\nUse a good flat bottomed non stick frying pan with a lid and put a couple of table spoons of oil in on medium to high heat. Let the oil heat. Then start placing the dumplings in the pan around the circumference and then a few in the middle if there's room. If you gently shake the pan they shouldn't be sticking. It'll take longer for the first batch to brown their bases probably 2-3 minutes. You can tell by the way it smells when you get experienced but just pick up the dumpling and look at the base to see when it is browned to your liking, be warned there is a narrow window between browned and burnt! Haha...\n\nOnce the base is browned to your liking then pour in half a cup of tap water and cover quickly. Steam for 1-2 minutes then take the lid off and keep cooking until the water has evaporated.\n\nThe sauce:\nThere are variants on this but I make sauce with some chilie flakes in oil then I add seasamie seed oil to this.\n\nSome people just like light soy.\n\nI'm thinking of experimenting with the sauce a little. I reckon there might be a role for some rice wine plus seasame seed oil and some chilie flavour.\n\nTLDR: go to your favourite goyza making restaurant because it's hard and time consuming to make especially alone. I tend to only do it with a few others who know how to make them, like my family or some friends in the know.

Haha...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the base is browned to your liking then pour in half a cup of tap water and cover quickly. Steam for 1-2 minutes then take the lid off and keep cooking until the water has evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sauce:\nThere are variants on this but I make sauce with some chilie flakes in oil then I add seasamie seed oil to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people just like light soy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking of experimenting with the sauce a little. I reckon there might be a role for some rice wine plus seasame seed oil and some chilie flavour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: go to your favourite goyza making restaurant because it&amp;#39;s hard and time consuming to make especially alone. I tend to only do it with a few others who know how to make them, like my family or some friends in the know. Although, now that I know how to make them the quality of goyza in restaurants is usually terrible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FoodPorn", "name": "t1_dgbwtl2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492367516.0, "created_utc": 1492338716.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd9v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n7q3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd9v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n7q3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd9v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n7q3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd9v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n7q3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd9v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n7q3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd9v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n7q3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rd9v", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n7q3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd1old", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cantaloupelion", "parent_id": "t1_dgciv3i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FoodPorn", "controversiality": 0, "body": "F", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;F&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FoodPorn", "name": "t1_dgd1old", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492428563.0, "created_utc": 1492399763.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgciv3i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "g33kst4r", "parent_id": "t1_dgcbx3n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FoodPorn", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Too late, I made these with 80% fat.
