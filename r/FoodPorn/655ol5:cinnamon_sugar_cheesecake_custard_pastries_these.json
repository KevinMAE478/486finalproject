Heat 1\u00bd cups milk in a medium saucepan. Heat it over medium-heat until hot but not boiling.    Remove the pot from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes.  \nMeanwhile, beat the cream cheese, cornstarch, egg yolks, and \u2153 cup of the sugar in a large mixing bowl until creamy and well-combined.   Very gradually add the hot milk to the egg mixture, beating continuously until fully combined. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the custard is thick, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in the vanilla extract and lemon juice. Let the custard rest to room temperature, then cover the top with plastic wrap (directly on top of the custard so that it doesn't develop a film) and refrigerate until cold and ready to serve.  \nWhile the custard cools, make the puff pastry pillows. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  \nUnfold one of the the thawed puff pastry dough packages (there should be two per box) and cut it into 9 squares. Using a circular cookie cutter, cut out the centers of 6 of the squares. Stack the squares on top of each other so that one intact square is on the bottom and two squares with holes in them are on top. This should create 3 pastry pillows. Transfer the pastry pillows to the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining puff pastry dough. If desired, you can also cut smaller circles into the remaining dough rounds and make mini cups out of them, too.  \nBeat the large egg with 2 tablespoons of the milk and brush all over the puff pastry pillows to seal the edges together and help them brown. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until puffy and golden brown.  \nIn a large, sealable plastic bag, combine the remaining \u00bd cup sugar with the ground cinnamon. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter. One at a time, brush the pastries with butter, place them in the plastic bag, seal, and toss the pastries with the cinnamon sugar. Repeat until all of the pastries have been coated with the cinnamon sugar.  \nIn a microwave-safe bowl, melt the white chocolate melting wafers according to package directions. Using a fork, drizzle the white chocolate over the pastries and let set.  \nFill the centers of the pastries with the refrigerated custard and top with whipped cream, fresh berries, and a light sprinkle of powdered sugar before serving.
