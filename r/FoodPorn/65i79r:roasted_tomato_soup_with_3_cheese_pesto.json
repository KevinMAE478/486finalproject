Since the soup will be blended at the end, there is minimal knife work; just quartering the tomatoes, onions, and peppers. Main annoyance with a soup like tomato is getting the texture right by blending/straining (after blending if it's too thick you can always add a little more stock or turn it in to more of a tomato bisque with some cream). Other than that, there's some pretty good room to cover up a few oopses.  \n\nI can't find the exact recipe I used for the soup, but [this one](http://cookieandkate.com/2011/roasted-red-pepper-and-tomato-soup/) looks pretty similar to what I remember doing. For blending, I used my immersion blender as I think it's a lot easier to use than trying to laddle hot soup into a standing blender (and then you'd have to dirty a second pot for the blended soup while the chunky soup is still in the first) and then straining, but either way would work.  \n\nFor the grilled cheese since it's a thicker sandwhich, I oven baked it instead of the normal butter in a fry pan method.  \nIngredients:  \n-mini Ciabatta rolls - the Kroger's in my area sells them by the bakery, they are little ~4 inch squares (I've also used a ciabatta loaf and cut to size)  \n-pesto - home made or store bought, whichever is easier  \n-prosciutto  \n-cheeses (I used a combo of mild or sharp yellow cheddar, gouda, and either provolone or montery jack) - Stay away from aged cheeses as they are normally firmer and wont melt as well, also, I made the mistake of using some smoked gouda that I already had...good in some things but grilled cheese is not one of them. I normally buy the block of cheese from the deli area and slice myself to ~1/8th an inch, could also have deli counter slice you a few pieces. I'd stay away from shredded cheese as it's normally covered in some type of anti-caking agent to keep it from stickign together in the bag so it won't melt as well.  \n\nHow to:  \n1. Oven to 350  \n2. Split ciabatta loafs in half and place open faced on cookie sheet, lightly drizzle with olive oil and put in oven for a few minutes to slightly toast  \n3. Remove from oven, spread pesto on both halves of the ciabatta. Depending on how thick the pesto is, can add a little olive oil to thin it out and help it spread  \n4. 1-2 pieces of prosciutto per sandwhich - I normally put on bottom half  \n5. Add cheeses - 1 layer of each cheese. I split the three cheeses between the top half and bottom half of the sandwhich to allow them to melt quicker and more evenly, so two types on top half 1 type on bottom half on top of proscuittuo  \n6. Put back in oven open faced for 5-10 minutes (I've never timed this part, I just check every couple of minutes until cheese is melty)  \n7. Take out, put halves together, and let set for a minute or so before cutting  \n\nRandom after thoughts:  \n-Definitely don't need to go buy an immersion blender if you don't have one. Blenders are more pratical as they have many more uses. But if you do feel like getting one there are a lot of good options in the $25-50 range and most come with a few attachments (whisk, mini food processor, and measuring cup). I got mine on sale for $35ish with the extra parts.  \n-If you're not use to buying blocks of cheese, you might get a little sticker shock when you do. For a chunk each of cheddar, gouda, and provolone around my house will be ~$15-20 or so total. Most of the cheeses will keep in the fridge for a 1-2 weeks after you buy them. If you don't think you'll use the rest of it might be easier/cheaper to have the deli slice some up for you instead.  \n-Some other cheese options that are fun to mix in: muenster, havarti, swiss, or mozz.  \n-Proscuitto is a little expensive as well.
