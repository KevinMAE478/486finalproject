It&amp;#39;s not racist to identify massive problems that a group of people face and try to work to fix it. I&amp;#39;m no big fan of the massive government spending and programs to fight drug abuse, I just think people are stupid to use drugs in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) These people are not understanding the &amp;quot;complex forces&amp;quot; that shape society, they are pointing to white people as the cause of all their problems. Instead of putting forth massive efforts to curb issues such as 70% of black kids being brought up in a home without a dad and mom, huge dropout rates in inner city schools, and 13% of the population of America committing over 50% of the murders, they are blaming the cops who are trying to protect them and white people who passed jim crow laws over 100 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I have said consistently is that we need to identify and fight the real problems facing us today. The discussion here is on the black community. I have laid out 6 concrete things that we can promote and strengthen that can solve many, not all, of the struggles that a disadvantaged black child can strive for to escape extreme poverty. If the only real retort that you have is, &amp;quot;yeah, but RACISM&amp;quot; then you have not accomplished anything. I know I&amp;#39;m not racist, and I don&amp;#39;t know any racists. I know they are out there, so if we&amp;#39;re going to eliminate racism you are going to need to show it to me so we can fight together. If you&amp;#39;re not able to point to an example of racism, then stop saying that racism is the cause, because there are so many other CLEAR causes for us to work together to fight for to help people of all colors, creeds, and backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Conservative", "name": "t1_dg7tm7p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492130590.0, "created_utc": 1492101790.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65503s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65503s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65503s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7vzp9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BarrettBuckeye", "parent_id": "t1_dg7vj2k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Conservative", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm not trolling.
