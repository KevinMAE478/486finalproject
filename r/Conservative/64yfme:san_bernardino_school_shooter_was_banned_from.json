The only exceptions are transfers between immediate family members, but knowingly transferring a gun to a prohibited person is illegal per federal law and it&amp;#39;s unlikely that immediate family members wouldn&amp;#39;t know he was prohibited, so it still would have been an illegal transfer.  So this would support the idea that there is no way he could have legally gotten a gun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is another example how closing so-called &amp;quot;loopholes&amp;quot; does absolutely nothing to prevent a prohibited person from obtaining a gun.  All those laws do is make it more tedious and more expensive for the law abiding to purchase a gun.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Conservative", "name": "t1_dg65bpf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492044606.0, "created_utc": 1492015806.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yfme", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yfme", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yfme", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6fo05", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "canikony", "parent_id": "t1_dg6ete1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Conservative", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good to know.
