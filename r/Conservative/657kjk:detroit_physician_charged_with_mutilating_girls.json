This is sick, although I'm no terribly surprised this took place in the USA, there undoubtedly many girls/women who have had this procedure forced upon them for religious purposes even in the USA.

It might sound crazy, but with the increasing prevalence of sharia traditionalist Islam in certain areas of the USA, I have no doubt many girls will be subject to FGM at the hands of their parents and a medical/religious practitioner of the FGM procedure. It would be one thing if these girls were grown educated women who understood the consequences and US cultural implications of FGM, yet wanted to remain true to the culture of their ancestors. However, I assume almost 100% of the recipients of the FGM procedure are either too young to understand what is going on and/or are being coerced into a situation they can't back out of once they realize what's happening. Or as women they are pressured to partake in a cultural tradition in order to remain in good standing with their family and/or community and furthermore their safety could be compromised if they refuse or attempt to escape FGM.

The neighbors had a strong legal case given the parking lot and building expansion sizes compared to the lot acreage is not within fire code, however the mosque is claiming that stopping the mosque's ability to accommodate more people is anti-Muslim and thus illegal. Also the traffic increase in the locations surrounding the mosque will devalue the adjacent properties to the point of having nearly no value, consider these are 700k homes that represent a significant part of the neighbors net wort, hence the mosque is attempting to make the neighbors lives so unpleasant that they sell, and the only realistic buyer will be the mosque considering traffic and noise, and the mosque will probably offer 2 or 3 hundred thousand at most thus successfully manipulating the value of these properties they desire at the expense of the residents, if I'm correct one of the residents isn't that well off and will be significantly financially damaged if the mosque wins the court case which is being covered locally by media representing both parties. That being said the mosque has more of a media backing and money to burn smearing these locals who have lived in those homes for many years. All nearby homes will drop in value as traffic increases commute times out of the area to commercial cities like NYC, Newark, and Morristown. The collateral damage is already basically imminent and homes values have dropped for both wealthy, middle class, and residents who scrape by with just enough. The mosque continues to use the liberal media to push their agenda despite knowing that such a large religious center on that medium to low traffic road will hurt many people who are basically defenseless or are afraid to use their defenses out of fear of being labeled as bigots. Ironically, the town has denied a church in a commercial district on the same road but at the intersection of several highways, thus it doesn't affect traffic flow too significantly to have a service, from making minor additions to existing buildings or adding thirty more parking spots on land they own that isn't in use. It goes to show how much carp \"minority\" populations can get away with if they play the liberal victim card. Again I know many great Muslim people, but this mosque's use of legal and cultural power to damage innocent parties in order to essentially steal their land and thus devalue entire middle class neighborhoods that surround that location, it's abuse and its wrong.
