Even the old suspense novel trope of a terrorist organization obtaining of and using an old nuke lost from the cold war has never happened, and probably has never come anywhere close to happening.  The difficulty of handling nuclear weapons probably has something to do with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically the point is this: Whether nuclear weapons are arms and the possession of them cannot be infringed upon doesn&amp;#39;t matter, as the possession of them by the people is beyond impractical.  There&amp;#39;s really no point in even discussing them in the context of a 2nd Amendment unless it&amp;#39;s being used as some sort of &amp;quot;gotcha&amp;quot; question.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Conservative", "name": "t1_dgc5sov", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492385863.0, "created_utc": 1492357063.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbze5c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bountyperson", "parent_id": "t1_dgby5p6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Conservative", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ok, if that's your position. \n\nI mean, the \"why not\" to me is pretty clear - regular people shouldn't be able to get nukes.
