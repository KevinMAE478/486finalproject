It&amp;#39;s sickening to read the reports of how all of this played out but the plain and simple fact is that we don&amp;#39;t know and likely will never know exactly what transpired. As absolutely terrible as it sounds and damning as it appears, it doesn&amp;#39;t make it right to take up a pitch fork and join the mob. Its absolutely terrible that this young man felt the only option was to take his life and I hope that the faculty members who neglected to follow proper policy are held responsible for their actions, but attacking someone without actual evidence of wrong doing is EXACTLY what happened to this young man and it would be hypocritical of us to engage in that, no matter how justified we might feel.
