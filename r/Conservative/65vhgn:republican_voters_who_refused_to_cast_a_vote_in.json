Risk point 1: Liberal values and assumptions can become embedded into theory and method&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The embedding of values occurs when value statements or ideological claims are wrongly treated as objective truth, and observed deviation from that truth is treated as error.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[Example:] Son Hing, Bobocel, Zanna, and McBride (2007) found that: 1) people high in social dominance orientation (SDO) were more likely to make unethical decisions, 2) people high in right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) were more likely to go along with the unethical decisions of leaders, and 3) dyads with high SDO leaders and high RWA followers made more unethical decisions than dyads with alternative arrangements (e.g., low SDO\u2014low RWA dyads).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet consider the decisions they defined as unethical: not formally taking a female colleague\u2019s side in her sexual harassment complaint against her subordinate (given little information about the case), and a worker placing the well-being of his or her company above unspecified harms to the environment attributed to the company\u2019s operations. Liberal values of feminism and environmentalism were embedded directly into the operationalization of ethics, even to the extent that participants were expected to endorse those values in vignettes that lacked the information one would need to make a considered judgment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The appearance of certain words that imply pernicious motives (e.g., deny, legitimize, rationalize, justify, defend, trivialize) may be particularly indicative of research tainted by embedded values.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Conservative", "name": "t1_dgdqz51", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476871.0, "created_utc": 1492448071.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vhgn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vhgn", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vhgn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdmju2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jonesrr2", "parent_id": "t1_dgdl58g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Conservative", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Which the WaPo is all too quick to agree with the Dem talking points, like always.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which the WaPo is all too quick to agree with the Dem talking points, like always.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Conservative", "name": "t1_dgdmju2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492471877.0, "created_utc": 1492443077.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdl58g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tikevin83", "parent_id": "t1_dgdimpc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Conservative", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's a great point, the plots only really show that Democrats had a massively increased perception of America as racist in the last election cycle.
