This is a wall of negatives, but only because that is what OP asked for.

On to the negatives.\n\n&gt; The debt has gone down by 101 billion, jobs are coming back in stupidly high numbers, illegal immigration is down 67% \n\nNone, and I mean literally none, of those can be said to be due to Trump. The fiscal year starts in October, so we are still running under Obama's last budget. There are quite a few reasons for the debt drop (ranging from cash on hand left by previous administration, early tax season receipts, etc.), and the simple fact is that the debt on Jan 20 2018 will be higher than January 20 2017. \n\nLets ignore the fact that jobs numbers will not be representative of anything the current administration has done for probably another six months, so it is for sure too early to tell, but where are you getting that jobs are coming back in stupidly high numbers? March job growth was [98k vs expected 180k](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/07/march-nonfarm-payrolls.html). February job growth was [235k](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/feb-jobs-report/519183/), almost the same as the [242k added last February](https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2016/03/04/job-growth-surges-in-february).\n\nThe 67% number for illegal immigration is wrong/misleading for a number of reasons. First off, it isn't since Trump took office. It is since the same time last year. Second, (and this one is why that is important), it isn't that illegal immigration is down 67%. It is illegal immigrant apprehensions are down 67%. Now, that could mean that less people are crossing the border illegally, or it could mean that ICE was sitting on its ass doing nothing these last 12 months.  I doubt anyone could argue that it isn't down (especially considering it has been [essentially flat for so long](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/03/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/) and President Trump is almost certainly causing it to be lower than before), but it is incredibly misleading to say illegal immigration is down 67%.\n\n&gt; We're making great deals with other nations\n\nAre we? I may be blanking, but what deals have we made since Trump entered office?\n\n&gt; we're fighting political corruption and forms of lobbying\n\nEhhhhhhhh.  Don't get me wrong, most of Trumps picks are really fricken awesome, but more than half of his cabinet picks were either executives or board members of corporations that are huge lobbyists. And I am not too keen on his close ties with his business (he should sever ties completely), and the opacity of his administration is Obama-like. Release the visitor logs, stop going to the Mar-a-Lago every damn weekend, and start being more transparent. \n\n&gt; and we're out of that disastrous TPP\n\nMaybe I missed the meeting on this, but since when are conservatives against free trade? Protectionism breeds inefficiency in the market.\n\n\nBeyond these, most of my problems with Trump come from him as a person. I have always had a sort of romantic view of the executive office, believing that it should be reserved for those who truly loved this country and wanted to improve it. I strongly, strongly disagreed with most of what Barack Obama did as president. Our visions of what America should aspire to be differ significantly. Yet, I never though that he was a bad person. Maybe I am naive, but I do think that most of what he did, he did because he believed it to be better for the country. I believe his assessment of what was better for the country was wrong as hell, but I do not think he had any ulterior motives. I just can't seem to shake the feeling that President Trump truly doesn't give a damn about anyone other than himself. And maybe that is okay, so long as his ego drives him to do what we want so it doesn't get bruised, but it still bothers me deep down. I also cannot stand some of the stuff he has said in the past, nor can I stand his sometimes childish behavior. The presidency is the most powerful office on the world, requiring immense responsibility. He should act like it.\n\n&gt;And if none of this resonates with you, we have a conservative on the Supreme Court who will protect and defend the Constitution.\n\nA-fucking-men. I'll admit, I am not super familiar with sitting federal judges, but the record for Gorsuch is pretty close to ideal for me.
