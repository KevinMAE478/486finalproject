The science on this is limited and inconclusive.  Especially limited is any data from reported from self-identified transgenders tracked over time.  There is not a monolith of opinion on this, despite what agenda-driven advocates might say.\n\n2. The data that does exist are not predictive.  They look at the brains of men, the brains of women, and the brains of transgendered people, then compare features of form and function.  What they do not do is say, \"I predict we will see a difference of X, Y, and Z\", so it's all just picking and choosing which similarities are important after the fact.\n\n3.  Some transgendered brains do exhibit signs of their identified gender; however, these brains also exhibit many signs of their birth sex.  We do not know which similarities are more or less significant than others or what impact these things have on the mind.  Personality, tastes, thoughts... it's not as simple as reading a brain scan to reveal everything about the mind.  Additionally, there is nothing to suggest that all brains of self-reported transgendered people are universal.  There is no universal transgender marker or transgender gene.\n\n4.  There is a wide variety of brain attributes that exist even among all men and women.  There are undoubtedly men who have more typically female features in their brains and women who have typically male features who are NOT transgendered.  Again, this comes back to the lack of predictive power in these studies.  In a room of 1000 people, 2 or 3 might be struggling with transgenderism, but no study has been able to pick them out based on brain scans alone.  I dare say there would be a few (more than 2 or 3) false positives among the other 997.\n\n5. It is inconclusive whether many of the things they test for (particularly brain activity with scans) are innate from birth or the result of environmental and social conditioning.  Brain elasticity can cause certain forms and functions of your brain to change over time.  The fact that an overwhelming majority of childhood dysphoria cases resolve on their own *unless the delusion is actively encouraged* would suggest that conditioning plays some role in this, and may even manipulate brain function over time.\n\nNow, I think there are a few political considerations to consider, as well:\n\n1.  If brain structure manifests itself in gender identity, that is in turn manifested by a preference for certain activities, then gender identity, gender roles, and gender norms are not social constructs.  Transgenderism defeats itself, or at the very least, sets itself up for a war with feminism.\n\n2. If we're dealing with something as precise as brain science, imaging, biology, and chemistry, why do modern gender activists push for the knocking down of gender roles *even to the point of suggesting gender can be \"fluid\"?* If they want to argue that gender is fixed by the brain, then they can't argue it's a meaningless construct, or argue that it is subject to change.\n\n3.  If this is about brain science, why do we not see vastly more caution exercised?  Some transgender activist parents, at the first sign that their boy likes dolls, will call him a girl.  They foist it upon the kid.  If boy brains are boy brains, and girl brains are girl brains, they could be deeply and irreparably harming the child if the wrong diagnosis is made.  What we do not see is a cold, dispassionate, empirical study of the self-identified transgendered person's brain.  We see political activism.\n\n4.  Why does the physical state of the brain in certain, limited areas over-ride the physical reality of the rest of the body?  The body is the sum of all parts, yet transgenderism points to a few, not fully understood areas of the brain and says, \"Ah ha! Those areas are slightly more feminine, therefore this person with XY chromosomes, functional male genitals producing male hormones, and male features in every other sense is a woman!\" This makes no sense. That's just picking and choosing a few things among many to justify your case.\n\n5.  Even if transgendered brains do exhibit some transgendered features (though, as above, there is nothing to suggest a universal \"transgender brain\"), does that justify upending the very useful and necessary distinction between male and female in society?  Do such rare abnormalities, to the extent they exist, justify drastic overhauling of civic institutions and the confusion of language?  For a society to be cohesive, there must be shared language and definitions.  Transgender activists have certainly not presented a strong enough case to justify the wholesale redefinition of the terms \"male\" or \"female\".\n\n6.  Having removed the frame of reference for \"male\" and \"female\" by detaching the mind one has from physical reality, how can they claim the mind can have a \"gender identity\" at all, let alone one that is \"misaligned\"?  And why bother looking for \"proof\" of transgenderism by poking around in the physical brain when they've already established physical reality and the mind need not align?  Why is the physical nature of certain parts of the brain a more persuasive concern than literally every other bit of physical evidence?\n", "edited": 1491947601.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that whenever such articles get popular here, we get flooded by &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt;, so I just thought that I&amp;#39;d start with a preemptive note on sexual dimorphism of the brain, and whether brain science &amp;quot;proves&amp;quot; that male minds can be &amp;quot;trapped&amp;quot; if female bodies and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science on this is limited and inconclusive.

What they do not do is say, &amp;quot;I predict we will see a difference of X, Y, and Z&amp;quot;, so it&amp;#39;s all just picking and choosing which similarities are important after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some transgendered brains do exhibit signs of their identified gender; however, these brains also exhibit many signs of their birth sex.  We do not know which similarities are more or less significant than others or what impact these things have on the mind.  Personality, tastes, thoughts... it&amp;#39;s not as simple as reading a brain scan to reveal everything about the mind.  Additionally, there is nothing to suggest that all brains of self-reported transgendered people are universal.  There is no universal transgender marker or transgender gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a wide variety of brain attributes that exist even among all men and women.  There are undoubtedly men who have more typically female features in their brains and women who have typically male features who are NOT transgendered.  Again, this comes back to the lack of predictive power in these studies.  In a room of 1000 people, 2 or 3 might be struggling with transgenderism, but no study has been able to pick them out based on brain scans alone.  I dare say there would be a few (more than 2 or 3) false positives among the other 997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is inconclusive whether many of the things they test for (particularly brain activity with scans) are innate from birth or the result of environmental and social conditioning.  Brain elasticity can cause certain forms and functions of your brain to change over time.  The fact that an overwhelming majority of childhood dysphoria cases resolve on their own &lt;em&gt;unless the delusion is actively encouraged&lt;/em&gt; would suggest that conditioning plays some role in this, and may even manipulate brain function over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I think there are a few political considerations to consider, as well:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If brain structure manifests itself in gender identity, that is in turn manifested by a preference for certain activities, then gender identity, gender roles, and gender norms are not social constructs.  Transgenderism defeats itself, or at the very least, sets itself up for a war with feminism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;#39;re dealing with something as precise as brain science, imaging, biology, and chemistry, why do modern gender activists push for the knocking down of gender roles &lt;em&gt;even to the point of suggesting gender can be &amp;quot;fluid&amp;quot;?&lt;/em&gt; If they want to argue that gender is fixed by the brain, then they can&amp;#39;t argue it&amp;#39;s a meaningless construct, or argue that it is subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is about brain science, why do we not see vastly more caution exercised?  Some transgender activist parents, at the first sign that their boy likes dolls, will call him a girl.  They foist it upon the kid.  If boy brains are boy brains, and girl brains are girl brains, they could be deeply and irreparably harming the child if the wrong diagnosis is made.  What we do not see is a cold, dispassionate, empirical study of the self-identified transgendered person&amp;#39;s brain.  We see political activism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does the physical state of the brain in certain, limited areas over-ride the physical reality of the rest of the body?  The body is the sum of all parts, yet transgenderism points to a few, not fully understood areas of the brain and says, &amp;quot;Ah ha! Those areas are slightly more feminine, therefore this person with XY chromosomes, functional male genitals producing male hormones, and male features in every other sense is a woman!&amp;quot; This makes no sense. That&amp;#39;s just picking and choosing a few things among many to justify your case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if transgendered brains do exhibit some transgendered features (though, as above, there is nothing to suggest a universal &amp;quot;transgender brain&amp;quot;), does that justify upending the very useful and necessary distinction between male and female in society?  Do such rare abnormalities, to the extent they exist, justify drastic overhauling of civic institutions and the confusion of language?  For a society to be cohesive, there must be shared language and definitions.  Transgender activists have certainly not presented a strong enough case to justify the wholesale redefinition of the terms &amp;quot;male&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;female&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having removed the frame of reference for &amp;quot;male&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;female&amp;quot; by detaching the mind one has from physical reality, how can they claim the mind can have a &amp;quot;gender identity&amp;quot; at all, let alone one that is &amp;quot;misaligned&amp;quot;?  And why bother looking for &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; of transgenderism by poking around in the physical brain when they&amp;#39;ve already established physical reality and the mind need not align?  Why is the physical nature of certain parts of the brain a more persuasive concern than literally every other bit of physical evidence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Conservative", "name": "t1_dg4zh2d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491976191.0, "created_utc": 1491947391.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sv50", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5h0z1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Iwanttobedelivered", "parent_id": "t3_64sv50", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Conservative", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can't wait to see transgenders compete in women's boxing", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t wait to see transgenders compete in women&amp;#39;s boxing&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Conservative", "name": "t1_dg5h0z1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492000323.0, "created_utc": 1491971523.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sv50", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5ivxs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Stapler405", "parent_id": "t3_64sv50", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Conservative", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Which is so funny tbh.
