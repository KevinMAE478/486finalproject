I'm jumping in here but I worked as an RA for a university and know several people who have been sexually assaulted, some of whom went to the police and some of whom did not. I think I may be able to provide you with some answers. \n\nFor your first question: why don't survivors feel comfortable going to the police? There are many reasons for this, and I'll only touch on a few of the big ones here. First: you have to look at it through a historical lens. In the past, women were often laughed at, called whores, or were accused of destroying someone's life when they went to report rape as a crime. As loath as we may be to admit it, this probably still happens today (albeit much less frequently and probably to a lesser degree). I can't blame someone for not wanting to be called a whore or accused of destroying someone's career when going to report something horrible that happened to them. For many women it is simply easier to get away from the alleged perpetrator and forget rather than dragging the whole ordeal on for months if not years, to probably not see a conviction anyway. Additionally, as was stated in the article, many police stations will react even more negatively if it is a female perpetrator assaulting a male student, female perpetrator assaulting a female student or any other combinations. Reporting through the school helps students who are at a societal disadvantage when dealing with the police (like homosexuals or men who may be perceived as \"weak\" for being assaulted by a woman). It's important to remember that police are humans and are flawed, and bring their expectations and assumptions with them when investigating a crime. If a man gets laughed out of a police station trying to report that his girlfriend assaulted him (because \"all men want it\" or \"what a weakling, your girlfriend can over power you?\"), his only hope for some peace of mind may come from the university where they live. \n\nI agree with you that innocent until proven guilty is a pillar of our criminal justice system and cannot be ignored, and many times universities over step their bounds and do drift into the guilty until proven innocent territory (you don't have to look any further than Jerry Browns affirmative consent law). However, universities are in a unique position to offer victims support. If a victim doesn't want to go to the police, and just wants to forget what their ex boyfriend or old friend did to them, the university can easily and quietly move them to a new room. They can provide psychological support at basically no cost, and can support the student in classes in what is a very difficult time. \n\nAlso many people may not want criminal actions taken against their assailant. The majority of rape victims know their assailant well. This means they could be dating, be friends, or classmates. If you have a personal connection with your assailant, no matter how viscous the crime, you may not want to send them to jail, or you may not want to be accused of trying to send them to jail. Time after time we see news services saying that people who commit sexual assaults have \"promising careers\" ahead of them, which can create the view that it is the victim pursuing justice who kill their career, not the actions of the perpetrator themselves. \n\nTo your second point! (Sorry this is so long, and thanks if you're actually reading at this point!) You're right, sometimes rapes aren't convicted because the person didn't do it. However, we know that it is relatively rare for people to make false claims of rape (it absolutely does happen and there absolutely should be strict and severe punishments for those who falsely accuse others), but due to the huge media coverage that comes out in reaction when this happens, these stories get blown out of proportion, and are seen as more common than they are. \n\nNow I'm not a criminologist or a police officer, but my guess would be that the majority of rape cases don't get prosecuted or convicted because there just isn't any evidence. If the woman doesn't get a rape kit test (which is fairly common), there is usually nothing beyond he said she said testimony, which doesn't do much in the way of conviction (for good reason). Now why don't women always get rape kits? Rape kits are an invasive process into an area where many people have already felt stripped of dignity. They also frequently go untested. There are thousands of untested rape kits all over the country, presumably from people who did wish to prosecute, many of which have now exceeded the statute of limitations (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/16/untested-rape-kits-evidence-across-usa/29902199/). Furthermore, until recently there wasn't any good teaching about what rape was, so many women in past decades may not have even been sure that they were able to bring their attacker to court (I know someone personally who was raped but she didn't know that what was done to her was rape and could be prosecuted, so she buried it for decades).\n\nIf you are a woman or man who just went through something extraordinarily traumatic, and you know that going through the ordeal of getting a rape test kit done will bring back horrible memories and it probably won't get tested and even if it does you'll be put on the stand to have your motives, alcohol consumption, and dress questioned over and over again to probably see nothing come of it, would you? Isn't it just easier to pretend it never happened? Isn't it easier to just go to your university and ask to be put in a different room, in a different building, or in a different class?\n\nYou are right, many times the university is heavily in favor of the accuser, and I agree, they don't have many protections for the accused and this needs to change, but hopefully what I've said above illustrates why some people don't feel comfortable going to the police with something like rape, and why universities are in a particularly good place to help students move past what happened.
