That&amp;#39;s a huge underutilized source of labor.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Why are men pushed into dangerous, risky jobs with fewer benefits?\n\nWhy are women more likely to work part-time, or in fields that don&amp;#39;t match their education?\n\nHow can we keep women in their careers after having children?\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) I&amp;#39;m curious to know the percentages of males to females that are involved as the primary guardian in terms of housekeeping and child-rearing. It may not be as simple as getting that 11.5% increase, granted you did mention it is a naive estimation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) It&amp;#39;d be worth it to look into risk vs. reward and how it relates to physical attributes for this one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) I think this is heavily related with the amount of women that are primary caretakers of the household vs men. Even if you had a degree, it may not be feasible to have a career in that field if you also need to look after children. Single parenthood would likely play a role in this as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Honestly, it would most likely have to do with child-care benefits that are offered through employment. It&amp;#39;s often times simply not worth it to have one parent hold a full-time job until the children can get through the day without somehow killing themselves because of the cost of day cares etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like the 77% figure is also decades old. I know it&amp;#39;s at least 20 years old because I&amp;#39;ve been hearing it since I was in elementary school. I&amp;#39;d like to see comprehensive figures on wage gap dependent on employment status, occupation choice, educational level, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s dishonest to simply say &amp;quot;this gender makes this much compared to another gender&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until you can actually get into more nuanced statistics, this kind of stuff is going to come down to what side of the party line you sit on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Conservative", "name": "t1_dg76w72", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492089496.0, "created_utc": 1492060696.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y3ra", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7pwhz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pied-piper", "parent_id": "t1_dg70ubd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Conservative", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The real question is \"Is there anything inherently wrong with women choosing to work less and focus on different things than men?\".\n\nThe obsession with having to make everything not only equal, but identical, is the problem.

There are exceptions, like private schools and accountants working for the government, but in general that&amp;#39;s how both industries work. Wages are also not normally based on &amp;quot;importance to society&amp;quot;. The president is only paid $400,000 while some CEO&amp;#39;s can be paid millions. Is that &amp;quot;unfair&amp;quot;? Wages are whatever people are willing to work for, and whatever companies are willing to pay, it&amp;#39;s not unfair if both parties agree to the wage, it&amp;#39;s not your right to demand someone else&amp;#39;s money, or decide what they should spend it on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If teachers are underpaid, it&amp;#39;s not due to sexism, I don&amp;#39;t see anything but circular arguments for that. It&amp;#39;s due to societies desire to have lower taxes, and therefore schools are pushed to do as much as possible with as little funds as possible. They&amp;#39;re forced to be efficient, and therefore the wages of teachers are lower than they probably could be. Accountants wages are based on what they can bring to a company, and is high enough to try and compete with other companies that also want the best accountants. That competition driving wages up isn&amp;#39;t present in the world of teachers. If anything, their market is oversaturated, which would then also allow for lower wages. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wages are about supply and demand, not about who contributed most to society on an individual level. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Conservative", "name": "t1_dg6lydc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492061958.0, "created_utc": 1492033158.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y3ra", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y3ra", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y3ra", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg74ty4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CuckzBTFO", "parent_id": "t1_dg72qhk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Conservative", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The bureaucracy of government takes a long time to adapt to market forces.
