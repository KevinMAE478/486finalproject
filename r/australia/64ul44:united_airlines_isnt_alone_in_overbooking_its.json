The flight wasn&amp;#39;t overbooked, the airline staff we&amp;#39;re booked at all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My comment is in regards to overbooking as a practice in general. Airlines are selling seats twice. They&amp;#39;re getting paid twice for only providing 1 service. That shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed. It shouldn&amp;#39;t be any skin off the airlines nose if someone doesn&amp;#39;t show up for their flight, the airline gets paid anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dg5j7j3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492004486.0, "created_utc": 1491975686.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5iskl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ujustgotjamed", "parent_id": "t1_dg5cva1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/australia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "the over booking isnt the problem, its the fact that united use violent force to remove passengers when they should of removed their own staff, or pay more customers to be removed", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;the over booking isnt the problem, its the fact that united use violent force to remove passengers when they should of removed their own staff, or pay more customers to be removed&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dg5iskl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492003628.0, "created_utc": 1491974828.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5cva1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "m00nh34d", "parent_id": "t3_64ul44", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/australia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ban overbooking.
