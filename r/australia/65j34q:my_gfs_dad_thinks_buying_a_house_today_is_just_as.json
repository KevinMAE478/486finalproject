I'm almost wondering if they've got the sides reversed. At any rate it doesn't make a difference, so I'm just assuming the sides are the right way around. The chart shows aggregate mortgage **interest** payments as a % of aggregate household disposable income (red line), plotted against the standard variable mortgage interest rate (blue line). Let's ignore discount variable rates for a sec, as they don't change the conclusions here.\n\nWhen interest rates 'peaked' in 1989 at  a bit over 16%, interest payments were eating up 6% of household disposable income. Interest rates had a smaller peak in 2007, when they hit about 9%. Despite variable rates being 7% lower than they were in 1989, the proportion of disposable income being eaten by interest payments hit around 11% (vs. 6% in 1989).\n\nSo:\n\n1989: 16% interest rates ---&gt; 6% disposable income\n\n2007:   9% interest rates ---&gt; 11% disposable income\n\n2017:   *?*% interest rates ---&gt; *??*% disposable income\n\n\nMortgage interest rates are the lowest they've been since 1977. *This can't possible last.* When, not if, but when they go back up to something resembling the historical mean, an enormous share of aggregate household disposable income will be eaten up by interest rates. But this isn't the worst of it. As someone else has pointed out, these are only aggregate figures. In reality, disposable incomes and loan sizes will be unevenly distributed across the population, and they won't always be in proportion to one another.\n\nIf I had to guess, I suspect even a 0.75 - 1% rise in variable rates will be enough to put a sizable number of marginal 'property investors' underwater. They'll default on their loans, declare bankruptcy, and all the properties in their portfolio will be fire-sold by the bank (the ones with multiple properties in different states will essentially be 'human CDOs'). This additional supply on market will push down prices a little. And the bankrupt investors will no longer be spending, so wages and employment will fall a little due to reduced aggregate demand. Foreign wholesale lenders, who lend the big 4 banks about half their total cash, will look at this and see that: (a) the value of debt collateral (i.e. houses and apartments) just went down, meaning a higher chance the banks will be unable to recover their loans if a default occurs, and (b) mortgage holders (who aren't currently in default) now have less capacity to pay, because of reduced wage growth and employment.\n\nIn response to this heightened risk, they'll raise the rates on the loans they make to the banks. The banks will be forced to raise variable mortgage rates. So the next batch of marginal investors default. And so on, and so on, until we find ourselves back in the [1890s again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_banking_crisis_of_1893). Unfortunately this Wikipedia article doesn't fully convey what happened. Suffice it to say, it was the worst depression and financial crisis ever experienced in Australia and it was preceded by a 30 year long boom in wool prices, which at one point made us the richest country in the world due to our wool export income. This income was poured into rampant housing and land speculation in Melbourne and Sydney, and prices went into the stratosphere. Then they came crashing down when foreign wholesale lenders recalled their loans...\n\nEDIT: Ah, this is a much better article on the general concept: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment", "edited": 1492366382.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate these LHS, RHS type charts.
