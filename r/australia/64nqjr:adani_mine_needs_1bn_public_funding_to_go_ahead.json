It&amp;#39;s a gross oversimplification when you consider that the mine is &amp;#39;apparently&amp;#39; going to cost $2B, and they want a loan for $1B and it&amp;#39;s just &lt;em&gt;assumed&lt;/em&gt; that the $2B cost is going to go directly into the local economy, which translates in the government&amp;#39;s eyes to &amp;#39;spend a billion to earn two billion&amp;#39;.  The problem is that it essentially means that they&amp;#39;re putting a price-tag on everything negative about the mine, and that price is $1B. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anything, we should be &lt;em&gt;spending&lt;/em&gt; that $1B to try save the reef AND the $5-6B tourism industry that depends exclusively on the reef.
