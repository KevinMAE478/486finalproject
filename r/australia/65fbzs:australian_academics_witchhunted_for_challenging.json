Also nice way to take it out of context as I literally said in the next sentence that we don't need to pick sides. Just we don't need to follow America into war. You can be economic and cultural allies without being military allies. \n\n&gt; Oh give it a rest. Capitalism is why there is less suffering now then there has ever been. \n\n hahaha this is just patently false. Capitalism has done a good job in a select few countries no doubt but this is only because we have exported suffering to the third world. The high living standards you see today are a direct result of having poor people to exploit in Asia, Latin America and Africa. \n\n&gt; Which Imperialistic conquests are you referring to\n\nAmerica and its Allies. If you truly believe any war we have been in for the past 60 or even 70 years has been for humanitarian reasons then you haven't been paying attention. Every single war has had an ulterior motive that we have hidden with a easily disproved casus belli:\n\n* Vietnam: The gulf of tonkin incident was proven to be a falsification. Nobody was attacking the Maddox, but that didn't stop a massive mobilisation of troops into vietnam and a massive bombing campaign which destroyed Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos as well as chemically altering children with agent Orange. \n\n* Iraq: there were no WMD's \n\n* Libya: There was little to no proof that Ghaddafi was behind the Berlin bombings under reagan and the civil war was basically created by America and France. \n\n* Syria: There is little to no proof that Assad was behind these recent gas attacks and why were we supporting these rebels in the first place. I thought we liked secularism, I know I do. Fuck Assad coz he's not a good man but he's a hell of a lot better than these rebels. \n\n* Afghanistan: The Taliban weren't behind 9/11 but fuck it lets destabilize an entire region coz they might've been nice to Osama. Funny how we never went after Saudi Arabia even though they are supplying ISIS and are where the 9/11 guys are from. \n\n\n\n&gt; Was India a conquest? Because India is a capitalist accomplishment\n\nYeah fuck yeah woohoo! What a fucking accomplishment! [Nothing is better than Genocide in the name of profit](https://yourstory.com/2014/08/bengal-famine-genocide/). Of course India was a conquest, some 80 million people died as a direct result of British conquest and it is still one of the poorest countries on earth. \n\nI wanna chuck in a more covert one because this is direct evidence of what I was saying before. The Red Rubber campaign in the Congo under Belgian conquest was integral to the industrial revolution in the west. Without the African Rubber the whole process would've been alot slower but thank god for the invisible hand of the Free Market. As African Rubber is harder and thus more expensive to extract than Asian so Belgium decided to create an Army which killed, Raped, burned and pillaged the natives to keep productivity up and keep the product profitable. Tens of millions died. Some estimates have half of the population murdered in the name of profit. What a fucking success. \n\nImperialism btw isn't dead its just more subtle. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWSxzjyMNpU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m59s) and you will see what I mean. Maybe check out some videos by the Empire Files.\n\n&gt; Nevermind the fact that only a couple of years ago they annexed part of another country.\n\nTechnically the Chrimea was part of Russia and most of the people there support a Russian government. But regardless you have fallen into the trap of strongman policy. It doesn't fucking work. As  I said in my previous comment, Putin is being forced into this line of action as his economy starts to collapse (fuck yeah, thanks free market reforms). In regards to what they are doing to homosexuals it is horrible and as someone with several LGBT people very close to me I find it disgusting but it is not the job for America to go in and end it. It is the task of a unilateral action by the UN against Russia. WW3 is going to be fucking horrible and no action justifies it so we must pursue every other possibility before we resort to violent conflict. I don't think you understand how bad it could be. \n\nWe don't want war, this doesn't mean we are pursuing their interests we are pursuing the humanity's interests. There are other ways to get what we want. \n\n&gt; Because they have made nuclear threats against the US and its allies on numerous occassions. THATS WHY. We should take them out before they actually have the means to do that. For his own protection? Well it's good to know that his protection is being thought of and not the protection of the NK people who are starving and who are tortured and killed regularly.\n\nHe already has the means to do it, but he hasn't because he doesn't want to and he knows that it is in nobody but America's interest for him to launch a nuke. He is making threats because the military believes its the best way to keep the west at bay. Remember that time he said he would be willing to get rid of all of his nukes if the US guaranteed to do the same and to back down. Also the people are starving as a result of the trade sanctions on the country. It is a terrible country for agriculture, it is fucking cold, it is mountainous and they lack the materials to develop a secure food supply. They get a bit from China but Xi is being a dick and cutting the help down and stopping more trade. \n\n&gt; Sure, Libya was a mistake but if you think that that means that we should revert to isolationism then I don't know what I could say to convince you otherwise. \n\nIf by isolationism you mean stop toppling Governments, then yes I support it. Fucking hell let the people of their own country decide their own future. Every single time we have ever gone in we have fucked it up terribly outside of maybe Japan and Germany. \n\n&gt; As for Iraq, we did a great job. The problem is that we left without any plan. And Syria is not our fault. Period.\n\nHow on earth was Iraq a good job? It cost billions to get rid of Saddam who if we think about it was doing an ok job. At least he was secular, we should've stopped his shit against the Kurds using the UN. \n\nBasically we have to be consistent, when are we gonna give the gulf states \"freedom\" or Northern Africa or Myanmar? We won't because its not in our interest. We only start to care about the people inside these countries when they are fucking up the global capitalist system. This is what Killing Hope talks about.

Sounds to me like you only read the books that re assert what you already believe.\n\nI actually watch and read alot of books from multiple sides of the political spectrum and some things are politically divisive.

As a colonisor state we should recognise the negative impact we have on the world and seek to rectify the damage we have done to the third world rather than attack more countries with the hounds of the capitalist hegemony.\n\nOh give it a rest. Capitalism is why there is less suffering now then there has ever been. Which Imperialistic conquests are you referring to. Religion fucked up the middle east and it was fucked up long before we got there. Free trade gives nations a reason to not go to war against one another. Was India a conquest? Because India is a capitalist accomplishment. This Isolationism where we have to tip toe around those who commit barbaric acts is ridiculous. The West is a force for good and the world is ultimately a better place because of the West.\n\n&gt; I don't want ww3 so I don't think we should be pressing Russia, we should condemn them but their economy will most likely collapse soon so this is why we're seeing such aggressive foreign policy from them a better option would be to set up strong trade links with them and support the growth of theirs and our economy to prevent more conflict.\n\nOkay, I now see your madness. Lets not set off the Russians. Nevermind the fact that only a couple of years ago they annexed part of another country. Apparently if WW3 did start it would be our fault because we pursued what is in our interest and not in the interests of those who have set of concentration camps for gays.\n\n&gt; Finally why are you glad to have the DPRK as your enemy. I don't agree with their policy or ideology but they are a completely isolated country which has gone against the status quo and every time a country does this in comes the bastion of freedom. When Libya did it they got destroyed, when Iraq did it they got destroyed and now Syria is being destroyed too. So to be honest I understand why Kim Jon Un is developing nuclear weapons, it's for his own protection. It's his only playing card which is securing his country's sovereignty. If anything the US is the crazy war mongering country. When was the last time North Korea attacked another country (don't bring up the korean war because that was orchestrated by America as well when they dissolved the socialist provisional government and set up a trusteeship with the ussr which led to increased tensions and aggression from both sides).\n\nBecause they have made nuclear threats against the US and its allies on numerous occassions.
