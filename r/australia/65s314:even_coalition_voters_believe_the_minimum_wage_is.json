I'm not talking about how your minimum wage is too low, but that there are other problems that affect people more. If you don't want to read my stories, just skip down below. You'll know where.\n\nAustralia has one of the highest (if not the highest) minimum wage in the world, yet it's still not enough. I spent a year in Australia when I was a kid, and my parents still have kept touch with some people back there (here?). I hear house prices are 500k and up out in regular towns near where I used to live around Lismore. I would say that it was a fairly regular Australian town. I think I remember hearing roumors (to a kid)  that the Chinese were buying up lots and lots of stuff in the cities (Melbourne, Sydney Brisbane). The same thing seems to have happened back home. Here (there?), the chineese are buying up things here, and they have been for years. Toronto, Calgary, Montr\u00e9al, and (worst of all) Vancouver. \n\nRecently, I've noticed that houses around me are starting to rise in price. Hell, my dad has a friend who bought a house in Hamilton (about 50km from Toronto) 5 years ago. It was in the east end which is known for being rougher, but they're mostly just hosers (bogans). He paid iirc ~ 150k$ and was below asking price. I don't know who moved in though yet. His neighbor sold his house last year for ~320k$ (asking price was 300k$). \n\nDown the street from me, a larger house when up after being owned by some douche parents with 7 kids playing in the road. Being nosey neighbors, my parents took a look at the house. It wasn't in good shape. Worst of all, they kept rabbits in the basement and it apparently smelt like rabbit crap and piss, with \"smelling brown marks on the wall\". It was sold to some Chinese people. I forget what exactly it was sold for, but it was well over asking price, which was 380k$.\n\n**skip to here**\n\nIt got me thinking. If the Chinese are buying houses in expensive cities, where do the people who move out go? Into a new house of course, but they first have to find it. With the a lot of the houses being sold to the Chinese, it is more and more likely that they will move to a smaller town. They have enough money, that after looking at million dollar ice fishing snacks for years, a 2 floor backsplit for 250k$ looks like a great deal. \n\nHowever, when someone from that town needs a new house, they can't get that 250k$ backsplit because they offered a lower price. It's just business that you go for the higher offer. They can't afford anything at home, so they go somewhere that is a lot cheaper. This also means however, that they may have not as good of a house, but they're willing to take that risk. \n\nAt the same time as the people above are moving somewhere else, the Chinese buyer told his friends about the houses he bought but never lives in in Abottsford (B.C. and N.S.W.) his friends want in. They can't afford Abottsfords prices though, so they start buying up property in a larger town (like lismore), and now, not only are locals being displaced, but people who are moving around trying to find cheap housing aren't going there either, and they head to somewhere even cheaper, and probably more remote. \n\nNow, it wouldn't be a problem if they rented out their property, or at the very least, tried to live in it. But instead they're treating these properties like Chinese properties. You've heard of stories of entire condo buildings in china being empty. Entire cities empty. Those condos are owned, but nobody lives in them. Why? Because to the Chinese, they are a money machine. They have relatively recently gotten capitalism, and its like the roaring twenties for them. Everyone is making money, but the bubble has to burst. They haven't yet known about black Tuesday, and it doesn't look like they want to know. \n\nOnce the bubble bursts, china will implode. They will have their great depression. I think its too late for anyone to do anything about that. They need to learn that, when in Rome, do as the Romans do. Don't buy up every property you see, and then do nothing with it. You may be making money now by doing nothing,  but you will lose everything when the bubble bursts. \n\nHowever, I remember hearing about the Chinese market bubble, and how its going to \"burst\" for years now. There will be no change unless we take legislative action. At the very least, force them to rent out their properties. They actually make money, instead of sitting on their ass, and helps fix your housing problem. \n\nNow, what does all this have to do with the minimum wage? Absolutely nothing. I think the Australian National wage is too high to begin with, but I won't complain because I'm not Australian. However, what seems to be the bigger issue, is that more and more of your people's wages are going towards housing. Australia is further down the path than Canada IMO, but no one should have to pay 2000$ a month for renting a 100sqft closet. If you fix this issue, then your individual economic status becomes more clear. \n\nTL;DR: you probably actually are making enough money, its just that you pay so much towards housing, that you don't have much money to spend on other things. This is probably because of the Chinese. Once the Chinese housing bubble bursts, so will the Australian and Canadian housing bubble, and you will have more money to spend on other things, like electricity, water and food.\n\nPs: feel free to tell me I'm wrong. I haven't been back to Australia, but I keep up with some major issues and events. From what I hear, the situation there (here?) Is similar, albeit a bit worse then it is here (there?), so I'm assuming that its a similar cause as well.
