It&amp;#39;s not just a question of harming the economy, but an issue of destroying decades of careful financial planning and implementation for the 60% of Australians who only own their one property, and their plans for their kids and family&amp;#39;s futures (who are people who don&amp;#39;t own now - making up a large percentage of the population). That&amp;#39;s immense. Of course nobody wants to unbalance that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a complex system that is completely interrelated. There isn&amp;#39;t a simple &amp;#39;just make houses cheaper&amp;#39; fix that can happen without having a million other impacts on actual real people, who also happen to be the majority in the country. It&amp;#39;s simplistic to pretend that can just happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dg9yplp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492242731.0, "created_utc": 1492213931.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
