There does appear to be a lot of Chinese money sloshing about in our capital city real-estate markets. But it's not something that can be taken as a constant. \n\nIf we're talking about the (legal) hot-money part of the equation, it's pretty much an immutable law of international financial capital flows that hot money will run a mile the second it smells trouble. Actually that's not quite true. It will **actively try to make the situation worse** if there's profit in it (see: the Asian financial crisis). When I say 'legal', I mean in terms of current Chinese capital controls (because it's not like we're doing anything to enforce our own laws).\n\nIf we're talking about the (illegal) capital flight out of China, then there's two factors to consider. For starters, we might actually start enforcing our own laws and meeting our international treaty obligations regarding anti-money laundering (hah, who am I kidding?). More realistically, the Chinese government can place an enormous amount of pressure on any Australian government to carry its share of water re: catching those engaging in illegal circumvention of Chinese capital controls. Also, on their end, the Chinese government can (and do) imprison and execute people for run-of-the-mill money laundering and embezzlement respectively.\n\nLet's just say, were I a property investor or lender, sustained inflows of Chinese capital is not something I'd want to bet the house on (sorry, couldn't resist).
