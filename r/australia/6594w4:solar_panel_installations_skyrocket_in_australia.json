So that's 2500kw of actual generation capacity. Converting to kw/h per year and we get (a) 21,900,000 kwh per year average electricity generated.\n\nThe latest consumption figures I can find are from 2010, 2011 and 2012, and I'm not really sure if average consumption would have gone up or down 5-7 years hence, and they seem to jump about from year to year.
