So basically the law was introduced as a form of inbuilt obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it infuriating that a few power hungry and greedy people that are already wealthy and at the top, can throw the words capitalism and jobs around and use their influence to get their way, just so they can increase production to become even more wealthy, then use that wealth to buy machines to displace the promise of jobs they used to get their way, all without any concern for the livelihood of the people that their greed impacts upon. Its fucking criminal. Legislation against the consumer is an exponentially fast and narrowing one way street. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m never gonna buy new clothes again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dg9phy3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492230777.0, "created_utc": 1492201977.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8y2k7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jabiluka", "parent_id": "t1_dg8uflq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/australia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "In THC content, the thing is that hemp was outlawed for no good reason.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In THC content, the thing is that hemp was outlawed for no good reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dg8y2k7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492189378.0, "created_utc": 1492160578.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8uflq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NeverReadTheArticle", "parent_id": "t1_dg8hxi1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/australia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How is it vaguely related when it's the exact same plant?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is it vaguely related when it&amp;#39;s the exact same plant?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dg8uflq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492179112.0, "created_utc": 1492150312.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8hxi1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jabiluka", "parent_id": "t3_6595hb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/australia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hemp which is vaguely related to marijuana but without THC was made illegal around the time that Dupont invented nylon rope, I had a hemp t-shirt once and it was the best I ever owned.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemp which is vaguely related to marijuana but without THC was made illegal around the time that Dupont invented nylon rope, I had a hemp t-shirt once and it was the best I ever owned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dg8hxi1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492159155.0, "created_utc": 1492130355.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
