SHA is not an encryption method. It's in the *name*; it's a *hashing algorithm*. The census had it as an available option for validating the certificate of the website. You can, in your own local browser, simply refuse to allow that as one of the options, and you'll be entirely secure, since TLS requires both ends to agree on protocols. And it certainly has *nothing* to do with how data is stored at their end.\n\nAnd even then, when we talk about vulnerabilities in cryptographic algorithms, they're nearly always much less severe than they might sound. The theoretical complexity of SHA-1, including its weakening by vulnerabilities, is still over 2^(60). That's well over 10^(18), or a quintillion possible values. Literally the first time a collision in SHA-1 was *ever* found was in February *this year*. And that *one* attack required the equivalent of 6500 *years* of CPU time. When cryptographers recommend moving away from an algorithm, it's always a long, *long* time before it becomes strictly necessary. It's specifically so that, by the time a *significant* vulnerability is found, everyone has already moved on, rather than that being when people *start* moving on.\n\nYes, the world needs to move on from SHA-1. Yes, anyone who *hasn't* moved on should be criticised for it. But you also should not pretend that the problem is worse than it is, and it's *definitely* not a good reason for refusing to participate in the census. It's not like they were using MD5 or SHA-0.\n\nYou really should not be getting so up in arms about something about which you have absolutely no idea, if I'm going to be honest.\n\nEDIT: I  should also speak a little bit about the probable reason that they left SHA-1 in as an option. As their main goal is, of course, to get everyone in the entire country to participate, they need to support everyone. Anyone still on Windows XP SP2 or older *needed* SHA-1 support in order to have any security whatsoever. So did anyone on Android Froyo or older. Government websites, especially ones like the Census, need to be able to cater to even the 85 year old grandma with the same computer she's had for 15 years.\n\nAs an additional note, you can easily verify which hashing algorithm, cypher, etc. was used in establishing your connection with a website, if you're particularly concerned about security.", "edited": 1491988566.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the ABS used an encryption method (SHA-1)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Huh?

The theoretical complexity of SHA-1, including its weakening by vulnerabilities, is still over 2&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;. That&amp;#39;s well over 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;, or a quintillion possible values. Literally the first time a collision in SHA-1 was &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; found was in February &lt;em&gt;this year&lt;/em&gt;. And that &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; attack required the equivalent of 6500 &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; of CPU time. When cryptographers recommend moving away from an algorithm, it&amp;#39;s always a long, &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time before it becomes strictly necessary. It&amp;#39;s specifically so that, by the time a &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; vulnerability is found, everyone has already moved on, rather than that being when people &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; moving on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, the world needs to move on from SHA-1. Yes, anyone who &lt;em&gt;hasn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; moved on should be criticised for it. But you also should not pretend that the problem is worse than it is, and it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; not a good reason for refusing to participate in the census. It&amp;#39;s not like they were using MD5 or SHA-0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You really should not be getting so up in arms about something about which you have absolutely no idea, if I&amp;#39;m going to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I  should also speak a little bit about the probable reason that they left SHA-1 in as an option. As their main goal is, of course, to get everyone in the entire country to participate, they need to support everyone. Anyone still on Windows XP SP2 or older &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; SHA-1 support in order to have any security whatsoever. So did anyone on Android Froyo or older. Government websites, especially ones like the Census, need to be able to cater to even the 85 year old grandma with the same computer she&amp;#39;s had for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an additional note, you can easily verify which hashing algorithm, cypher, etc. was used in establishing your connection with a website, if you&amp;#39;re particularly concerned about security.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dg5nqi0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492016741.0, "created_utc": 1491987941.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5cf2m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg58kg9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/australia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1492271946.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dg5cf2m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491993238.0, "created_utc": 1491964438.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pg01", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pg01", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6deu2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DsyelxicBob", "parent_id": "t1_dg5yrko", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/australia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; tinfoil level fear of the government\n\n\nAm I the only person that remembers when saying that the Government spies on you was also considered a tinfoil conspiracy theory?\n\nWe are so far beyond the point of not trusting your government being a crackpot theory at this point.
