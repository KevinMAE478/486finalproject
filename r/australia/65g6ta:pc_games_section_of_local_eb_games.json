EB is a hassle to deal with for me, haha.", "edited": 1492241808.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Problem is, Target employees are very rarely trained properly in gaming, their returns policy is pretty shit, and they don&amp;#39;t sell preowned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fair enough, I only buy games when I am 100% certain on them (done my own research) so I usually just walk in, buy, and be done. I&amp;#39;ve never had to do a return of a game at any store before for any reason, hopefully I can keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;EB offers price match, bigger range, staff who know games, rewards systems, awesome returns and refund policy and preowned games that beat even the best deals at other stores.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that people do use EB&amp;#39;s rewards system and returns etc but for me at least, I keep my games/consoles for good (trade-in bonuses irrelevant for me), I do careful research into games AKA I don&amp;#39;t buy on a whim (don&amp;#39;t require a &amp;#39;no questions asked&amp;#39; return policy, just need one to cover defective items which I believe even Target has as I&amp;#39;ve heard of people returning/replacing defective joycons), I can buy brand new games cheaper from overseas than EB&amp;#39;s preowned sales... for example, I bought Splatoon brand new for under AUD$50 (inclusive of shipping, and not during a sale). EB lists secondhand Splatoon for $57. Why buy secondhand when I can buy new?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, EB is very poor value. I can see it being useful for others if they take advantage of the deals that EB offers, of course. However, if not taking extra deals into consideration, a straight-up price match should go to the original retailer to offer it, within means. In my opinion, anyway. I don&amp;#39;t really want to reward lazy pricing. :P To each their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: And to add for clarity, lazy pricing isn&amp;#39;t the only thing I dislike about EB. Their service is terrible and inconsistent (for example, their price-matching policy varies from manager to manager). I&amp;#39;ve had my pre-orders accidentally sold to other people when I went to pick it up the next day after being messaged that they were ready to be collected. I&amp;#39;ve had my orders cancelled for not being in stock when their website still showed &amp;#39;in stock&amp;#39; up to a few days after my order was cancelled.
