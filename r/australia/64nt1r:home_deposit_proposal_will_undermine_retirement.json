You are realistic though, and are simply aiming to buy a unit in inner Melbourne, at a REIV median cost of 585k.  \n\n9% compulsory super a year gives us 7.2k pa going into this special account. Meaning you need to find 7.2kpa to match it.  \n\nYour post tax income (especially if you have a HECS/HELP debt - and that's only going to become a bigger burden with tertiary deregulation back in the budget) is going to be ~60k, if not lower. Meaning you need to save fully 12% of your take home wages, each year, for three years in order to qualify for this.  \n\nThat's a huge stress on your budget. And let's look at what you can expect to achieve.  \n\nBetween your superannuation and matching deposits (totalling $554 per fortnight with rounding), and assuming an amazingly generous 5% return calculated monthly, you will end the three years with a deposit of $46,434.  \n\nWhich you might have noticed, isn't even a 10% deposit for the property, let alone the costs incurred in the purchase.  \n\nAnd what about the opportunity cost? I'm being *very* simple with this bit of maths, but the three years of lost superannuation totalling 21,600 in compulsory deposits is *huge*.  \n\nAssuming that you get paid 7.2k pa into your super each year (at a fortnightly rate), and interest is calculated monthly. We'll start saving at 30 and retire at 65 (hah, we will never get to retire, we'll be lucky to survive until 65), so let's compare.  \n\nScenario 1 - with no use of super for home buying, and 35 years of deposits gives us a figure of $682k.  \n\nScenario 2 - with 3 years of super used for home buying, and only 32 years of deposits leaves you with 567k.  \n\nThat's more than 100k difference, and that's assuming your income, and contributions never rise over the course of those 30+ years.  \n\nSo what we're doing is declining your lifetime superannuation value by 15-20%, in order to get an amount of money that is nowhere close enough for a deposit, let alone enough to make a mortgage affordable. And that's assuming you can even afford to set aside the matching savings to start with.  \n\nAnd all this to keep a bubble from popping, and contribute further to massive intergenerational wealth transfer.  \n\nBut let's be fair here, and do **all** the maths.  \n\nUsing CBAs calculators, we have total upfront costs of $33,953 to cover stamp duty and other fees involved in buying that lovely unit in a new development. That gives us a total cost to purchase of $618,953. I'll round that up to 620k, so you've got some money left over to buy a few items of furniture at Ikea to make the house a home.  \n\n620k, minus your 46.5k deposit leaves you 573.5k to borrow. With a 30yr mortgage, and assuming that same, very generous 5% interest rate and fortnightly payments - you're going to be paying $1,540 per fortnight on that mortgage.  \n\nRemember back at the start, when we looked at your net income? That works out to about $2,300 per fortnight. Meaning that once you pay your mortgage (and *just* your mortgage, not body corporate, or insurances, or any other costs related to ownership), you are left with $760pf.  \n\nThe housing is not more affordable because of this measure. It remains as out of reach, and reliant on the genetic lottery (yay for rich parents if you've got them!) as ever. All this does is keep the bubble going. Fuck that. \n\nPlease let me know if you see any glaring issues.

And let&amp;#39;s look at what you can expect to achieve.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Between your superannuation and matching deposits (totalling $554 per fortnight with rounding), and assuming an amazingly generous 5% return calculated monthly, you will end the three years with a deposit of $46,434.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which you might have noticed, isn&amp;#39;t even a 10% deposit for the property, let alone the costs incurred in the purchase.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what about the opportunity cost? I&amp;#39;m being &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; simple with this bit of maths, but the three years of lost superannuation totalling 21,600 in compulsory deposits is &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assuming that you get paid 7.2k pa into your super each year (at a fortnightly rate), and interest is calculated monthly. We&amp;#39;ll start saving at 30 and retire at 65 (hah, we will never get to retire, we&amp;#39;ll be lucky to survive until 65), so let&amp;#39;s compare.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario 1 - with no use of super for home buying, and 35 years of deposits gives us a figure of $682k.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario 2 - with 3 years of super used for home buying, and only 32 years of deposits leaves you with 567k.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s more than 100k difference, and that&amp;#39;s assuming your income, and contributions never rise over the course of those 30+ years.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what we&amp;#39;re doing is declining your lifetime superannuation value by 15-20%, in order to get an amount of money that is nowhere close enough for a deposit, let alone enough to make a mortgage affordable. And that&amp;#39;s assuming you can even afford to set aside the matching savings to start with.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all this to keep a bubble from popping, and contribute further to massive intergenerational wealth transfer.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s be fair here, and do &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the maths.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using CBAs calculators, we have total upfront costs of $33,953 to cover stamp duty and other fees involved in buying that lovely unit in a new development. That gives us a total cost to purchase of $618,953. I&amp;#39;ll round that up to 620k, so you&amp;#39;ve got some money left over to buy a few items of furniture at Ikea to make the house a home.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;620k, minus your 46.5k deposit leaves you 573.5k to borrow. With a 30yr mortgage, and assuming that same, very generous 5% interest rate and fortnightly payments - you&amp;#39;re going to be paying $1,540 per fortnight on that mortgage.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember back at the start, when we looked at your net income? That works out to about $2,300 per fortnight. Meaning that once you pay your mortgage (and &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; your mortgage, not body corporate, or insurances, or any other costs related to ownership), you are left with $760pf.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The housing is not more affordable because of this measure. It remains as out of reach, and reliant on the genetic lottery (yay for rich parents if you&amp;#39;ve got them!) as ever. All this does is keep the bubble going. Fuck that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you see any glaring issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dg3vgne", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491914852.0, "created_utc": 1491886052.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64nt1r", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64nt1r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg402up", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "123123131231", "parent_id": "t1_dg3nq1g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/australia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "     WORK WILL SET YOU FREE", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; WORK WILL SET YOU FREE\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dg402up", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491925269.0, "created_utc": 1491896469.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64nt1r", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg3p0gi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jcit878", "parent_id": "t1_dg3nq1g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/australia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "First they came for our \"iphones\".
