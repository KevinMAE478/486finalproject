This is well documented. The point is that its not the Boomers who have benefited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are all being conned. The super-rich have their eyes on the Boomer&amp;#39;s retirement savings and are planning to strip-mine that next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So by blaming the oldies you are being a &amp;quot;useful idiot&amp;quot;. You are doing exactly what the media wants you to do, which is to deflect the issue away from the super-rich.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever, it is clear that two things are happening: World-wide the super-rich are buying all the land to harvest the profits as they continue to drive the prices up and up. (House prices are unaffordable world-wide, but still the rich are buying them). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus the really big issue is that wages have stagnated for decades so normal people can no longer afford to buy a house, whether they are young or old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But of course, you&amp;#39;ll just go on blaming the Boomers...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dgc2d1f", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492380761.0, "created_utc": 1492351961.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 48}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ov0b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ov0b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ov0b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ov0b", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ov0b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcyre3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DrBalance", "parent_id": "t1_dgcupfh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/australia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There are plenty of skilled jobs and you can learn a language in 1-2 years.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of skilled jobs and you can learn a language in 1-2 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "australia", "name": "t1_dgcyre3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492424431.0, "created_utc": 1492395631.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcupfh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Condiment", "parent_id": "t1_dgc7f8n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/australia", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You teach English?
