The way she speaks is a big part of her electoral success as was the contrived and ostensibly mangled elocution of Joh Bjelke-Petersen and most of her vote base also happens to be in Queensland. This is something her media managers/handlers are well aware of and so was Oldfield when he was at the helm of PHON. Joh used his muttering/stuttering/stammering verbal slap downs to great effect to tap into the parochial psyche of Queenslanders for decades and \"Don't you worry about that\" it worked. The difference being that Joh - 'The Hillbilly Dictator' as [Evan Whitton] (http://netk.net.au/Whitton/Hillbilly1.asp) accurately attributed him, was a much more shrewd political operator who had much of the establishment including the Bischof/Terry Lewis cops in his back pocket. Something PHON does have in common with the former Bjelke-Petersen administration is it's desire to stamp out any dissenting viewpoints ie. The ABC\n\nHansons own awkward parliamentary oratories are in much the same vein as Johs because such demagoguery appeals to many Queenslanders who find comfort and/or have become accustomed to the media focus it draws from more population dense areas like NSW and Victoria on the national stage. Joh's mastery of the soundbite for instance was displayed when he told journalists from interstate to go back to \"Senile City\" while dismissing questions at press conferences and this displayed his ability to both deflect questions of his own inadequacies as well as appeal to his own rural supporter base who weren't from the city. (Most Queenslanders do not live in Brisbane). \n\nDespite the National Party government's lack of transparency, people continued to vote for [Joh] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHHEvedhZ-4) in droves. The only problem being that that approach can lead to enormous levels of corruption and cover ups as revealed by The Fitzgerald Inquiry. It might be the tropics that leads to Queensland having many \"colourful\" politicians but make no mistake the good ones know how to tap into the well tested emotional appeal of the insecure Queenslander psyche of relevance deprivation syndrome when it comes to Canberra affairs. \n\nHere is a short list of some Queensland politicians who are smart political operators that have courted controversy just like Joh to great success recently:\n\n[Clive Palmer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM9I7cfmjbM),\nPeter Slipper,\nMal Brough,\nKevin Rudd,\nBob Katter,\nGeorge Christensen,\nAnna Bligh,\nBarnaby Joyce, \nMal Colston.\n\nSome will continue to take comfort in PHON but thankfully it's message only resonates in Queensland just like the failed Joh for PM campaign. \n    ", "edited": 1492138783.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is something about the way she speaks (and what she actually says) that screams &amp;quot;WTF&amp;quot;, every time you see a clip of her saying whatever she says.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a good point. The way she speaks is a big part of her electoral success as was the contrived and ostensibly mangled elocution of Joh Bjelke-Petersen and most of her vote base also happens to be in Queensland. This is something her media managers/handlers are well aware of and so was Oldfield when he was at the helm of PHON. Joh used his muttering/stuttering/stammering verbal slap downs to great effect to tap into the parochial psyche of Queenslanders for decades and &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t you worry about that&amp;quot; it worked. The difference being that Joh - &amp;#39;The Hillbilly Dictator&amp;#39; as &lt;a href=\"http://netk.net.au/Whitton/Hillbilly1.asp\"&gt;Evan Whitton&lt;/a&gt; accurately attributed him, was a much more shrewd political operator who had much of the establishment including the Bischof/Terry Lewis cops in his back pocket. Something PHON does have in common with the former Bjelke-Petersen administration is it&amp;#39;s desire to stamp out any dissenting viewpoints ie. The ABC&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hansons own awkward parliamentary oratories are in much the same vein as Johs because such demagoguery appeals to many Queenslanders who find comfort and/or have become accustomed to the media focus it draws from more population dense areas like NSW and Victoria on the national stage. Joh&amp;#39;s mastery of the soundbite for instance was displayed when he told journalists from interstate to go back to &amp;quot;Senile City&amp;quot; while dismissing questions at press conferences and this displayed his ability to both deflect questions of his own inadequacies as well as appeal to his own rural supporter base who weren&amp;#39;t from the city.
