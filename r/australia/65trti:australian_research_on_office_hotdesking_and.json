I had enough trouble getting a desk set up for my spine and hip disabilities, as soon as my office converted to hot desking I lost all my accommodations, I ended up working on the floor most days because it provided a more comfortable posture. A change of scenery every single day was doing my head in, I'm more productive when I can set up workspace and have it be exactly as I left it so when I arrive the next day I can just get straight into it.\n\nIt felt like It took half my shift to get used to the new desk - if I managed to get a  desk. I had an agreed upon late start (7:30am) because of my disability making it difficult to arrive before 7am like the rest of the staff.\n\nI went from 110% KPI prior to hot desking to 74% after, 60% was when your job would start being in jeopardy, but honestly at 74% I felt completely useless, it was really messing with my head, my self esteem and my sense of job satisfaction. I knew I could do better if my environment was different, but that was outside my control.\n\nI dislocated my hip in June and my doctor and I fought tooth and nail to get me a hip precaution chair, but that chair didn't fit under most of the available desks, I ended up working without a desk, with a laptop on my lap most days. It was not productive. \n\nHowever, Hot desking was exactly what some of my colleagues needed, It did make them more productive, the change of pace was necessary for them to thrive.\n\nIt's a simple matter of not all people working the same, If you want your staff to be productive you need to be able to support their individual needs. Hot desking is a good idea, But it should not be forced upon an entire group of people and their complaints ignored in favour of \"Research state it's better\" when the simple fact is that not everyone is going to work well in that environment.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have any suggestions for how you could implement hot desks for those who need it, and maintain permanent desks for those who need it.\n\nOne thing that made hot desking the death of my previous work place was that teams were often divided across the floor. In the old days I could just swivel my chair around to ask my Team leader a question, face to face, scoot over to look at a colleagues monitor to understand exactly what they needed help with. But when we failed to get desks near each other in a hot desk environment, It meant using messaging services to ask questions, or walking across the floor, which took longer and often wasn't as effective as face to face.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone with sensory processing issues, Hot desking was a part of the reason I resigned from my last job. I had enough trouble getting a desk set up for my spine and hip disabilities, as soon as my office converted to hot desking I lost all my accommodations, I ended up working on the floor most days because it provided a more comfortable posture. A change of scenery every single day was doing my head in, I&amp;#39;m more productive when I can set up workspace and have it be exactly as I left it so when I arrive the next day I can just get straight into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It felt like It took half my shift to get used to the new desk - if I managed to get a  desk. I had an agreed upon late start (7:30am) because of my disability making it difficult to arrive before 7am like the rest of the staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went from 110% KPI prior to hot desking to 74% after, 60% was when your job would start being in jeopardy, but honestly at 74% I felt completely useless, it was really messing with my head, my self esteem and my sense of job satisfaction. I knew I could do better if my environment was different, but that was outside my control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dislocated my hip in June and my doctor and I fought tooth and nail to get me a hip precaution chair, but that chair didn&amp;#39;t fit under most of the available desks, I ended up working without a desk, with a laptop on my lap most days. It was not productive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, Hot desking was exactly what some of my colleagues needed, It did make them more productive, the change of pace was necessary for them to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a simple matter of not all people working the same, If you want your staff to be productive you need to be able to support their individual needs. Hot desking is a good idea, But it should not be forced upon an entire group of people and their complaints ignored in favour of &amp;quot;Research state it&amp;#39;s better&amp;quot; when the simple fact is that not everyone is going to work well in that environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t have any suggestions for how you could implement hot desks for those who need it, and maintain permanent desks for those who need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that made hot desking the death of my previous work place was that teams were often divided across the floor.
