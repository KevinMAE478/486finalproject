My group of friends were heading out of town for a sold out Flogging Molly concert. Everyone in the group had tickets for the show, except for one other guy and myself, but we just figured we&amp;#39;d buy from a scalper once we arrived. Well, tickets on the street were far more outrageous than we had anticipated, so we were left to wander downtown on our own while everyone else enjoyed the show. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We spent some time bar hopping, collecting a respectable buzz, when I decided we were getting into that show. My friend inquired as to how we were going to accomplish this, to which I told him, &amp;quot;just let me do any talking and always follow my lead.&amp;quot; Honestly, I didn&amp;#39;t have a plan at this point; I just knew that I was going to talk our way in: one way or another. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well -as luck would have it that- at the exact moment we were approaching the entrance, security was dragging out a few extremely intoxicated concertgoers. While there wasn&amp;#39;t an overly big scene with this, there was just enough of one for me to see my opportunity. I jumped into the middle of things and immediately began acting like I knew the drunk patrons while offering my assistance at taking them off of securities hands. The guards, ready to be done with these belligerent drunkards, gladly handed them off to the care of my friend and I, and we headed down the block. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got them out of sight around the corner, where I then phoned a taxi, gave them a couple smokes, and headed back towards the venue. I instructed my friend to look straight ahead and follow me inside without even acknowledging the ticketing agents. We did exactly that, only to be stopped after just getting past the counter. Before I had to utter a word, two of the security guards interjected letting the booth worker know that we were already here before, but had to leave to get a drunk friend out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lady apologizes and we head in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feeling extra confident at this point, I tell one of the guards that our group is at the front of the venue and wanted to know if he could help us reclaim our spots.
