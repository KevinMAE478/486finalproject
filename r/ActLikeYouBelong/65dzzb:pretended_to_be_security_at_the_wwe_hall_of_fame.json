After the event we got back to the subway station at MSG and we walked outside thinking we could catch some wrestlers who were getting to MSG for the hall of fame. We were standing by a random entrance that was pretty deserted and noticed two long strings of tape on the ground from the street to the door. We just joked around thinking that this is where all the wrestlers are going to enter. Just as we said that, a WWE bus comes and parks on the side of the street at the end of the line of tape. We were all wearing black jackets and sunglasses so we just stood along the line while random people, actual security and photographers came out of nowhere. Next thing you know is that we&amp;#39;re at the front &amp;quot;holding&amp;quot; people back behind the line. In total 3 busloads of current and retired wrestlers came thorough as we pretended to be security. Some even thanked us as they walked by (Big Show was the absolute nicest and also the biggest person I have ever seen). We didn&amp;#39;t see any of the major stars at the time (John Cena, Stone Cold, HBK) as they all had bigger entrances at the front of the arena, but regardless it was super cool to see and say hi to these guys up close while pretending to be their security. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Quite an old story but just found this sub and thought this would be a cool place to tell this story.\n\nMy friends and I travelled to NYC for Wrestlemania 29 and on the Saturday before the event we went to the Izod Center to see the Wrestlemania fan access event.
