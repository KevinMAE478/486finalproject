By senior year I already got the scholarships I needed, so I let loose a bit. Because my siblings were quite the opposite, my parents pretty much didn&amp;#39;t care at all.

Not really ready for this test next period&amp;quot; and they would, no questions asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one likes to skip alone, so I would then call school and sign out one of my teammates acting as their dad. This was a weekly occurrence for awhile, until we stupidly bragged to others and it became a known issue for the school. Someone warned us that they asked to verify the home address on record, so the next time I made sure to have his memorized. So next time sure enough, they asked, I verified, and then they informed me that they don&amp;#39;t have my phone number on file... so I gave them mine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next time I called to sign him out, they didn&amp;#39;t ask about the home address. Instead their new method was to call back that number on file. So naturally, they call me afterwards and I confirm that I just signed him out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best part about this:  Later on, my buddy was caught using chewing tobacco during class. My school was VERY strict about tobacco on campus, so gave him out-of-school suspension immediately. The principal called me, so I stepped out in the hall during one of my senior joke classes, acted disappointed as he informed me I would need to come pick him up, and I texted me parents to sign me out as we enjoyed our free day off. His parents never found out and I took the next few days off during his OOS to enjoy with him. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "A little backstory:  In high school, I excelled in sports and academics, never got in trouble, and rarely went out.
