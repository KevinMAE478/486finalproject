I kind of just walked about 15 yards just past the security guards and said hey man! Like I knew him. Thank God the security guards let me get this far without saying anything so I was able to talk to him. Anyway, I just straight up tell him that I have couple grams of straight chronic if I could borrow his vest and broom so that I could sneak in and then he could come in after using his id if needed. He smiled and said hell yeah my guys been dry all week. I was filled with joy. I had an 8th of weed and I split it in half to share between us. The idea worked and I got in.
