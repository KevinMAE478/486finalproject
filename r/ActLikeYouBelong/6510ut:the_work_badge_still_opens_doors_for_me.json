Well I posted before of how I got me and a girlfriend into an NFL after party. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time I have to share an epic tale of how I almost got caught, weaseled out of it, and then was able to keep my badge and enjoy the rest of the event. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a little while ago and this company had a thing going at one of the conventions. Had a booth set up and we knew about it thanks to a friend. I will not say what kind of convention because right now I am actually kind of in the danger zone for being caught by said company. They don&amp;#39;t have my name but they know that someone has been using an expired badge to gain entrance to places.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I show up at one of the side entrances and me and my friend are just waived through. We carried all of our stuff in these bulky boxes normally used for carrying sound equipment and the security guys just waived us in when they saw my badge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We get in and are informed that if we want access to the rest of the con we need to get passes from the table in the back. Well problem there as they were taking down names and checking them against a list. I panic a bit at first, but then notice that no one is actually making us go there right away and decide to wait a bit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A small incident came about first with a security guard. HE saw us not actually doing anything and asked us if we were supposed to be there. We informed him that we were added at the last minute to the event by our work and that we were not given any instructions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The security guard laughs and says &amp;quot;Typical&amp;quot; and makes us follow him to the booth. Now I was sure I would have been caught right then and there but nothing came of it. We go over to the booth and one of the guys setting it up was working. The guard asks him if we were part of the event and the guy looks at my badge and simply says. &amp;quot;He is an ____ employee yes.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guard nodded and told us sorry for the hassle and let us go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My moment to get into the rest of the con came a little later when the security guards went to handle a drunk incident with a female model and drunk A-hole leaving me an open opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walk out the doors and over to the table where people were getting passes from. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me - Hey can you help? We lost our passes &lt;em&gt;shows him my badge&lt;/em&gt; and they directed us here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her - We can give you a VIP pass if you want. Same access as presenter passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me - Perfect&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her - I just need your names. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me - &lt;em&gt;Slight panic but rolls with it. I give her my name and my girlfriend&amp;#39;s name.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her - Your name&amp;#39;s aren&amp;#39;t checking out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me - &lt;em&gt;Feigning frustration.&lt;/em&gt; God again? &lt;em&gt;Pulls out phone&lt;/em&gt; Sorry we were added to the event at the last minute. Have been dealing with this all day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am pretending to make a call so I can quietly exit when the security guard from earlier walks by as several of the security guards escort the drunk guy out. I &amp;quot;hang up&amp;quot; the phone and wave him over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has an annoyed look on his face and asks whats the issue. We explain that the lady at the table was asking us if we were supposed to be here. He was in a hurry and looks at the lady. &amp;quot;I confirmed it with ____ earlier. They are authorized to be here as part of the crew.&amp;quot; Then immediately leaves to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are handed our passes and we enjoy the rest of the convention. Those passes got us into the con all weekend and into every single booth and event. We even got into advanced screenings for a movie. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have decided to put away the badge for a while before the heat dies down. But I am truly thankful for this badge.
