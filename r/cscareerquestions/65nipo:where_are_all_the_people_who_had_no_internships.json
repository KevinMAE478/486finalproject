In our field that included programmers, engineers, architects, sys admins, and so on. Also, to \"trim the fat\" corporations started firing their most seasoned and talented individuals simply because it was cheaper to replace them with 2 kids out of college. \n\nNow the thing is, \"career advancement\" is like a pyramid, the farther up the chain you go, the less positions are available, and the more people from the lower part of the pyramid want to go \"up the ranks.\" \n\nHere is a very real scenario: I am a Senior Software Architect making, oh lets say 150k. I get fired. So do a lot of people who do what I do. Lets say I am in the top 60% of my field; problem is people in the top 90% of my field, who by the way are making 220k, all of a sudden have to take something comparable to my position with less pay. As an employer, I'd rather pay someone 150k who is worth 220k(SALE!). \n\nSo here I am. Whoever did get fired, and subsequently did find another job sucked up all of the Architect positions. So now I am forced to take a Software Engineer III role. See where I am going with this? The architects took the senior engineer roles, the senior engineers took the mid-level roles, and the mid-levels took the entry level jobs. That's also why you keep seeing \"entry level with 1-3 years of experience required\" posts (A lot of that also has to do with H-1B visas, but I digress). This is a legacy of the damage done as more seasoned people accepted less seasoned positions. \n\nSo how did it damage you? Well, my wife is only 4 years younger than me. (i'm 35). Because of the recession and timing of Millennials joining the work force, as well as people in positions of leadership not being able to retire because they were wiped out, I've read articles saying that 5-10 years of wealth gain was destroyed overnight. By not being able to find a job, by finding a job but not getting raises or promotions, your generation is on a much weaker footing, let alone all of the student loan debt.  \n\nYou are entering the work force with more demanding responsibilities, longer hours, less pay, and so on. \n\nIt is a game of numbers. Keep trying! Eventually you will find something. I usually apply to hundreds of positions after scouring thousands of postings when considering a move, of which maybe 10-20 respond (With my seniority, I expect a lot from a perspective employer, and am not willing to undercut myself). Of those probably 3-4 lead to an offer, and I pick which one I want. It takes time and effort, but its worth it. Every night I would sit down for months looking for new postings, and applying. The worst thing they can do is ignore you. You are gaining great experience by talking to potential employers, and the interview process is something you will eventually get comfortable with. \n\nI've interviewed hundreds of candidates, probably reviewed thousands of resumes, and I can tell you that even with people who are nervous, I can tell very quickly if someone is comfortable in their own skin, and if they know what they profess to know. \n\nKeep trying! I've said this before. No one will care what degree you got with what GPA 3-5 years down the road. The degree is just a stepping stone, especially in Engineering. Once you start having a proven track record, as long as you are diligent, and follow through on your promises, your reputation will start to precede you.\n\nI went to a no name school. GPA was decent but that really didn't matter to me. There are engineers far brighter than I. And I wish them all the best of luck. In fact some of the trails they've paved have made my progression much easier. They were the pioneers, I was the guy setting up shop once the town was built and the economy was flowing. I digress. Point being, you can be an average to above average engineer, (not a super-start with brand name recognition), and still live a very comfortable lifestyle. \n\nEdit: Grammatical tenses", "edited": 1492358370.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing people need to realize, and this is a tough pill to swallow; but the truth is the 2008 market crash in the US had catastrophic effects on the people just about to enter the work force for any field.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The effect was two fold. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, a lot of people got fired.

You are gaining great experience by talking to potential employers, and the interview process is something you will eventually get comfortable with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve interviewed hundreds of candidates, probably reviewed thousands of resumes, and I can tell you that even with people who are nervous, I can tell very quickly if someone is comfortable in their own skin, and if they know what they profess to know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep trying! I&amp;#39;ve said this before. No one will care what degree you got with what GPA 3-5 years down the road. The degree is just a stepping stone, especially in Engineering. Once you start having a proven track record, as long as you are diligent, and follow through on your promises, your reputation will start to precede you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to a no name school. GPA was decent but that really didn&amp;#39;t matter to me. There are engineers far brighter than I. And I wish them all the best of luck. In fact some of the trails they&amp;#39;ve paved have made my progression much easier. They were the pioneers, I was the guy setting up shop once the town was built and the economy was flowing. I digress. Point being, you can be an average to above average engineer, (not a super-start with brand name recognition), and still live a very comfortable lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Grammatical tenses&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dgc6g5t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492386751.0, "created_utc": 1492357951.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nipo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nipo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nipo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nipo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nipo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nipo", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgccbkh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RunninADorito", "parent_id": "t1_dgcazqt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The best is when you've got a 4.0 from one of those schools that's out of 5.0.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best is when you&amp;#39;ve got a 4.0 from one of those schools that&amp;#39;s out of 5.0.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dgccbkh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492394496.0, "created_utc": 1492365696.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nipo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcvbi5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "quenty234", "parent_id": "t1_dgcazqt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "HIRED.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIRED.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dgcvbi5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492419806.0, "created_utc": 1492391006.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcazqt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 20, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Frenchiie", "parent_id": "t1_dgca9wn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "i listed my GPA as over 9000.

Hey, I wanted to inquire about a junior level position. I have a CS degree. I was reading your HN posts, and I&amp;#39;ve seen &amp;lt;startupName&amp;gt; ads in &amp;lt;localCity&amp;gt; near &amp;lt;university&amp;gt;; so I thought why not try. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About me: I only have a few months contract experience for a startup, called &amp;lt;startupName&amp;gt;, in NYC.

I&amp;#39;ve developed projects in many languages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) General company someone refered me to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, thanks for this. I know &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; is a solid company from word-of-mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, understand me: I have been doing CS for my entire life (I can show you might 8th grade bio if you want). I care the most about doing the best that I can at the job that I have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my last contract, I have high recommendations from the CTO that I worked with.

I had to move back with my parents at the age of 30 and I&amp;#39;m now 34.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only one place asked about my GPA and class descriptions, but that was back in early 2008. Right now I&amp;#39;m still grinding away to my goal of reaching a stable financial state so that I can be self sufficient and rent a home. I&amp;#39;m considering lowering my job goals some more and apply for Junior positions again. Maybe this time I&amp;#39;ll be off to a better start.

I applied for 70 jobs, had 10 interviews and like 3/4 offers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all about persistence. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dgc19ie", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492378845.0, "created_utc": 1492350045.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nipo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc1nml", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fulaphex", "parent_id": "t3_65nipo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've had no internships yet, no impressive side projects, still doing master.

It was tough but I did get a job in QA.  I always did great whenever I got the chance to answer technical or programming questions.  Within a few months in QA, it was clear to those that I was working with that I had more value in development, and I&amp;#39;m a Junior Engineer.  It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; 83K a year, but after living so long with no or little income, I learned how to manage money really well.  I feel rich.  I go in to work excited, and leave with a little more experience under my belt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t anticipate having any trouble scaling ranks or getting other jobs in the industry going forward.  I&amp;#39;m in my 30s, and only a year in the game.  I don&amp;#39;t regret taking my detours, but I do regret taking so much time thinking that I had no chance.  Brush up your skills, read what you can, send out the resume, follow the advice given here, work your ass off, and just don&amp;#39;t give up on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dgckb6z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492404995.0, "created_utc": 1492376195.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nipo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgckq3z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "honestlytbh", "parent_id": "t3_65nipo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't quite fit the profile, but I feel like my profile's mediocre enough to compare.
