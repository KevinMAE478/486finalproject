Another weird thing about the interview was that it started in the morning and continued until the afternoon but there was no lunch scheduled. So I just ate a big breakfast. I thought ahead of time maybe one of the interviews will be a lunch one but they were all in a conference room. Although they did ask if I wanted snacks. But I had a good time interviewing there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dg5bs3y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491992360.0, "created_utc": 1491963560.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s6o4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s6o4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg57sgd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ranma69", "parent_id": "t1_dg4uxz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "yeah i applied for the fellowship.
