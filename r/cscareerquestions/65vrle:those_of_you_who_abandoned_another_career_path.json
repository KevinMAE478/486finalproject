It was bullshit bc they said they were looking to hire entry level grads for this position, but they offered no training or support. I considered it a major failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So back to square one. I got right back on the application train. Applied, applied, &amp;amp; applied. Reached out to the same recruiter from that staffing company but he didn&amp;#39;t seem like he wanted to work with me again. Another 6mo go by just like that and I&amp;#39;m getting depressed, discouraged, and severely fed up with the lack of control I have over my life. Again, luckily for me, another recruiter offers me up a position at an IT company working in &amp;quot;Federal Contracts&amp;quot; and I jump on it. Being another contract position, it&amp;#39;s hourly wage without benefits. Everything at this point seems to be going well. I stick around for 14 months before my boss leaves the company for another position and the replacement (a hard ass black women) decides to lay off all contract personnel. So...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That happened in Fall of 2016 and I&amp;#39;m still jobless. Its been 6+ months now. So, all in all since I graduated college in winter of 2012, I&amp;#39;ve had 16mo of  &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; work experience. Despite my constant effort applying and reaching out to all my contacts, I can&amp;#39;t seem to land anything substantial. And all those contract positions I had before payed under $20/hr. Not sure what to do at this point. I keep busy by doing Coursera and Edx MOOCs online, I have a gym membership so I workout, but I&amp;#39;m almost 27 with not much experience (bc I can&amp;#39;t seem to get hired anywhere) and no future prospects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dgdxmfr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492484283.0, "created_utc": 1492455483.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vrle", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgebi75", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "burdalane", "parent_id": "t1_dgdlc3h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;  You get too scared and comfortable to change your circumstances so you just accept that IT help desk job and let 10 years go by.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the path I've taken, minus the the help desk.

But I quickly noticed that I am only really passionate about CS. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spent the entire 3 years of my BSc skipping classes and working on a programming projects and studying CS lectures, and graduated with the bare minimum grade. However, it turns out people in life sciences are very interested in computer science implementations, but noone is able to do it, so I leveraged my background to land myself an internship. I guess the CS standards are much lower outside of CS fields, I would never have landed an internship in a CS field with my resume at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there on I was allowed to freely research what I desired, and I have now forgotten everything about biology and chemistry. Had options to go to a top uni and big companies, I feel like I would never be able to distinguish myself if I didn&amp;#39;t pursue what I was truly passionate about. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dgdo047", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492473546.0, "created_utc": 1492444746.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vrle", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdk57o", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Macduffer", "parent_id": "t3_65vrle", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nope.

I worked in a research lab to get experience to apply to those programs, typically more on the computational side of bio but also had to do a ton of the traditional cell/molecular stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Working on the computational aspect of bio made me realize how much I loved programming (plus I already took a ton of CS courses in undergrad).  Furthermore, the lack of job prospects in industry and academia for bio PhDs kind of contributed to that choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am currently going for my MS in computer science at my top choice grad school, and I have no regrets since I love what I am doing.  Biological research got kind of boring and repetitive since it seems like you are always repeating the same experiments over and over again, yet I am always being challenged by something new as a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My only true regret was not attending an undergrad that was engineering focused, since I never considered becoming a programmer until fairly recently.  My undergrad school, while big, decent and well known, does not have a lot of CS major students and very little recruiting in that field.  Most of our students go into law, banking, or academia.
