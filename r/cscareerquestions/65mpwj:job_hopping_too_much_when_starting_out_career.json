The pay was about $35k/year full-time as a contractor.

But the bad part is that I am also basically a generalist for anything computer related in the small office (12 people), so I also fix computers and answer excel/wordpress questions. This second part has become a huge drain on me, especially since one of my co-workers is both utterly useless and mean about it, and I find hours of my day wasted trying to explain basic concepts and defend myself on accusations related to her own mess ups.
