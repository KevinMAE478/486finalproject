In this class we have weekly problem sets and it literally takes me hours to understand them; I also never finish on time despite not having a life at all and committing the majority of my time to the class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never felt like a &amp;quot;CS person&amp;quot; -- my forte was always English, music, etc. and I&amp;#39;m breezing through the philosophy and music classes I&amp;#39;m taking. I guess I decided to take CS classes for financial stability and also because I didn&amp;#39;t know what other subjects I could study that would lead to financially stable jobs in the future. That being said, I actually enjoyed my Data Structures class and decided to keep studying CS since I liked understanding the big concepts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know maybe it&amp;#39;s the networks/nitty gritty nature of this class that is really hard for me. I can choose CS tracks in my future studies. I&amp;#39;ve also never made an app, website, or done any personal projects -- I have 0 idea of what I will actually do in the real world.
