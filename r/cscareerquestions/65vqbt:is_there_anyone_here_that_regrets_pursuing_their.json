The work is meh for the most part, but that's the work for the vast majority of people at my level; you need to pay your dues.\n\nAs someone who has had shitty jobs before, boring is fine as long as it pays reasonably well and you're learning gradually. Nothing keeps me from learning cool things once I go home, so the boring part is not something that I worry about too much. You just go through the motions with most jobs after a while if you're good at the job.\n\nI think the best way to stay sane is to take a step back sometimes. I'm not a big fan of the whole rockstar developer mentality and how if you don't program day and night in your free time, you're somehow less of a developer. For me, if I want to do something in my free time, I do it. If not, I don't do it. It's worked pretty well for me so far. You're a teenager. You're way ahead of most people. I didn't start programming until university...\n\nTLDR: Enjoy programming. A job is just a job. It doesn't define who you are. Take a break when you don't feel like programming.
