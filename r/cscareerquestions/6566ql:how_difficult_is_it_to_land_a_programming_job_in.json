Sometimes done online on sites like Haker Rank, sometimes you are given a spec for a simple exercise to complete. May come before or after the phone screen depending on the company. Some companies don't do this, but it's quite common.\n\n3) On-site interview. Some companies will cover the travel costs,  some will not. You can expect around half day of questions with at least 2 interviewers.
