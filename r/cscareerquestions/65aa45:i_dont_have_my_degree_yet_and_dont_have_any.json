But CS  is  largely a theoretical field,  at my school Computer Science was the 4-year program that is said to focus on theory,   and  &amp;quot;Programming&amp;quot;   was a separate  2-year associates degree program \n geared for practitioners, with an internship after 2yrs,   that would get new people in, trained, and out ready to program in a short time.   (In other words:  teaching people to go into business as professional computer programmers is a totally different degree and much shorter program than CS.    The CS program require a more-rounded education with requirements in other subjects such as History, Physics, English literature, and Behavioral sciences,  and covers a lot of theory,  but not so much programming or  specific frameworks such as Sockets).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the CS program,   programming assignments are fairly limited, \nthey teach the syntax of 1 or 2 languages they have picked for students to use as a tool,  and the basics,  and   assignments are geared towards  demonstrating  an understanding of  computation, Algorithms, Data structures,  and Theory,       But  not  specific Application Development knowledge....  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got essentially, nothing beyond simple ANSI Standard C/c++  (No BSD/POSIX syscalls,  No BOOST library, no STL or other common frameworks),  and MIPS Assembly for the Computer Architecture and Assembly Programming courses;  C# and .NET for the Software Engineering course;  Common LISP for the Artificial Intelligence course;  Standard ML of New Jersey (sml), Occam,  Python,  and SNOBOL   for   the &amp;quot;Programming Languages&amp;quot; course,  finally we used  SML again, Ada, Algol68,  Flex and Yacc  for the  Compilers class,  and then  Perl + Awk + Sed + Cut  + Cat + Sort + Uniq  + Grep + Bc + Tee + Troff   in  the optional Unix programming class I chose;   Finally,   Java in the optional Java class I chose,   which  I also  re-used  in  the optional cryptography and security classes I chose,   and in the senior computer graphics course, where we were allowed to pick any programming language we wanted  to do our work in,  so long as we leveraged OpenGL....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But see?   No Sockets or UNIX-related C  coverage anywhere in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dg9fbql", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492218672.0, "created_utc": 1492189872.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg93plk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "euchreking", "parent_id": "t3_65aa45", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you're a junior in CS shouldn't you also have stuff like UNIX, C/C++, socket programming, data structures, among others on there?
