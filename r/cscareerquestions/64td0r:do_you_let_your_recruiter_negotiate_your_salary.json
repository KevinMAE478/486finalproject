For you, a salary of $X vs $(X + 10%) can be a significant bump in quality of life, financial security, long term savings, etc. You would put in quite a significant effort to achieve that, as you should. For the recruiter, however, this is just one &amp;quot;sale&amp;quot; among many, and the sooner they can get it over with, the sooner they can move on to the next one. They wouldn&amp;#39;t want to do anything that could delay or even jeopardize the &amp;quot;sale&amp;quot;, such as trying to negotiate a better &amp;quot;price&amp;quot; for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the recruiter&amp;#39;s relationship with the client (hiring manager) is much more lived than that with the client. Ideally, a recruiter wants to fill multiple openings for the same client over the course of time. If they can get the client a better &amp;quot;deal&amp;quot;, whether that&amp;#39;s in terms of &amp;quot;price&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;speed&amp;quot;, that&amp;#39;s much more beneficial to them in the long run than the variance on any individual commission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say third party contingency recruiters are bad or do bad things, necessarily. &lt;em&gt;They can, and have been, quite helpful&lt;/em&gt;, and I honestly appreciate that.
