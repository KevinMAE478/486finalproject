But it's the commonly used term. It's fundamental for OOP with Python. The first parameter to a member function (aka a method) is the object itself. ie, it's `self`. This lets you access fields of the object.\n\nExample:\n\n\tclass Person:\n\t\tdef __init__(self, name):\n\t\t\t# Commonly accepted practice is to initialize fields in the constructor\n\t\t\tself.name = name\n\t\t\n\t\tdef print_hello(self):\n\t\t\tprint(\"Hello,\", self.name)\n\nThen you'd use it as below. Note how you never pass anything into the `self` parameter -- that's automatic (akin to calling `person.print_hello(person)`).\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; person = Person(\"Kat\")\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; person.print_hello()\n    Hello, Kat\n\nBut you can name that `self` variable anything you wanted. Some people might prefer `this`, which is what more languages would call that concept (but `this` is typically an actual keyword). Still, `self` is the Python convention. Bad to break conventions.\n\nIf you wanna know why Python did this so differently from, oh, almost everyone else, see here: http://neopythonic.blogspot.ca/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html", "edited": 1492122323.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a keyword. But it&amp;#39;s the commonly used term. It&amp;#39;s fundamental for OOP with Python. The first parameter to a member function (aka a method) is the object itself. ie, it&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;. This lets you access fields of the object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Person:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        # Commonly accepted practice is to initialize fields in the constructor\n        self.name = name\n\n    def print_hello(self):\n        print(&amp;quot;Hello,&amp;quot;, self.name)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you&amp;#39;d use it as below. Note how you never pass anything into the &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; parameter -- that&amp;#39;s automatic (akin to calling &lt;code&gt;person.print_hello(person)&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; person = Person(&amp;quot;Kat&amp;quot;)\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; person.print_hello()\nHello, Kat\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can name that &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; variable anything you wanted. Some people might prefer &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;, which is what more languages would call that concept (but &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; is typically an actual keyword). Still, &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; is the Python convention.
