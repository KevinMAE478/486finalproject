Firstly, I&amp;#39;d like to say that initially all seemed well. I applied for an internship, and received an offer for a technical phone screen. That went okay, and about a week later I received an offer stating they thought I was a good fit and to come to a four hour &amp;quot;Blitz Day&amp;quot; where all candidates will have time to meet each other and interview both in groups and 1/1 with hiring managers. The candidates invited ranged from Software Engineers to Communications and HR. This is where things went downhill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few hours before leaving, I was told the position I applied for was no longer available, but they had another that I should come interview for. That seemed odd, but I agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving, there was well over 200 candidates there, with about a total of 25 available seats. The event required an RSVP, so I&amp;#39;m not sure what that was about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, they told us they would call us by groups on position and time of arrival. That quickly devolved to chaos, so then they told us they would call us individually. That didn&amp;#39;t work either, and then they told everyone to wait in line for a &amp;quot;pre-screen resume interview.&amp;quot; After about 30 minutes of sitting in line, they then restructured the lines and divided them up by majors, then sorted by arrival time. We were told this would be a continuous event and arrival time had no part beforehand, but now obviously it was first come, first serve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, this line was huge, and slow. I&amp;#39;m not sure why this was necessary, and why they didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;prescreen&amp;quot; resumes before hand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, &lt;strong&gt;the entire time they had a live feed of the positions, and would cross them off as they were filled.&lt;/strong&gt; People were waiting in line for a &amp;quot;pre-screen&amp;quot; for literally over two hours before having some lady come on a microphone and announce the position had been filled. All without ever having their resume even glanced at. The least they could do is say thank you for your time or offer a formal rejection, but nope. Just a loudspeaker saying the position was filled, go home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this only scratches the iceberg of some of the behavior and treatment of people I saw, but I don&amp;#39;t want to make this post too long. Overall, this obviously left me with a terrible taste in my mouth. This company was disrespectful, and borderline unethical.

What I didn&amp;#39;t mention in the post was that they never formally announced this change until about an hour into the process. Me and most others caught on by seeing the line began to form and personally asking one of the company representatives, but a good bit of people were still waiting for their name to be called like we were told would happen. Eventually, almost as an afterthought, they decided to get on the loudspeaker and tell all the remaining people who hadn&amp;#39;t caught on that &amp;quot;they need to get in line for a prescreen.&amp;quot; All the while, they were still calling names? Idk why? Like, someone&amp;#39;s name would be called, they&amp;#39;d leave the line and then be told to go get back in line (of course, to the end). Yea, obviously I left this out cause it was chaotic enough in the moment and it&amp;#39;s hard to explain, but the bottom line is many people got screwed out of positions because they failed to give any structure to things, and by the time they did the positions were already filled. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dg58w6p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491988552.0, "created_utc": 1491959752.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg586ur", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jarvvski", "parent_id": "t3_64umye", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Dude please continue.
