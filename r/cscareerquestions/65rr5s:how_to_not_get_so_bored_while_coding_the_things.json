I don&amp;#39;t like to learn new programming concepts/podcasts while I am coding. But I do like to have white noise that is informative, yet unrelated to programming. That way it prevents me from picking out technical &amp;quot;trigger&amp;quot; words in talks which would distract me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, when I get bored with music, I start to watch Starcraft 2 tournaments. You don&amp;#39;t have to be actively watching the screen all the time, just listening to the commentary. Same thing with historical documentaries; how are battleships built? why did they fall out of favor after WW1, what was the eastern campaign in ww2 like...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will be surprised how many hours pass by just listening to that stuff in the background. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes it easier to deal with shit you don&amp;#39;t like to do, if you are simultaneously doing something you do like to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like to watch documentaries about quantum mechanics or anything that would require 100% of my attention just to wrap my mind around what they are trying to say. I watch some TED talks. But usually it gets analytical and that would draw my attention away. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dgcubnt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492418487.0, "created_utc": 1492389687.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr5s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdelgj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "edcRachel", "parent_id": "t1_dgcq3tu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I can't code without music.

Make it part of your daily routine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have the same problem, I just can&amp;#39;t focus on ds/a problems. They are just so irrelevant to my day-to-day work (compared to the other vast number of topics I could be learning) that I get frustrated. I have a list of 10 books that I want to read and learn that will immediately impact my performance as a programmer. Yet, I need to study for dozens of hours for nothing but an interview. I&amp;#39;m an iOS developer. I could write a quadratic search algorithm and nobody would ever notice. I find studying for an interview to be idiotic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current goal is to finish every problem in CTCI doing two per day. Then find another book to do two per day. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dgdxoos", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492484354.0, "created_utc": 1492455554.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr5s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcugcq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dxplq876", "parent_id": "t3_65rr5s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I find music really helps for the boring things.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find music really helps for the boring things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dgcugcq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492418656.0, "created_utc": 1492389856.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr5s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr5s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65rr5s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd5egu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CaliganDev", "parent_id": "t1_dgcyg2q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No way around them, sure, but you can still perfect them.
