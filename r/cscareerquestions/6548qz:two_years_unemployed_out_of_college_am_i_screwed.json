My advice is mainly from what I've felt has worked for me in job searches.\n\n&gt; Worked independently to design and implement Python code for automated remote measuring of various sensors, using a LabJack data acquisition system.\n\nTo me this seems to be an important part of your work. I would include more details and break it up into several bullets. For example, I would name the sensors. Was the sensor data processed in anyway in your code? If so mention that. Even if you implemented an algorithm that you didn't develop there is still value in mentioning that you implemented it. I.e. if you used a sensor fusion algorithm you found on github you should mention that you implemented a sensor fusion algorithm (and name the algorithm as well). Did you use any Python libraries, for example numpy? If so, name it. If nothing else, naming these things will bring your resume up in a keyword search.\n\n&gt; Designed and implemented code for measuring three-phase electrical power consumption.\n\nAgain, more details. What were you measuring the power consumption for? Talk about the hardware involved: how was the power being measured? Name your hardware? How did you communicate with it? What protocol? Did this involve any embedded programming? Also, if your program had any features worth mentioning you should mention them. I.e. did you design a GUI?\n\n&gt; Configured a MySQL database to store collected data, and wrote python code to automatically upload data to the database.\n\nWhere was the data being retrieved from? How was it automatically uploaded? i.e. was all data backed up at the end of day? Or was this part of the data acquisition process?\n\n&gt; Offered troubleshooting advice and computer technical support\n\nI would leave this off. IMO it looks like you're just fishing for stuff to put on there which can make the reader think less of the other stuff you've done.\n\nI would bring 'Projects' before 'Skills'. The skills section provides little insight into what you've done and serves more as a list of keywords so your resume comes up in a search. The projects section is info about your background though. \n\n&gt; **Worked on a team to program** a TI MSP430 microcontroller embedded system to record sensor measurements...\n\nStarting a sentence with 'worked on a team' makes it sound like you didn't really contribute and you were just part of the team. I don't mention working in a team for team projects in my resume, instead I just focus on what my contributions were. When discussing it in an interview I will say it was a team project and I've listed what I did.\n\nIt's good that you've named the micro-controller, but it would be even better if you included the processor in there. i.e. does that board have an ARM Cortex M processor? Put that info in there because it's more likely that someone will be looking for someone with experience with a certain ARM processor than with a certain TI board.  \n\n&gt; Integrated sensor data-measuring components with PC-display components.\n\nAgain, name the sensors and specify what you your code did and how you communicated with the PC.\n\n&gt; Optimized power consumption for maximum battery life\n\nHow did you optimize it?
