I avoided a CS degree because I thought that was just what the IT guy at my highschool did and I would be stuck fixing computers all day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should have spent more time researching what my options were with each degree, but I also think there should be more emphasis on this in high school so students are prepared for what they are signing up for. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it is really challenging and rare for someone to decide what they want to do for the rest of their life when they are 16-17. For me,  it was a process of elimination. Try something, realize it was not what I was looking for, start over and try something else. I have had 6 jobs in the past 5 years and it kinda bums me out that I didn&amp;#39;t decide to start learning to program earlier. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "name": "t1_dgd2hgw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492429778.0, "created_utc": 1492400978.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sw02", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sw02", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeb13b", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thingsThatMatterToMe", "parent_id": "t1_dgd9pyz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Would you still recommend suffering the course to the end, despite yourself coming out jobless?\n\nUnfortunately, yes.
