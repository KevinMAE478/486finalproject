It is a story of joy and victory, sadness and defeat, of crushing workloads at times and thumb twiddling at others.\n\nOur story begins as young Throwaway arrives at the Uber office on the first day. He survived the interview gauntlet, proud to work at a company with a well known name. He had heard stories--dark, troublesome stories--about Uber, but those stories had mostly been told years ago, and his friends had told him Uber had much improved.\n\nPrior to having arrived, Uber's HR team had sent out all of the usual first day forms. This meant that, unlike some previous first days, most HR paperwork had already been filled out. Minor formalities remained, such as verifying the form I-9 documents, so much of the first day was spent setting up the laptop.\n\nAs was the fashion in the tech industry, it was a brand new Macbook Pro. Throwaway savored pulling off the plastic wrap from the machine--ah, how wonderful it is to unbox a machine! He followed the instructions, and soon he was able to access Uber's internal tools and repos.\n\nBut as he continued, he saw the first signs of trouble: a tool called `boxer`. It was an internal Uber written application that would claim--or create--an EC2 instance in AWS, run puppet or some other config gooblegock--our hero was not versed in the arcane arts of operations--and install Uber services.\n\nThe tool failed, and failed some more. It took hours before it finally succeeded, and at the end it turned out it was only needed for services that couldn't be run locally for legacy reasons. Hours wasted for our hero, as his work mostly never needed to touch that world.\n\nAt long last, Throwaway's manager approached with a starter task. It was the standard starter task; a boolean field was returning true when it should have returned false in a certain circumstance. Throwaway cloned the repo and got to work, finding the offending field and putting out a diff to fix said minor bug.\n\nAs he wrote the diff, he discovered something curious in the repo he was working in. Real Time API, it was called. A curious name, as it was not real time--at least, not any more real time than any other API--and it didn't form a cohesive API, being a gateway service that exposed different product teams' APIs to mobile or Web clients (and, as some would argue, could be entirely replaced with an NGINX config).\n\nMost curious was the testing framework. Rather than mock dependencies and write unit tests to cover business logic, almost all endpoints were tested with integration tests that would mock out all downstream services. 100% test coverage was mandated, and this was the hack chosen to achieve that mandate.\n\nWhat it meant for Throwaway, because the endpoint he had to modify had over a hundred tests, was that he had to update a hundred unrelated tests in order to get a green build. A rather inefficient use of his time, he thought. Perhaps he would talk to the maintainers and link them to the numerous Google and other $BIG_NAME company testing blogs that argue against this very pattern. But then his heart sank when he saw the title 'Staff Engineer' on several of the core maintainers' bio pages, as he realized the battle was hopeless.\n\nBut alas, all was not lost. He was able to submit the diff, get a green build, and ultimately land the changes and fix the bug. It took days to get a code review--those staff engineers of course were **terribly** busy--whereupon he had to make changes including a series of micro-optimizations, very important in a NodeJS service endpoint whose time was entirely dominated by calling nearly a dozen downstream services. God forbid 'array.map` be used; surely the calls to the Demand service in an N+1 fashion were as optimized as possible. Likewise, the calls to this endpoint every 4 seconds were not wasteful at all--it would definitely not be possible to use the already existing Kafka events from the stateful downstream services to invalidate a cache at an absolute minimum (Author's note: This eventually did happen, many months later).\n\nNo matter, those victories wouldn't be possible today. Optimizations made, the code was landed and deployed, apparently in record time for this sort of starter task. Throwaway wasn't sure whether to be happy or sad, given that at previous companies this task would be literally an hour long at most. He settled on happy.\n\nThe weeks passed. More tasks were given, and Throwaway met them with equal determination, still confused at how much of this RTAPI service was structured, but finding equally puzzling code in other services. His own team wrote well structured code, gave great code reviews, and his skills grew, but most of his tasks involved touching other teams' codebases. It would appear the hiring bar was much lower a year before Throwaway was hired.\n\nStill, he enjoyed having a relatively big impact. Brand new features materialized, and the work was never ending. He went from working 8 hours a day to 9 hours a day. On at least a few occassions, he had to put out diffs on the weekend to keep up with the immense workload.\n\nBut then at other times Product--which entirely dominated engineering--would forget about his team. And he would thus be left with little work, save that which he could find for himself. But then the cycle would continue anew: deathmarch to breather.\n\nEventually, a new enemy was introduced: PagerDuty. You see, Throwaway was not a smart person, at least when it came to asking work life balance questions. All of his previous jobs had had a great balance, for the most part, and thus he was spoiled. Uber corrected that mistake, as eventually he would find himself waking up at 3AM to outages he was not in any way trained for, in services his team did not work on at all, mostly caused by downstream services his team couldn't fix anyways. Life was not good. \n\nRoughly once every two weeks--about a month across the whole year--Throwaway was on the rotation, having to respond to pages and manage outages. Other teams had it worse; there were some teams with only two people, who alternated. Other teams had it better, being more focused and having more people, meaning fewer bad pages and less time on the rotation. During his PagerDuty time, Throwaway would not dare venture out far, if at all, as he knew that a page would come. And boy, did they come, as management had the philosophy of erring on the side of keeping flaky alerts rather than miss an outage and not prioritizing fixes.\n\nBut all was not entirely terrible.\n\nBefore long, Throwaway found himself leading a team against his will, but not an actual manager. He had extremely smart people working with him, and they crushed their goals ahead of time without deathmarches. Life was good, save for PagerDuty.\n\nBut then Product and Throwaway engaged in epic duels, where Throwaway wanted to see success metrics for product features, and product couldn't define them. His team hated their product manager and projects, as did Throwaway, especially as their own well-defined projects were rejected. Fix bugs in critical user-facing places? Hah, the product manager laughed, let's add more fancy animations instead. Despite a 'driver obsessed' year, pro-driver features were shot down, even when metrics showed real issues. Better launch features we can't measure the success of, and then when we can measure the impact, find it only improves 1% of interactions, and then by a negligible amount.\n\nIt was not only PMs he struggled with. He saw diffs where fellow engineers had had comments such as 'I never want to see code by your team ever again' written on them. He had had engineers from his team comment on *his* diffs before the maintainers of the repo did, to then have the original maintainers rant over HipChat against those comments for an hour or more cursing the name of Throwaway's teammate for making a simple mistaken comment that Throwaway had planned on ignoring.\n\nHe saw much duplicated services and code for political reasons. He even had to build them himself, to avoid updating a garbage service that stored undocumented JSON blobs in MySQL.\n\nAnd then the series of scandals happened. Fellow teammates started to leave, and the PagerDuty rotation got smaller and smaller. Pressure was mounting to leave. He hit LeetCode hard.\n\nSo far this is where the story ends.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a software engineer at Uber.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a story.
