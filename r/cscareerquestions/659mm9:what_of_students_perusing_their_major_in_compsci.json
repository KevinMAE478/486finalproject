Back to your OP, I don't mean to discourage you at all but programming comprises maybe 35% of what you do in college as a CS major, the rest of your classes will consist of discrete math and abstract concepts such as algorithms and data structures, etc... \n\n&gt;All we did was follow a book and copy code into the screen for the most part\n\nIf this is your only background with CS, not to discourage you again, but you will fail horribly. I took college level java last year and tbh I spent more time studying for that class than my calculus class just to give you a visual of the work load.\n\n&gt;I really want to go down this career path, but lets just say i'm a little scared. I mean this is my future and I don't want to fuck it up and be left 20k in debt \n\nEspecially in CS, degrees don't mean shit except that they're a pretty piece of paper so please don't expect to just 'go through the motions' of getting your degree and expect a $80k+ salary. Companies mainly care about projects you have on your Github or other collabs you've made not GPA as much but a high one helps.\n\nI hate how the majority of my comments are critical especially because you seem really excited however trust me, but your first sentence is a major red flag. Take it from someone who's changed their major 4 times because I kept googling \"highest paying jobs\" and thought I'll just go with it but thats not realistic. \n\n&gt;Now the thing is, i'm interested in perusing compsci not only because it's the one thing that at least I feel like I have an interest in, but also I've heard the field is growing and job opportunities are endless\n\nHonestly speaking, what other areas of study have you genuinely exposed yourself to? No really, this is my main point. Before choosing a major, shadow the career. Watch a day in the life videos, etc... Sorry again for not staying CS related however you remind me of my naive 18 year old self who got really excited about a career with only mild exposure to them. I didn't know myself enough, trust me learn to *Know Thyself* . However goodluck!! Whatever path you decide to take remember they will all be hard. *Nothing good comes easy*", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the thing, I&amp;#39;m at a point in life where I need to pick a major and go to college, no other career really interests me other than&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a 20 year old who was in your position 2 years ago, please please please, do yourself a favor and just be honest with yourself and determine WHAT YOUR GOOD AT and go to school for that... Back to your OP, I don&amp;#39;t mean to discourage you at all but programming comprises maybe 35% of what you do in college as a CS major, the rest of your classes will consist of discrete math and abstract concepts such as algorithms and data structures, etc... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All we did was follow a book and copy code into the screen for the most part&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this is your only background with CS, not to discourage you again, but you will fail horribly. I took college level java last year and tbh I spent more time studying for that class than my calculus class just to give you a visual of the work load.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I really want to go down this career path, but lets just say i&amp;#39;m a little scared. I mean this is my future and I don&amp;#39;t want to fuck it up and be left 20k in debt &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially in CS, degrees don&amp;#39;t mean shit except that they&amp;#39;re a pretty piece of paper so please don&amp;#39;t expect to just &amp;#39;go through the motions&amp;#39; of getting your degree and expect a $80k+ salary. Companies mainly care about projects you have on your Github or other collabs you&amp;#39;ve made not GPA as much but a high one helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate how the majority of my comments are critical especially because you seem really excited however trust me, but your first sentence is a major red flag. Take it from someone who&amp;#39;s changed their major 4 times because I kept googling &amp;quot;highest paying jobs&amp;quot; and thought I&amp;#39;ll just go with it but thats not realistic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now the thing is, i&amp;#39;m interested in perusing compsci not only because it&amp;#39;s the one thing that at least I feel like I have an interest in, but also I&amp;#39;ve heard the field is growing and job opportunities are endless&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly speaking, what other areas of study have you genuinely exposed yourself to? No really, this is my main point. Before choosing a major, shadow the career. Watch a day in the life videos, etc...
