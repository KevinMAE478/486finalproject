And there's several types out there. \n\n**A company recruiter** - this guy will tell you his company is best and you should work there. Typically they are an employee of the company or on contract. If you want to work at that company, these are good, but once you're done, they're done. They might recommend you to friends of theirs or something but most of the time you should cut the cord. These guys are often paid to be cheerleaders for their company, and their allegiance is for sale. Though of course while they're at the company, \"no of course not, I REALLY believe in this company\", ha!\n\n**The desperate recruiter** - these guys blanket companies in the area, and work essentially on commission. For people who don't know how it works, they're usually given a % of your salary as a fee. Not out of your pocket, of course. I think I've heard 10% as a number tossed around, and I think I heard 12% once as well. So if they get you $100k salary, they're getting $10k in fees. This has two effects - the first is they're going to try to get you a good salary, the other is that if you're junior or low-end, they've got less incentive to spend time with you as you're cheaper than senior level. I have 10 years experience at this point and I still get random potshots from recruiters sending me junior level roles because they haven't really read my resume and can't be bothered.\n\n**The \"Agent\"** - I found one of these recruiters early in my career and love it. This guy treats you like a Hollywood agent. He listens to you, doesn't just throw crap your way and hoping it sticks, and keeps track of your career. He gives advice, often not in his best immediate interest, in the hopes that you'll stay loyal down the road. If you find one of these guys, stick with them.\n\n**The scammer** - These guys will represent you if you pay them a small up front fee. Run like hell. This is a scam. Anyone asking you, THE PRODUCT BEING SOLD, to pay is tricking you.\n\n**The Word-of-Mouth \"invite only\" guy** - I was lucky enough to run into one of these guys too. Doesn't advertise the same way as other recruiters, seems low key. Brings to the table unique opportunities that aren't just dredged up from Monster.com. I haven't gotten any jobs from this but it helps with the diversity of companies I'm looking at.\n\n**The incubator guy** - This guy works with incubators and knows all the startups. For anyone NOT aware of the term, an \"incubator\" is a startup farm. Big companies or investors or whatever will sponsor shared space for small startups to take risks on their dime. Most fail, some work out. I have one or two recruiters that call me regularly with \"awesome startup opportunities\". These can range from \"insane offer at an awesome place\" to \"too good to be true oh because they're measuring their posted salary based on imaginary stock options based on success they wouldn't see for 10 years if they even survive the first 6 months\". Usually this guy is loud, excited, and hyper.\n\n**The management / executive recruiter** - this is someone I discovered existed recently. They skip the whole \"junior/mid-level/senior\" stuff and go right for the upper range of architects, managers, leads, etc. This type is rare, but if you want management stuff can't really be beat.
