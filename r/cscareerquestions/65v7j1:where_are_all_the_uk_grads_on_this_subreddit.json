For example, the MS interview was incredibly technical and I was completely out of my depth. It was just after the summer where I hadn&amp;#39;t done any programming and they were really hard algorithms and data structure questions along with some programming on paper. The other two I interviewed at had basically no technical questions at all but were much more focussed on the soft skills. I genuinely believe that they (at least where I worked) are far far more interested in how you come across in the interview than the technical side of it. Even during the year working there I felt that good soft skills such as presenting, working with your team and just getting on well with people in general was so much more important than the technical skills. There were lots of people who were much better technically than me who didn&amp;#39;t get grad offers.
