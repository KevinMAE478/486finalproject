Hell, part of the reason that its stories were so compelling is because they were effectively on-rails, with no significant scope for variation from one run to the next, irrespective of the choices made. Look at (spoilers, again) the battle for Kaer Morhen, in which you can choose - during the previous few hours of gameplay and questing - who assists you, but with no real effect on the scenario itself other than minor adjustments to difficulty. Recruiting a couple of powerful magic users like Triss and Keira should result in a dramatically different event than recruiting solely fighters like Zoltan and Roche, but it doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of scope for genuine variety there, but they eschewed it in favour of a more tightly-controlled story. I&amp;#39;m not saying this was the wrong design decision, but it definitely counts against those who offer up the game as an example of player agency.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dgb3o7a", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492315529.0, "created_utc": 1492286729.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgazs08", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "StargateGuy", "parent_id": "t1_dgaxm0c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; If we're talking about player choice then something like Witcher 3 isn't a great example to use.

They are open world,  you go around doing quests and getting XP for actions you perform. By going the right way instead of the left way, you are &amp;quot;role playing&amp;quot;. Thing is, you can plug &amp;quot;RPG&amp;quot; to literally any game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was beginning my gaming career, in late 90s/early 2000s, RPG meant &amp;quot;your actions impact the world, you have lots of quests, and you get a different ending&amp;quot;. So - games like Gothic, Fallout, Deus Ex, VampireBloodlines, KOTOR, TES. You know the drill. Many people, even in these times, considered games like Diablo, Dungeon  Siege as RPGs, though I always found that odd and called it &amp;quot;hack/slash&amp;quot; instead. I actually thought that &amp;quot;the Sims&amp;quot; are more RPG-like than Diablo, because you actually are in control of the characters personality. But no one called Sims an RPG.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how do you differentiate &amp;quot;RPGs&amp;quot;?

Role-playing a Darkwraith is pretty much the same as role-playing a pedestrian in GTA.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post highlights exactly the muddying of the term &amp;quot;RPG&amp;quot; where no role-playing in the PnP sense is needed, just an ability to &amp;quot;do different stuff&amp;quot; on a few axes of freedom. Additionally there&amp;#39;s a bucket of &amp;quot;RPG elements&amp;quot; like questing, levels, skills, item choices and apparently having a few of them turn a game into an RPG. Are GTA 5, Dishonored and Minecraft also RPGs then?

I can role-play in this manner in Witcher or Pillars of Eternity to name some recent examples, but not in Dark Souls.
