Journey has an amazing soundtrack, as do so many other games, but some people might find it boring and need an in-your-face action game like Titanfall or Uncharted with shit blowing up. On the other side of the same stone, some people think linear adventures are boring and prefer to explore or at least play games that reward exploration.

I&amp;#39;m 21 and I started playing games at a young age through my older brother, aged 27 now. I didn&amp;#39;t play too many old school games, so no Baldur&amp;#39;s Gate, Planescape, etc, but I do intend to play them at some point when I have time since I love the RPG genre. I remember playing games like GTA 2 and 3, Rampage, Need For Speed, FIFA games of those years (early-mid 2000&amp;#39;s probably), Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg, lots of Sonic, Mario, etc, and Twisted Metal Black to name a few. I think I&amp;#39;m a pretty well rounded and as this is a PC gaming sub, my first PC game that I remember playing is Driver 2 and 3. &lt;strong&gt;So finally&lt;/strong&gt;, in my opinion, my perfect game would include an impeccable amount of small details. Things like stairs and steps being physical objects that characters change animations for to walk up and down like in GTA IV, and other dozens of hand-made animations that bring the character and game to life and adds lots of expression to characters without saying anything. I didn&amp;#39;t play Diablo 1 or 2 (was more into Starcraft and C&amp;amp;C)  but I did play Diablo 3 and I loved it. I loved the skills and their animations and the huge enemy density and ripping through them. I also loved how weak I was at the beginning, so I think a logical and reasonable progression system is vital to making a game feel worthwhile and can also add a lot of value to a game. Being over or under powered at the beginning of a game only for no progression to occur can make any great game fall flat. I could go on and on about what I think makes games great, but I&amp;#39;d love to hear from you. I like dissecting games and talking about them rather than just saying &amp;quot;Andromeda sucks. AI is stupid, exploration is bland, etc.&amp;quot;. I wanna know what you guys think about improving these games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and if anything, I hope this stirs some juices in your brains that get you thinking about old games that you loved.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "With so many different opinions about so many different games, I'm curious what this sub has to say about what they think makes a perfect game.

It's a lonely, hopeless world where people are dying, going mad, or raging against a hopeless cycle. Now they can achieve this just through the world design but they use every aspect of the game to make this happen. \n\nNPCs, for example. In other RPGs NPCs are everywhere. In Dark Souls, they are few and far between, and they tell you very little. Some of them want nothing to do with you. Many of them try to kill you, either by eventually going mad ('hollowing') or just to further their own ends. As such, you can't trust any of them. This is because every NPC can be attacked and can all attack you. In a lot of RPGs they exist just to be quest givers and feel very 'gamey'. By being completely untrustworthy, and transient, they make the world feel that much more treacherous, and by being so few and far between they add hugely to the loneliness of the world. The moment where you find them can fill you with hope, but it's fleeting, as they either break your heart or try and stab it. \n\nThe sound design. Almost perfect. There's no music outside of boss fights and that's because the boss fights are the key moments of the game, the most exciting and the most heart-pounding. You find them out of nowhere a lot of the time, so going from silence to some huge bombastic orchestra screeching at you adds so much to the adrenaline of the scenario. You start associating music with your own feelings towards the game. They twist this on it's head massively - the final boss theme isn't a bombastic chorus but a lonely piano. You're coming to the end of the game, the end of the hopeless cycle told about in the story, and you know that even if you kill this boss, this god, nothing good can really come of it. It is simply something that must be done. And this story is barely told to you - you work it out by how you feel through the music, and through snippets of plot given through item descriptions. \n\nAnd of course, gameplay. Dark Souls is known for being hard as shit. I think this is one of the biggest driving forces behind the world design, because the plot is about action in the face of hopelessness, futility, inevitable failure. The game is so hard that you know you're going to die like 50 more times. You accept death and failure as part of the game, just like in the plot. You have to accept misery, and resolve to continue on anyway, and for every moment of glorious victory, the game is quick to snatch it away and remind you that failure is coming also. \n\nWhen you finish a game you normally feel fulfilled and finished.

Kingdom of amalur did the abilities part better but it was much weaker on the movement/combo stuff.\n\nFighting games - Tekken 5 - it's not like i never enjoyed Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, but when i go to Practice mode and see move list it's usualy like 20-30 moves for character, and then i go to tekken and i have like 170 for Xiao, and learning a character with 170 moves is way better for me then 20-30.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;FPS - Doom 2016/Wolfenstein The New Order/Crysis 1 *planetside - for me perfection in First person shooters is about movement(fast and smooth), Guns and shooting(cool weapons and ability to shoot effectivly without aiming down sights at 10 meter range and map design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RTS - Warhammer 40:000: Dawn of War - among the most important things in RTS&amp;#39;s for me is awesome factions(since i dont like spending large amounts of time on building base and units that i wont enjoy to look at, and play with) and dawn of war is by far the  best in this factor. it also has great mechanisms, map editor and mods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TBS- Heroes of Might &amp;amp; Magic III - By far above any TBS strategy ever released for me. Strong Factions, Exploration, Combat, Progression,music and even after almost 20 years now the graphics aged realy well since it&amp;#39;s 2D based it dosn&amp;#39;t sufffer the 3D age problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3rd Person RPG&amp;#39;s - Gothic 1/Witcher 3 - RPG&amp;#39;s most important part for me is the Dialog and World Building. this is why i dont even classify Souls Series as a RPG(it&amp;#39;s a 3rd person action game for me). While Witcher 3 dosn&amp;#39;t requiare explenation, First Gothic game was a marvel. it has this thing where you expected anyone to \n turn against you at any time. nothing was free, you had to earn maps.(yes buy or steal them). so at beggining of the game your M button didnt exist like today you had to memorize roads and could get actualy lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;cRPG - Divinity: Original Sin - Never could understand D&amp;amp;D systems or put effort into understanding them, Larian took thier idea and made it understendable without reading a manual,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3rd Person Action Games - DMC3/DMC:Devil May Cry/DarkSiders 2\nin this kind of games i value pretty much only 1, thing the combat and to me the DMC series is above anything else in this regard, the remake got alot of shit for the heresy they did with iconic characters, but the combat there is absolutely the best. i mention darksiders 2 becouse while it&amp;#39;s not as good as DMC and it suffered greatly becouse of THQ bankruptcy problems during it&amp;#39;s development. they took the DMC formula and did it very well while also adding hotkeybased abilities which i liked very much.
