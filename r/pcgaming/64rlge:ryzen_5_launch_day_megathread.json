1800X). **If CPU rendering is your thing, Ryzen 5 is well ahead of same-priced i5 CPUs**.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;For **gaming, AMD ties same-priced Intel i5 CPUs** in some games \u2013 like Watch Dogs 2 before OC \u2013 and is 7-15% behind **in other games (7-10%, generally**). AMD has closed the gap in a significant way here, better than they did with R7 versus i7, and offers an even stronger argument for users who do legitimately plan to do some content creation alongside gaming. With regard to **frametimes**, AMD\u2019s R5 series is **equal in most worst cases, or well ahead in best cases**. Although the extra threads help over an i5 CPU, the R7\u2019s extra threads \u2013 Watch Dogs notwithstanding \u2013 do not generally provide much of an advantage.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If you\u2019re purely gaming and not looking to buy in $300-plus territory, it\u2019s looking like R5 CPUs are close enough to i5s to justify a purchase, if only because the frametimes are either equal or somewhat ahead[...]\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yes, i5 CPUs still provide a decent experience \u2013 but **for gaming, it\u2019s starting to look like either you\u2019re buying a 7700K, because it\u2019s significantly ahead of R5 CPUs** and it\u2019s pretty well ahead of R7 CPUs, **or you\u2019re buying an R5 CPU**. We **don\u2019t see much argument for R7s in gaming** at this point, although there is one in some cases, and we also see a **fading argument for i5 CPUs**. It's still there, for now, but fading. The current **juggernauts are**, interestingly, the **i7-7700K and the R5 1600X with an overclock**. Because the games don\u2019t much care for the R7's extra four threads over the 1600X, performance is mostly equal to the R7 products when running similar clocks. These chips, by the way, really should be overclocked. It\u2019s not hard and the gain is reasonable.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If you\u2019re already **settling for an i5 from an i7**, it\u2019s **not much of a jump to go for an R5** and benefit in **better frametimes** with thread-thrashing games. The i5 is still good, don\u2019t get us wrong, it\u2019s just not compelling enough. It\u2019s not as strong as the i7 is against R7, as the 7700K is still the definitive best in our gaming tests. Going **beyond 8 threads doesn\u2019t do a whole lot** for your gaming experience, but as we\u2019ve shown numerous times in i5 reviews, **going beyond 4 threads does help in consistent frametimes**. It\u2019s not required \u2013 you can still have a good experience without 8 threads in most games \u2013 but **that is the direction we\u2019re moving**. **16 threads won\u2019t much matter anytime soon, but 8 will and does already**. If you buy an R5, overclock it, and buy good memory, it\u2019ll be competitive with Intel. That said, be wary of spending so much on the platform and memory that you\u2019re put into i7+3200MHz territory, because at that point, you\u2019d be way better off with the i7 for gaming. It\u2019s a fine balance, but getting near an i5\u2019s average FPS isn\u2019t too hard with the right board and RAM.[...]\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;One final reminder: It\u2019s not just cores doing this. People seem to forget that cores between architectures are not necessarily the same. If it were just cores, the FX series would have been defensible \u2013 but the architecture was vastly different. We are still limited by the slowest thread in gaming; it is the architecture and design of those cores that matters. \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy pasting from the buildapc thread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well-written summary from &lt;a href=\"http://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/2875-amd-r5-1600x-1500x-review-fading-i5-argument/page-4\"&gt;GamersNexus&lt;/a&gt; regarding the R5 vs i5 debate:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: i5 Hangs On with Fading Grasp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s no argument that, at the price, Ryzen is the best price competitor for render workloads if rendering on the CPU \u2013 though GPU-accelerated rendering does still serve as an equalizer, for people who use compatible workloads (see: Premiere w/ CUDA on i5-7600K, 6900K, &amp;amp; 1800X). &lt;strong&gt;If CPU rendering is your thing, Ryzen 5 is well ahead of same-priced i5 CPUs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;gaming, AMD ties same-priced Intel i5 CPUs&lt;/strong&gt; in some games \u2013 like Watch Dogs 2 before OC \u2013 and is 7-15% behind &lt;strong&gt;in other games (7-10%, generally&lt;/strong&gt;).

It\u2019s not hard and the gain is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re already &lt;strong&gt;settling for an i5 from an i7&lt;/strong&gt;, it\u2019s &lt;strong&gt;not much of a jump to go for an R5&lt;/strong&gt; and benefit in &lt;strong&gt;better frametimes&lt;/strong&gt; with thread-thrashing games. The i5 is still good, don\u2019t get us wrong, it\u2019s just not compelling enough. It\u2019s not as strong as the i7 is against R7, as the 7700K is still the definitive best in our gaming tests. Going &lt;strong&gt;beyond 8 threads doesn\u2019t do a whole lot&lt;/strong&gt; for your gaming experience, but as we\u2019ve shown numerous times in i5 reviews, &lt;strong&gt;going beyond 4 threads does help in consistent frametimes&lt;/strong&gt;. It\u2019s not required \u2013 you can still have a good experience without 8 threads in most games \u2013 but &lt;strong&gt;that is the direction we\u2019re moving&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;16 threads won\u2019t much matter anytime soon, but 8 will and does already&lt;/strong&gt;. If you buy an R5, overclock it, and buy good memory, it\u2019ll be competitive with Intel. That said, be wary of spending so much on the platform and memory that you\u2019re put into i7+3200MHz territory, because at that point, you\u2019d be way better off with the i7 for gaming. It\u2019s a fine balance, but getting near an i5\u2019s average FPS isn\u2019t too hard with the right board and RAM.[...]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One final reminder: It\u2019s not just cores doing this. People seem to forget that cores between architectures are not necessarily the same. If it were just cores, the FX series would have been defensible \u2013 but the architecture was vastly different. We are still limited by the slowest thread in gaming; it is the architecture and design of those cores that matters. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dg4g8cs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491954893.0, "created_utc": 1491926093.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 61}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlge", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlge", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlge", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlge", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlge", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rlge", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6x9tt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "drunkenAmoeba", "parent_id": "t1_dg616ji", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Sandy Bridge CPUs (especially the i5-2500k) offered an incredible price/performance jump from the previous generation, similar to the Core 2s.

It is starting to be fairly common for AAA games to scale past 4 threads now, for example Overwatch, which sees a pretty big improvement in average (and minimum) fps when moving from an i5 to i7.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the Ryzen chips have more room to &amp;quot;grow&amp;quot;, unlike the current i5&amp;#39;s that are maxed out, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The r5 is more expensive&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both the i5-7600k and R5 1600x have the exact same MSRP of $249. The lower end Ryzen chips are actually cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;performs worse than a current i5&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 1600x is slightly worse than the 7600k in average fps, although better in minimum fps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also you aren&amp;#39;t even considering the rest of the line up, step back down to the i5-7500 vs the R5 1500x (similar price) and there is no reason to pick the i5. It is a locked chip that runs at roughly the same clock speed of the 1500x and lacks hyperthreading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell the locked i5&amp;#39;s are not really worth it anymore. The i3&amp;#39;s are going to be completely dead as the low end Ryzen chips are 4 core 4 thread parts.

The R5 series is more obviously competing with Kaby Lake and the 7700K is still very clearly a good CPU in it&amp;#39;s price range compared to the R7, whereas the 7600K is now a more of a &amp;quot;do you have a lot of single threaded games you like or do you need more cores with similar IPC pre-OC?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, I&amp;#39;m glad to have options and if things keep going the way they&amp;#39;re going, I&amp;#39;ll be picking up the second generation of R7 whatever they end up calling it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dg603py", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492039006.0, "created_utc": 1492010206.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5wxtx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sofaboy90", "parent_id": "t1_dg4ru4g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "i think intel has their new kabylake X and skylake X by then with their new 299x thing. tho itll probably have its price too and you gotta keep in mind intel likes to change their motherboards pretty often whereas amd has said those am4 mobos that you can buy right now will last 4 generations.\n\nryzen r7 is competitive to intels offerings but intel has not responded with price reductions at all, that 6900k still sits on mindfactory.de for 1114\u20ac as it did before ryzen, same with all other intel cpus.\n\nthat makes me think that intel might not be able to have a pricely compeititve product to this b350+1600 deal that gives you so much for so little money.\n\nitll be interesting to see how intel responds and its certain that amd most likely did make intel re-think their future plans.\n\nbut im really unsure why intel isnt countering with lowered prices, in germany the 7700k costs 350\u20ac, the 1600x 280\u20ac.\n\njust a little lower and i might go for the 7700k but those 350\u20ac for me a just a little too uncomfortable to spend for my budget", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i think intel has their new kabylake X and skylake X by then with their new 299x thing. tho itll probably have its price too and you gotta keep in mind intel likes to change their motherboards pretty often whereas amd has said those am4 mobos that you can buy right now will last 4 generations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ryzen r7 is competitive to intels offerings but intel has not responded with price reductions at all, that 6900k still sits on mindfactory.de for 1114\u20ac as it did before ryzen, same with all other intel cpus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;that makes me think that intel might not be able to have a pricely compeititve product to this b350+1600 deal that gives you so much for so little money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;itll be interesting to see how intel responds and its certain that amd most likely did make intel re-think their future plans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but im really unsure why intel isnt countering with lowered prices, in germany the 7700k costs 350\u20ac, the 1600x 280\u20ac.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;just a little lower and i might go for the 7700k but those 350\u20ac for me a just a little too uncomfortable to spend for my budget&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dg5wxtx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492035368.0, "created_utc": 1492006568.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4ru4g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HaroldSax", "parent_id": "t1_dg4ljss", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Probably not, but we'll see.
