Every owner of a restaurant, barber shop, etc needs a license if they want to play TV/radio in their establishment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bureaucracy in Germany is spelled with a capital &amp;#39;B&amp;#39;, figuratively and literally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t a new thing nor is it an attempt to deny someone&amp;#39;s freedom of speech. Getting such a license isn&amp;#39;t that big a deal- there are a few regulations you have to abide by but that&amp;#39;s not the problem. The problem is that these licenses were intended for entities like TV stations and the rules and regulations are outdated and not fit for online services like Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a bunch of bureaucrats trying to apply laws, not the German government going totalitarian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And what makes the german government even think they have a juristiction over twitch ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the streamer is a German citizen who resides in Germany and who has most likely registered his business (yes, PietSmiet is a registered business) with the German authorities under German law and German jurisdiction?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dg44ql4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491938864.0, "created_utc": 1491910064.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg42pf8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jigssaw", "parent_id": "t1_dg405ho", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Government that wants to limit my speech is sure as hell not my friend.
