In all honesty the sequel trailer we were shown many years ago disappointed me as much as this new one does. I absolutely love the original game, it\u2019s one of my favorite single-player FPS experiences from its generation and the deathmatch was really interesting and fun, largely because of all the Escher-like level design, portals, etc\u2026 The original had a lot of unique gameplay conceits, and on top of that interesting characters. I really liked Tommy (the character you play as) and by the end of the game, which for the record is: \"Prey will continue...\" I wanted more. I wanted to know more of Tommy\u2019s story, where he goes next, how he rebuilds his life.\n\nSo this new game, this new Prey? Why hate on something that is so clearly different but using the same name? Well, mostly because this signals that we will never, ever see the rest of Tommy\u2019s story. New IP owners, new developers, new game with the same title as the original game released a decade prior, not even a new number. Plus the original from what I can see is no longer for sale ANYWHERE. The story and character I liked and wanted more of? Wiped from existence at least as far as Bethesda is concerned.\n\nBut to what end? Any cachet the Prey name has is intimately tied into the first game. And let\u2019s face it: we\u2019re talking about a single game from a decade ago that suffered a development cycle not unlike DNF. There\u2019s barely any cachet there at all, what exists is purely from fanboys like me who actually really liked the characters and story, and have been waiting for more than that. There is NO ONE who didn\u2019t play the game but was hoping for a new Prey. They could have named this new game anything, calling it Prey doesn\u2019t help the marketing at all, unless the marketing department was cynically depending on negative press and fans like me complaining/mentioning the game. Nothing really to be gained from naming this game Prey, but on the other hand something is surely lost, the entirety of Tommy\u2019s story is now just 2006 Prey, despite the ending Prey is not continuing, it\u2019s being wiped away so some other shit can be propped up in its place.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(And to be fair, i DID provide a TLDR).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh?

I&amp;#39;ve yet to see one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#39;m pretty incredulous that there&amp;#39;s any point to this exercise based on your comments, but here goes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, I say Prey/Prey 2 mainly to placate people. In all honesty the sequel trailer we were shown many years ago disappointed me as much as this new one does. I absolutely love the original game, it\u2019s one of my favorite single-player FPS experiences from its generation and the deathmatch was really interesting and fun, largely because of all the Escher-like level design, portals, etc\u2026 The original had a lot of unique gameplay conceits, and on top of that interesting characters. I really liked Tommy (the character you play as) and by the end of the game, which for the record is: &amp;quot;Prey will continue...&amp;quot; I wanted more. I wanted to know more of Tommy\u2019s story, where he goes next, how he rebuilds his life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this new game, this new Prey? Why hate on something that is so clearly different but using the same name? Well, mostly because this signals that we will never, ever see the rest of Tommy\u2019s story. New IP owners, new developers, new game with the same title as the original game released a decade prior, not even a new number. Plus the original from what I can see is no longer for sale ANYWHERE. The story and character I liked and wanted more of? Wiped from existence at least as far as Bethesda is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to what end? Any cachet the Prey name has is intimately tied into the first game. And let\u2019s face it: we\u2019re talking about a single game from a decade ago that suffered a development cycle not unlike DNF. There\u2019s barely any cachet there at all, what exists is purely from fanboys like me who actually really liked the characters and story, and have been waiting for more than that. There is NO ONE who didn\u2019t play the game but was hoping for a new Prey. They could have named this new game anything, calling it Prey doesn\u2019t help the marketing at all, unless the marketing department was cynically depending on negative press and fans like me complaining/mentioning the game. Nothing really to be gained from naming this game Prey, but on the other hand something is surely lost, the entirety of Tommy\u2019s story is now just 2006 Prey, despite the ending Prey is not continuing, it\u2019s being wiped away so some other shit can be propped up in its place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dg6uldj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492072598.0, "created_utc": 1492043798.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6icxf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheKnightMadder", "parent_id": "t1_dg6hxca", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh, its definitely over the top.

You would&amp;#39;ve known that if you just waited a few days to wait to see what the consensus was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People shouldn&amp;#39;t be pre-ordering games these days to begin with. If you stop giving the devs your money ahead of time, you won&amp;#39;t get your hopes crushed when a shit PC port makes you regret your purchase. DOOM didn&amp;#39;t have early review copies and that game turned out great. Demos, Betas, early access, reviews before the game is released are all luxuries that we are absolutely not entitled to. We are, however, entitled to great games that we pay money for. Stop pre-ordering and stop supporting publishers with shitty practices like Day 1 DLC, game-breaking micro transactions, and premium pass bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dg6j9pv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492058889.0, "created_utc": 1492030089.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ypj8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg69bx8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PartTimeCrazy", "parent_id": "t3_64ypj8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Doesn't the demo only let you play the first hour?
