My name is Anthony Tote, but most people call me Tony (yes my name is really Tony Tote). I am the leader of a small band of aspiring game developers. We call ourselves Fledgling Studios, and we are quite busy developing our first game, an Unreal 4 powered ARPG tentatively titled Hellrift.\nHellrift is designed to be a third person ARPG in a futuristic version of Earth that has been overrun by a demonic invasion. I often describe the vision of Hellrift to be &amp;quot;a spiritual successor to Hellgate: London, only not a train wreck.&amp;quot; More specifically, we are creating (what we hope will be) an engaging ARPG with tons of quests, loot, skill choices, crafting, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Hellrift, the player will choose one of three character classes, and will embark on a journey to fight back against the evil that has all but exterminated the human race. The demons are building more and more Hellrifts; machines made of flesh and metal that break down the barriers between our world and theirs. As they have built more Hellrifts, the amount of demonic energy present on our world has skyrocketed over the past few years. The Earth is starting to transform. It is being terraformed. It is up to the player to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The three classes will fill the three standard ARPG archetypes (melee, caster, ranged), but each will represent a unique organization, and will have multiple builds that the player may customize to their liking. For instance, the Remnant are a coalition of the remaining military forces of Earth. Should the player choose to play as a Remnant soldier, they will be capable of focusing on building drones to assist them in combat, or grenades and other explosives, or modifications to their weapons to make them more powerful. Each character class will have its own style, loot, weapons, skills, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The demons are designed to be a twisted amalgamation of machinery and flesh, sort of a Doom meets Diablo aesthetic. The monster pictured is the first of many we have plans to create.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our approach to development is multi-faceted. In these early stages, we are prioritizing creating a fun and polished gameplay loop, because in our mind, none of the other stuff matters if you don&amp;#39;t have that. From a larger perspective, we are also examining what game mechanics have worked well for recent RPG&amp;#39;s, such as Path of Exile, Torchlight, Diablo 3, Grim Dawn, etc. We are a small team, so we are carefully balancing the features we cannot live without with the ones that are secondary or can be discarded entirely. For instance, Hellrift is not designed to be an online game. We are planning to have LAN and listen server functionality for co-op, but maintaining the infrastructure for an always-online environment is too costly for our tiny team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Financially, everything has been funded directly out of my pocket thus far. This project is my brain child and essentially what I&amp;#39;ve wanted to pursue my entire life. I hold a Bachelor&amp;#39;s in Game and Simulation Programming, and have been gaming for 20+ years. My wife&amp;#39;s a gamer, my friends are gamers. You get the idea. Most of the team members (myself included) have full-time jobs. We work on this on our nights and weekends until we are able to obtain more funding. Right now, we have a Patreon (a tad hipster, I know), but that is intended just to help us to get our gameplay demo up and running. Our goal is to eventually go to Kickstarter or some other form of crowd-funding in order to obtain the money needed to perform the bulk of our development. This project, and the team, are designed to grow concurrently with increases to our funding.
