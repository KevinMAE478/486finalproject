He turns Temporal Filtering on, sounds like a neat setting, but has no idea what it does.  Plays Watch Dogs 2, it runs great too.  Comes on Reddit and talks about how great it ran.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the rub:  If enough people do that, without knowing what Temporal Filtering does, suddenly Ubisoft saves themselves from &amp;quot;bad port&amp;quot; outrage.  How many PC gamers use Temporal Filtering without knowing what it does?  90%+?  Probably even more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without that setting the game runs significantly worse.  Now imagine it was never added to the game and all of those gamers would lose 30% or more performance.  Suddenly, Watch Dogs 2 runs quite poorly and thousands of people pour onto the internet to complain about how bad of a port the game is.  Hence, cheating.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dge01yp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492487043.0, "created_utc": 1492458243.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdyzd9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "uss_wstar", "parent_id": "t1_dgdxjny", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;When it comes to discussing \"how well\" Watch Dogs 2 runs in the context of other games, it's going to skew results.
