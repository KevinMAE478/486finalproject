Finishing route A means that you've really only seen about half of the game's content, and the story is nowhere near complete. \n\nRoute B is similar to route A, but from 9S's perspective. The middle is mostly the same as route A, just with a different combat style, but the beginning and end are fairly different. This route recontextualizes a lot of stuff you saw in route A, makes the protagonists' relationships more fleshed out, and has some important revelations at the end. \n\nThe entirety of route C is *completely* different from A and B, but I won't say more because of spoilers. After beating route C and getting the third ending, you unlock chapter select, which allows you to quickly see two more endings, D and E, which take about 15-30 minutes each. \n\nThe game really gains a lot from endings C, D, and especially E. They're not just \"bonus\" or joke endings like some of the silly ones you get when you game over under certain conditions; the game and the experience simply isn't complete until you've seen A-E.

Just because tbry were higher level didnt mean they were more difficult than when I started. They dont scale fast enough with you once you start getting chip upgrades. I was level 20 towards the end of my first play thru and the level 30 to 35 enemies were still easy on normal. If i turned it to hard the game was unplayable. Needs to be a happy medium.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dgdseuv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492478473.0, "created_utc": 1492449673.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vr4n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vr4n", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vr4n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdwcj4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JackTheJot", "parent_id": "t1_dgdw73u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Pretty broken.
