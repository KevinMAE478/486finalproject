Ships artists really shouldn&amp;#39;t be writing networking code for the 3.0 release, it would just cause more problems. Second, CIG is spread across 4 studios with each studio specializing in certain aspects of the game, it&amp;#39;d be real hard for a dev in the Austin studio to do significant work on the physics grid because that&amp;#39;s mostly housed in the Frankfurt studio, it just wouldn&amp;#39;t be a good use of that dev or his/her time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watch some of the dev videos and you can really see how much of CIG is actually working on the game compared to how much of CIG is working on the ships. You see the ships cause its great visible progress plus the community goes wild for it while implementing Item 2.0 there just isn&amp;#39;t a lot to show till it&amp;#39;s all done. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dgb8aa4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492321870.0, "created_utc": 1492293070.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb0def", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HeliosNarcissus", "parent_id": "t1_dgaz8w8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think people (myself included) are getting tired of them adding in new assets like $2500 ships and other new things that weren't originally planned.
