It&amp;#39;s a TN display, but I&amp;#39;ve been satisfied with what I got for the price. It&amp;#39;s obvious it&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;budget variant&amp;quot; being smaller and TN vs IPS compared to it&amp;#39;s bigger 27&amp;quot; brother, but I knew that going into it. My main budget point was keeping a G-Sync monitor and new GTX 1070 under $800 at the time and I cam in at under $725.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it absolutely amazing? No. But it&amp;#39;s a good enough screen at the size I wanted, with decent performance. And 1080p means no scaling issues (obviously). I came from a 30&amp;quot; Yamakasi Leonidas behemoth I got from a friend a few years ago (2560x1600), and I don&amp;#39;t really miss the screen real estate that higher resolution got me very often. Most of it was wasted with my usage, and it made some gaming difficult or odd with a 16:10 aspect ratio. I do miss the physical size, but I was willing to give that up to stay within budget and keep G-Sync (absolutely &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; screen tearing with a burning passion). As long as the framerate stays above 60fps I don&amp;#39;t personally care that much, so 120Hz monitors are good enough IMO. Even then, with an adaptive framerate system like G-Sync, a dip below 60fps now and then isn&amp;#39;t really a major issue most of the time and a worthy trade-off for being able to up the graphics a bit higher on some games.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dgae3hb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492267290.0, "created_utc": 1492238490.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgab861", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mr_Rotch", "parent_id": "t1_dgaarda", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was honestly debating on getting the new Asus 1080p 240Hz monitor so I wouldn't have these blurry issues, but I spent *cough* $800 *cough* on my current monitor, and feel like it'd be a waste to go back to that.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was honestly debating on getting the new Asus 1080p 240Hz monitor so I wouldn&amp;#39;t have these blurry issues, but I spent &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; $800 &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; on my current monitor, and feel like it&amp;#39;d be a waste to go back to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dgab861", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492261223.0, "created_utc": 1492232423.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaarda", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "conquer69", "parent_id": "t1_dgaa3sl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Damn that sucks.
