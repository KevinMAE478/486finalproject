Posters have already mentioned the worst offenders, but I am a tinkerer and I thought I would talk about my settings choices I run.\n\n\nIt does depend on the game. Ill use Dragon Age Inquisition &amp; The Division as my examples.\n\nI Have a i5 6600k 16GB Ram &amp; a GTX 970 running 1 to 3, 25\" 2560x1080p 21:9 monitors (i only triple for my racing sims). I cant max out all games so I too look for the best options to maintain 60FPS all the time (unless some areas in a game map are unavoidable due to excessive object detail compared to most other areas).\n\nShadows:\n\nDragon Age Inquisition has the usual low to Ultra options. The Differences are shadow resolution and the amount of contact shadows. So Low has very pixalated shadow effects and almost no contact shadows so it looks pretty bland. On the Ultra end the resolution is max and the amount of contact shadows is huge (a bit too much for some of the maps in DAI) and at Ultra the contact shadows are also shown at greater distances.  (Nice balanced look is medium/high) Ironically set to high, close proximity shadows look like they do when other games, like in GTA V, apply an expensive Nvidia Gameworks effect to shadows called NVPCSS which is a shadow softening efffect which usually is very costly to frames.\n\nThe Division shadows are broken up into a few sections, which is great to see. This means you could possibly run with max shadows (resolution) and have low contact shadows set in order to keep up frame rates. There are a few shadow settings in The Division, most of the heavy hitters are the contact and object casting shadow effects, but as its been seperated you can tinker a lot more, but its mostly contact and object amount+ distance settngs that munch frames, over pure shadow resolution.\n\n\nScreen Space Ambient Occlusion -A lovely shadow depth effect depending on how the developer implemented it.\n\nDragon Age Inquisition uses the standard SSAO, HBAO and the frame killing Gameworks settings HBAO+. I run SSAO on my system because HBAO or + can reduce a scene by 10+ frames, and I cannot bear 40 -50 FPS it makes me feel ill when I see the shuddering/jarring effect of sub 52 fps. If your running medium/high shadows and you have room to add more just stick to SSAO, but its an easy effect to live without, and as its a post process effect and they are still after all these years too costly on GPUs especially lower end cards. \n\nThe Division has the same spectrum of settings, but its HBAO++ game works setting was unque to the title (apparently) and TDV is already a big hitter on FPS. Try settings like this that last/keep low or off, if your trying to find a good balance.\n\n\nPost processing, object/vegetation depth and distances &amp; Gameworks effects in general\n\nDAI has a low to Ultra PPE. Fortunatley in DAI its PPE it limited to motion blur, and depth of field effects which are very easy to live without. Settings it to low does save a good chunk if FPS . The Division has options to alter PPE individually (I wish more games facilited this option) Most of which are awful loking with them set to on/high/max anyways IMO.\n\nTesselation &amp; Gameworks Hair &amp; or fog effects\n\nHigh to Ultra Tesselation settings require a beefy GPU processor, but dpending on how it was implemented games like DAI look great with it set to high (stone walls have greater formation, ground rubble/stones look decent). in DAI Tesselaton links into (unfortunatley) vegetation settings so if you run DAI with high tesselation but very low vegetation settings most of the ground effects arent visable anyway so your high tesselation effect only really comes tino play with buidings or walls which you dont see very often in DAI as the mps can be quite opn and large.\n\nTDV gameworks (there are a few) are massive FPS killers. Volumteric fog looks pretty amazing when you run it on high or ultra but the FPS tanks really really hard. I have to run it on medium which is its lowest setting. TDV breaks down object dsiatnce and detail into two sperate sliders. In the streets high or max it seems to not destry fops too much, but there are areas in TDV were it opns up a lite bit and lots of tress and fences are in view. Adding up all the possible details above, high contact shadows, HBAO or higher, shadow res fog etc et5c and the ganme cripples itself unelss your running GTX980s or higher. \n\nI run TDV on high settngs mostly, and any PC specific or nvidia games works based options to its lowest or off if it allows it (fog, contact shadows, screen space reflections, SSAO/HBAO)\n\nTLDR: Gameworks Hairworks or AMD Tress FX effects as seen in The Wither 3 or the recent TombRaider are so easy to live without, considering how much FPS you lose for it, i personally wil never ever miss not using it. (It looks weird and great at the same time depending on how much your paying attention to peoples/ monsters hair styles) extures can hurt but it dopesnds on your card, GTX970s and above can handle ultra usually due to having 4GB of memory to load the higher textures files, lower end cards wil need to have texture settings set to high but this depnds again, on the game your playing. Over use on GPU ram causes stuttering which is the last thign you want and can cause game crashes\n\n\n\nWorst offenders Gameworks effects, post processing effects like Motion blur or bokeh/depth of fields whn running with other FPS munchers enabled, shadow resoultion and contact shadow distance and amount, screen space reflections if in use or reflection resolution (depending on the game) tesselaton, and vegetaton depth and details.  Tinker with these and generally most games still look good without them on/high/max.\n\n\n", "edited": 1492256954.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a tricky one.

There are a few shadow settings in The Division, most of the heavy hitters are the contact and object casting shadow effects, but as its been seperated you can tinker a lot more, but its mostly contact and object amount+ distance settngs that munch frames, over pure shadow resolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Screen Space Ambient Occlusion -A lovely shadow depth effect depending on how the developer implemented it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dragon Age Inquisition uses the standard SSAO, HBAO and the frame killing Gameworks settings HBAO+. I run SSAO on my system because HBAO or + can reduce a scene by 10+ frames, and I cannot bear 40 -50 FPS it makes me feel ill when I see the shuddering/jarring effect of sub 52 fps. If your running medium/high shadows and you have room to add more just stick to SSAO, but its an easy effect to live without, and as its a post process effect and they are still after all these years too costly on GPUs especially lower end cards. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Division has the same spectrum of settings, but its HBAO++ game works setting was unque to the title (apparently) and TDV is already a big hitter on FPS. Try settings like this that last/keep low or off, if your trying to find a good balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Post processing, object/vegetation depth and distances &amp;amp; Gameworks effects in general&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DAI has a low to Ultra PPE. Fortunatley in DAI its PPE it limited to motion blur, and depth of field effects which are very easy to live without. Settings it to low does save a good chunk if FPS . The Division has options to alter PPE individually (I wish more games facilited this option) Most of which are awful loking with them set to on/high/max anyways IMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tesselation &amp;amp; Gameworks Hair &amp;amp; or fog effects&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;High to Ultra Tesselation settings require a beefy GPU processor, but dpending on how it was implemented games like DAI look great with it set to high (stone walls have greater formation, ground rubble/stones look decent). in DAI Tesselaton links into (unfortunatley) vegetation settings so if you run DAI with high tesselation but very low vegetation settings most of the ground effects arent visable anyway so your high tesselation effect only really comes tino play with buidings or walls which you dont see very often in DAI as the mps can be quite opn and large.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TDV gameworks (there are a few) are massive FPS killers. Volumteric fog looks pretty amazing when you run it on high or ultra but the FPS tanks really really hard. I have to run it on medium which is its lowest setting. TDV breaks down object dsiatnce and detail into two sperate sliders. In the streets high or max it seems to not destry fops too much, but there are areas in TDV were it opns up a lite bit and lots of tress and fences are in view. Adding up all the possible details above, high contact shadows, HBAO or higher, shadow res fog etc et5c and the ganme cripples itself unelss your running GTX980s or higher. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I run TDV on high settngs mostly, and any PC specific or nvidia games works based options to its lowest or off if it allows it (fog, contact shadows, screen space reflections, SSAO/HBAO)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Gameworks Hairworks or AMD Tress FX effects as seen in The Wither 3 or the recent TombRaider are so easy to live without, considering how much FPS you lose for it, i personally wil never ever miss not using it. (It looks weird and great at the same time depending on how much your paying attention to peoples/ monsters hair styles) extures can hurt but it dopesnds on your card, GTX970s and above can handle ultra usually due to having 4GB of memory to load the higher textures files, lower end cards wil need to have texture settings set to high but this depnds again, on the game your playing. Over use on GPU ram causes stuttering which is the last thign you want and can cause game crashes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worst offenders Gameworks effects, post processing effects like Motion blur or bokeh/depth of fields whn running with other FPS munchers enabled, shadow resoultion and contact shadow distance and amount, screen space reflections if in use or reflection resolution (depending on the game) tesselaton, and vegetaton depth and details.  Tinker with these and generally most games still look good without them on/high/max.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "pcgaming", "name": "t1_dgakakj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492285525.0, "created_utc": 1492256725.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hpdc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hpdc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgajrtg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Informalmoose3", "parent_id": "t1_dgaifxy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hahahahah whatever you say.
