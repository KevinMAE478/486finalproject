You should always be making moves that will improve or maintain your own standing or diminish another states standing (as per the rules of a zero sum game is also an improvement for your state)\n\n2nd is the idea of an overwhelming but stagnant military. The US has the most overwhelming military force and budget in the world but in accordance to the first point what good is having a massive military budget if its only used as a deterance? The idea is that if you have a large military it should be put to use to accomplish the first point otherwise its just a waste of time and money. \n\nWe are always involved in some conflict to accomplish point 1. Determining if we put boots on the ground or just support a faction really is dependant on global and local political climate. \n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, its my first :)\n\nAlso for anyone who wants to read more about [Political Realism in International Relations from Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-intl-relations/) click the link.
