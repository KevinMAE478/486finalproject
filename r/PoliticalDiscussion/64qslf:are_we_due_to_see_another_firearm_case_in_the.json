I think it&amp;#39;s important to note that the defendants in &lt;em&gt;Miller&lt;/em&gt; were two bank robbers who were caught moving sawwed off shotguns over state lines- and were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; members of a state or federal militia. The argument was never made that they could never be protected by the 2nd Amendment because they were not in the militia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, you claimed Breyer was somewhat on the fence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His dissent was that there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an individual right to keep and bear arms just like the majority said, except his twist was to apply interest balancing tests with deference to the legislature where- surprise surprise- almost any gun ban or prohibition could survive judicial scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think people can argue whether that constitutes being &amp;quot;on the fence,&amp;quot; but I don&amp;#39;t think he is here. He&amp;#39;s a ends-justify-the-means Judge and he was hoping to save DC&amp;#39;s handgun ban by making an olive branch to the conservative wing. It&amp;#39;s Breyer&amp;#39;s ham-fisted attempt at compromise; I think it&amp;#39;s important to note that Breyer also signed fully onto Stevens dissent. If he &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; was on the fence, he wouldn&amp;#39;t have signed onto it fully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t like the majority&amp;#39;s position, as exemplified in his &lt;em&gt;McDonald&lt;/em&gt; dissent where he questioned the validity of &lt;em&gt;Heller&lt;/em&gt; and used that as a basis to decline to expand the right there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;that the Second Amendment is not unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No disagreement there.

What Courts have relied on in Miller is nothing more than dicta. Miller&amp;#39;s only contention was that the lower court couldn&amp;#39;t invalidate the NFA on Second Amendment grounds because the weapon in question had no military purpose (and the Court was factually &lt;em&gt;incorrect&lt;/em&gt; on this point &lt;em&gt;at the time Miller was decided&lt;/em&gt;). The funny thing is, Miller can easily be read to protect the very types of weapons that Democrats are running around trying ban, while not protecting the weapons that Democrats say they will &amp;quot;never&amp;quot; ban.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "name": "t1_dg506ng", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491977076.0, "created_utc": 1491948276.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qslf", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qslf", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qslf", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qslf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg57tth", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "imrightandyoutknowit", "parent_id": "t1_dg55e8f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PoliticalDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well your disingenuous framing of the debate about the 2nd Amendment aside, your whole spiel isn't helped by the fact that *US v.

Either issue would face strict scrutiny, the highest level of scrutiny a law can face. Strict scrutiny is generally applied to any law that restricts a constitutional right, and means that for the law to stand, it must be proven that the law is a) addressing such a major and pressing issue that the government had no choice but to act and b) tailored as narrowly as possible, so as to infringe on the right as little as possible. The supreme court has never officially ruled that gun restrictions must face strict scrutiny, but lower courts have (I know the 6th circuit did in Tyler v. Hillsdale County Sheriff), the fact that firearm ownership was officially incorporated as a right (McDonald v.
