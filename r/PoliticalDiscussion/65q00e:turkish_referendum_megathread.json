The President becomes both the head of state and head of government, with the power to appoint and sack ministers and VP. The president can issue decrees relating to the executive branch. If legislation conflicts with a Presidential decree, the decree will become invalid and parliamentary law takes precedence.\n\n* The numbers of seats in the Grand Assembly increases from 550 to 600. The term of members is extended from four to five years.\n\n* The Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors is renamed to simply The Board of Judges and Prosecutors, removing the \"Supreme\". The members of the board are reduced from 22 to 13. The Grand Assembly will elect 7 of the judges, while the President will be able to appoint 4 judges directly, and 2 other judges as well, because they are also cabinet members.\n\n* Many other executive powers vested in cabinet members will pass to the President.\n\n* Military courts are abolished, unless they are erected to investigate actions of soldiers under conditions of war.\n\n* The acts of the President are now subject to judicial review.\n\n* The President's ability to declare state of emergency is now subject to parliamentary approval to take effect. The Parliament can extend, remove or shorten it. States of emergency can be extended for up to four months at a time except during war, where no such limitation will be required. Every presidential decree issued during a state of emergency will need the approval of Parliament.

Nearly half of the members of the highest level of the judiciary may now be appointed by the President. Military courts are effectively abolished. All of these changes place more power in Erdogan's hands. On the other hand, they may also stabilize the country by reducing the likelihood of military coup, and could help break parliamentary deadlock if a coalition can't be formed - these are points on the Yes campaign's side. The No campaign argues that these powers are much too far-reaching and that the President could ease his way into dictatorship once he declares a state of emergency. Furthermore, they posit that even though the Judiciary has always been seen as supreme and untouchable in upholding the law, the amendments weaken them greatly - even notice how \"Supreme\" is removed from their name, an obvious symbolic move. I've also heard conflicting things about whether the President is allowed to dissolve parliament under these amendments.\n\nAnother very important point to note, and this is something I've heard but can't confirm, but if this referendum's passage means term counts will restart, since it's a new electoral system, then that means Erdogan could theoretically serve as President until 2029.

Furthermore, they posit that even though the Judiciary has always been seen as supreme and untouchable in upholding the law, the amendments weaken them greatly - even notice how &amp;quot;Supreme&amp;quot; is removed from their name, an obvious symbolic move. I&amp;#39;ve also heard conflicting things about whether the President is allowed to dissolve parliament under these amendments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another very important point to note, and this is something I&amp;#39;ve heard but can&amp;#39;t confirm, but if this referendum&amp;#39;s passage means term counts will restart, since it&amp;#39;s a new electoral system, then that means Erdogan could theoretically serve as President until 2029. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "name": "t1_dgcb5g1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492392965.0, "created_utc": 1492364165.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 260}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q00e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q00e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q00e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q00e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q00e", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd0l81", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dgcrncc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PoliticalDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "name": "t1_dgd0l81", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492426982.0, "created_utc": 1492398182.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcrncc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dgcdkf5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PoliticalDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "name": "t1_dgcrncc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492414854.0, "created_utc": 1492386054.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcdkf5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 34, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dgcbnex", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PoliticalDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "name": "t1_dgcdkf5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492396163.0, "created_utc": 1492367363.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 34}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q00e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q00e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q00e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q00e", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65q00e", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdkm2m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LongLiveGolanGlobus", "parent_id": "t1_dgdk3ms", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PoliticalDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Tons of people will be fleeing Turkey for other reasons.
