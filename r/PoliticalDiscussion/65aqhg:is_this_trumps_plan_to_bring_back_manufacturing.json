The term *unskilled labor* refers to the level of skill required to do the job, not the cumulative skills possessed by the worker. As such, a retiree who went into a fast food job would still be doing unskilled labor, regardless of any skillset they may possess.\n\nI'd also like to clarify that not all jobs that are perceived as being \"blue collar\" are low skill labor. Electricians and plumbers are generally considered 'blue collar' jobs because they deal largely with manual labor. However, those two jobs are anything but low-skill and require a great deal of training and specialization. The same could be said for decent carpentry work as well. These types of specialized labor are generally known as 'trades'. Unfortunately, we actually have a shortage of these jobs and need people willing to go into them to replace those retiring.\n\nHowever, there are certain skills that may be useful but can quickly become obsolete. A mine worker may have expert knowledge of drilling equipment, but if that's all he knows, then when he is replaced by a machine or there is no longer any need for his expertise, he is shit out of luck.\n\nWhat we should be doing is investing in renewable energy sources, and providing the training necessary to give these displaced workers gainful employment in the industry.

The term &lt;em&gt;unskilled labor&lt;/em&gt; refers to the level of skill required to do the job, not the cumulative skills possessed by the worker. As such, a retiree who went into a fast food job would still be doing unskilled labor, regardless of any skillset they may possess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also like to clarify that not all jobs that are perceived as being &amp;quot;blue collar&amp;quot; are low skill labor. Electricians and plumbers are generally considered &amp;#39;blue collar&amp;#39; jobs because they deal largely with manual labor. However, those two jobs are anything but low-skill and require a great deal of training and specialization. The same could be said for decent carpentry work as well.
