What's different is that Democrats came out in large numbers. If you compare this special election to the last special election for a deep red Republican, Ohio's 8th district (when Boehner retired) you see sonewhat similar numbers. That special election had 26,000 votes cast, 20,000 of which we're Republican. Compared to 2016's regular election the republican candidate gathered over 200,000 votes in a forty point win. The midterm went similarly, with 125,000 Republican votes in another 40 point win. I bring this specific election up because this seat when just as red for Trump.\n\nGetting into this special election, there were 63,000 republican votes and 55,000 Democrat votes. 2016's election was 167,000 to 81,000. 2014's midterm was 134,000 to 70,000.
