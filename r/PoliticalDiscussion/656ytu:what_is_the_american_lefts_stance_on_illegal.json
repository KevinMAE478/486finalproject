You&amp;#39;re not gonna find a unified front on that end I think. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am personally of the opinion that statements like &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m against illegal immigration&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m for legal immigration&amp;quot; are somewhat akin to political copouts because they do &amp;#39;t address the questions &amp;quot;how much immigration do we want, how hard should it be to immigrate, and what kind of immigrants do we want?&amp;quot; Answers to those questions will vary widely among left-leaning folks. If someone&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; political opinion on the issue is that they don&amp;#39;t like it when people illegally immigrate for example, then rationally they shouldn&amp;#39;t have any problem with open borders where immigration is extremely easy (as long as you have no criminal convictions). But, that likely won&amp;#39;t be the case, because the questions I raised are the more fundamental stakes at hand. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "name": "t1_dg8x5sn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492186435.0, "created_utc": 1492157635.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656ytu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656ytu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgajza9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "team_satan", "parent_id": "t1_dg8vvd7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PoliticalDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;This is just the outside looking in though.\n\nI don't think that's even looking in though, that sounds like you're just looking at what others on the right are telling you the leftist position is.

Somehow being illegal grants him a special sanctuary status from being punished for other non-immigration crimes.  &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What about the (fucking) family?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  Why should we care?  If a US citizen broke a law, would we allow &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; as an excuse to exempt him from the law? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually support building a wall for the following rationale:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do you remember that &lt;a href=\"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/guide-children-arriving-border-laws-policies-and-responses\"&gt;the child migrant crisis&lt;/a&gt; at around 2013 and 2014? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After Obama announced &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals\"&gt;DACA&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied children (mostly from Central America) illegally flooded across the southern borders into the country.  Their parents (mistakenly) believed that the children would benefit from the DACA &amp;quot;amnesty&amp;quot; and that, if the children could successfully enter the US, then the children would be able to become US citizens and then sponsor the parents into America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you know what could have deterred and stopped most of those children?  &lt;em&gt;A big, beautiful wall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "PoliticalDiscussion", "name": "t1_dgcw6o6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492420912.0, "created_utc": 1492392112.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
