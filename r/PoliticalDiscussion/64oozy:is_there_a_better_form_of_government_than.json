One might argue the years of peace may be more due to economic interlinking, the theory that leaders won't go to war if doing so will destroy your successful economy. And indeed, historically, many wars have been fought to increase economy/secure resources (see WW2, Invasion of Kuwait). If one had those resources (ex. free-trade so it is completely free), there is no reason for a country to go to war over that resource, unles there is reason to believe the leaders will withold access (see Panama War).", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is people are not obliged to vote in democracies. So what happens is a cyclical cycle. Those that got what they want tend to not come out or care as much the next round, and so the opposing parties gain prominence. When this occurs, you lack stability in representation and therefore, major policy shifts that change ever election. Just look at the last 10 years. 10 years ago, the US had it with the GOP system of zero financial regulations and the Iraq war, so the Democrats voted in Obama. This election Democrats largely got what they wanted (end to Iraq, a somewhat financial recovery) so the GOP voted in Trump. And there is no question that there are changes in policy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the real world where you have multiple countries that interact with each other, the most important thing IS stability. Then can you rationally predict what others will do and plan accordingly. If one year you love China and host Xi Jinping and the next year, you hate China, want to impose a trade war and potentially go to war against them, that becomse extremely hard to plan future decisions, so the most rational decision is to build up one&amp;#39;s military in case the latter viewpoint gains power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The argument that there&amp;#39;s been years of peace due to democracy makes sense however. It supposes that people will not vote for people who would be war mongerers because people don&amp;#39;t want to be sent to war. However, the ruling party is not only beholden to citizens, but also to corporations who finance their elections, so this puts a wrinkle in that goal.
