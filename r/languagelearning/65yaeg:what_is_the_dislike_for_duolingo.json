Learning the language to read and write it? or to interact with others in the language face to face, to me that&amp;#39;s the big thing that Duolingo lacks.  I&amp;#39;m not hating on it, I&amp;#39;m just saying be sure to fill in the gaps in your learning to make it more solid.   When you&amp;#39;re face to face with someone speaking you won&amp;#39;t have the visual prompt of how the word is spelled to ensure you recognize it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a waste of time, you just might consider adding another half hour a day for other methods to push your learning forward faster and in different circumstances than Duolingo alone presents to you. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "name": "t1_dgeao1m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492499827.0, "created_utc": 1492471027.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeab2l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "veniceinperil", "parent_id": "t1_dgea9sa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/languagelearning", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm worried that I'm wasting my time. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m worried that I&amp;#39;m wasting my time. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "name": "t1_dgeab2l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492499358.0, "created_utc": 1492470558.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgea9sa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LetsPlayThisBro", "parent_id": "t3_65yaeg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/languagelearning", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think it's a tool in ones arsenal, it shouldn't be your only tool.
