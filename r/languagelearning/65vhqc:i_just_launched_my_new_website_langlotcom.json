(to be honest, I don&amp;#39;t even know if I have a &amp;quot;vocabulary&amp;quot; built at Duolingo, so probably I am missing something or there is some explanation missing, perhaps). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, I don&amp;#39;t really know what a Cloze is. I clicked anyway, but I am a beginner, and most of the time I was lost. Am I supposed to learn some vocabulary before selecting &amp;quot;Cloze&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried the video, but it crashed when I cliked over a word. I then tried the list of 100 words, but to be honest, it looks a bit intimidating, not to mention the 1000 most popular words! However, I loved how you put the words in context on the exercises. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, I love the concept, and I hope you take my feedback as an encouragement to keep developing, as I really love learning this way and would love to see Langlot more developed!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "name": "t1_dgetsrc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492527707.0, "created_utc": 1492498907.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vhqc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeuhfk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BeautyAndGlamour", "parent_id": "t3_65vhqc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/languagelearning", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can someone list all the languages?
