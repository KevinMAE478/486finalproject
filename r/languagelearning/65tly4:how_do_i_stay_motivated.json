The problem, for you, is that you can't simply decide that from now on you will have discipline. \n\nIt is a combination of values, expectations, strategies, mental models, and even biological factors, and developing it is a long term project itself.\n\nIn the while I suggest a much simpler method, based on motivation. Since motivation comes and goes, the trick is to be finished before it goes. How do you do that? By restricting your focus to a laser point and put all your energies on that point as long as motivation is there. \n\nFor example, you can't learn a language in a few weeks, but you can reach the point - in a few weeks - where you are able to read simple books, or the news. Just study an essential grammar focused on reading/translating (if you tell me what language you are learning I may be able to suggest you a book for that), learn 50-100 words a day with Anki, and try to decode a text in your target language using readlang or a kindle. Sure, this means several hours a day, but after all it will only lasts a few weeks, and you better exploit that motivation while it is there.\n\nWhat will happen when the motivation is gone? For one, you have already reached a practical, useful goal (reading simple text). You may simply make it a small, enjoyable habit to read a few pages of something everyday, and your reading skills will take care of themselves. Next time your motivation comes back, instead of starting everything from zero like you have probably done so far, you can start from a good level, and choose another few-weeks goal.\n\nThis is the worst case scenario, but I have discovered that if you reach quick goals this way, every goal you reach will actually generate new motivation to reach a higher goal. There is a good chance that after learning to read children books you will itch to try your hand at more complex books, and after that you will itch to try understanding tv shows, and then you will want to try chatting with someone, etc. And the great thing is that every one of these goals can be reached in a very short time, using the old one as a basis.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=\"/u/jackelpackel\"&gt;/u/jackelpackel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/u/BestLucarioFan\"&gt;/u/BestLucarioFan&lt;/a&gt; told you, in order to reach long term goals you need discipline.
