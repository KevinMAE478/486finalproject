He says studying a language by spending hours on the nuances of its grammar, studying the specific pronunciation of certain words, and even rote memorizing vocabulary is inefficient and ineffective. He believes you need to &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; a language to learn it best. This means a lot of listening and speaking. He thinks you should go out and speak a language, regardless of your skill level, as it attaches feelings and emotion to the language (and obviously makes you a more comfortable speaker in the process). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I do support just about everything he said, as someone who has made a lot of progress from vocab memorization (via Anki), grammar study, and frequent reading, I feel like he is being just a little unrealistic.

I now opt to try and learn more organically, and look up things I don&amp;#39;t understand as they come up. I&amp;#39;m finding that having a more personalized and practical approach to learning has helped me remember much more than I did in school, however studying the language in school has given me a good foundation in understanding the structure of the language and it makes learning now much more natural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, one should study basic sentence structure, grammar, and elementary vocabulary (I&amp;#39;d say about a year or two in school, maybe less if you study on your own), and then try expanding your skills by actually using the language and letting the understanding come organically by need instead of memorizing words.

Your conversation won&amp;#39;t last very long anyway. I personally prefer to wait until I&amp;#39;ve learned a few common phrases to keep the conversation going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve dedicated no time whatsoever to grammar study and ended up implicitly learning more about Polish grammar in a matter of months than the French and Spanish grammar that I was explicitly taught over 13 years. The reason my English grammar is as good as it is (despite a lack of knowledge of how it works or what the rules are) is the fact that I have spent more than 20 years &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t do rote memorisation of vocabulary with Anki. I use the SRS to test my understanding of full sentences. It&amp;#39;s proven extremely effective for me over the past 18 months, but now I&amp;#39;m starting to look into other methods to boost my skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "name": "t1_dg7u9tm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492131286.0, "created_utc": 1492102486.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
