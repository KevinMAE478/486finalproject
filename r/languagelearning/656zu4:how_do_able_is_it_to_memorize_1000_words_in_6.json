I think it&amp;#39;s the perfect choice for a motivated student that doesn&amp;#39;t want to stagnate and lose motivation, but at the same time has other duties in life and can&amp;#39;t devote half his day to anki reviews. 100w/d or 200w/d can be good as an experiment or when you have a lot of time and a burning desire to become proficient in the language in record time, but the main problem is the trail of reviews it will create, that will drag for a long time after you have finished studying new cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In what way do you learn conjugation / grammar?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the first month, I worked through &amp;quot;German for reading&amp;quot;, a very good book that aims at teaching you only the grammar point that are essential to understand written text, as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a while, I started using a more balanced grammar (die gelbe Aktuell), and every time I studied a point I also added it as a card to a grammar deck in Anki. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I think the next step would just be to keep reading in order to discover new expressions and improve my feel for the correct usage. I&amp;#39;m also thinking of buying a reference grammar (Duden - vol.4) in physical form and either consult it whenever I&amp;#39;m particularly curious about some point, or simply make it my bathroom book and read it at a leisure pace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m attempting the same plan for Russian right now (first month: &amp;quot;Reading and translating contemporary Russian&amp;quot;, a super compressed grammar outline focused on reading), but I still don&amp;#39;t know how I will follow it. Getting to actually reading Russian seems to have a much steeper curve than German.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "languagelearning", "name": "t1_dg8yg0u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492190603.0, "created_utc": 1492161803.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8xx28", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "art_is_love", "parent_id": "t1_dg8urli", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/languagelearning", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks a lot, your reply keeps me motivated!
