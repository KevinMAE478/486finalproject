I&amp;#39;m not sure how I want to describe it but it&amp;#39;s very easy for me to use duolingo for two days and then abandon the program and while it can be good for vocabulary, I need help with grammar and that I feel isn&amp;#39;t taught well enough for me to support it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So anyone wanna help recommend me programs or help me out? :D thank you!! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello!
