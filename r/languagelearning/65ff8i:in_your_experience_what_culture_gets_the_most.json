As someone who is fluent in Korean, I am always very pleasantly surprised when people attempt to learn it and are interested in the culture. Because aside from Korean bbq, K-pop, and business giants like hyundai, LG, and Samsung,  nobody knows or cares much about Korean culture. It&amp;#39;s kind of sucks when an entire history or culture is reduced to something so mainstream. So when people are genuinely interested in our culture and language, trust me, we get wayyy excited. It&amp;#39;s also not as common as learning a western language. Everyone wants to learn those!
