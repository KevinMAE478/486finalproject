I did learn quite a bit, but honestly I wasn't far enough along to really learn new things comfortably just from context. My coverage was too low, probably closer to 95% than 98%, that missing few % makes a big difference. With German, even though I'm maybe 99.x% known, there's still a lot of words I wouldn't be able to get just from context. \"I went to the store to buy a goober\". Doesn't really tell you much about what a goober is, some sentences provide far less clues even than that. You're genuinely only going to recognize the real meaning of a word from context (even if you master that skill) in a relatively small number of instances, so you'll need to encounter a word more often before it starts to take on some shape and color. \n\nSo... for what it's worth, I think you probably could pick up a lot with what you're doing. You'd probably pick up more with a RL type approach (have english in the background on audio book) or reading in a dual-language book so you can glance across the page when you need a quick bit of help. Personally I like using readlang or a kindle... if looking something up only takes two or three seconds, then it's no big deal, I just take a quick peak at what I need to know, and move on. If you try going just with the gist, without looking anything up at all, you'll probably have to cover 2 or 3 (or more) times as many pages for the same amount of progress. I think you'll get it all eventually though... I read a fuck ton when I was a little kid (JRR Tolkien, Dune, Battlefield Earth, Earth Abides, Exiles Trilogy, etc) and I promise there's a fuck ton of words I didn't know back then. I learned them though, and I didn't use a dictionary to figure out what they meant... I just picked it up as I went. \n\nSo which should you pick? You should pick what works for you. With my method (looking up everything as quickly as possible, take no notes, and move along) it seems to be around 10,000 pages to hit a relative degree of comfort in reading recreationally without help from a dictionary. If you made an anki card for every unknown word, it might only take 1,000. If you didn't look anything up at all, it might take 30,000. Either way you're talking about hundreds of hours... so you should pick what appeals to you, and what you'll actually spend the time on, you know? All roads lead to Rome, you just have to walk far enough to get there. \n\nI just started reading the lightning thief to my kid, haha. It's a fun book. Enjoy, however you choose to read it.
