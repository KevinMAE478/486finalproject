In most Slavic languages, 2-4 triggers Genitive singular&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suffix -\u0161tina/-\u010dtina which means &amp;quot;language of (X nation)&amp;quot;. Czech is &lt;em&gt;\u010de\u0161tina&lt;/em&gt;, English language is &lt;em&gt;angli\u010dtina&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past tense is formed with the auxiliary verb &lt;em&gt;b\u00fdt&lt;/em&gt; (to be) with the past tense form of the verb (infinitive minus /t/ plus /l/ -- jet -&amp;gt; jel) EXCEPT in the 3rd person singular, where you don&amp;#39;t need the auxiliary. So it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;j\u00e1 jsem zp\u00edval&lt;/em&gt; (I was singing(Masc)), but &lt;em&gt;on zp\u00edval&lt;/em&gt; (He was singing(Masc)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Polish, the object after &lt;em&gt;b\u00fdt&lt;/em&gt; (to be) takes the nominative, not the instrumental. (Then again, I think that&amp;#39;s Polish being weird...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vocative is not some archaic case, it&amp;#39;s used all the time and is alive and well. Don&amp;#39;t call to her with &lt;em&gt;Jarmila&lt;/em&gt;, say &lt;em&gt;Jarmilo!&lt;/em&gt; Don&amp;#39;t address him with &lt;em&gt;Adam&lt;/em&gt;, say &lt;em&gt;Adame!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word for &amp;quot;music&amp;quot; is &lt;em&gt;hudba&lt;/em&gt; which is just funky and I love that word&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINALLY the funky \u0159 sound. You basically close your teeth, show them, and put the blade (not tip) of your tongue on your alveolar ridge and then trill it there. It&amp;#39;s such a fun sound to make once you get the hang of it, but I might have bit my tongue once or twice trying to make it mid-sentence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I totally misread the title, I thought they meant of the language &lt;em&gt;you&amp;#39;re learning&lt;/em&gt;.
