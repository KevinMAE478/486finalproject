David Wells the CFO answers the question by saying to not focus on quarter by quarter but focus on a yearly basis. What I take from this is that they seem to go for yearly goals, like a 7% operating income, which causes the quarters to vary greatly; 9.7% operating income Q1 and 4.4% in quarter two. It could also explain the general volatility in net additions, and shows that they have a yearly goal to reach rather than steady quarterly growth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heres the excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Q - Doug Mitchelson&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much. Actually, first question for you, David, and then one for Reed. David, could you just talk a little bit about the net add results in the quarter versus expectations, and any dynamics underline the second quarter guidance that you want investors to know about?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;David Wells&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I think what\u2019s written in the letter and what I\u2019ll reiterate is that, we\u2019re not spending too much time understanding any particular quarter. We were with under 100,000 in the U.S. under a couple of 100,000 in the international versus our expectation. We had a particularly back-weighted first quarter, which were - we don\u2019t usually have, but that explains some of the sort of net adds guidance versus actuals as well, and we have a pretty strong guide for Q1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I think looking at our Q4, which is one of our strongest quarters ever and a pretty strong Q2 guide, we sort of look across that like we put in the letter and say, we\u2019re still on a great growth path, and our content is working. And we\u2019re pleased with the international growth and we\u2019ve got a lot of growth left in the U.S. as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, we see Hastings avoiding to say certain metrics such as viewing hours per day. I don&amp;#39;t like seeing this from Hastings, because view hours per day is an important metric to the investor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Doug Mitchelson&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The international arena is a pretty rich topic, but I want to move back to the U.S. But first, Reed, you mentioned consumption. I think investors would love to have an update on consumption both in the U.S. and overseas. What is the hours per day on average? Is it still growing for both cohorts year-to-year? Anything you\u2019re willing to share at this point in time?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reed Hastings&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, viewing is very large and growing, but nowhere near as big as YouTube. So we definitely got YouTube envy and we\u2019ve got a lot a room to go. And some of the new shows like Ted was talking about, our movie out of Korea [indiscernible] has great global potential. So, we\u2019re finding great talent around the world and that\u2019s what drives up the viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good point from the interview which is what I was worried about is that eventually memberships are going to be harder to come as they grow. Hastings mentions it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Reed Hastings&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;U.S. market is continuing to grow very nicely. I don\u2019t see any fixed wall. I mean of course, every incremental 10 million is a little harder than the last 10 million, but our content keeps getting better, so those forces offset each other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;David Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, Mentions the Disney relationship. It looks strong. Good to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So it\u2019s been a great relationship and continues to be a great relationship with Disney as a company producing our Marvel series as well as being their Pay 1 partner and hundred - several hundred hours of their catalog all the time. So it continues to be a great partnership and they\u2019re great supplier of content that people love so we\u2019ll see.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hastings says the recent departure of several officers isn&amp;#39;t a worry to investors, nice to hear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Doug Mitchelson&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so no particular signal that investors should take from this. It just happened to line up this way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reed Hastings&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks like total aggregate viewing isn&amp;#39;t in their metrics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Reed Hastings&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s really not the total aggregate viewing as opposed to the median viewing by country is not something internally that\u2019s in our metrics pack.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The content Netflix produces has a goal of being high quality, which gives them a competitive edge. I agree with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, we\u2019re already delivering that and also growing the content. So I think, sure I\u2019d love to have shows less expensive, but honestly we\u2019re more competing with the quality of the show and trying to push and improve the cinematic quality of that show, which is driving - has more of an influence on the cost of that than the individual competition within the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, it looks like 100m total subscribers is going to be reached this weekend which I am looking forward to see. I liked the replies from Sarandos and his overall positive attitude. Hastings didn&amp;#39;t have the best replies, because they weren&amp;#39;t very specific. Q1 we saw some great growth in operating margin, but Q2 overall guidance is lower and you should check that out in the video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think about the interview?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nxpost from /r/investing\n\n[This is the orginial video on Netflix Q1 Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qEaCqQl94Y)\n\n[Here is the **new** Q1 followup &amp; Q2 analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa1WZ3T1W7E&amp;t=1s)\n\nCheck those out because I reference them here. \n\n[Into the Q1 interview that was posted to Netflix's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2jaDMko9JQ)\n\nFirst, the question is on net adds expectation for the quarter.
