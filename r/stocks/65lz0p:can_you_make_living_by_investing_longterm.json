So, do the math:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;account for inflation, let&amp;#39;s say 3%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;account for taxes, it sucks, I know, let&amp;#39;s say 30% on average&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;if you have $ 1,000,000 accumulated to invest&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;you can have a return on $70,000 / year before tax&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;after tax you have $49,000&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;of that 3% or 30,000 needs to be put back into capital to offset inflation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;you got a whopping $19K after tax to enjoy &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; you have accumulated $1,000,000 in savings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I put some numbers there, everyone&amp;#39;s opinion of numbers will be different; I also put some logic and calculations where everyone else logic and calculation will be different as well.  I put this together &amp;quot;off the cuff&amp;quot;; but take the overall general principle of:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;capital needed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;expected return that is reliable and &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;account for taxes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;account for inflation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and you&amp;#39;ll have a blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get discouraged, knowledge about investing (and personal finances) are great tools in everyone&amp;#39;s life. And, IMO, it&amp;#39;s fun too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "stocks", "name": "t1_dgbbk2x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492326585.0, "created_utc": 1492297785.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 66}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lz0p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lz0p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lz0p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lz0p", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbeuyn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cyrilix", "parent_id": "t1_dgbdbsi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/stocks", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's not everyday where you get a chance!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not everyday where you get a chance!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "stocks", "name": "t1_dgbeuyn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492331261.0, "created_utc": 1492302461.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbdbsi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "obvs_an_engineer", "parent_id": "t1_dgbc0k4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/stocks", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You just wanted to type boobpix didn't you...", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You just wanted to type boobpix didn&amp;#39;t you...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "stocks", "name": "t1_dgbdbsi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492329096.0, "created_utc": 1492300296.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbc0k4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cyrilix", "parent_id": "t1_dgbbeut", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/stocks", "controversiality": 0, "body": "PM ME BOOBPIX has a better reply.

And, IMO, it's fun too.\". So please keep learning but below I am speaking directly about trying to make a living out of trading for a living. I have worked in the retail investments industry and have seen countless people try and fail at this.\n\n1) Only 1%'ers start with enough money to make a living investing. You need 7 digits, minimum. And even if you have 7 digits to start, you could turn 7 digits into 6 before you learn all your lessons or there is a bad downturn in the market.\n\nPM_ME_BOOBPIX posted a pretty realistic scenario (agree with conservative)....and it doesn't even sound that fantastic. 19 k after tax is not even enough to raise a family of 4.\n\nYou might be able to do that 4 years in a row....and then you might have a year where you are down 60 K. That changes the game. Not only do you not have income you have to spend to live.\n\nThe 1%'ers who are successful at it start with many millions.....and at that point even if they have a down year, it's no biggie.\n\n2) Coming back from losses is harder than making money and investment portfolios often turn into a downward spiral when people try to live off a million.\n\nThe math goes like this. You buy a stock you think is good but for some reason it drops by 50%. How much do you have to return to go back to where it was? 50%? No. 100%.\n\n100k to 50k (50%).....50k to 100k (100% growth). The math in investing is cruel and you fight for a few percentage but the losses come hard and swift and are incredibly hard to come back from.\n\nI have worked in the industry and seen a lot of people crater million dollar accounts trying to live off them.\n\n3) Investing is about learning.\n\nNo one comes out of the gate being good (with the exception of a few prodigies). You have to learn the game over a decade or more (they say it takes 10k hours to master something and investing is no different imo) and you have to develop your own style and risk tolerance (which also changes over time).\n\nYou can't get good on practice accounts, the same way you can't get good at free poker. It has to be the real thing. It's very easy to structure asset distribution and buy and sell a million bucks on a practice account with no emotion.....no so easy with the money you have to live on.\n\n4) It might not make you happy.\n\nSpending your day in your pajamas in front of a trading screen sounds great in theory but it can also lead you to being overweight and lonely at thirty something with no social life and no status.\n\nDepending on your trading style, it might not even really be a full time job.

I would say it's more common than not.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I get started I agree with PM_ME_BOOBPIX when he says&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t get discouraged, knowledge about investing (and personal finances) are great tools in everyone&amp;#39;s life. And, IMO, it&amp;#39;s fun too.&amp;quot;. So please keep learning but below I am speaking directly about trying to make a living out of trading for a living. I have worked in the retail investments industry and have seen countless people try and fail at this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Only 1%&amp;#39;ers start with enough money to make a living investing. You need 7 digits, minimum. And even if you have 7 digits to start, you could turn 7 digits into 6 before you learn all your lessons or there is a bad downturn in the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PM_ME_BOOBPIX posted a pretty realistic scenario (agree with conservative)....and it doesn&amp;#39;t even sound that fantastic. 19 k after tax is not even enough to raise a family of 4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might be able to do that 4 years in a row....and then you might have a year where you are down 60 K. That changes the game. Not only do you not have income you have to spend to live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 1%&amp;#39;ers who are successful at it start with many millions.....and at that point even if they have a down year, it&amp;#39;s no biggie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Coming back from losses is harder than making money and investment portfolios often turn into a downward spiral when people try to live off a million.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The math goes like this. You buy a stock you think is good but for some reason it drops by 50%. How much do you have to return to go back to where it was? 50%? No. 100%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;100k to 50k (50%).....50k to 100k (100% growth). The math in investing is cruel and you fight for a few percentage but the losses come hard and swift and are incredibly hard to come back from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have worked in the industry and seen a lot of people crater million dollar accounts trying to live off them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Investing is about learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one comes out of the gate being good (with the exception of a few prodigies). You have to learn the game over a decade or more (they say it takes 10k hours to master something and investing is no different imo) and you have to develop your own style and risk tolerance (which also changes over time).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t get good on practice accounts, the same way you can&amp;#39;t get good at free poker. It has to be the real thing. It&amp;#39;s very easy to structure asset distribution and buy and sell a million bucks on a practice account with no emotion.....no so easy with the money you have to live on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) It might not make you happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spending your day in your pajamas in front of a trading screen sounds great in theory but it can also lead you to being overweight and lonely at thirty something with no social life and no status.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on your trading style, it might not even really be a full time job. What if your style is to swing trade and make 20 rock solid trades a year? Yes you will have a lot reading and analysis but it&amp;#39;s not a full time job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you will definitely become borderline suicidal if you fail at it after putting everything you have (energy and money) into it.
