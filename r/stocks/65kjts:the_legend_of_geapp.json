So, I&amp;#39;m a senior, and in my freshman year I joined my school&amp;#39;s Investment Club. The main thing in the club was the stock market game on Marketwatch.com (#notsponsored) One day, while I was doing my day trading, in the hot stocks bar at the bottom of the page, I saw a stock whose symbol was &amp;quot;GEAPP&amp;quot; and it was up 1,000%. I decided to watch the stock on the site, and when I checked it later that week, I found that it had fallen from $100,000 to $1,000, a 99% drop. I left it in my watchlist to see what would happen, and one month later it repeated itself, jumping 1,000% one day and dropping 99% the next. I decided to take advantage of this and, on the day it went up, I put it in my phone&amp;#39;s calendar for a month later. I got my alert from the calendar a month later, put all of my money into GEAPP, and, sure enough, it went up to $100,000. In one day I went from just over $100,000 to over $1,000,000 (I didn&amp;#39;t know about shorting at the time so I didn&amp;#39;t short it, but imagine if I had!) I ended up doing this a few more times (not with all of my money, unfortunately; market caps) and I ended up getting pretty rich off of it (I came in third since 2 other people stole the move from me). I tried to do some research on the stock but all I could find was it was called &amp;quot;General Electric Appliances&amp;quot;, it was traded on the OTC Markets, and a second stock on the European markets under the symbol &amp;quot;GEA&amp;quot;.
