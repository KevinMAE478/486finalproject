The only way to test for it if the animal is not yet showing symptoms is via brain dissection, which will likely occur for any wild / undocumented animal and possibly for owned\u200b pets where there isn't a certainty.\n\nIt's all based on the circumstances.  My friend's cat and I would play whenever I visited her.  He was extremely excitable and loved playing with me.  One time I'd played with him for like half an hour right before leaving, him going crazy at this snake toy on a stick; biting and kicking it like mad as I teased it around him.\n\nWhen I went to leave I abruptly had to stop playing with him.  So I did, got my jacket, and gave him a hug.  He was so worked up still that he bit me, putting a top tooth into one side of my wrist and pulling the skin taunt so much that he was able to get a bottom tooth in 180\u00b0 around on the other side of my wrist; left to right of the wrist, widthwise a few inches pulled together in a single spot from his bite.  This hurt like hell and bled profusely, like something out of a horror film, spurting blood in a stream with each heartbeat.\n\nWe did our best to clean and I blamed myself, as I knew I'd worked him up like crazy and he never gets enough play. She'd point out that that cat loved the hell out of me especially of all her friends.  He reminded me of a 20 yr old cat I'd had since a kid who had died a year or so earlier.\n\nAnyways, despite our best efforts, it got infected.  As you are well aware but I'll point out for anyone else, cat's mouths are a bacterial haven and bite/puncture wounds have a high infection chance.  Well, he did a number on my arm and punctured both sides deep, pushing that bacteria way beyond the reach of soap/water/topical antibiotics.\n\nTwo days later my whole arm up to the elbow looked like a giant birthmark, streaking red further up the arm towards the bicep.  It was incredibly weak and painful.  The night before it wasn't so bad, but it was clear that morning that I needed antibiotics.  I went to Urgent Care; local University offshoot from their main hospital school on the other side of the state.  It's not an Emergency Room; It's more for seeking immediate care but not for something you'd place under needing to waste ER time/resources/expenses.\n\nThing is, I'd heard about something to do with the course of action for animal bites, and I researched online on my state CDC .gov site about it.  If they did not know if the animal was rabid and did not know if it had shots (also other factors like if it is an indoor or outdoor animal), then a rabies course would be recommended if not highly recommended, and the animal *eould be euthanized and dissected to test for rabies* EDIT: Depending upon circumstances, it might just be taken and monitored by the CDC for two weeks.  This wasn't just recommendations, it was actually the *law*, as I learned.\n\nI was uncertain so I called her and she assured me he'd gotten all his booster shots like 4 weeks prior.  I had no intention on letting them harm him nor giving him up / givin them her name.  He had very clearly bit me while excited playing and in reaction to my 'hug' cornering him et cetera.  I spoke with the doctor there at length and they said that while that's true, the animal could easily be in contact with rabid mice or other rodents in the apartment complex, which could put it in his system for a short time as a carrier even as his vaccine immunization fought it off. Checked with her again - no known rodent contact or rodents in her apartment any time she had been there.\n\nThey said that they wouldn't force me to give up the animal, but that if I wanted the rabies shot to be safe... That would have to be administered at the ER, and they'd have to fill out the CDC report and potentially put the animal down for testing given the severity of my bite EDIT: At a minimum, take the animal for monitoring...  If it has rabies, even if you get the shot and are fine, they use the information to track the spread of the disease and to immediately, say, go to her apartment complex, warn residents to watch for signs and wildlife, go nuclear with extermination of any local rodents, etc.\n\nBasically, they have the law because it easily spreads out of hand via local rodents / wild life and it's one of their main ways to head off the disease.\n\nIf I wanted the shot, I'd have to give up the animal.  I explained this to my friend and she was angry and in tears at the thought.  I had no intention of doing this, and he was an indoor cat who was provoked, so I took my chances.  Obviously I'm still here, and the antibiotics worked overnight to massively reduce the injury and make my arm useable again (any weight over like a quarter a kilo? was absolutely unbearable to lift when I went to get seen, it was that bad.)\n\nPoint of all that story:  Easily a situation which, in the U.K. the way you described it, would make me assume they give antibiotics and and that's basically it.  When you've erradicated the disease so well that the wild/rodent population isn't an issue to be concerned with, it's an entirely different treatment plan.  Technically, that doctor had to report me if I gave up the information and the CDC would, at a minimum (I just remembered) take her cat for two weeks quarantine/observation, if not decide to euthanize and dissect at some point along the way - depending on signs and/or local rabies activity in her area.\n\nInstead, the report was written up that the animal was someone's but the patient (me) seemed vague on the details.  I don't fully remember what was written but it covered their ass while leaving the rest vague. The rabies shot was my choice to go get, and I had chosen not to and admitted fault for working up the animal, so they decided not to do a CDC report (I am normally all for vaccinnations, and would have had it, had it not been my fault and so unlikely)\n\nSo that's an incident where you DO see the rabies shot come in as an option for someone here but it's not clear cut; where a decision to administer the shot is simply an option to consider. A rabid animal bite and quick action?  Certainly the shot gets administered.  But a bite from an animal highly unlikely to be rabid and provoked?  It still actually comes into question due to other factors here.", "edited": 1492352776.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get bit by any animal in the U.S., wild/undocumented or even vacinated, they are dtill going to consider the rabies vaccine immediately depending upon other circumstances  As you say, a visually rabid animal would certainly trigger an aggressive treatment for the person biten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, unlike the UK where it&amp;#39;s so unlikely, any animal who bites a person is subject to concern about rabies.

He had very clearly bit me while excited playing and in reaction to my &amp;#39;hug&amp;#39; cornering him et cetera.  I spoke with the doctor there at length and they said that while that&amp;#39;s true, the animal could easily be in contact with rabid mice or other rodents in the apartment complex, which could put it in his system for a short time as a carrier even as his vaccine immunization fought it off. Checked with her again - no known rodent contact or rodents in her apartment any time she had been there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They said that they wouldn&amp;#39;t force me to give up the animal, but that if I wanted the rabies shot to be safe... That would have to be administered at the ER, and they&amp;#39;d have to fill out the CDC report and potentially put the animal down for testing given the severity of my bite EDIT: At a minimum, take the animal for monitoring...  If it has rabies, even if you get the shot and are fine, they use the information to track the spread of the disease and to immediately, say, go to her apartment complex, warn residents to watch for signs and wildlife, go nuclear with extermination of any local rodents, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, they have the law because it easily spreads out of hand via local rodents / wild life and it&amp;#39;s one of their main ways to head off the disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I wanted the shot, I&amp;#39;d have to give up the animal.  I explained this to my friend and she was angry and in tears at the thought.  I had no intention of doing this, and he was an indoor cat who was provoked, so I took my chances.  Obviously I&amp;#39;m still here, and the antibiotics worked overnight to massively reduce the injury and make my arm useable again (any weight over like a quarter a kilo? was absolutely unbearable to lift when I went to get seen, it was that bad.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Point of all that story:  Easily a situation which, in the U.K. the way you described it, would make me assume they give antibiotics and and that&amp;#39;s basically it.  When you&amp;#39;ve erradicated the disease so well that the wild/rodent population isn&amp;#39;t an issue to be concerned with, it&amp;#39;s an entirely different treatment plan.  Technically, that doctor had to report me if I gave up the information and the CDC would, at a minimum (I just remembered) take her cat for two weeks quarantine/observation, if not decide to euthanize and dissect at some point along the way - depending on signs and/or local rabies activity in her area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, the report was written up that the animal was someone&amp;#39;s but the patient (me) seemed vague on the details.  I don&amp;#39;t fully remember what was written but it covered their ass while leaving the rest vague. The rabies shot was my choice to go get, and I had chosen not to and admitted fault for working up the animal, so they decided not to do a CDC report (I am normally all for vaccinnations, and would have had it, had it not been my fault and so unlikely)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s an incident where you DO see the rabies shot come in as an option for someone here but it&amp;#39;s not clear cut; where a decision to administer the shot is simply an option to consider. A rabid animal bite and quick action?  Certainly the shot gets administered.  But a bite from an animal highly unlikely to be rabid and provoked?  It still actually comes into question due to other factors here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "facepalm", "name": "t1_dgc12yn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492378499.0, "created_utc": 1492349699.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbwopl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 108, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GuineaPigApocalypse", "parent_id": "t1_dgbw7rk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/facepalm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The UK has been a rabies-free country since the 70s or 80s thanks to being an island, and to rigorous screening and vaccination of animals entering the country. \n\nWe don't speak about it because it hasn't been in the U.K. in decades apart from rare cases where dogs have been imported on fake passports, usually skipping all the screening and prevention steps to save money as they're typically puppies imported to sell, and then turn out to be carrying the disease.

A local dog started acting strange, trotting along dirt roads with determination and a stunned look on her face. We called her Fry. After a day or two her mouth started frothing and she looked fearful, and had a crazy look in her eye. Then a couple of the other dogs in the area started to seem unwell, and had bite marks.\n\nIt was time to put Fry out of her misery but the people were all Buddhists and we had no guns or tools. So my mum and a bunch of others put their thickest jackets on (in summer) and approached Fry to try to tie her to a tree, or into one of the latrines and close the door and lock it. They managed it but several of them got bites them pierced the skin through all the layers. Fry passed away a couple of days later.\n\nWe were about 7 hours drive in a jeep from the nearest hospital, so we went to look for vaccines. The course turned out to be 14 shots in a zig-zag pattern in the fat folds of your stomach. This was before the fancy new shot came out.\n\nThe hospital had about 5 shots, which was enough for 5 people to get their first shot. For the next two weeks we toured around from town to town asking for rabies vaccines. Some of the hospitals had had power cuts and the vaccines were sometimes out of date. After about 1200 kms of travel and some very nasty hospitals, we managed it but I kept a very very close eye on my mum.

A local dog started acting strange, trotting along dirt roads with determination and a stunned look on her face. We called her Fry. After a day or two her mouth started frothing and she looked fearful, and had a crazy look in her eye. Then a couple of the other dogs in the area started to seem unwell, and had bite marks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was time to put Fry out of her misery but the people were all Buddhists and we had no guns or tools. So my mum and a bunch of others put their thickest jackets on (in summer) and approached Fry to try to tie her to a tree, or into one of the latrines and close the door and lock it. They managed it but several of them got bites them pierced the skin through all the layers. Fry passed away a couple of days later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were about 7 hours drive in a jeep from the nearest hospital, so we went to look for vaccines. The course turned out to be 14 shots in a zig-zag pattern in the fat folds of your stomach. This was before the fancy new shot came out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hospital had about 5 shots, which was enough for 5 people to get their first shot. For the next two weeks we toured around from town to town asking for rabies vaccines. Some of the hospitals had had power cuts and the vaccines were sometimes out of date. After about 1200 kms of travel and some very nasty hospitals, we managed it but I kept a very very close eye on my mum. I even had to think about what to do if she started to turn, I mean the most sensible option would be to attack her with a knife or a rock before insanity and aggression took over and she might bite me. Luckily the shots worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lots of dogs died of rabies though, before the ordeal was over.
