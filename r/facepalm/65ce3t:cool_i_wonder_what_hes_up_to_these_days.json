Some interesting ones are below:\n\n1. Simultagnosia is weird. The person becomes unable to understand the \"bigger picture\", but he/she can work fine with the individual parts of the scene. You might put a man in a classroom and it will tell you he is in a room with chairs, a chalkboard and books, but he can never understand those items combine to constitute a classroom. \n\n2. Prosopagnosia is, in fact, what was described above as \"face blindness\". People will become unable to recognize familiar faces, including their own, although they see the rest of the world around them just fine.\n\n3. Astereognosia is the inability to recognize objects when only using touch.

But then I glance up and I realize it's him.   \nFucking Admiral Adama is standing right in front of me.   \nJudge Mendoza!   \n**Mr. FUCKING Escalante!** is in my shop.  \n  \nAll that went through my head as I calmly finished the work order and asked him to sign agreeing to the work we were completing for him. I didn't say anything because there were people in the shop and I didn't want to call attention to him because that is a dick move. Then he starts talking to the other people in the store and I realize they were all with him and so knew who he was. Small shop and he was with his daughters I believe. and either an agent or friend or something, another guy. I didn't ask about relationship dynamics or anything. But on the off chance one of them came back alone to do the pickup I didn't want to waste my opportunity. As politely as possible I said.  \n  \n\"I'm sorry sir I don't want to bother you while you are out running errands but I just realized who I was speaking to and just wanted to say I really enjoy your work\"  \n  \nHim: \"Well thanks.\" \n  \nAnd I thought that was it. I went back to complete his order, they went to lunch while I worked on it. I called my boyfriend geeking out like a motherfucker once they left because I had to tell someone and he is the one who got me to finally watch battlestar.  \n  \nWhen he came back to pickup his order I stayed calm and handled him like any other customer because that seems like the most polite thing to do. I wanted to small his hair, i imagine it smelled like sandalwood and a hint of pipe tobacco. I don't care if he smokes or not somehow i'm certain that is what he smells like.  \n  \nHe swiped his card and I set his item on the counter instead of handing it to him because sometimes when I try to hand people things there is awkward hand touching and out products are fragile so transfering them to a surface to be picked up is safer.  \n  \nThen he made my fucking day.  \n  \nHe reached for a handshake.  \n  \nI shook his hand, which which had a firm steady grip, and he said \"Thanks for all your help.\"    \nTo which I replied \"That's what I'm here for just let us know if you need anything else.\"  \n  \nIt was awesome.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always said that if I ever meet an actor or someone famous who I would actually want to meet.

So I fall into script mode because i say the same thing a few million times a day&lt;br/&gt;\nMe: Alright I will be happy to get this taken care of for you, it&amp;#39;s going to take about an hour. I just need to get some information so we can keep your order straight and contact you if needed. Can I get your name?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Him: Ed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: And your last name?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Him: O-L-M-O-S  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my head I am thinking, and almost say  Wow i bet you get a lot of flack for that name. But then I glance up and I realize it&amp;#39;s him.&lt;br/&gt;\nFucking Admiral Adama is standing right in front of me.&lt;br/&gt;\nJudge Mendoza!&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Mr. FUCKING Escalante!&lt;/strong&gt; is in my shop.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that went through my head as I calmly finished the work order and asked him to sign agreeing to the work we were completing for him. I didn&amp;#39;t say anything because there were people in the shop and I didn&amp;#39;t want to call attention to him because that is a dick move. Then he starts talking to the other people in the store and I realize they were all with him and so knew who he was. Small shop and he was with his daughters I believe. and either an agent or friend or something, another guy. I didn&amp;#39;t ask about relationship dynamics or anything. But on the off chance one of them came back alone to do the pickup I didn&amp;#39;t want to waste my opportunity. As politely as possible I said.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry sir I don&amp;#39;t want to bother you while you are out running errands but I just realized who I was speaking to and just wanted to say I really enjoy your work&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Him: &amp;quot;Well thanks.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I thought that was it. I went back to complete his order, they went to lunch while I worked on it. I called my boyfriend geeking out like a motherfucker once they left because I had to tell someone and he is the one who got me to finally watch battlestar.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he came back to pickup his order I stayed calm and handled him like any other customer because that seems like the most polite thing to do. I wanted to small his hair, i imagine it smelled like sandalwood and a hint of pipe tobacco. I don&amp;#39;t care if he smokes or not somehow i&amp;#39;m certain that is what he smells like.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He swiped his card and I set his item on the counter instead of handing it to him because sometimes when I try to hand people things there is awkward hand touching and out products are fragile so transfering them to a surface to be picked up is safer.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he made my fucking day.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He reached for a handshake.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shook his hand, which which had a firm steady grip, and he said &amp;quot;Thanks for all your help.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\nTo which I replied &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m here for just let us know if you need anything else.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "facepalm", "name": "t1_dg9gyok", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492220568.0, "created_utc": 1492191768.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 96}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r5rp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ce3t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r5rp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ce3t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9hzzv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Monkeymonkey27", "parent_id": "t1_dg9c2zy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/facepalm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Except Tony is known for his face.
