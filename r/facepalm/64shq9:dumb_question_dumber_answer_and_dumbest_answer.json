Ten has two prime factors: 2 and 5, making it inconvenient for easily dividing numbers into useful everyday fractions, like 1/3, 1/4, and 1/6.  This is why units (at least in the past) tend to be based on numbers that include 3 as a prime factor.  You see this everywhere in the imperial system: 12 inches in a foot make it easier to divide feet into common fractions.  Originally, an ounce was 1/12 of a pound (*roman pound/libra*) but has changed over time to 1/16.\n\nThe problem with imperial units (besides being somewhat of a clusterfuck) was that they're incredibly *awkward* to force into a base 10 numeral system.  Units based on 12 and 60 lose a lot of their convenience when you're forced to perform cumbersome calculations to use them.  For example, converting 492 inches to feet:\n\nBase 10:\n\n    492/12\n    4/1 = 4\n    12*4 = 48\n    492 - 480 = 12\n    12/12 = 1\n    492/12 = 41\n\nCompare this with base 12 (using A and B representing 11 and 12):\n\n    350/10\n    35/1 = 35 (just shift the decimal place over)\n    350/10 = 35\n\nMany common divisions get a *lot* easier to do in base 12, as well (here's 216/3):\n\n    160/3\n    16/3 = 6\n    160/3 = 60\n\nThis doesn't excuse the imperial system, though.  It's incredibly inefficient and doesn't make a whole lot of sense when it comes to how the units relate to each other.  If the metric system were to be \"remade\" for another number system, it would look almost identical, save for the base of the exponent everything was based on.\n\nMy guess as for why angles and time have stuck around with base 360 and base 12 number systems is that both measures use modular arithmetic.  This is like adding hours on a clock: exceed 12, and it \"wraps around\" to 1 again.  Add 20 degrees to 350, and you get 10 degrees.  It would be really strange to use a base 360 measurement, *if* we regularly used measures in excess of 360.  Happily, with both time and angles, we generally stay in our nice little bubble of 12 hours and 360 degrees, and we get the benefit of dividing our angles and time into nice little fractions (1/3 of a day in base 10 time? *yuck*).\n\nIn case you're wondering there *is* a \"decimal\" angle system in regular use today.

If the metric system were to be &amp;quot;remade&amp;quot; for another number system, it would look almost identical, save for the base of the exponent everything was based on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess as for why angles and time have stuck around with base 360 and base 12 number systems is that both measures use modular arithmetic.  This is like adding hours on a clock: exceed 12, and it &amp;quot;wraps around&amp;quot; to 1 again.  Add 20 degrees to 350, and you get 10 degrees.  It would be really strange to use a base 360 measurement, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; we regularly used measures in excess of 360.  Happily, with both time and angles, we generally stay in our nice little bubble of 12 hours and 360 degrees, and we get the benefit of dividing our angles and time into nice little fractions (1/3 of a day in base 10 time? &lt;em&gt;yuck&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case you&amp;#39;re wondering there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a &amp;quot;decimal&amp;quot; angle system in regular use today. The &lt;em&gt;gradian&lt;/em&gt; (metric degree) is widely used in surveying and divides a full rotation into 400 grads.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "facepalm", "name": "t1_dg5filb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491997787.0, "created_utc": 1491968987.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4zt9e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AstroTibs", "parent_id": "t1_dg4xfz2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/facepalm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's not really a good answer.
