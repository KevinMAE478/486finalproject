I was very open to all of the issues that a car that old is bound to have. I had very little time to deal with idiots from the Internet, so I lowered the price and I just wanted it gone at that point. Wife and I both have full time jobs and my son was only barely one then. Finally get three serious buyers show up. One of them was late by over an hour, so he overlapped with the next serious buyer. The guy that was late shows up with his tree-tall son and proceed to get angry that the other guy and I had already worked up a deal. The second guy just needed to go get the cash and a truck to tow it away. I told him, sorry, but this gentleman and I already shook on it, it&amp;#39;s a done deal. The dude proceeds to get loud and violent with me, while I was holding my baby son, and the poor guy that just bought the car from me. Wtf. He finally takes off as I threatened to call the police. Wonderful people on Craigslist, I tell you. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "facepalm", "name": "t1_dgdp80h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492474928.0, "created_utc": 1492446128.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r5rp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vs09", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r5rp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vs09", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge52vm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "THROUGHFAILUREIWIN", "parent_id": "t1_dge4ba1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/facepalm", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Right.
