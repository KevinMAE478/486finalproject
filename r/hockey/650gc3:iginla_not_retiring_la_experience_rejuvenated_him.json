What sutter implemented was a system that relied on a slow, heavy-hitting game and having to grind out goals. Fortunately, this system won us 2 cups in &amp;#39;12 and &amp;#39;14, but since then, the league has changed and our slow and physical system just doesn&amp;#39;t work anymore. But Sutter kept using the system and the players like Kopi, Toffoli, and Pearson were held back because of this system&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hockey", "name": "t1_dg6mwnq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492063106.0, "created_utc": 1492034306.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiel", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_650gc3", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ptjk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sleazy_T", "parent_id": "t1_dg6lnzw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hockey", "controversiality": 0, "body": "By the way it's all speculation.
