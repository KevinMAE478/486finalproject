It was a shitty situation for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeo&amp;#39;s in an awkward spot with a guy who&amp;#39;s pretty much done at the end of the year, helping him coach a team that is just struggling in every aspect of the game...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hitch, who had done great things for the team seemed to have completely lost them, which from what I heard was likely due to the team being changed pretty heavily in terms of who was there. Apparently his style is to grind on the guys until they start to play his style without the guidance from him. That requires locker room leaders, and with Backes, Brouwer and Ott all leaving, the locker room was finding it&amp;#39;s new identity, so with them went the Hitch style.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Armstrong can&amp;#39;t realistically not bring back the coach that took the Blues deeper into the playoffs than they had been in years...so everyone got stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hockey", "name": "t1_dg6eumf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492054340.0, "created_utc": 1492025540.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg616xu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 44, "report_reasons": null, "author": "OldSpaceChaos", "parent_id": "t1_dg5vsye", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hockey", "controversiality": 0, "body": "As an stl resident his departure hurt my heart.

They are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds. Birds are the closest living relatives of crocodilians.\n\nThe fossil record indicates that birds evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs. True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago.[3] DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous\u2013Palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago, which reduced the Pterosaurs, and killed off all the non-avian dinosaur lineages. Birds, especially those in the southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling.[4] Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago.[1] Many of these early \"stem-birds\", such as Archaeopteryx, were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birds (Aves), a subgroup of reptiles, are the last living examples of dinosaurs. They are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds.
