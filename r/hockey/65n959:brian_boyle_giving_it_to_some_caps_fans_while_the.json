How about you settle down on the bias there. In his NHL career so far, Tom Wilson at 23 years old is producing the same as Brian Boyle did in his first few seasons. They&amp;#39;re both very similar players. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also Wilson doesn&amp;#39;t take that many dumb penalties. Maybe it seems that way against the Pens. He&amp;#39;s our only real fighter so he&amp;#39;s always going to lead our team in PIMs and skirt the line of taking a penalty or not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But either way, Wilson hasn&amp;#39;t taken a penalty in these playoffs so far and won game 1 for us whereas Boyle had 1 each game so far and his latest one was in OT. Not good timing there. Fortunately for him, he was able to redeem himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "hockey", "name": "t1_dgbstdo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492354765.0, "created_utc": 1492325965.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qiel", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65n959", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbw124", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jamslut2", "parent_id": "t1_dgboqd7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hockey", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Exactly.
