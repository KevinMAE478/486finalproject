But hey, it&amp;#39;s a comic book show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has so much happening in most episodes that I&amp;#39;m honestly bored when I watch a MCU movie and want to get back to the show.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "comicbooks", "name": "t1_dgb2s59", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492314309.0, "created_utc": 1492285509.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhon", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65je8x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaxnwe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wigsternm", "parent_id": "t1_dgau1ar", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/comicbooks", "controversiality": 0, "body": "For the record you'd probably be fine starting at s01e016-17.
