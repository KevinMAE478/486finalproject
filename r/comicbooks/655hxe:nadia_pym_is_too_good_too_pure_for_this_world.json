Wasp is one of my favorite characters in comics, and while this doesn&amp;#39;t star Janet... it&amp;#39;s still &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; Wasp, with a connection to Janet.

This is 10x worse than that ever was, way too on-the-nose with their message.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nadia feels kinda Mary Sue-ish to me, though granted she&amp;#39;s a new character so we might see those flaws crop up soon enough.
