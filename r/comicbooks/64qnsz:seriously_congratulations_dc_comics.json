I wont lie; at the time I didn&amp;#39;t have the money or means to read comics on a regular basis (hard to find in UK without travel) and so I did torrent the entire line, but it got me hooked and I have paid for every comic I&amp;#39;ve read since earning a steady pay-cheque (mostly digital or via subscriptions). Either way, I became a Marvel fanboy, but I couldn&amp;#39;t get in to the mainline comics. That changed with Marvel NOW! (the first) and The New 52.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The New 52 kicked it all off and I enjoyed getting to know DC Comics&amp;#39; line of characters on their home turf and not through cartoons or movies, etc. But I fell hard for Green Lantern and it was one of the comics that didn&amp;#39;t get a full reboot, so I needed to track down the best place to start and that, of course, led me to Geoff Johns&amp;#39; Rebirth... and I was hooked. I had to hunt down and buy almost every issue, tie-in, or side-series, and it was worth every penny! I managed to do it fairly quickly (I was still living at home with no girlfriend so the money was as abundant as space sectors) and, by this point, I preferred digital so I binged hard; in fact, I am pretty sure Geoff Johns is responsible for a few slips in my final grade at college (pre-university in UK)! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, OG Rebirth Green Lantern ruined the New 52 for me. It offered a glimpse of characters and tropes I didn&amp;#39;t know I wanted in comics. I had always loved the Ultimate comics&amp;#39; clean slate and grounded approach, and Marvel&amp;#39;s characters felt a little more flawed in general; I thought that was what I wanted... but actually I needed hope, heroism, absurdity and all-round goodness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Marvel was going through with Marvel NOW! and after every reset I lost a little more faith. I branched out to creator owned comics and I got a good dose of joy from Invincible, but one comic a month (that I looked forward to, at least) was hell. I thought that Secret Wars would give me back the Marvel I initially enjoyed, because my original love, the Ultimate Universe, was going to get folded in to the mainstream 616... but I just couldn&amp;#39;t maintain my excitement by the time Civil War II came around and I dropped every title I was reading from the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also thought that DC&amp;#39;s Convergence would give the New 52 the kick it needed, but it didn&amp;#39;t and I slowly wondered whether I was just getting tired of superhero comics. But, one of the heroes from Convergence stuck around and that character, who I had grown to hate with the New 52 and his movie offerings, quickly became the hero I didn&amp;#39;t know I always needed - the almost flawless boy scout in bue and red, Superman!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Post-Crisis Superman was back and I needed to follow every turn in his story, then news of New 52 Superman&amp;#39;s upcoming death started to build credibility and Rebirth was coming in fast... sooner than I expected Wally West joined DC&amp;#39;s supremo in the current universe and the line wide injection of optimism, insanity and joy gave me the DC universe I found I longed for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot explain what a joy it has been to read every single title from Rebirth over the past few months! Every title seems to have its niche and purpose, without treading on the toes of their sister titles; dark titles are dark and have moments of levity, but light titles stay light and find moments of darkness - not everything is washed over with the same brush or forced to conform to a publisher wide image. I honestly look forward to reading new titles each week and I can&amp;#39;t wait to see how Mr. Oz, The Pin, Superman and more, bring the DC universe back to where it needs to be; slowly, but surely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, congratulations DC Comics; you have won me over and I am loving Rebirth so far... just, please, don&amp;#39;t delve in to too many publisher wide events or any major editor mandated shake-ups any time soon!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;also... guys... you need to bring back Plastic Man.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Tried to post this on /r/DCcomics but it isn't showing and I don't expect this to get much visibility, but I really hope that at least one person from DC Comics (at any level) sees this and knows I am rooting for them!\n\nI started reading comics about eight-or-so years ago and I started with Ultimate Marvel.
