It depends on the individual dog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This whole blanket statements that people want to make about babies and dogs show either a fundamental misunderstanding of dog behavior or just a laziness in that approach to understanding. Yes, there are some very broad generalizations that can be made about how dogs think, act, react and otherwise behave but they are just that - broad generalizations. Nothing is going to be 100% accurate across the species, or even across a breed. Anymore than a generalization about a group of people will hold up 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry that you got bit as a baby, I really am. But I can also attest to multiple times that I&amp;#39;ve personally witnessed babies poke dogs in the eyes, yank on their tails. hit them on the head and do other behaviors that I would normally think would make a dog lash out; only to have the dog in question look over to its human with a pitiful look akin to, &amp;quot;Help me. Please take this insane little human away from me.&amp;quot; And then yes, there are other dogs that are very sweet and well socialized that I would never let a baby near, even under adult supervision - some of them being my own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A responsible pet owner should have good communication skills with their pet. A responsible pet owner should know whether or not it is safe to let a baby or toddler near their pet and should make that call accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Eyebleach", "name": "t1_dgaubjf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492302802.0, "created_utc": 1492274002.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 35}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s427", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65iw2d", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s427", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65iw2d", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaua1k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 36, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nilesandstuff", "parent_id": "t1_dgatfyw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Eyebleach", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just that it was trained in a pretty high capacity to be patient, especially when being touched and moved in ways that make the dog uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, dominant isnt the right word, part of training show dogs is making them realize they aren't the alpha, but i know what you meant.\n\nIt was also trained to be a hunting dog.\n\nBoth disciplines require that a dog be very patient and not act on impulses.\n\nIrish gordon setters are however knwn to be aggressive toward children.\n\nEdit: also, the training involved to have a dog be a show dog **and** a pet is different than to be a show dog and then live in a kennel the rest of the time or with mostly other dogs.
