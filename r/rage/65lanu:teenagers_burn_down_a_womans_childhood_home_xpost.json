She married my grandfather in the front yard. Practically all of my great grandma&amp;#39;s grandchildren grew up at the house. A lot of sentimental value is held here. For example, my grandmother&amp;#39;s sister was killed in a car accident in her twenties. Her children were very young and don&amp;#39;t remember. Three months later, her oldest child died. My grandmother, and her brother-in-law, were very shook by the two deaths so close together. Not just them, but even my mother and her siblings. A lot of time was spent at the house and the family helping raise her two children in her absence. We also had a door where one of the sheets of glass was broken on the bottom by a distant cousin of mine decades ago. Since that, every child before the age of one crawled through that hole in the door (no glass left anywhere). It was a partial tradition my family held. Yeah, it&amp;#39;s a house. It was built by my family and not a single soul lived in it other than family. It was never sold, never bought other than the land for it to be built. It was practically a mansion to a lot of people in the area. The heartbreaking part, is that my grandmother stood and watched her family home burn from her kitchen window for five hours and cried. She couldn&amp;#39;t afford to fix it up, but she paid insurance on it. She was going to sell it. \nWe do know the names of 2 out of 3 teenagers that were arrested. 17, 16 and 13. They believe a 4th may have been involved, so they&amp;#39;re investigating further. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rage", "name": "t1_dgcwlbv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492421428.0, "created_utc": 1492392628.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qil2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lanu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge84sg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "khaleesi97", "parent_id": "t3_65lanu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rage", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[here's the news report on their arrest](http://www.wect.com/story/35170090/3-teens-accused-of-burning-two-columbus-county-homes) ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wect.com/story/35170090/3-teens-accused-of-burning-two-columbus-county-homes\"&gt;here&amp;#39;s the news report on their arrest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rage", "name": "t1_dge84sg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492496517.0, "created_utc": 1492467717.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qil2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lanu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qil2", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65lanu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeh7zf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "khaleesi97", "parent_id": "t1_dgebqin", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rage", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Their families are so embarrassed currently.
