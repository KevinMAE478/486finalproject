When I asked him what the blurred name was, he replied he would ask a field officer and then send me a copy. He hasn\u2019t sent it to me yet.**\n\n&gt; How the whole thing worked was that the various Duterte supporters here and abroad were encouraged to send their money to Gava Gives, which would then keep eight percent of the gross amount at the closing date and send the remainder to Bondoc. **Gava Gives could not legally issue a check to D.A.V.A.O. Movement because the group was not yet incorporated as an NGO.** Banks are super strict nowadays in allowing the opening of bank accounts in the name of corporations and other entities other than individual persons.\n\n&gt; Jimmy Bondoc told me that indeed he was the one who received the check from Gava Gives. He assured me that \u201cnobody held the money but me\u201d and that all expenses using the money were accounted for \u201ckahit yung P36 na brown folder\u201d (even the P36 spent for buying a brown folder).\n\n&gt; **Since there was no corporation to speak of and it was Jimmy Bondoc who had received the money, I asked him whether or not he was aware that he had to pay taxes on the P2 million they had raised.**\n\n&gt; **At first, he told me that some \u201cexperts\u201d told them no tax had to be paid.** I told him that under Bureau of Internal Revenue rules, only those NGOs given special BIR status could receive donations without paying taxes on them.\n\n&gt; When I pointed that out, Bondoc replied that if taxes had to be paid, he or the NGO would pay it.\n\n----\n\n&gt; How much does Jimmy Bondoc owe in taxes for the P2 million donations?\n\n&gt; **Since the money would still, at this point, be treated by the Bureau of Internal Revenue\u201d as his personal income I roughly calculated that next year, Bondoc would have to pay about P600,000 in income tax.**\n\n&gt; **I was surprised that the D.A.V.A.O. Movement seemed unaware of their tax responsibilities since among the organizers was lawyer Bruce Rivera**, the lawyer of Janet Lim Napoles who is being accused of spectacularly laundering billions of pork barrel pesos through her NGOs.\n\n----\n\n&gt; Who actually paid for the expenses of the rally? In his breakdown of expenses, Bondoc makes it clear that half of the money they raised through Gava Gives went to rally expenses.\n\n&gt; As proof, he posted on FB a receipt showing they paid P230,000 for \u201clight, sound, staging and roofing\u201d.\n\n&gt; I found several things curious about the receipt. First, it did not show the name to whom the receipt was issued. Second, it did not show the date it was issued.

I asked him to send me the complete receipt. I have not received it to this day.**\n\n----\n\n&gt; **I asked her [GavaGives owner Annalyn Cuisia] whether her company withholds taxes on the money raised**, which then has to be reported to the BIR using BIR Form 2307. I cited Jimmy Bondoc\u2019s fund-raising as an example.\n\n&gt; She later replied, \u201cUpon checking with my legal officer and CFO (chief financial officer), **we are not bound to issue (BIR Form) 2307.
