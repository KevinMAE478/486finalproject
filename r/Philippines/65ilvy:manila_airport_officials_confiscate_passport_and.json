As we all know as well, immigration is a touchy subject and if she had &amp;quot;escaped&amp;quot; Saudi to seek asylum elsewhere, she surely would have been vetted as probably an illegal immigrant--- NOW, if Saudi was an &amp;quot;enemy&amp;quot; state ala Russia Vs USA during the cold war, then by all means we can protect her from the enemy-- but the reality is that Saudi is not an enemy state to us, and thus we had no choice but to give in to Saudi as far as their citizen is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is the sad reality, to be honest.
