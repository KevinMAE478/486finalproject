Both were young and wildly ambitious. Then Martial Law came, and Aquino was jailed, campaigned for a seat in the Batasang Pambansa, got sick in prison, was granted a humanitarian waiver to get treatment in the US, stayed on in exile, and hearing of the grumblings and unrest after the lifting of Martial Law decided to participate once again in the political fray by coming home. Was assassinated, then Cory happened...EDSA....Cory as president....PGGG....Marcos dies in Hawaii....his body allowed to be shipped back to Ilocos Norte....Imelda and the spawn come back to win political positions....court cases filed by the government against the Marcoses don&amp;#39;t prosper...FVR, a Cory ally and Marcos relative becomes President.......................Cory dies...Noy runs for President, PNoy continues his family&amp;#39;s acerbity and hostility against Marcoses...PNoy grooms his successor, Mar Roxas...Roxas fails, Duterte wins...Duterte with Marcos ties...panic mode within the Aquino camp because the idea of a Marcos within striking distance of the presidency is anathema to their whole being as Aquinos! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see it&amp;#39;s not that these people are against Marcos per se, because they are insulated time and circumstance from the Martial Law era. Or maybe they really are against Marcos. But it&amp;#39;s more that these people are decidedly pro-Aquino, and any friend of the enemy of the Aquinos is also their enemy. They are loyalists of a different sort, or of the other camp. And so, the intransigence against anything Duterte here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These two families have been duking out with each other for decades and many Filipinos have become participants in their conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This just came to me.
