And that while as a Catholic, I don&amp;#39;t always agree with Protestantism&amp;#39;s doctrines and theology, I affirmed that the division of Catholics and Protestants is there for a reason, and that God still desires that all still be &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; for Him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to Mass afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Philippines", "name": "t1_dg5tqal", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492030974.0, "created_utc": 1492002174.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjov", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x724", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5qv4v", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Starmark_115", "parent_id": "t3_64x724", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Philippines", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Is this a church service or an opera performance?\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is this a church service or an opera performance?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Philippines", "name": "t1_dg5qv4v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492025690.0, "created_utc": 1491996890.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjov", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x724", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5yxnm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheDonDelC", "parent_id": "t3_64x724", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Philippines", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There are some 'born-again' fellowships which are quite nice as other commentors here have noted and then there are others which really have a cultish vibe to them like \"speaking in tongues\" and pastors who find satanic impressions on everything.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some &amp;#39;born-again&amp;#39; fellowships which are quite nice as other commentors here have noted and then there are others which really have a cultish vibe to them like &amp;quot;speaking in tongues&amp;quot; and pastors who find satanic impressions on everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Philippines", "name": "t1_dg5yxnm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492037691.0, "created_utc": 1492008891.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjov", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x724", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg632m8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pogiface", "parent_id": "t3_64x724", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Philippines", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Cult ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cult &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Philippines", "name": "t1_dg632m8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492042247.0, "created_utc": 1492013447.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjov", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x724", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjov", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x724", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5pfip", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MahalNaEmre", "parent_id": "t1_dg5oyso", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Philippines", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Protestante pa rin mga ulol.
