I&amp;#39;m afraid of what he might do to my little nephew which his sister tasked him to take care of while working abroad\nI told my little brother about this incident to warn him. He said that he already knows what my cousin&amp;#39;s been doing and that he sees him doing it sometimes. He also told me that a kid who comes there with my cousin saw him molesting another kid. I didn&amp;#39;t tell my mother Immediately cause my cousin was in the house all day, I didn&amp;#39;t want him to hear me cause he&amp;#39;s a violent person. I told my grand mother this  story and asked her where I should report this, but all she said is a BS story and to pray for him. A few days later after thinking and seaching the net.
