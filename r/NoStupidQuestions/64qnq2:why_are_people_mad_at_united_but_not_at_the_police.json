Once a person is on the plane and seated said passenger should be allowed to remain. They could have asked for volunteers at the gate to give up their seat, but to *mandate* that somebody leave the plane is not the right way of doing things. This exudes operational arrogance and an absolute disregard and disrespect for the passengers.\n\nAs I understand it they needed four seats and three people volunteered to be bumped, with one of those three being the victim's wife. When the wife volunteered they demanded that the other guy leave as well even though he did not volunteer. At that point the proper action would have been to continue to search for volunteers, raising the incentive if need be, instead of escalating the situation.\n\nWhile they have reserved the right to mandate that somebody be bumped, and they have reserved the right to have a belligerent passenger removed from the plane by authorities, they certainly should have known that having a peaceful, non-violent, non-aggressive passenger beaten and forcibly dragged from an airplane in the modern era of everybody having video recording capability certainly doesn't put the company in a positive light.
