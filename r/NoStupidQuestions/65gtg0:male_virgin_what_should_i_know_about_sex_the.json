It can't be easy to ask. I am a woman and I had some very wrong ideas of MY OWN anatomy until I was in my mid-20s!\n\nWhen we hit puberty, women typically start ovulating, producing tiny little egg cells inside our ovaries. This is part of our menstrual cycle, but it doesn't usually happen when we bleed, it typically happens two weeks before we are actually \"on\" our period. When this egg is out, we are capable of getting pregnant. Our menstrual cycles are typically ~30 days and regular, but that's not always true. Lots of women have irregular periods (a major reason to go on birth control is that it regulates your cycle) and may bleed more of less frequently, and there is a chance (though a small one) that an egg may be present while menstruating. \n\nMenstruation itself (the period) is a period where the red uterine tissue which has been thickening for the past month sheds itself. It comes out the vagina in lots of different forms. Sometimes light like blood, or sometimes very gooey and full of semi-solid bits. It has a distinct smell, but doesn't necessarily smell *bad*. \n\nWomens hormones do fluctuate throughout the cycle, but it is not typically a major issue. Men also experience some level of hormone fluctuations. If a woman is super pissed off on her period there are lots of reasons that might be so- pain from cramping while menstruating might make her have a short temper, maybe she is tired of people blaming things on her period, or there is a small possibility that she does have *severe* hormonal fluctuations and needs treatment. That's not the norm. Nor is debilitating cramps the norm- believing that delays women from seeking treatment. Same with believing that the first time having sex should be painful.\n\nThat's a basic rundown of the menstrual cycle. Now for some anatomy and birth control. \n\nBodies come in a lot of sizes and shapes, genitalia are no exception. The shape and size of some features of our genitalia can vary a lot, if you think about noses you'll understand.  Generally women have thicker outer labia (outer lips), thinner labia minora (inner lips, colloquially known by idiots as 'roasties'), and then the clitoris (a little nub that is the physical analogue of the head of the penis) which is covered by a little hood of skin (like foreskin) with the urethral opening (pee hole) a little ways under that and then the vagina (the inner part) below that. There may or may not be a hymen, which is a flap of skin around the edges of the vagina with a large slit or hole in the middle. [Top right illustration is a typical hymen.](http://i.imgur.com/bjEOTbj.gif)\n\nThe labia minora changes shape and size during and a bit after puberty. This is the kernel of truth that has turned into the shitpearl of 'wisdom' that is the persistent myth that having a labia minora, especially ones that are lower than the outer lips (sometimes called \"outies\") is due to excessive sexual intercourse with too many different penises. They never think that sex with just one man's penis will cause problems, funny isn't it?\n\nThe vagina itself is spongy tissue, and largely muscle. They self-clean by continually secreting a small amount of mucus discharge throughout the day. The smell and the thickness of the discharge can change naturally throughout a woman's cycle. She also produces more when she is aroused, usually. This isn't always true because lots of things can affect it. Medication, age, hormone levels can all affect amount of natural lubrication, and some women just naturally produce more or less. Nor is a sudden increase in production a guarantee that a woman is turned on, so it is not a good proxy for other nonverbal or verbal consent. \n\nThe vagina, as a muscle, doesn't stretch out from having sex with many people. It can temporarily get larger in some ways. A vagina \"tents\" when aroused, and somewhat tighter when the person with the vagina is scared or uncomfortable- the tightness can be extreme and quite painful if the woman has the condition vaginismus. \n\n[Above the vagina](http://i.imgur.com/ToYmjmh.jpg) is [the cervix.](http://i.imgur.com/lbP7TJC.jpg) Hitting this during sex is very pleasurable for some women, and excruciating for others. I mostly mention this because there is this weird trend on the internet for the last year of people thinking it's some sort of ultimate goal to hit it. It's not that hard to hit, and certainly not pleasant for everyone.\n\nSpeaking of \"it's not pleasant for everyone\", people have different wants and needs during sex. There is no one thing that is guaranteed to work for everyone with the same parts. You can get some ideas for things to try and things to avoid, but ultimately you and your partner(s) have to figure out what works best for you as individuals and as a partnership/triad/orgy/whatever.  Honestly that's a big part of the fun anyway! It's not like asking things like 'what would you like me to do to you'/ 'does this feel good' is not a turn off in the least. Communication and good observation skills make for a fantastic lover. \n\nI'll talk a bit about birth control, because if you're straight that's gonna be important. It's best to use multiple forms of birth control, because none are 100% effective, even if used perfectly. And most people don't use them perfectly. \n\nFor condoms: It doesn't have to be terribly awkward. You doesn't have to stop the action to be put on- it can be a group activity. Make sure to follow the directions in the condom package if you use them. Don't use two at once- it's *less* effective than one, not more effective. It causes tiny microtears through which sperm can travel.  And make sure not to let them get too hot, too cold, or too old. Those will all effect their efficacy. Also just as an FYI, condoms don't stop all STIs. Herpes, crabs, and one other I can't recall at the second can be transferred from skin-to-skin contact.\n\nHormonal birth control- there are IUDs, implants, birth control shot, patch, and the pill. They all have a lower chance of failure than barrier methods alone, but not all women want or even *can* use them. Sometimes the hormones can cause extreme side effects, such as blood clots and stroke, or suicidal depression. It's also easy to accidentally mess up taking the pill, as it has to be taken at the same time each day to be effective. There are also all kinds of things that will make the birth control pill stop being effective- St Johns Wort, even some antibiotics. \n\nFor emergency contraception there is plan B, but it's only 89-90% effective at the best of times. Plan B won't work if an egg has already been fertilized and implanted, and it also has a much lower efficacy in women over a BMI of 26, which is literally most women in America. (http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/ecobesity.html) Copper IUDs can be used as emergency contraception, but not all places offer them and it's not always recommended for women who haven't given birth.\n\nIt's safest to take charge of your own birth control, as much as you can.\n\nSex in general: Women generally take longer to get off than men do. Women often can't get off from penis-in-vagina intercourse alone and need some form of clitoral stimulation as well. When men joke about female masturbation they typically mention dildos- when women joke about female masturbation, they typically mention things that vibrate. There's a reason for that. \n\nOh and don't take sex cues from porn. So much of the shit in there looks *painful,* like extremely hard repeated jackhammering, putting so much pressure on the breasts they look like they're about to pop, choking out of the blue, etc. Ask first, start slowly, don't jump in to something, especially if it might be painful or scary. \n\nI can't think of anything else at the second.

If a woman is super pissed off on her period there are lots of reasons that might be so- pain from cramping while menstruating might make her have a short temper, maybe she is tired of people blaming things on her period, or there is a small possibility that she does have &lt;em&gt;severe&lt;/em&gt; hormonal fluctuations and needs treatment. That&amp;#39;s not the norm. Nor is debilitating cramps the norm- believing that delays women from seeking treatment. Same with believing that the first time having sex should be painful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a basic rundown of the menstrual cycle. Now for some anatomy and birth control. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bodies come in a lot of sizes and shapes, genitalia are no exception. The shape and size of some features of our genitalia can vary a lot, if you think about noses you&amp;#39;ll understand.  Generally women have thicker outer labia (outer lips), thinner labia minora (inner lips, colloquially known by idiots as &amp;#39;roasties&amp;#39;), and then the clitoris (a little nub that is the physical analogue of the head of the penis) which is covered by a little hood of skin (like foreskin) with the urethral opening (pee hole) a little ways under that and then the vagina (the inner part) below that. There may or may not be a hymen, which is a flap of skin around the edges of the vagina with a large slit or hole in the middle. &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/bjEOTbj.gif\"&gt;Top right illustration is a typical hymen.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The labia minora changes shape and size during and a bit after puberty. This is the kernel of truth that has turned into the shitpearl of &amp;#39;wisdom&amp;#39; that is the persistent myth that having a labia minora, especially ones that are lower than the outer lips (sometimes called &amp;quot;outies&amp;quot;) is due to excessive sexual intercourse with too many different penises. They never think that sex with just one man&amp;#39;s penis will cause problems, funny isn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The vagina itself is spongy tissue, and largely muscle. They self-clean by continually secreting a small amount of mucus discharge throughout the day. The smell and the thickness of the discharge can change naturally throughout a woman&amp;#39;s cycle. She also produces more when she is aroused, usually. This isn&amp;#39;t always true because lots of things can affect it. Medication, age, hormone levels can all affect amount of natural lubrication, and some women just naturally produce more or less. Nor is a sudden increase in production a guarantee that a woman is turned on, so it is not a good proxy for other nonverbal or verbal consent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The vagina, as a muscle, doesn&amp;#39;t stretch out from having sex with many people. It can temporarily get larger in some ways. A vagina &amp;quot;tents&amp;quot; when aroused, and somewhat tighter when the person with the vagina is scared or uncomfortable- the tightness can be extreme and quite painful if the woman has the condition vaginismus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ToYmjmh.jpg\"&gt;Above the vagina&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/lbP7TJC.jpg\"&gt;the cervix.&lt;/a&gt; Hitting this during sex is very pleasurable for some women, and excruciating for others. I mostly mention this because there is this weird trend on the internet for the last year of people thinking it&amp;#39;s some sort of ultimate goal to hit it. It&amp;#39;s not that hard to hit, and certainly not pleasant for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not pleasant for everyone&amp;quot;, people have different wants and needs during sex. There is no one thing that is guaranteed to work for everyone with the same parts. You can get some ideas for things to try and things to avoid, but ultimately you and your partner(s) have to figure out what works best for you as individuals and as a partnership/triad/orgy/whatever.  Honestly that&amp;#39;s a big part of the fun anyway! It&amp;#39;s not like asking things like &amp;#39;what would you like me to do to you&amp;#39;/ &amp;#39;does this feel good&amp;#39; is not a turn off in the least. Communication and good observation skills make for a fantastic lover. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll talk a bit about birth control, because if you&amp;#39;re straight that&amp;#39;s gonna be important. It&amp;#39;s best to use multiple forms of birth control, because none are 100% effective, even if used perfectly. And most people don&amp;#39;t use them perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For condoms: It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be terribly awkward. You doesn&amp;#39;t have to stop the action to be put on- it can be a group activity. Make sure to follow the directions in the condom package if you use them. Don&amp;#39;t use two at once- it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; effective than one, not more effective. It causes tiny microtears through which sperm can travel.  And make sure not to let them get too hot, too cold, or too old. Those will all effect their efficacy. Also just as an FYI, condoms don&amp;#39;t stop all STIs. Herpes, crabs, and one other I can&amp;#39;t recall at the second can be transferred from skin-to-skin contact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hormonal birth control- there are IUDs, implants, birth control shot, patch, and the pill. They all have a lower chance of failure than barrier methods alone, but not all women want or even &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use them. Sometimes the hormones can cause extreme side effects, such as blood clots and stroke, or suicidal depression. It&amp;#39;s also easy to accidentally mess up taking the pill, as it has to be taken at the same time each day to be effective. There are also all kinds of things that will make the birth control pill stop being effective- St Johns Wort, even some antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For emergency contraception there is plan B, but it&amp;#39;s only 89-90% effective at the best of times. Plan B won&amp;#39;t work if an egg has already been fertilized and implanted, and it also has a much lower efficacy in women over a BMI of 26, which is literally most women in America. (&lt;a href=\"http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/ecobesity.html\"&gt;http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/ecobesity.html&lt;/a&gt;) Copper IUDs can be used as emergency contraception, but not all places offer them and it&amp;#39;s not always recommended for women who haven&amp;#39;t given birth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s safest to take charge of your own birth control, as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sex in general: Women generally take longer to get off than men do. Women often can&amp;#39;t get off from penis-in-vagina intercourse alone and need some form of clitoral stimulation as well. When men joke about female masturbation they typically mention dildos- when women joke about female masturbation, they typically mention things that vibrate. There&amp;#39;s a reason for that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh and don&amp;#39;t take sex cues from porn. So much of the shit in there looks &lt;em&gt;painful,&lt;/em&gt; like extremely hard repeated jackhammering, putting so much pressure on the breasts they look like they&amp;#39;re about to pop, choking out of the blue, etc. Ask first, start slowly, don&amp;#39;t jump in to something, especially if it might be painful or scary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t think of anything else at the second. Feel free to ask if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "name": "t1_dga8b36", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492256238.0, "created_utc": 1492227438.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 184}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w844", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gtg0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w844", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gtg0", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w844", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gtg0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgay5th", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Net_Lurker1", "parent_id": "t1_dgaprct", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoStupidQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Funny how many men experience this even when they have watched porn before\n\nGuilty as charged ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Funny how many men experience this even when they have watched porn before&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guilty as charged &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "name": "t1_dgay5th", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492308075.0, "created_utc": 1492279275.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaprct", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Dyslectic_Sabreur", "parent_id": "t1_dgaeohw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoStupidQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Haha I just wrote a comment saying the same thing.
