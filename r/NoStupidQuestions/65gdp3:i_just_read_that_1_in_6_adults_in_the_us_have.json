It's a skin condition that doesn't have any real mortality risk.  Obviously nobody want to have sores on their genitals, but it's not something you have all the time.  You might never even have an outbreak, and if you do have outbreaks, they may only happen once a year or less.\n\nIf you want to be 100% certain of contracting herpes, here's what you do: never have sex.  If you have sex, you're at risk.  If you have sex with a condom, you're at less risk, but still at risk.  It's contracted by skin-to-skin contact, not fluid exchange.  The condoms help only because they cover up some skin.\n\nHere's the fun, counter-intuitive part, which explains why so many people have herpes: You're probably less likely to contract herpes from someone who tells you they have herpes than you are from someone who doesn't.  The person with herpes is probably taking anti-virals, which lower the likelihood that they're shedding the virus.  For a man having sex with an infected woman, the chances of contracting the virus can be as low as 1 or 2%.  Meanwhile, most people with herpes don't know they have it (because they've never had a symptom, and even if they get regularly tested for STDs, they've probably never been tested for herpes - the test is expensive and herpes isn't a dangerous disease like syphilis or gonorrhea, so it's not part of the standard STD test).  So they have safe sex with a condom, but they're not taking antivirals, so they have a higher risk of asymptomatically shedding the virus, which carries a 75% risk of transmitting the disease.  And their partner doesn't have an outbreak, tests clean on their next STD test, and passes it on to somebody else.\n\nDo you want herpes?  Of course you don't.  But you're absolutely going to contract illnesses throughout your life that are massively less desirable to actually have, and have an actual risk of killing you.  They just don't carry the stigma herpes does, because people think it means you've done something immoral or wrong.\n\nIf you start dating someone and they say they have herpes, all that means is that you have to take some precautions when having sex, and you'll probably be safe.

In terms of symptoms there is no difference between type 1 and type 2 genital herpes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people don&amp;#39;t talk about their herpes because of the stigma attached to it.  That and the fact that upwards of 80% of those with HSV 2 don&amp;#39;t ever have symptoms and hence do not know they have it.  The standard STI - test for everything test does not include HSV 1 or 2.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Physically herpes - in either form oral or genital - is not a huge issue for the vast majority of people that have it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "name": "t1_dganmgl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492292752.0, "created_utc": 1492263952.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w844", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gdp3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgavfvq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ikari_Shinji_kun_01", "parent_id": "t3_65gdp3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoStupidQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If I had herpes I wouldn't be talking about it... except to a doctor I guess.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I had herpes I wouldn&amp;#39;t be talking about it... except to a doctor I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "name": "t1_dgavfvq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492304378.0, "created_utc": 1492275578.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w844", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gdp3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd9tiu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "userniko", "parent_id": "t3_65gdp3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoStupidQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It actually isn't.
