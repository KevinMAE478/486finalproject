It's another term for the Republican party.  \n\nThere are three branches of government.  Executive, Judicial, Legislative.  Legislative passes laws.  They write bills, debate them, and vote on them, and these bills go to the president who signs them (often if they're not signed they don't pass).  It's comprised of the House of Representatives and Senate.  House of Representatives is huge and each state is proportionally represented.  That is, California has a ton of reps, Vermont has a few.  Senate has two senators for each state, which means there are 100 Senators total.\n\nThe purpose of both the house and senate isnt' really that different to mention, but a bill has to pass both houses to become a law.  The House and Senate are together known as Congress.\n\nThe judicial branch, obviously, is in charge of the court system.  Trials, appeals, etc.  The Supreme Court in particular determines if a law violates the Constitution.  If it does, the law is struck down. \n\nThe executive branch is pretty much the rest of the government.  They control parks, schools, welfare, military...pretty much everything.  The president is in charge of it.  \n\nThe united states is a *federal* system, which means that there's a big overreaching government (the federal government), and each state has its own government.  That's why you pay a federal tax, and a state tax.  Some things are controlled by states (such as giving out licenses), others aren't (like the military).  The structure of state governments is like a miniature version of the federal government.  A governor is the \"president\" of the state.  Each state has a supreme court.  They have a state congress with representatives from each town.  State police police the state, and the FBI is the *federal* equivalent of that (and town police are the bottom level, of course).  \n\nThere are two major political parties.  Republicans and Democrats.  Republicans are socially and economically conservative, democrats are socially liberal and more economically charitable.  Republicans TYPICALLY mostly value a less powerful government, better budget, and fight for traditional values, like against gay marriage.  They're usually more religiously inclined.  Democrats tend to focus more on inequality issues and generally want more government funding of social programs, and also tend to think that the rich need to be taxed more.

Other rights in the bill of rights include things that protect people arrested or convicted of something to make sure the proceedings are fair.  For example, police need a warrant to search a place, and they can't torture you in prison.  Stuff like that.\n\nThat's pretty much the bare minimum.
