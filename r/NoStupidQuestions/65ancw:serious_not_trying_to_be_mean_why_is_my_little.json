That said, in all the media I've seen Sonic the character seems to combine \"edgy and rebellious\" with \"good, wholesome person\", which hits all kinds of emotional developmental sweet spots for young children. People with mental illnesses of any kind tend to struggle with how they're perceived by others and with having a sense of freedom or independence, so it makes a certain amount of sense they might like Sonic because he represents the idealized young adulthood they think feel they've been cheated out of. From what I saw of the anime as a teenager, it's similar with the black hedgehog, only he's a bad guy and that appeals to people who feel marginalized for other reasons as well as the stereotypical \"teenage male angst\" thing. \n\nMLP, though? I was a huge fan as a child and, being in education, I quickly had the newest series recommended to me. And it's... great. It's a well-written show for its target audience that was designed to have some sophistication and consistency to appeal to the parents and teachers stuck watching it and the nostalgic viewers seeking it out. As an educator I end up watching a lot of kids' media, and I hate it when shows have adults act like children. The main MLP characters are all supposed to be sort of 18-22ish, and for most part they act like emotionally stunted versions of people that age rather than acting like children. It's a subtle difference, but it's one that makes the show for any adult who works with teenagers and children both. I'm pretty sure that aspect appeals to adults who are actually that have developmental and emotional impairments as well. The show also has strong female characters, a focus on female characters, and de-emphasized romance subplots, all of which which are kind of a treat in any media.

The two hedgehogs from the Sonic franchise represent an autonomy and dignity that people on the spectrum are rarely afforded, and the current MLP's setting is a feminist utopia where people with neurological conditions and mental illnesses are valued and respected the same as everyone else. My experience with kids is that all they really want is a little autonomy and a little dignity, and kids on the spectrum are especially prone to being denied those by well-meaning but confused parents and educators. It makes sense that they'd focus on media that deals with that struggle at a level that's appropriate to how they've developed rather than how old they are.\n\nTLDR: In addition to all the other things people are saying, the Sonic franchise specifically appeals to two childhood developmental conflicts that tend to drag out in people who have any kind of disability, and MLP specifically appeals to the desire of many disenfranchised groups for dignity and respect while being, in the case of the current series, a show written for a family rather than child audience.
