I realize that traffic is basically stopped, so I start braking. I look in my rear view mirror, because this guy behind me is pretty close already. I see that he&amp;#39;s not really paying attention. By the time I look back in front, I need to fully brake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I was not at a full and complete stop, but rather that 2-3 MPH speed when you let off the brakes but aren&amp;#39;t exactly accelerating either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy slams on his brakes, I hear the tires skid, I look in my mirror again and say to myself, &amp;quot;Self, this is happening&amp;quot; and I grip my wheel tightly, place my head against the headrest, push myself back in the seat so that all of the surface area of my back is cradled by the seat, and finally let my foot off the brakes entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dude hit me probably only going 15-20 MPH (since traffic was already slowing down) but it was enough of an impact to break the bumper on my brand new car. :(&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "name": "t1_dge195g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492488396.0, "created_utc": 1492459596.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w844", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wftb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge8jcm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kraks_", "parent_id": "t3_65wftb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoStupidQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Letting off the brakes saves your car as the impact energy is converted in forward acceleration.
