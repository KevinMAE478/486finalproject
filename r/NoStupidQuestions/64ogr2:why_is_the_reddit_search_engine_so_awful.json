That is their _core product_. It's not a valid complaint, in my mind, to say \"if google can do search right, why can't reddit\". reddit's core product is the \"hot\" listing; where votes and popularity generate a feed of (ideally) new and interesting content. (Whether or not they're fully succeeding in that respect is a discussion for a different thread).\n\nFor subreddit search:\n\nSo here's a fun fact: The page at https://www.reddit.com/subreddits has TWO search bars. Yup! Two! The lower, gray search bar does an exact name and description search. It's nigh useless, since most subreddits don't have \"public descriptions\" set that have enough words to make search meaningful, and the names are hard to make use of, since no effort was put into splitting subreddit names into multiple words.\n\nThe upper, blue bar is a bit better - you can type in \"out of the loop\" and one of the suggestions will, in fact, be /r/OutOfTheLoop. The blue bar works better because it searches all of reddit's _posts_ for the words/phrase entered, and finds subreddits with the most hits. It's pretty decent, actually, for discovering new subreddits.\n\nIn any case, yes, reddit probably could be better about subreddit search. But again, reddit's core product is not search. So when figuring out whether to put 2-3 engineers and designers and such onto building out subreddit search versus improving mobile experience, it's pretty clear what should be most important. Every scheduling decision is a tradeoff; as long as there's more value in non-search things, search will not be a huge priority. For the longest time, it has worked \"well enough\", and combined with using google to find the harder to find things, there are enough ways for users to get to what they need.\n\nNow, with that out of the way: Why doesn't reddit call out to google for search?\n\nThe number one reason is that google can't index posts in private subreddits. In the past, there perhaps was also a question of cost, and control over the results. That may or may not still be a concern. Google search also can't use the current user's context (subscriptions, etc.) to build better results (though reddit to my knowledge doesn't actually do this, when/if they put serious effort into search they likely would want to).\n\nAs for the recent failures, well, reddit has grown, and the backing search store probably needs to be grown. That of course, costs more money, so they've likely been balancing the cost of growing that with the minimal benefits that search provide.\n\nP.S. I worked on reddit's search once. It wasn't a high priority even then. Most of the work I did was migrating it off of a Search-as-a-service provider that was getting bought out, and onto a different backend (Amazon's CloudSearch, for the curious). It got marginally better, but search needs a lot of care and feeding to go well.
