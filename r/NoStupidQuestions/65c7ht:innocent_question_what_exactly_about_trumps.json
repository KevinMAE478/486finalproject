The two biggest could be:\n\n- If Russia and Trump colluded together in making him president, including committing criminal acts such as hacking, it would make Trump an agent of an enemy state.  That is treason and punishable by death.\n\n- If Russia provided any financial support to Trump, that would make him a paid agent of an enemy state.  That is treason which is punishable by death.   \n\nOf any allegations levied against Trump, Russia aiding Trump financially in his bid for president is the most likely.  this is because during his campaign Trump was caught soliciting campaign donations from members of several foreign governments.  He was outed by members of both British and Australian governments.  It is very much illegal just to ask for money from a foreign government, treason to actually accept it.  You would be, in effect, selling the presidency of the U.S. to another nation by acting as an agent on their behalf in return for the money they gave you.  Trump gave those who supported his campaign financially cabinet positions they are laughably unqualified to hold.  If a foreign government financially aided him as well you would have to assume they too would be getting something in return for the money they paid to make him president.\n\nThis is why all connections between a candidate and his campaign with foreign governments must be made known.  The big deal about Trump and Russia is that like 4 or 5 members of his campaign have already been shown to have lied about their connections with Russian officials.  People don't usually lie about something unless they have something to hide.  People logically assume that what they are hiding is illegal.  If not, why lie about any meetings with any Russian representative? Why would numerous people lie?", "edited": 1492230675.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;nobody really knows until the investigation is over.  The two biggest could be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Russia and Trump colluded together in making him president, including committing criminal acts such as hacking, it would make Trump an agent of an enemy state.  That is treason and punishable by death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Russia provided any financial support to Trump, that would make him a paid agent of an enemy state.  That is treason which is punishable by death.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of any allegations levied against Trump, Russia aiding Trump financially in his bid for president is the most likely.  this is because during his campaign Trump was caught soliciting campaign donations from members of several foreign governments.  He was outed by members of both British and Australian governments.  It is very much illegal just to ask for money from a foreign government, treason to actually accept it.  You would be, in effect, selling the presidency of the U.S. to another nation by acting as an agent on their behalf in return for the money they gave you.  Trump gave those who supported his campaign financially cabinet positions they are laughably unqualified to hold.  If a foreign government financially aided him as well you would have to assume they too would be getting something in return for the money they paid to make him president.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why all connections between a candidate and his campaign with foreign governments must be made known.  The big deal about Trump and Russia is that like 4 or 5 members of his campaign have already been shown to have lied about their connections with Russian officials.  People don&amp;#39;t usually lie about something unless they have something to hide.  People logically assume that what they are hiding is illegal.
