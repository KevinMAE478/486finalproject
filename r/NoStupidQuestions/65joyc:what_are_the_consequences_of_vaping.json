I quit a 30 year smoking habit with vaping where any previous method attempted ended in failure to quit!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My only suggestion would be to learn to mix your own eliquid as there is only 3 basic ingredients + your flavorings. It is much cheaper and you know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what is in your eliquid (VG [vegetable glycerin] - PG [poly glycol], food/candy flavorings [no oil based concentrates only PG based, research lipid pneumonia] &amp;amp; Nicotine [use caution when handling high concentrate nicotine can be dangerous, handle 48mg or less and use caution  gloves and eye protection when mixing and keep locked up and out of reach of children/pets]). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is something like a 500-10,000% markup on retail eliquid and it&amp;#39;s ridiculous. For the price of 4-5 retail 30mg bottles of eliquid, I can make about a gallon that would last me a year or more of heavy use in both tanks &amp;amp; drippers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "name": "t1_dgb9unr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492324077.0, "created_utc": 1492295277.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w844", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65joyc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbhkbc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Leesieloveswaffles", "parent_id": "t3_65joyc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoStupidQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The worse part is, \"vaping\" is a generally new idea, so they won't know long-term effects for a long time.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worse part is, &amp;quot;vaping&amp;quot; is a generally new idea, so they won&amp;#39;t know long-term effects for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "name": "t1_dgbhkbc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492335136.0, "created_utc": 1492306336.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w844", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65joyc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbiydp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rhodechill", "parent_id": "t3_65joyc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoStupidQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "weed vaping = still accumulation of some sticky stuff; greatly reduced.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;weed vaping = still accumulation of some sticky stuff; greatly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "name": "t1_dgbiydp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492337168.0, "created_utc": 1492308368.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w844", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65joyc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbvgn6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sonoalec", "parent_id": "t3_65joyc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoStupidQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It is better than smoking.
