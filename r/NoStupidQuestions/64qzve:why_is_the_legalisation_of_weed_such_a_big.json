Family members have to go live without their wives, husbands, children, friends go without friends; it affects many millions more than just those in prison. Simply because you possess a plant. Even with other drugs, jail is never the answer. Treatment is. It&amp;#39;s not all that complicated. Look at alcohol or tobacco. Those kill more people every year than any other drug. By far. We need to scrap all of the terrible drug-related laws we have, and start fresh. Legalize, but HEAVILY regulate, them. That way, you know exactly what you&amp;#39;re getting. There&amp;#39;s no cutting with cheaper, but far more potent, drugs -such as fentanyl - or whatever else might be added to increase volume, and thus, profits. It destroys the power of the cartels, which would reduce violence around the world, but particularly Mexico (since we&amp;#39;re taking about the US). That is what common sense reform looks like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "name": "t1_dg54ocz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491982981.0, "created_utc": 1491954181.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg53yjd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Butt-Factory", "parent_id": "t1_dg522y6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoStupidQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes,  millions", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes,  millions&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "name": "t1_dg53yjd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491982013.0, "created_utc": 1491953213.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg522y6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg4hhnr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoStupidQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "name": "t1_dg522y6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491979499.0, "created_utc": 1491950699.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4hhnr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 68, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Butt-Factory", "parent_id": "t3_64qzve", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoStupidQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The UK has more sensible laws and isn't throwing millions of people in jail or prison for marijuana possession.
