Did you stay at cheap hotels at all? When car camping what are some good places to catch some z's?\n\nAll of the above.  I'd hit a hotel about once every 10 days (generally on long travel days or after camping for too many days and when I needed a shower).  Airbnb is another cheap option if you're anywhere near a city/developed area. \n\nI did dispersed camping in the Petrified Forest NP, on BLM/NF land around Sedona, the grand canyon.  I stayed at backpacking sites in golden bluffs, canyon lands, bryce, and used regular dive-up campsites at most other parks.  Just be flexible.  The website [Roadtrippers](https://roadtrippers.com/) allows you to plan a route and look for campsites along the way so that was helpful.

If at zion get to the first come first serve site and get in line EARLY.  Like before 7am.  I got there at 8 or 9 the first day and it was too late.  Got there 5 am the next day and was still #2 in line. \n\n&gt; Did you go out to eat a lot or did you cook your own food on the go?   \n\nI tried to \"cook\" as much as I could to save money.  After hiking all day taste doesn't tend to matter lol.  I had a plastic bin in car with a lot of instant stuff (rice, couscous, instant noodles), cans of beans, canned fruit, jerky, and many many many cans of tuna - 2 cans of water packedtuna + 1 or 2 cans of oil packed tuna (all drained) mixed with some thousand island dressing is actually really good after hiking 15 miles. I had a multi-day cooler to keep perishables (ketchup, etc) and I'd just buy a new bag of ice every few days (if you are able to buy blocks of ice, DO IT! It was common in outdoorsy places like Sedona and Moab and it would last 2-3X longer than bags).  \n\nIf I was at a campground for a few days, I'd usually \"reward\" myself on the last night by going to the general store to buy real food and actually cooking on a fire - hot dogs, kielbasie, grilled corn-on-the-cob, grilled onion (I was craving fresh veggies and fruits), etc.  And then occasionally I'd go to a restaurant and get a Caesar salad (like I said I craved fresh food lol) and either a pizza or a big pasta dish.  And there were no leftovers.  I used a calculator to estimate on my toughest days I burned 5000-7000 calories (that sounds like a lot to me but I'm already a tall guy so it very well might be true). \n\n&gt; Did you go solo or did you have another person with you?  \n\nSolo for almost all of it -  a friend from school flew out and joined for bryce and zion.  I met up with a friend from school in Sedona.  And I randomly met another friend from school who was doing their own roadtrip at 5pm in the Canyonlands ranger station parking lot (go figure).  \n\nI actually enjoyed the solo aspect as it meant I could do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted. \n\n&gt; What's a good start time (regarding weather) after April?   \n\nDepends.  Arizona, NM, and Utah get HOT in May/June.  It was 109 in Zion one day, 95-105 when I was backpacking in Canyonlands.

Many many many hours.  But I didn't do it to decide the exact minute-to-minute plan.  I did it to know all my options and give me the flexibility to vary when I got to a park.
