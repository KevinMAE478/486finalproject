Translation from a great 1986 article about this\n\n&gt; Arturo \"Black\" Durazo and his story may not be as spectacular as that of Ferdinando Marcos, who stole in twenty years between five and ten billion dollars. But it's not bad: a billion dollars in just six years, between 1976 and 1982. Even Durazo has more merit, because Marcos was a whole head of state in the Philippines, while *Black* was only chief of police and Transit in Mexico City. He was appointed and maintained - throughout his six year term - by President Jose Lopez Portillo, who was his friend since childhood. Finished the presidential period, Durazo fled. But in June of 84' he was caught in Puerto Rico by the FBI, that wanted him for drug trafficking; And now, after twenty months of legal struggling, he has just been extradited to Mexico by a US federal court to be tried there for extortion and illegal collection of weapons. According to the prosecutor, he can be sentenced to 22 years in prison - wich would make him 90 year old when released. \n\n&gt; In addition to his position as chief of the Federal District Police, Negro Arturo Durazo held other titles, including that of brigadier general, by direct appointment of his friend the President, and several *Doctor Honoris Causa* degrees, granted by several universities or (oddly) By the Supreme Court of Justice. But his most profitable appointment was that of police chief. *El Negro* revenues were calculated at a monthly minimum of eight hundred million Mexican pesos before the devaluation. This astronomical sum came not from his salary, but from other sources: smuggling (through customs), drug and arms trafficking, women trafficking, commission on purchases of implements for the police (uniforms, Vehicles, fuel), and the biweekly and \"voluntary\" quota that each of the officers and agents of the institution paid him to remain in his position. All that was rounded off by the Negro with the full payroll of three thousand imaginary agents of the Police, who only existed on paper and for the boss to collect wages in his name.\n\n&gt; In addition to greed, or as compensation to his greed, Durazo was a thrifty man. None of his expenses, those of his wife or those of his numerous lovers, paid him of his salary. Everything was on account of the budget of the Police. Thus was constructed two lavish mansions on the outskirts of Mexico City. One of them, with its stables and its private racetrack, its shooting range, its disco point-of-point track of Studio 54 of New York, cost a quarter of a million dollars. On the other, called \"The Parthenon of Zihuatanejo\" because it was built in a style inspired by that of classical Greece, the Negro literally paid not a penny: the masons of the work were the police officers of the Federal District.\n\n&gt; Such ostentations were, however, nothing more than the visible part of Arturo Durazo's life. The rest, \"The Black part of Black Durazo\", is narrated in a book of that title that was published in Mexico in November of 1983 and became an instant bestseller: in the first month they were sold 225 thousand copies, and the rolls Successive already exceed 800 thousand, not counting the second parts nor the adaptations for comic strips. There everything is told - or almost everything, since the continuation was still lacking, titled \"What I did not say of the Negro and of others\" -; And almost everything that counts, from common murder to torture, through extortion, falls under the weight of the Penal Code.\n\n&gt; The author of the book is Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Gonz\u00e1lez, who was Durazo's bodyguard chief during his period as Police Director. Gonzalez lacks literary merit, but replaces them with brutal frankness. From the first lines he begins by declaring: \"I began to kill at 28 years of age, having in my conscience a cipher of more than 50 individuals dispatched to the next world ...\" In his conscience, but not in his police record, as Gonz\u00e1lez then thanks the various authorities who were responsible for keeping him clean since all his murders were on behalf of one or another of these authorities, beginning with Durazo and President Jose Lopez Portillo.\n\n&gt; The career of Negro Durazo, as portrayed in the book of his bodyguard Gonzalez, constitutes a true \"mirror of princes\" as those written in the Renaissance to illustrate the power of the powerful. And it is certainly much more exciting than those, as it is also more realistic and truthful than the famous but insipid \"Memories of Hadrian\" by Marguerite Yourcenar. It only lacks a happy ending, like the one that, according to all indications, expects Ferdinando Marcos with his ten billion dollars in Hawaii or to Nene Doc with his five hundred million (something is something) in the south of France. But it is still possible that the misfortune of Negro Durazo is only temporary. As stated by him when arriving to the Mexico City airport, under heavy guard:  \"My lawyers will have the last word, but i think i'm innocent\"\n\nBlack Durazo only spent 8 years in prision, and died of a Colon Cancer in August 2000.
