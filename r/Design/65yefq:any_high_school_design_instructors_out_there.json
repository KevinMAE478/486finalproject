Whats the day to day like. Did you use any external resources for your lessons/tutorials. How long did students spend time on one particular assignment/project. What kind of projects did you assign. Did you teach basic design fundamentals like shape, color, balance, hierarchy, composition, etc. If the class was digitally focused, did you also teach sketching, line-weight, shading, etc in order to give them tools for conceptual design?\nAlthough my course will be generally considered as part of a &amp;quot;Career in Technology&amp;quot; course, I have a good amount of freedom in the curriculum, and what tools/resources i can ask the school for.
