It fits the Batman corpus, and Snyder and Capullo don't waste a word or a frame. This book is powerful, even if its plot is not the typical firework display of the New 52.\n\nI think it's one of the more interesting and overlooked books in the run since it is so subdued. As much as I enjoyed the other arcs, the restrictive format of 22 pages and emphasis on action made some issues feel rushed. Snyder gives Volume 6 (and thus the readers) time to breathe.\n\nBatman sees so much death in the first 5 books that an earnest examination of his grief is refreshing. Where Volume 7 might be called the \"storm,\" Volume 6 is therefore the \"calm.\" I would argue that this contrast is *stylistically* necessary but not *narratively* necessary.\n\nPlus, it's not like nothing happens. This book has some pretty batshit moments, like a Clayface fight at Wayne Enterprises, and a serial killer with a mass grave, and the very first inmate of Arkham breaking out.\n\nUltimately, you won't \"miss\" anything except a damn good handful of stories. With one exception. A certain feature is introduced that pays off fucking incredibly in Volume 7.

It fits the Batman corpus, and Snyder and Capullo don&amp;#39;t waste a word or a frame. This book is powerful, even if its plot is not the typical firework display of the New 52.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s one of the more interesting and overlooked books in the run since it is so subdued. As much as I enjoyed the other arcs, the restrictive format of 22 pages and emphasis on action made some issues feel rushed.
