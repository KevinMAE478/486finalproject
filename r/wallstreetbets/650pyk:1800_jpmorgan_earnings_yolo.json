How do I know what strike price to enter in at that will safely stay outside the money after earnings?\"\n\nI'm glad you asked! You can calculate the expected move of the stock at earnings fairly simply. Take the front most(closest expiration date after earnings) straddle, and see what its price is. A short straddle is done by selling a put that's strike price is at the money, or the closest strike price to being exactly at the money, and then selling the call at the exact same price. Basically selling a call and a put at the money in the same trade.\n\nAnyways, so you take the mark price of this straddle and multiply by 0.68. This will give you a 68% probability expected range of movement after earnings.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, let's say AAPL is $100 a share, with earnings coming up next week. I want to make a trade on their earnings, but I'm neutral in the stock's direction, so I just want to cash in on the IV crush. \n\n1. I would look at a 1 year volatility chart to make sure the stock typically has a large IV crush following earnings. Some stocks crush a lot harder and more consistently than others, these are the guys we want to trade. \n\n2. I'm checking to make sure there is enough liquid(number of options being traded) in these options to allow me to instantly get in and out. Having to wait for these options to buy or sell, even by a few minutes, can fuck your profits in an earnings trade.\n\n3. Calculating my expected move range. So let's say the ATM call is $1.34 and the ATM put is $0.74, meaning the straddle has an overall cost of $2.08. Now we multiply 2.08 x 0.68 = $1.42.\nSo, our expected movement is +-$1.42 after earnings.\n\n4. We want to sell options **outside** of that range, to keep ourselves safe. We aren't worried about the direction of movement, this is literally only about the IV crush, so be safe, but also make sure the credit received is going to be worth your time and effort.\n\nStrategies to trade; Strangles, Straddles, or Iron Condors if you want to avoid the high capital requirements of the other 2 strategies.", "edited": 1492046837.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much immediately after earnings are priced in, the IV will tank.
