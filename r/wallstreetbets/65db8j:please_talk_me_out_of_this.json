You may end up picking half that then be pushed up against a wall if you want to buy back your calls if they go ITM and you want to keep the position. Covered call writing is no free lunch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me it sounds like your position is too big for your comfort level and that maybe you should sell some. If you still want some upside here is some options plays to maybe lock in some of the gains but right now selling an AMD call 280 days out ATM is only $1.80 which is laughably tiny. It makes me tempted to buy up a ton of those. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Assuming you have a good cost basis in your stock you could do this in the monthlies and pocket $12k a month if they expire with still gaining some upside if it breaks through the call.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/x7cNR9h.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/x7cNR9h.jpg&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wallstreetbets", "name": "t1_dg9okld", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492229664.0, "created_utc": 1492200864.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65db8j", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65db8j", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9usm8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MaximusDemus", "parent_id": "t1_dg9d5gh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You don't cover puts with long stock", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t cover puts with long stock&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wallstreetbets", "name": "t1_dg9usm8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492237507.0, "created_utc": 1492208707.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9d5gh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "not_so_happy_place", "parent_id": "t3_65db8j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "body": "When do you see yourself switching to puts?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When do you see yourself switching to puts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "wallstreetbets", "name": "t1_dg9d5gh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492216211.0, "created_utc": 1492187411.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65db8j", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65db8j", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65db8j", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9fjas", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "whitebananas", "parent_id": "t1_dg9ejgx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wallstreetbets", "controversiality": 0, "body": "opps, fixed it.
