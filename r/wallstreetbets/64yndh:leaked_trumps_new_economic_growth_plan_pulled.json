Your analogy is ALMOST perfect. But if you buy another currency with a bank loan, the most you can possibly lose is the original value of that loan.\n\nIf the dollar spikes in value, then you have to pay back a loan that is now far more expensive to pay back. So you lost more money than the \"original value\" because each dollar is now worth more than it used to be, just like when a stock goes up. \n\n&gt;You take out a loan of $100 to buy 100 Prussian Frank's. Prussia is gonna do great! Bad bet. Frank's are now worth zero. How much debt are you currently in? Your original loan amount + interest.\n\nExcept oops, the dollar just doubled in value, and now that $100 is going to cost you the equivalent of $200 to pay back relative to what you borrowed.\n\n&gt;You short the stock in the very beginning when it is at $1/share.Bad bet. The very next day, Tesla is worth $60 billion trillion per share, and you've got to buy back the stock you sold at some point\n\nThe dollar could do the exact same thing. \n\n&gt;The difference between taking out credit and shorting a stock is that there is an upper limit on how much you can lose when you take out credit. Shorting a stock means you're writing a blank check and saying \"boy I sure do hope this company doesn't experience any miracles any time soon.\"\n\nI think where you went wrong on all this, is that you have this built-in assumption that money can't appreciate. Of course it can. The changes in the value of the dollar have historically had a huge impact on farmers, who relied heavily on loans against future harvests. If the dollar tanked, the farmers were far better off, since their harvests sold for a lot more dollars, and they could pay off the loans more cheaply/easily. Conversely, if the value of the dollar rose significantly, farmers would get hosed, since their crops would bring in fewer dollars, but they still had to pay back those loans at full price. The damage from this was just as unlimited as shorting a stock.\n\nLet me put this another way:\n&gt;You take out a loan of $100 to buy 100 Prussian Frank's.\n\nYou take out a loan of 100 shares of stock US DOLLAR to sell. You spend it on hookers and booze.\n\n&gt;How much debt are you currently in? Your original loan amount + interest.\n\nHow much debt are you in?
