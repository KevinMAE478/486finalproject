Hannah's best friend Kat was dating him before she left, and when she did, she gave her permission to go out with him. Can't really blame here for wanting to pursue a crush.\n\n&gt;3. Douchebag jocks harass me 4. I hang out with them constantly, not my fault\n\nShe never hung out with douchebag jocks, other than the few parties she attended. They started harassing her after she was put on the list, and the other events started to unfold.\n\n&gt;5. Some guy tries to be nice to me,\n6. humiliate and berate him\n7. he steals my drawings not my fault\n\nCan you really blame her for not believing he was sincere though? I mean, he was best friends with a guy who tried to sexually assault her. \n\n&gt;8. Cute guy likes me\n9. Scream at him and tell him to leave\n10. he does, not my fault\n\nLiterally one of the only things I can agree with you on.\n\n&gt;11. witness friend get raped, I sit and do nothing\n\nWhat the fuck else was she supposed to do? If I were in her position and witnessing a rape, I probably wouldn't try to be a hero because I would be in shock. \n\n&gt;11 Then i proceed to go to said rapists party\n\nShe stumbled across it because she was upset with her parents. It's entirely possible she didn't know that was Bryce's house either.\n\n&gt;12. i strip down to almost nothing and get in his jacuzzi alone with him\n\nThis is where you are so wrong that I decided to reply to this post. Jessica and Zach were the ones who encouraged her to join them in the hot tub. After they left, Bryce was the one who brought himself in with her.\n\n&gt;13.
