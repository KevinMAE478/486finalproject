It&amp;#39;ll have been replaced by more trash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really have a problem with radio music in the way you would think though. A few years back, radio music was just that, radio music. People knew the music wasn&amp;#39;t really good but hell it was fun to listen to every now in then. Remember LMFAO? No one actually believed that it was quality music, but it was awesome to listen to at parties and stuff like that. The thing is, nowadays, people &lt;em&gt;actually believe&lt;/em&gt; that the trash that is on the radio is good. Trash artists take themselves so seriously. Which is a shame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Music is probably the only luxury that lets you pay &lt;em&gt;just as much&lt;/em&gt; for better quality content. A song by Kendrick costs the same as a song by one of those wannabe rappers, but hell, Kendrick&amp;#39;s verses are infinitely better. And this doesn&amp;#39;t just apply to rap, it applies to every genre. So why wouldn&amp;#39;t you take an hour on YouTube to find about better artists that get less exposure because they&amp;#39;re not part of the cycle of radio music, and pay just as much for better content?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yes, I agree that taste in music is completely subjective, but there is some music that is &lt;em&gt;objectively&lt;/em&gt; better in it&amp;#39;s lyrical/melodic quality, and this is the music that people will remember in 10 years, unlike shitty rappers like Future or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "teenagers", "name": "t1_dg61bpx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492040347.0, "created_utc": 1492011547.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg60nrf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 17, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tisadi", "parent_id": "t1_dg5yf7l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/teenagers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Music is subjective maybe?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music is subjective maybe?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "teenagers", "name": "t1_dg60nrf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492039617.0, "created_utc": 1492010817.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5yf7l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DrizzlyShrimp36", "parent_id": "t1_dg5snh9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/teenagers", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Absolutely agree.
