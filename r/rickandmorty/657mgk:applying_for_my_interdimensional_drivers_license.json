Just because we follow C-137 Rick and Morty in the show most often, many watchers assume we are in that dimension as well. I like to imagine that since Rick and Morty have traveled to the Simpsons universe that they can travel to our universe. Just as Homer did in the episode [Treehouse of Horror VI.](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VI) In the segment Homer^3 we see Homer in the real world. \n\nI would like to see a scene where Rick and Morty are running from danger, portaling from one dimension to another. Rick's portal gun stuck on automatic mode we watch them go into our dimension.  But, our dimension at a certain time. When you ask? Well the 90's of course. Starting in 1994, we see them flying out of a portal onto a highway, thinking they have escaped the Galactic Government. Only to see they are now being chased by a horde of police cars. The camera pans forward to show they are right behind a white Ford Bronco. This is the actual target of the police not our favorite alcoholic and his grandson. (OJ Simpson)\n\nNext, they portal into Sherman Oaks, CA during 1995 and fly by an Erotic Cake shop as Homer Simpson is looking into the window. Then they narrowly escape their pursuers and flee into another portal. \n\nThis portal takes them one year into the future to 1996, here we see them dodging the dangerous shots from Tammy riding on the back of Phoenix Person with Tammy's  Gromflomite soldiers trailing shortly behind them. Some of the Gromflomite's shots barely miss Rick's ship and repeatedly hit a man wearing a bandana at a stop light. He was standing out of his car's sunroof talking to two girls in the next car. Now he is dead. (Tupac) \n\nThough the next portal, they arrive in 1997 on a TV set. A rubber puppet dog looks up at them and insultingly yells \"Who is this \u00fcber-dork?\" Rick leans out of his window, aggressively holding up his middle finger, shouting back, \"Peace among worlds mother-fucker!\" He follows this up [looking at the show's host] with, \"Get some better characters you ginger bitch!\" (Triumph the Insult Comic Dog on Conan O'Brien)\n\nStill in 1997 the ship exits a portal and scrapes the top of a street sign. This sends them barreling towards the ground. They smash into the last of four children waiting at a bus stop, killing him. A small jewish boy then yells \"Oh my god! They killed Kenny!\" The child by his side following this up with \"You Bastards!\" Rick reaches out to the fattest child of the group and grabs the snack out his hands. The fat child yells out \"Mom!\" orange morsels flying from his mouth as the ship flies away into another portal. A grey character leans out from behind a tree in background. With a confused look on its face, it thinks to itself one word, \"Rick?.\" \n\nNow at this point traveling in the void between portals the forces behind them are gathering together and closing the gap. The different groups made up of several factions that formerly made up the Galactic Government with many others hot on their heels; Tammy atop Phoenix Person and crew, an entire Gromflomite kill squad. To the left we see cross eyed Plutonians. Behind them Garblovians, grinding together their interlocking teeth. But the most dangerous trailing on the right, just outside Morty's window are the treacherous whizzing and whirling, knife wielding Wacky waving inflatable arm-flailing tube men. Having traveled from 2005 and not really fitting into the time scheme, they are filled with red hot rage and air, ready to deal out wacky arm-flailing death.\n\nJust then Rick realizes where this next portal will take them. \n\nThey cross the green event horizon of the portal, entering a world of blues skies and large fries. Behind them an army marches, ahead of them golden arches. Even as the villains cross the portals border, Rick is preparing to order. Closing in is a murderous crew, Rick is thinking dine-in or drive-thru. Who cares about RPGs, all Rick needs is some of that delicious MSG. He knows he should floor it and get a move on, But he needs the sauce inspired by Mulan. If not for the ferocious foes following behind coming out of the galactic gate, all would be great, for they have arrived in 1998.\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do as well.
