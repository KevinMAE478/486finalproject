I distinctly remember getting out of the Army in 2006, going to a McDonald&amp;#39;s and asking for szechuan sauce, and being disappointed not only because they didn&amp;#39;t have it, but because they didn&amp;#39;t even know what the fuck I was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around December my GF and I went and got some Nuggets and I went off about how the only two &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; sauces McDonald&amp;#39;s has had that weren&amp;#39;t completely fucking terrible are their hot mustard and the szechuan (&amp;quot;original&amp;quot; because it&amp;#39;s kind of hard to fuck up basic ranch and honey).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That guy&amp;#39;s copycat recipe is a pretty decent approximation.  Comes out spicier than I remember the original, but in a good way.  Hell, it&amp;#39;s probably better than whatever McDonald&amp;#39;s comes up with if they decide to pander to the memery and churn out something now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "rickandmorty", "name": "t1_dg80l9i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492138006.0, "created_utc": 1492109206.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u4lp", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655a2a", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg894iq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sephrinx", "parent_id": "t1_dg7nqal", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rickandmorty", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I never knew it even existed.
