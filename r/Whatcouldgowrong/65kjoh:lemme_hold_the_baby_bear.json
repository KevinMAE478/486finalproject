This happened at my school Washington university in St. Louis. I actually know the girl in the back\n\n&gt;Story: A student group brought a petting zoo on campus during finals as a destresser. The zoo brought a baby bear. The bear ended up biting over 10 people including some people I know. There was then this huge rabies scare on campus and they almos killed the bear to biopsy it's brain and test it but everything turned out ok and the bear now lives in the St. Louis zoo!\n\n---\n\n\nNews Article about this incident and the bear:\n\nhttp://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/boo-boo-s-strange-journey-how-a-baby-black-bear/article_2b20a064-946b-5780-acce-cb5507b9da07.html\n\n&gt;ST. LOUIS \u2022 The little black bear wasn\u2019t always named Boo Boo.\n\n&gt;He started life as Rudy. Yes, as in that Rudy, the famously undersized college football player who fought to get into a game at the University of Notre Dame.\n\n&gt;The cub got the name early, in his first few days of life \u2014 before his owners sold him at auction, before a local petting zoo hauled him to Washington University. And before he chewed on 18 college students, causing a weeklong rabies scare on campus.\n\n&gt;Because, in those touch-and-go hours, Rudy wasn\u2019t doing well.\n\n&gt;\u201cHe was the runt of the litter,\u201d said Sondra Morgan, who raised him. \u201cHe was such a little fighter.\u201d The veterinarian gave him a 10 percent chance of survival.\n\n&gt;Rudy was born Jan. 27. He was one of three male cubs sired by the black bear Victor and birthed by Victor\u2019s paramour, Victoria, at a drive-through wild animal park a few miles east of Springfield, Mo., where Morgan is general manager.\n\n&gt;Three months later, the 10-pound cub was being passed between Washington U. undergrads at an on-campus petting zoo event, organized by a student housing association to help relieve exam-season stress.\n\n&gt;And by the following Wednesday, state and county health officials had declared that Rudy would have to die. His nibbles could have spread rabies, and the only way to know was to sample his brain matter.\n\n&gt;\u201cIt was devastating to all of us \u2014 that somebody could be so ignorant as to buy a bear and put it in a petting zoo,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cAll he wants to do is play with you. But he\u2019s a bear! He\u2019s got the jaw power of an alligator.\u201d\n\n&gt;For the last two weeks, state and county officials have been working to piece together the strange voyage of Rudy the baby black bear.\n\n&gt;They\u2019re not done. State officials say there are parts they haven\u2019t nailed down.\n\n&gt;Other stretches of his journey, however, are now coming out. Rudy was nursed to health by Morgan and her staff, in large part at Morgan\u2019s own home. He was trucked to an exotic animal auction house more than 200 miles north. His buyer, who didn\u2019t have the right permits, passed Rudy to local petting zoo owner Cindy Farmer. Farmer brought him to Washington U.\n\n&gt;For Rudy, the story seems to have a happy ending. The state moved him to the St. Louis Zoo, where he got a thorough checkup, eats five squares a day and awaits word on a future home.\n\n&gt;But Rudy\u2019s travels also shed light on things a bit less comfortable: the subculture of exotic animal collectors; the legal (and illegal) trade for wild animals; and the near-universal appeal \u2014 despite all good sense \u2014 of a fuzzy baby bear.\n\n&gt;RUNT OF THE LITTER\n\n&gt;Rudy\u2019s first breaths came in a concrete cave at Wild Animal Safari, just off Interstate 44 in Strafford, Mo.\n\n&gt;Raising bears in captivity is tough. Newborns need the colostrum, that first few days of breast milk, packed with nutrients and antibodies. But if left with their mothers too long, they risk getting rolled over, stepped on or neglected.\n\n&gt;And Rudy was tiny \u2014 just about 6 ounces. His brother Boscow was nearly 8 ounces; Opi, almost 9.\n\n&gt;Rudy went home with Morgan every night. She woke every two hours to feed him another bottle. And when his health crashed, she helped get him on an IV.\n\n&gt;And then Rudy recovered. He opened his eyes before his brothers. He started walking first.\n\n&gt;Morgan\u2019s 6-year-old daughter, Eloise, started calling him Rudy.\n\n&gt;Morgan and her staff wanted to keep all three. But Wild Animal Safari has 700 animals \u2014 including four bears. And company executives at Parks! America, the publicly traded theme-park company based in Georgia, didn\u2019t think their Strafford location needed more bears.\n\n&gt;One mid-April morning, Morgan put Opi, Boscow and Rudy on leashes, walked them to her truck and drove them three hours north to Lolli Brothers Livestock Market in Macon, Mo.\n\n&gt;$500 APIECE\n\n&gt;Lolli Brothers are auctioneers of cattle, tack, taxidermy, guns \u2014 plus primates and fennec foxes, hedgehogs and wild cats, camels, zebras and, of course, bears.\n\n&gt;Delcianna Winders, an attorney at the animal rights organization PETA, called Lolli \u201cone of the most notorious exotic animal auctions left in the country.\u201d\n\n&gt;Morgan says the business is \u201csquared away\u201d with regulators. But that doesn\u2019t mean she wanted to be there.\n\n&gt;\u201cI was really hoping I\u2019d come back with three bears,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell my boss.\u201d\n\n&gt;Shortly after 5 p.m., she carried each, one-by-one, into the auction house, past the auctioneer and in front of the crowd.\n\n&gt;But before she took Rudy, she stopped \u2014 a moment now memorialized on her Facebook feed \u2014 picked him up, leaned her forehead into his, and kissed him.\n\n&gt;The bears sold for about $500 apiece, she said, to three separate private buyers, for, as of yet, unknown purposes.\n\n&gt;That\u2019s where Rudy\u2019s story gets fuzzy.\n\n&gt;Officials at the Missouri Department of Conservation now think Rudy\u2019s buyer didn\u2019t have his paperwork in order. Somehow, he contacted Cindy\u2019s Zoo, the local petting zoo, and asked Farmer, the owner, to hold his bear for him.\n\n&gt;Farmer, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment, didn\u2019t have the correct permits either, state officials say.\n\n&gt;Private residents can own black bears. Owners must pass a yearly permit test. They have to build a double-fenced enclosure, of at least 150 square feet, with walls at least 8 feet high with a roof, or 12 feet tall without. And the test must be passed, cage inspected, before the bear arrives, said state Conservation Deputy Director Tim Ripperger.\n\n&gt;Farmer didn\u2019t have that, officials say.\n\n&gt;Moreover, said Ripperger, owners can\u2019t take a bear out of its cage for public handling. Ever.\n\n&gt;BREAKING SKIN\n\n&gt;Kaity Cullen saw the petting zoo crowd at Washington U. from afar. A few students were petting goats. One or two, maybe, stood by the miniature horse.\n\n&gt;\u201cAnd then just a horde,\u201d said Cullen, a sophomore from Chapel Hill, N.C. About 20 students began passing the bear around.\n\n&gt;Rudy was teething, Cullen said, and nibbled on fingers. Sometimes, she could tell he got frustrated. He\u2019d twist, try to get away, but someone would catch the leash looped around his midsection.\n\n&gt;It nagged at Cullen some. Why, she wondered, bring a bear to a petting zoo?\n\n&gt;But she couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cThe bear was really damn cute,\u201d Cullen said.\n\n&gt;And then, as she was passing Rudy to the next student, the cub bit her hand.\n\n&gt;She barely noticed the bite, but it broke the skin. \u201cA paper cut would have been more painful,\u201d she said.\n\n&gt;Three days later, her roommate told her about the rabies scare.\n\n&gt;Within hours, it was all over Facebook. Thursday morning, Cullen got a call from the university.

Even the U.S. Department of Agriculture got involved.\n\n&gt;And, before long, officials put the pieces together. Rudy wasn\u2019t wild. He\u2019d never left the care of those who raised him. He\u2019d never been exposed to rabies.\n\n&gt;Scott Corley, of the state conservation department, kept Rudy for a few days before the bear went to the St. Louis Zoo.\n\n&gt;Corley has dealt with wolf hybrids, orphaned deer and even a bobcat. But this was a first.\n\n&gt;And you can hear the conflict in his voice when he talks about it. Corley bottle-fed Rudy every five hours. It was neat.\n\n&gt;\u201cAt the same time, I wish it never would have happened,\u201d he said.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe\u2019ll dig in a little deeper now,\u201d he continued, \u201cto see what happened and how it happened.\u201d\n\n&gt;And, if they can prove there was something wrong in Rudy\u2019s journey, they\u2019ll ask authorities to file charges.\n\n------\n\n^(Beep boop these actions were performed automatically.)\n\n [Click here](http://i.imgur.com/6PlRXhI.gif?noredirect) to learn more about the process.", "edited": 1492291789.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branching off the top comment to provide context.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a picture of &lt;a href=\"/u/sshibab\"&gt;/u/sshibab&lt;/a&gt; from 2 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/gPHI1AT.jpg\"&gt;Another picture from the same day with the bear.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Context provided in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/26w6nl/play_with_the_baby_bears_they_said_it_will_fun/\"&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt; from 2014 found &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/26w6nl/play_with_the_baby_bears_they_said_it_will_fun/chv6pbl/\"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/padthai93\"&gt;/u/padthai93&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey guys. This happened at my school Washington university in St. Louis. I actually know the girl in the back&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Story: A student group brought a petting zoo on campus during finals as a destresser. The zoo brought a baby bear. The bear ended up biting over 10 people including some people I know. There was then this huge rabies scare on campus and they almos killed the bear to biopsy it&amp;#39;s brain and test it but everything turned out ok and the bear now lives in the St. Louis zoo!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;News Article about this incident and the bear:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/boo-boo-s-strange-journey-how-a-baby-black-bear/article_2b20a064-946b-5780-acce-cb5507b9da07.html\"&gt;http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/boo-boo-s-strange-journey-how-a-baby-black-bear/article_2b20a064-946b-5780-acce-cb5507b9da07.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS \u2022 The little black bear wasn\u2019t always named Boo Boo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He started life as Rudy. Yes, as in that Rudy, the famously undersized college football player who fought to get into a game at the University of Notre Dame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cub got the name early, in his first few days of life \u2014 before his owners sold him at auction, before a local petting zoo hauled him to Washington University. And before he chewed on 18 college students, causing a weeklong rabies scare on campus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because, in those touch-and-go hours, Rudy wasn\u2019t doing well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe was the runt of the litter,\u201d said Sondra Morgan, who raised him. \u201cHe was such a little fighter.\u201d The veterinarian gave him a 10 percent chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rudy was born Jan. 27. He was one of three male cubs sired by the black bear Victor and birthed by Victor\u2019s paramour, Victoria, at a drive-through wild animal park a few miles east of Springfield, Mo., where Morgan is general manager.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three months later, the 10-pound cub was being passed between Washington U. undergrads at an on-campus petting zoo event, organized by a student housing association to help relieve exam-season stress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And by the following Wednesday, state and county health officials had declared that Rudy would have to die. His nibbles could have spread rabies, and the only way to know was to sample his brain matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was devastating to all of us \u2014 that somebody could be so ignorant as to buy a bear and put it in a petting zoo,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cAll he wants to do is play with you. But he\u2019s a bear! He\u2019s got the jaw power of an alligator.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the last two weeks, state and county officials have been working to piece together the strange voyage of Rudy the baby black bear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They\u2019re not done. State officials say there are parts they haven\u2019t nailed down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other stretches of his journey, however, are now coming out. Rudy was nursed to health by Morgan and her staff, in large part at Morgan\u2019s own home. He was trucked to an exotic animal auction house more than 200 miles north. His buyer, who didn\u2019t have the right permits, passed Rudy to local petting zoo owner Cindy Farmer. Farmer brought him to Washington U.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Rudy, the story seems to have a happy ending. The state moved him to the St. Louis Zoo, where he got a thorough checkup, eats five squares a day and awaits word on a future home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Rudy\u2019s travels also shed light on things a bit less comfortable: the subculture of exotic animal collectors; the legal (and illegal) trade for wild animals; and the near-universal appeal \u2014 despite all good sense \u2014 of a fuzzy baby bear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RUNT OF THE LITTER&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rudy\u2019s first breaths came in a concrete cave at Wild Animal Safari, just off Interstate 44 in Strafford, Mo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Raising bears in captivity is tough. Newborns need the colostrum, that first few days of breast milk, packed with nutrients and antibodies. But if left with their mothers too long, they risk getting rolled over, stepped on or neglected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Rudy was tiny \u2014 just about 6 ounces. His brother Boscow was nearly 8 ounces; Opi, almost 9.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rudy went home with Morgan every night. She woke every two hours to feed him another bottle. And when his health crashed, she helped get him on an IV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then Rudy recovered. He opened his eyes before his brothers. He started walking first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morgan\u2019s 6-year-old daughter, Eloise, started calling him Rudy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morgan and her staff wanted to keep all three. But Wild Animal Safari has 700 animals \u2014 including four bears. And company executives at Parks! America, the publicly traded theme-park company based in Georgia, didn\u2019t think their Strafford location needed more bears.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One mid-April morning, Morgan put Opi, Boscow and Rudy on leashes, walked them to her truck and drove them three hours north to Lolli Brothers Livestock Market in Macon, Mo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$500 APIECE&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lolli Brothers are auctioneers of cattle, tack, taxidermy, guns \u2014 plus primates and fennec foxes, hedgehogs and wild cats, camels, zebras and, of course, bears.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Delcianna Winders, an attorney at the animal rights organization PETA, called Lolli \u201cone of the most notorious exotic animal auctions left in the country.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morgan says the business is \u201csquared away\u201d with regulators. But that doesn\u2019t mean she wanted to be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI was really hoping I\u2019d come back with three bears,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell my boss.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shortly after 5 p.m., she carried each, one-by-one, into the auction house, past the auctioneer and in front of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before she took Rudy, she stopped \u2014 a moment now memorialized on her Facebook feed \u2014 picked him up, leaned her forehead into his, and kissed him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bears sold for about $500 apiece, she said, to three separate private buyers, for, as of yet, unknown purposes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s where Rudy\u2019s story gets fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Officials at the Missouri Department of Conservation now think Rudy\u2019s buyer didn\u2019t have his paperwork in order. Somehow, he contacted Cindy\u2019s Zoo, the local petting zoo, and asked Farmer, the owner, to hold his bear for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Farmer, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment, didn\u2019t have the correct permits either, state officials say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Private residents can own black bears. Owners must pass a yearly permit test. They have to build a double-fenced enclosure, of at least 150 square feet, with walls at least 8 feet high with a roof, or 12 feet tall without. And the test must be passed, cage inspected, before the bear arrives, said state Conservation Deputy Director Tim Ripperger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Farmer didn\u2019t have that, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, said Ripperger, owners can\u2019t take a bear out of its cage for public handling. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BREAKING SKIN&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kaity Cullen saw the petting zoo crowd at Washington U. from afar. A few students were petting goats. One or two, maybe, stood by the miniature horse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd then just a horde,\u201d said Cullen, a sophomore from Chapel Hill, N.C. About 20 students began passing the bear around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rudy was teething, Cullen said, and nibbled on fingers. Sometimes, she could tell he got frustrated. He\u2019d twist, try to get away, but someone would catch the leash looped around his midsection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It nagged at Cullen some. Why, she wondered, bring a bear to a petting zoo?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cThe bear was really damn cute,\u201d Cullen said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, as she was passing Rudy to the next student, the cub bit her hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She barely noticed the bite, but it broke the skin. \u201cA paper cut would have been more painful,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three days later, her roommate told her about the rabies scare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within hours, it was all over Facebook. Thursday morning, Cullen got a call from the university. Rudy would be put down, and tested for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the campus react to an issue the way they reacted when they heard that Boo Boo was going to be put to sleep,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DIGGING DEEPER&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The saga wrapped up in two tense days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Farmer, who was initially combative, officials said, gave the bear up to the county.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The state sent agents all over looking for clues as to Rudy\u2019s roots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morgan, from her zoo in Strafford, saw news accounts of the ordeal, recognized Rudy, and started making calls herself.

Anyone can learn how to use bath salts \u2013 and there are several ways to use them. Bath salts aren\u2019t just for bathing; you can use bath salts as scrubs, cleansers, and more.\n\nWhen you use bath salts, the first step is to find the bath salt that\u2019s right for you. You have to be careful to use bath salts that are of the highest quality possible; in their pure form, bath salts contain many beneficial minerals that can be lost if the salt is overly processed. Be sure to use 100% natural bath salts that are made from real sea salt.\n\nBath salts come in many different colors, sizes, and textures. Colors are thought to have an effect on mood, so be sure to use bath salts in colors that match your mood \u2013 or what you\u2019d like your mood to be. For instance, you can use blue bath salts if you feel anxious (blue is very soothing), and can use red, orange, or yellow bath salts if you feel sluggish (warm colors are energizing). The color of the bath salt will change the color of the water in your tub, and they look beautiful in jars and vases, too. Size and texture varies between different bath salts as well; when you use large-grain bath salts, you\u2019ll notice they not only look beautiful in the bath, but take a bit longer to dissolve. You can use smaller-grain bath salts as scrubs for exfoliation.\n\nBath salts also come in a variety of scents and fragrances, and are often infused with herbs and essential oils. You can use bath salts that are scented, or you can use plain, unscented bath salts.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to use bath salts. For a bath, fill the tub about halfway to the desired level. Take a handful of bath salts and pour them into the bath by holding your hand under the faucet, allowing the bath salts to fall with the water into the tub. While pouring the bath salts into the bath, their fragrance will be released into the steam, allowing for a very fragrant bath.  Depending on their size, bath salts will dissolve quickly once in contact with hot water. Once you have poured one to two handfuls of bath salts into your bath, you\u2019re ready to relax!  Be sure to stir the bath salts into the water and circulate them well, so the fragrances are released into the steam.\n\nIf you would like to use bath salts for exfoliation, simply take a small handful of fine-grain bath salts and add a tiny bit of water. Work the mixture into a paste and smooth it over your skin. You\u2019ll be softer and smoother than you ever imagined!\n\nNow that you know how to use bath salts, you can enjoy all the benefits of bathing.
