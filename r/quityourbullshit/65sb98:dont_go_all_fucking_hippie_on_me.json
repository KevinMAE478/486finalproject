The resurrection of Jesus is a critical doctrine of the Christian faith stating definitively that Jesus conquered death and the grave and proved to be the world\u2019s Savior from sin and death. \u201cWhoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life\u201d (John 3:16).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "quityourbullshit", "name": "t1_dgdey2t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492460703.0, "created_utc": 1492431903.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd9dfk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "palmund", "parent_id": "t1_dgd6b1k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/quityourbullshit", "controversiality": 1, "body": "How good of you to end the quote just before the good part. \nHere is the rest:\n\nAs Ishtar was actually pronounced \u201cEaster\u201d in most Semitic dialects, it could be said that the event portrayed here is, in a sense, Easter. **Of course, the occasion could easily have been a Phrygian family honoring Attis and Cybele, or perhaps a Phoenician family worshipping Adonis and Astarte.
