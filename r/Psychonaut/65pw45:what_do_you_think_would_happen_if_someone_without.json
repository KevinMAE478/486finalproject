From my understanding of buddhist meditation, an awareness or knowing arises with a sensory input and so it would be impossible to have an awareness independent of a sensation.

Similarly if there is no sensation from your case in point, then i do not think an awareness would be there as it only arises in combination with something to experience.\n\nIf you pay attention to something long enough or take LSD, then your ability to pick up more sensations will sharpen and then your experience suddenly contains far more information (Hyper Awareness) The breath for example after awhile will become a stream of hundreds of little sensations passing through the nostril, into the throat, lungs and body. Many many tingley pin point sensations. These are only available because the mind was focussed on one area of attention. They were always there, but the mind never bothered to look. The point i'm making is that it is only your attention that creates the reality you inhabit and another name for attention is NOTICING. When there was an attention on the breath, there was a noticing of every single little sensation that happened. tingle/notice tingle/notice tingle/notice very very fast which made up the experience of that present moment.
