I was playing my guitar, enjoying the feeling. Then I broke. My mind fractured into two separate realities. In one, I was in my room, trying not to slip into the other reality. The other reality was somewhere I had been before, on a previous large does mushroom trip. It was somewhere I did not want to go, it was somewhere horrifying. But I had no way out. I went there again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was broken glass around me, I felt as if I was in a car accident. I was laying on the side of the road. My face smashed, my jaw destroyed, my teeth broken. I felt blood flowing from my mouth. I was dying. A couple of cops/paramedics were talking over me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How many?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;just two, we think the driver was on something&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew I was in my room, but I also knew that I was lying on the side of the road, dying. I felt myself being loaded up in a bodybag. At which point I think I died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything felt awkward. I met &amp;quot;beings, who my mind percieved as human, who awkwardly told me that this was it, I was dead. They began to work on my brain is if it was a vehicle in an auto shop. I felt like I was being raped. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly a feeling came over me. I returned to the reality in my bedroom. I felt powerful. I hopped out of my bed, I had become a god. I felt my body, I had muscles everywhere, I was the perfectly sculpted human being. Made up of all of the good evolutionary traits that human have had throughout time. I had made it. I was transcending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only was I transcending, the whole human race was transcending. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was shown how everything worked. I was shown how we are all one being. The enitre universe is one consciousness. It is all of us. And I had transcended into everything in the universe in human form. I was in my room pacing. In that moment I had defeated satan, and I was to finally take my throne as god, the almighty. A representation of our universe in human form. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of my pain and suffering from my human life was over. I didn&amp;#39;t have to worry about my family anymore, they were all experiencing the same thing that I was in that moment. Human suffering was over. We were transcending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would look in the mirror and see my real shitty self, but In my mind I knew that was only because my physical body still had to die, before I can my knew form as god. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is so much more I can&amp;#39;t put into words &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I come to and realize I&amp;#39;m still in the same shitty life that I was before. But I&amp;#39;ve been shown how everything works. How we are all one soul, experiencing life through different physical means. At the end of what we see as &amp;quot;time&amp;quot;, we will be brought back together. As the universe decays, as everything in it does does, we will return to being a single entity of space and time. We will be god.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That trip really fucked me up. In multiple ways. I don&amp;#39;t think I can every do psychedelics again. It just seems to go bad now. Although, I really do feel like I have an understanding of how the universe works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "My Lsd trip was going great.
