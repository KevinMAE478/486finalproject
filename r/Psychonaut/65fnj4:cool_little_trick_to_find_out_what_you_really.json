I don't want to define myself by how many chicks I can bang or how hot of a girl etc. I love women, and sex is awesome, but I feel like it's a lot more awesome when I'm not plotting how to get laid and instead just enjoying life and getting laid.\n\nI think the reason many find it so appealing is because we think sex is the most satisfying thing there is. Tbh it can be but in my experience only when I truly care for the person I'm pleasuring and deriving pleasure from. \n\nIf you weren't expecting such a long answer what can I say this is actually a topic that really fascinates me. \"To game or not to game.\" To me sex is not the highest goal, love is. Love in all its forms. Love of yourself, love of what you're doing, love of others, love of biting into a juicy orange, love of sex! So to me I don't love being \"gamey\" but hey if someone else does that's cool. I think a lot of guys, myself included, are tempted by this idea of pick up psychology because it promises to get us laid more, and we think we want that. And probably we do. But more importantly than getting laid is being satisfied overall, and I wouldn't be satisfied overall if I was constantly micromanaging social situations to my sexual advantage, or even just social advantage in general. It feels like it would get in the way of where I'm going. Like it's just a big distraction keeping me from truly expressing myself, who I am, and what I want to be really doing.\n\nEdit: and if this was a joke then epic woosh \n\nEdit 2: oh oh! I know what it is that makes it so tempting. It's the idea that people who use pick up strats will be better at getting laid than you. That's why it's so tempting. It a straight up prisoners dilemma. If you don't do it and another guy does, then you lose and he wins. Even now writing this I'm like, hmm... Maybe I should... But no. Think about it you're this awesome fucking unique individual with a badass personality unlike anyone else. Being yourself is so innately satisfying. Feeling able to be comfortable being who you truly are. Then you get laid by girls who actually like you. Good lord. What a life that is.", "edited": 1492219138.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haha no, just looked up what that is. I&amp;#39;m not into the whole pick up scene. I don&amp;#39;t want to define myself by how many chicks I can bang or how hot of a girl etc. I love women, and sex is awesome, but I feel like it&amp;#39;s a lot more awesome when I&amp;#39;m not plotting how to get laid and instead just enjoying life and getting laid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the reason many find it so appealing is because we think sex is the most satisfying thing there is. Tbh it can be but in my experience only when I truly care for the person I&amp;#39;m pleasuring and deriving pleasure from. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you weren&amp;#39;t expecting such a long answer what can I say this is actually a topic that really fascinates me. &amp;quot;To game or not to game.&amp;quot; To me sex is not the highest goal, love is. Love in all its forms. Love of yourself, love of what you&amp;#39;re doing, love of others, love of biting into a juicy orange, love of sex! So to me I don&amp;#39;t love being &amp;quot;gamey&amp;quot; but hey if someone else does that&amp;#39;s cool. I think a lot of guys, myself included, are tempted by this idea of pick up psychology because it promises to get us laid more, and we think we want that. And probably we do. But more importantly than getting laid is being satisfied overall, and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be satisfied overall if I was constantly micromanaging social situations to my sexual advantage, or even just social advantage in general. It feels like it would get in the way of where I&amp;#39;m going. Like it&amp;#39;s just a big distraction keeping me from truly expressing myself, who I am, and what I want to be really doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: and if this was a joke then epic woosh &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: oh oh! I know what it is that makes it so tempting. It&amp;#39;s the idea that people who use pick up strats will be better at getting laid than you. That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so tempting. It a straight up prisoners dilemma. If you don&amp;#39;t do it and another guy does, then you lose and he wins. Even now writing this I&amp;#39;m like, hmm... Maybe I should... But no. Think about it you&amp;#39;re this awesome fucking unique individual with a badass personality unlike anyone else. Being yourself is so innately satisfying. Feeling able to be comfortable being who you truly are. Then you get laid by girls who actually like you. Good lord.
