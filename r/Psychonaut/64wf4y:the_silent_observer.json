But, because it is so immersed within the manifestation it popped into, it immediately will identify with the manifestation, and then it creates the illusion that it is acting this whole thing out, when really it&amp;#39;s all just... automatic?

Of course, then there&amp;#39;s intention, which is something where if consciousness wants to experience a certain thing, out of curiosity, the body in which it is in will act out what it must in order for that intention to be satisfied. Then you have intuition, where consciousness might let go to see where the river flows possibly based on a light sort of intention, and then you have instinct, where consciousness also lets go, but allows the body and mind to act within its learned, automatic habits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This feeling has led me to become closer and closer toward taking in a possibility that perhaps I am not controlling my body and my mind in the way that I think I am. Perhaps I am the silent observer, so enticed and attentive toward this life that I made myself convinced enough that &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; was this body, this mind, this personality.
