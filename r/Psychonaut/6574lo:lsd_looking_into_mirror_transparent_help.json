Almost like i was seeing me but not me but me at the same time.\nSo there was the most beautiful tattoo im going to call it on my chest looked exactly like the aztec calendar except it fit my chest and traps  perfectly, my hand and half arm were covered in beautiful patterns like those henna tatoos but they were better, so if i moved my hand side to side it would be above my hand and move with it. Now my whole body was not covered in these patterns only these parts, the longer i stared my face morphed into a reptile head like a green lizard head but more alien like, was only half my face, also transparent i could still see my face behind it.The whole time i felt so powerful the feeling was unreal, felt like a god. I also remember as i began to stare, say it was a 10 min stare, the longer i looked the more wrong like i shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing, like a evil presence feeling occured, like you should trust your gut feeling  but i remember i just was in such awe that i kept going ie staring at my reflection in the mirror, and i was in tears not weaping but they just fell down my face in the begging, and my breathing was super heavy like a bull bout to charge ... so imagine just staring at your self breathing super heavy tears in the begging and just this sense of evil and power, and through that, looking at the most beautiful self ive ever seen, except the face that was weird, i also remeber feeling like i wanted to be in so much pain like pain was power, like those african tribes that do the razor blade cutting for art on there body&amp;#39;s, feeling like i needed to get that done on me idk. if any body knows if this meant any thing that would be cool or similar experiences feel free to share, and i know my grammar and punctuation is shit so thanks for gettin through this if you did(:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "OK so everything was transparent.It was  like a hologram you could wear if that makes sense.
