Their Penis Envy cubensis are very potent, and the packaging stealth was quite clever. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a bit of background, I was a pretty heavy drug user from age 15-23 (1999-2007). Mostly X, coke, and weed, but I never hesitated to grab some shrooms whenever I found a source. If the darknet had been around back then, I probably would&amp;#39;ve stuck with psychedelics instead of raving and clubbing so much. I became disabled 10 years ago due to various health issues, which eventually left me homebound and unable to work. Needless to say, I haven&amp;#39;t done any drugs during this entire time. I recently got a medical marijuana card but haven&amp;#39;t used it much since being stoned doesn&amp;#39;t feel good in my current condition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I\u2019m turning 33 in a couple weeks (an auspicious number), and I figured that a shroom trip would be a nice present. It was about time for a conversation with my higher self; plus my parents would be out of town, so the timing was perfect. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ordered 7 grams, planning on taking 3 and giving the rest to some friends. I only weigh 110 pounds, so it would be a hefty dose. I ate them Saturday with some chocolate, but 8 hours later, I still felt nothing. Damn\u2026 Perhaps the medications I\u2019ve tried had altered my brain chemistry and left me immune to tryptamines. But then I read about lemon tek and thought, \u201cWhy not?\u201d I took the remaining 4 grams and within 30 minutes was tripping so hard that I collapsed into bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 1 \u2013 Kosmos&lt;/strong&gt; (approximate length: 3 hours)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve experienced ego death before, but it was always more of a mental/emotional phenomenon. This was the first time that I actually felt it &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt;. The boundaries of my body were extended to the edges of existence. In fact, I no longer even &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a body and was reduced to the most basic substance that the universe is composed of. In spiritual terms, we could call it \u201cconsciousness.\u201d In occult terms, we could call it \u201cthe astral light.\u201d But those words fail to capture the absolute corporeality of what I felt; I was transformed into some sort of \u201ccosmic ooze,\u201d outside of time and space. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From this vantage point, I was able to experience everything that\u2019s being experienced by every person on this planet: the most glorious heights of love and ecstasy, the most torturous depths of despair and rage, every type of pleasure or injustice imaginable, all of it, simultaneously\u2026 Yet despite the sheer intensity of what I was being subjected to, there was an air of strange detachment about it. After all, I was beyond human, in a sense &lt;em&gt;pre-human&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Hinduism, there\u2019s a concept known as Lila: the divine play of the gods. Reality is simply a way for the divine to play with itself and experience all there is to experience. I\u2019m convinced that the Soma referred to in the Vedic texts was a psychedelic plant because this is exactly what I came to understand, not on an intellectual level but on a visceral level. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not just humans; we are not special. Every form of life, whether organic or inorganic, is a facet of this cosmic ooze that&amp;#39;s uploading new experiences into some sort of central database. If I wanted to be a tree, I could experience tree-ness. If I wanted to be a bird, I could experience bird-ness. If I wanted to be a rock, I could experience rock-ness. I wasn&amp;#39;t even bound to this planet. I was able to explore the multitudinous creatures inhabiting the most outrageous pockets of the universe, and from there I could even launch into other universes where the rules are completely different from our own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I was allowed a peek behind the curtain to see where universes are born. It reminded me of the Pleroma discussed by the Gnostic Christians in the Nag Hammadi gospels. This is the part of the journey that\u2019s most difficult to describe because it is a realm that is pre-language. The best way I can explain it is to call it a \u201cconcept factory.\u201d For example, in our universe, there are \u201cthings,\u201d which are \u201cdiscrete objects.\u201d However, not all universes have \u201cthings.\u201d Another example is that not all universes are built on duality like ours; some are based on a triune system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rudolf Steiner believed that when God created humans, we were omniscient and therefore lacked free will. Lucifer gave us free will, which took away our omniscience, but in exchange he gave us the power of imagination. Steiner claimed that whatever we\u2019re able to imagine already exists and that we\u2019re simply remembering what we once knew. After this experience, I can\u2019t help but wonder if he was right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my best friends recently became a father, and I jokingly told him that I would try to find his daughter while tripping. Well guess what? I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; see her, but it wasn\u2019t our first time meeting. We laughed as we discussed the countless previous lives we had spent together over the past trillion years and wondered what was in store for us this time around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 2 \u2013 Rebirth&lt;/strong&gt; (approximate length: 3 hours)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By now I was back on earth and a human again, but I had to start over from the beginning of life. I was like a newborn baby, unable to determine where my body ended and the outside world began. I had absolutely no sensory gates (Aldoux Huxley\u2019s \u201creducing valve\u201d) and was forced to simply feel &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I was able to figure out that I had a physical body, which was separate from the bed I was laying on. The next step was becoming aware of basic bodily functions. I checked to make sure I hadn\u2019t pissed or shat myself. Okay, so far so good. Of course, I still didn\u2019t know what the words \u201cpiss\u201d or \u201cshit\u201d meant; I simply knew that there were certain things that weren\u2019t supposed to come out of my body except at appropriate times. I couldn\u2019t stop running my hands through my hair because I had no idea what it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was crying like a baby, but I didn\u2019t know what the tears coming out of my eyes were. I was covered in sweat, but I didn\u2019t know that it meant I was hot. I simply had a vague notion of the concept of \u201cwetness.\u201d I constantly switched from crying to laughing, the way babies do, and I feel that this phase was the most healing phase of the trip. It allowed me to expel all the psychic sludge that had built up in my soul over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One by one, words came back to me\u2026 &lt;em&gt;Window.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Room.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Candle.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fart.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bed.&lt;/em&gt; I was having strong auditory hallucinations, so every word I said echoed dozens of times. I pushed my hands against the bed and sat up. Success! I still didn\u2019t really know where I was, but I could feel that I was in a safe place and knew that I wasn\u2019t seriously injured. Finally, I was able to crawl off my bed and start crawling around on the floor. I ended up getting pretty dirty, but hey, that\u2019s what babies do. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the hallmarks of a shroom trip is novelty, but it\u2019s usually meant in reference to the fact that everything becomes \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cinteresting.\u201d In this case, everything became novel in the literal sense of the word: \u201cnewness.\u201d Everything was new to me because I had essentially started over as a baby and had to re-learn a lifetime\u2019s worth of knowledge.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 3 \u2013 Delirium&lt;/strong&gt; (approximate length: 2 hours)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was now aware that I was an adult human being. However, the trip then took a strange turn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began having intense feelings of derealization and depersonalization, along with very strong delusions. I lost all bearing on reality. I forgot that I was in my own house. I wasn\u2019t even sure if I was dead or alive. I became worried that I had killed someone and was condemned to hell, where I would stay insane for all eternity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was at least able to stand for short periods of time, so I went to the bathroom and looked at myself. This helped to bring me back a bit. I remembered my name. I remembered that I had taken shrooms. I remembered all of the friends who I had seen become delusional while trip-sitting, and I told myself that the same thing was happening to me. It wasn\u2019t permanent. &lt;em&gt;It would soon pass&lt;/em&gt;\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just sat on the ground with my arms around my legs, breathing deeply and telling myself that everything would be okay. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that this part of the trip was a \u201cbad trip,\u201d since I was able to handle it myself, but it was definitely the closest I\u2019ve come to psychedelic-induced psychosis. One of my friends had asked if I wanted him to come over and check on me while I was tripping, but it\u2019s a good thing he didn\u2019t because he probably would\u2019ve called 911 if he saw me in this state. lol&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 4 \u2013 Pleasure&lt;/strong&gt; (approximate length: 2 hours)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 8 hours, I had come down to the point where things were a bit more calm, fun, and exciting. I now had a firm grasp on basic concepts like time, place, and personal identity. I was finally able to comfortably stand and walk around, so I went downstairs and chugged a quart of coconut water. &lt;em&gt;Goddamn I was thirsty!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My visual hallucinations were quite intense, with a lot of high-level geometry, as exemplified in this artwork:\n&lt;a href=\"https://psychonautwiki.org/w/index.php/File:In_the_tree_by_Eddie_calz.jpg\"&gt;https://psychonautwiki.org/w/index.php/File:In_the_tree_by_Eddie_calz.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s funny because I had spent so much time preparing for the trip. I had a carefully-curated music playlist. I had acrylic paints laid out so I could create. I had candles set up around my room to create an atmosphere conducive to meditation. I had even cleaned the house and smudged every room with incense to clear any negative energy. But as soon as the shrooms hit me, all those plans went out the window!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was now able to speak, but the only three words I could say were, \u201cHoly fucking shit!\u201d over and over again. Everything just seemed so outrageous in that special shroomy way. I was cackling like a hyena as I roamed around the house just staring at things. I considered going outside but decided not to because I looked like a madman and knew that the neighbors might suspect something. Even though this phase only lasted a couple of hours, it was probably the most fun I\u2019ve ever had while shrooming. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 5 \u2013 Glow&lt;/strong&gt; (approximate length: 2 hours)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was extremely exhausted after experiencing the creation of the universe, so I laid down for the rest of the trip, just staring out the window and smiling. I was sobering up pretty quickly, basking in the afterglow, and the comedown was very smooth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire trip was around 12 hours long. I was an absolute mess, so I showered and washed my sheets. Extremely famished, I ordered a shepherd\u2019s pie from a local Irish restaurant and wolfed it down. Whew!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fantastic dreams I had that night could probably fill up an entire separate post. I remember exploring an infinitely-large library that contained all the books ever written or imagined, past, present, and future. It reminded me of a story written by my favorite author Jorge Luis Borges, \u201cThe Library of Babel.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So\u2026 do I regret taking all 7 grams? Nope. Would I recommend it? &lt;em&gt;Nope&lt;/em&gt;. Not unless you possess a certain type of constitution, have a high degree of psychic resilience, and already have a fair amount of experience with non-ordinary states.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trip wasn\u2019t really \u201cfun\u201d until Phase 4. But if I was just looking for a good time, I could\u2019ve popped a roll or snorted some K. I wasn\u2019t looking for fun. I was looking for expansion and healing, and that\u2019s exactly what I got.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "First of all, shout out to u/CupOdrugs.
