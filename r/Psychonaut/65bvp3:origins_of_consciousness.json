That was the start of my thought process that made me want to ask this question. The way I thought about it was that if our consciousness was self contained (meaning that our emotions, awareness and reactions are a product of how we happen to live our lives) then that means that there would only be one true way to react and understand our world: your way. That seems like a clear contradiction of how it actually happens. So I set up a thought experiment. Say you have two exact copies of our local universe, and that this copy also followed us dynamically (meaning that it has the same time as we do). Is it then possible for the you that is reliving your life, to have a different perspective despite having the exact same life. My answer to that was yes, because otherwise that would mean that there is only one way to understand certain events, and that is just plainly false. \nDue to that alone I decided that consciousness must be outside of us, otherwise it wouldn't be possible to live through similar events and come out with completely different ideas of what it meant. We would all react similarly, which is not how it is.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like your idea of reality being malleable and dynamic.
