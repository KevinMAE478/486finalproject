Sometimes I get glimpses of patterns or images (usually hard to make out or focus on) but nothing intense. This time, I lightly pressed my fingers over my closed eyes to stimulate the colors or something? I don&amp;#39;t know. I was having unusually vivid imagery with this &amp;quot;new technique&amp;quot; (like some vague psychedelic patterns moving in weird, snaky waves, plus some scattered images I couldn&amp;#39;t make sense of). The moment that gave me goosebumps was when I saw this really vivid eye-shape in the center of the &amp;quot;void&amp;quot;. I haven&amp;#39;t ever seen this kind of stationery visual before, or something that can be made out so clearly. It was a round/almond eye shape (yellow), a deep blue/purple pupil in the center, and maybe a small bright spot appearing in the center of the pupil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since this was unusual for me I snapped out of it and just pondered what a strange thing that was to see. The purple and yellow colors were especially strange to me for some reason, so I made a mental note of it.
