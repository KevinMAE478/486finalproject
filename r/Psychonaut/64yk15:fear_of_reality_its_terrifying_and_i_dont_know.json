The next most vivid part of the trip was where I told myself that I had to die, that the only way I could escape this was to kill myself. I knew my mom and sister would be devastated if I killed myself, so I decided that I would give myself lung cancer by smoking excessively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pictured myself lying naked in a restaurant or somewhere in public covered in my own feces and people staring at me in utter disgust. After a while I climbed into my bedsheets and closed my eyes. This was when the anxiety went down a little bit, but the trip turned to a whole new level. I felt like there were these things taking me to another dimension where I would play the role of &amp;quot;god&amp;quot; or the universe of whatever. I felt myself experiencing nothing but suffering, I felt me as a single entity transfer my consciousness into every person throughout time. I felt the pain of the Jews who were burned alive, the people in the scuff videos I saw online, my ex-boss who treated my like shit but I understood that he through was suffering quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My trip ended when my roommate walked into our condo and I snapped back to reality. What followed however was a huge amount of anxiety from the thought of nihilism, that everything we do is completely useless. Nothing has a purpose and we&amp;#39;re all in this universe to suffer. It turned me inside out, I indulged in my own nihilistic thoughts and refused to talk to someone about it, and it really really fucked me up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=\"/r/meditation\"&gt;/r/meditation&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;ve hit almost a month of daily meditation which has reduced my anxiety quite a bit, but I still get panic attacks. I was before living in a very solipsistic mindset, thinking that I was the only one who actually existed and everything, everyone was just a projection of my mind (hence having the power to give myself lung cancer) but this has almost completely gone away through meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always wonder, what is gonna happen when I die, will I live the lives of all of these people who have suffered all over again? At times I have thought about killing myself, but a while back I read on &lt;a href=\"/r/GlitchInTheMatrix\"&gt;/r/GlitchInTheMatrix&lt;/a&gt; (I know it sounds stupid, but its been feeding the fire in my head) that these people tried killing themselves, and woke up in a different reality; an identical reality with a slightly different timeline. What the fuck is the point of existing?\nI know that only I can find the answer to this question (maybe), and through meditation I have realized some things buried in my subconscious, like the people who bullied me when I was a kid, or the death of my father at a very young age.
