I got to work early and decided to relax in my car for 30 minutes before heading in. I was listening to &amp;quot;The Heart of the Buddha&amp;#39;s Teaching&amp;quot; on tape and kind of went into a trance with the humming of the narrator&amp;#39;s voice. I kept trying to distinguish my thoughts as separate from my physical body and started losing track of the physical location of my arms. I also felt them sort of rise a bit and separate from my body, and my mouth felt as if it were opening and becoming large, even though it wasn&amp;#39;t physically. I got the impression also that my arms and hands and particularly my mouth were expanding continuously and that my extremities were HUGE. It&amp;#39;s hard to explain. I felt some detachment as well. I set an alarm on my phone before all this and when it went off I calmly went back to reality. When I opened my eyes and got out of the car, I felt physically high, very similar to the feeling after smoking a little marijuana. Nothing extremely intense but definitely like a good solid pot high but waaaay more peaceful. I looked around and felt a sense of awe as well. Most productive day I had at work ever probably haha.
