I'm in my 40's now and I've lived in a Zen temple for awhile, and done extensive work with psychedelics.  Here's my take.\n\nMeditation is the practice of being mindful.  You develop this skill by focusing on (usually) your breath.  When you regonize your mind has wandered away from your breath and onto something else, like dinner, you move your attention back to the breath.\n\nYou repeat this 1 million and 1 times (give or take).  Over and over and over until you get good at it.  Over time your attention will rest longer on your breath until finally you start breaking through to the point that big chunks of time will fly by as your attention sits motionless.\n\nThis gives you mastery over your attention, and your thoughts.  This idea of \"being mindful\" often means paying attention to what your mind is thinking, from an outside perspective.  Noticing what's actually going on, while it's happening.\n\nIt's a powerful skill, once mastered.\n\nPsychedelics on the other hand are not a practice or a skill, they are an experience.  The powerful ones are like electro-shock therapy.  You're going to get a massive dose of self-introspection and reality, like it or not.  And focusing on your breath for long periods of time is probably not in the cards.\n\nTo me they are both tools to help me on the path, but they are very different tools.  They do different things, and help in different ways.  Ultimately they are both helping me to see myself more objectively, and to be more in control over myself, my thoughts, my emotions, my behaviors.\n\nI'll give a brief example.  Perhaps you're the kind of person who gets mad at people when you shouldn't, or has trouble when experiencing anger or frustration.  The first step in dealing with that is mindfulness.  You must realize, as soon as it begins to happen, that something is making you upset.  If you catch it quickly, you can recognize it, and allow it to pass away instead of reacting to it and allowing it to intensify.  Just let it go, so to speak.  That requires mindfulness.\n\nMeditation is a tool that will help you to recognize when something starts to upset you sooner, and allow you to let it go more easily (just return to the breath).\n\nTake some Iboga and you might spend 20 hours being shown just how much of an asshole you can be when you get upset, and how that harms you and those you love.\n\nSame thing, but different.  :)", "edited": 1492060774.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a teenager I was introduced to both meditation and psychedelics.
