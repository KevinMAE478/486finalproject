That's a support of 6 references, not to mention the chain of references underneath those also.\n\n&gt; From my experience in this subreddit, these types of articles posted on this subreddit have been increasing exponentially.\n\nExponential is a very well defined term, and the use of it in this way seems like bias to me. By the way, these articles are talking about research from 1-3 years ago. That's a decent amount of time for the parent articles, if proven to be biased, to be redacted.\n\n&gt; This article OP posted makes tons of bold claims, little citing of references, as well as bold extrapolations.\n\nAs much as I know this isn't what you're referring to, there aren't any claims in bold and there aren't \"tons\" of them. Besides, that's not a standard measure, and generally a good critique would pick apart and prove the specific points of extrapolation.\n\n&gt; These articles are always posted and upvoted because lets get real - its due to conformational bias.\n\nAlways? There's been plenty of times I've seen reposts with shitty titles that don't get upvoted at all. Usually the ones extrapolating remain buried.\n\nPS. It's a *confirm*ational bias, confirming belief, not conforming.\n\n&gt; We like the information that seems to support our beliefs, despite adequate proof.\n\nWhere exactly is your adequate proof? Where are *your* references?\n\n&gt; I think if ever a article is posted, OP should provide a interpretation. Ideally, just the study should be posted with a interpretation.\n\nYeah... the article posted is exactly that, an interpretation of a number of studies. Are you calling for an /r/psychonaut rule like that of posting image links, where OP needs to explain how it links to mind-exploration? Even when it's clearly about psychedelics and the science and anecdotes behind them?\n\n&gt; Otherwise, being on this subreddit is no different the the biased, polarized society we live in.\n\nEvery single word you have used, if taken alone, can be polarized with it's opposite: \"X\" and \"not X\". You, here, in this language, are being polarized. The entire world is well-known to contain duality. It's generally not seen as a problem, and the solution is a matter of personal perception - if you read those words as symbols of unity that take into account their opposites then it would become bunk, just like every other example of linguistic polarization.\n\nSociety isn't the polarization problem here, it's language, it's you.\n\nPlease, if you are to respond to this critique, provide at least 6 references that show \"adequate proof\" that OP's article and it's parents are extrapolation.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is bias in the news channels, social media, as well as articles like the one posted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I agree there&amp;#39;s bias, this has two references, both of which rely on two other references each. That&amp;#39;s a support of 6 references, not to mention the chain of references underneath those also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From my experience in this subreddit, these types of articles posted on this subreddit have been increasing exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exponential is a very well defined term, and the use of it in this way seems like bias to me. By the way, these articles are talking about research from 1-3 years ago. That&amp;#39;s a decent amount of time for the parent articles, if proven to be biased, to be redacted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This article OP posted makes tons of bold claims, little citing of references, as well as bold extrapolations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As much as I know this isn&amp;#39;t what you&amp;#39;re referring to, there aren&amp;#39;t any claims in bold and there aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;tons&amp;quot; of them. Besides, that&amp;#39;s not a standard measure, and generally a good critique would pick apart and prove the specific points of extrapolation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These articles are always posted and upvoted because lets get real - its due to conformational bias.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always? There&amp;#39;s been plenty of times I&amp;#39;ve seen reposts with shitty titles that don&amp;#39;t get upvoted at all. Usually the ones extrapolating remain buried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS. It&amp;#39;s a &lt;em&gt;confirm&lt;/em&gt;ational bias, confirming belief, not conforming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We like the information that seems to support our beliefs, despite adequate proof.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where exactly is your adequate proof? Where are &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; references?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think if ever a article is posted, OP should provide a interpretation. Ideally, just the study should be posted with a interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah... the article posted is exactly that, an interpretation of a number of studies. Are you calling for an &lt;a href=\"/r/psychonaut\"&gt;/r/psychonaut&lt;/a&gt; rule like that of posting image links, where OP needs to explain how it links to mind-exploration? Even when it&amp;#39;s clearly about psychedelics and the science and anecdotes behind them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, being on this subreddit is no different the the biased, polarized society we live in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every single word you have used, if taken alone, can be polarized with it&amp;#39;s opposite: &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not X&amp;quot;. You, here, in this language, are being polarized. The entire world is well-known to contain duality. It&amp;#39;s generally not seen as a problem, and the solution is a matter of personal perception - if you read those words as symbols of unity that take into account their opposites then it would become bunk, just like every other example of linguistic polarization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Society isn&amp;#39;t the polarization problem here, it&amp;#39;s language, it&amp;#39;s you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please, if you are to respond to this critique, provide at least 6 references that show &amp;quot;adequate proof&amp;quot; that OP&amp;#39;s article and it&amp;#39;s parents are extrapolation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Psychonaut", "name": "t1_dg8kx12", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492163255.0, "created_utc": 1492134455.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qplv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65681c", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qplv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65681c", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qplv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65681c", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qplv", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65681c", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9v2me", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Existential-Funk", "parent_id": "t1_dg9oh1n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Psychonaut", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just like the 'god complex' here in many communities.
