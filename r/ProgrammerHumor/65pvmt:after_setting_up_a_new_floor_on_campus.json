(Most of them do play on them too, just accept that PCs are superior.) You choose whatever you choose, no problem with that. But how much work does it involve to use a Mac like a PC, and how rewarding is it?\n\nI see what you mean which disabling stuff like System Integrity Protection, I know what you're talking about with the challenges. I have a Chromebook, that one does the same thing. I still ended up dual-booting it, and nowadays only use ChromeOS when I'm just casually browsing, but not for development. It was possible to develop stuff on it, I used chroots and everything, but it was a hassle, and deep down the system was designed to be locked down and used for a single reason. And yes, you can do the same thing on a Mac, you can unlock its full potential without hassle by installing a different OS (actually, my dad does that exact thing on every MacBook he touches), but then it's just an overpriced prebuilt, nothing else.\n\nThe same way Microsoft is tracking people who don't know how to disable it Apple is locking the same users into its app-based, locked-down ecosystem governed by a single store of the manufacturer, exactly like a console or a mobile device. Sure, it can be hacked, and hacking stuff around is very welcome in both subreddits, but hacking, by definition, is what you add, not what the device offers. Following the same logic, when a console is cracked and booted into a Linux system, does it become a PC?
