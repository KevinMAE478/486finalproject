There are no good tools nor tutorials on getting into development on Linux. There are no good frameworks. Android is okay, but it&amp;#39;s become a &lt;a href=\"http://gph.is/1frEsqf\"&gt;roving dumpster fire&lt;/a&gt; with the hell that is fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Windows is no walk in the park either, but at lest there&amp;#39;s a nice unified toolchain with Visual Studio. I don&amp;#39;t fiddle around with it, it just works. Granted, it&amp;#39;s what I learned on, but it&amp;#39;s what I feel most at home with and no opensource alternative, save for SharpDevelop has really come close. MonoDevelop felt like a steaming pile since I started developing stuff. There were larger carfires I could use, but none of them really had the same punch as Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I write Python and C#. I can have a mobile app running and working on Desktop in about 20 minutes.
