I'll explain this in general though because I know more about Indian history than I do Sri Lankan. It's partly to do with migration and partly to do with admixing. Population genetics is the study of human migration and genetic divergence. Population genetics tells us that all humans originated in Africa and migrated in all directions and therefore we are all related, obviously, since we are the same species. How similar or different we are, partly depends on how recently in history our races separated from each other. Proximity is a big clue, as are physical land barriers - for example in addition to Indians, all of the Middle East is also considered Caucasian. I don't have my books with me to confirm right now, but from memory the Australian Aboriginals are the end product of one of the first groups to leave Africa and are thought to be the most similar to our original ancestors. The land mass was different then, not as it is now - Gondwana land. A group traveled from Africa through the Middle East down through Southern Asia and across the land bridge down to Australia, PNGers are the most similar genetically to Aboriginals. This happened over 1000s of years obviously. As people traveled out of Africa, different groups dropped off, colonising different places, which is how the Sri Lankans ended up where they did. Over time humans adapted to their unique environments via natural selection, hence differences in appearance and genes. For example Africans have dark skin, because lighter skin was selected out, it's disadvantageous in such a hot, sunny climate. Eskimos developed a yellowish skin tone as they have an extra layer of fat under their skin, which is an advantage as it keeps them warmer in the cold climate they live in, their eyes are narrow to protect against the extreme glare off the snow. Southern Europeans like myself have oily skin that tans rather than burns, providing a natural moisturiser against the dry, sunny ocean climate - the skin of an Irish person (like my partner) in comparison doesn't do as well in that type of climate, as they don't have that oily barrier - their climate has so much moisture in the air that their skin can absorb it to keep moist. The way we (and all living things) look, has everything to do with natural selection (before humans started messing with it that is). Then land masses change, physical barriers cut people off and different races continued to develop independently of one another, leading to further genetic variation between areas.  If at one point there was a land bridge between Sri Lanka and India, that would have allowed migration. The rising of ocean levels then isolated it as an island, allowing independent development and divergence from the mainland population. Later migration also changed things a little. Since India is easily accessible through a continuous land mass, Indians have mixed with Westerners a lot more freely than Sri Lankans could due to the ocean barrier, at least earlier on before ships and unfriendly invaders. I hope this all makes sense. Basically we are all cousins - some are more like 1st cousins, others more like 17th, but for all intents and purposes, we all came from a single origin and the influence of environment and time on our genes took care of the rest. In another few thousand years we will be different again. With modern technology, environment is becoming less of an influence and with travel now much easier than it was before, those physical barriers are no longer there. It's already happening in melting pot countries like America and Australia. My half Cypriot, half Greek cousin just married an Indian girl. My half Greek, half Egyptian brother married an Italian. My other cousin is dating a Chinese man. It's possible that in thousands of years, we could end up as one big race again, back to where we started.\nEdit: a word", "edited": 1492125073.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure.
