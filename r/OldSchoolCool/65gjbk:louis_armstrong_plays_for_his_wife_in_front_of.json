Being number 1 in military impact on the world and Olympic medals doesn&amp;#39;t solve the majority of issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was raised and educated to believe that the USA was the shining city on the hill, a beacon, calling all of those who were honest, hardworking people to come here and make a life for themselves and family free from tyranny and oppression. A country leading the world with its example of the highest expectations and standards. What I see now is fear, people terrified of &amp;quot;losing&amp;quot; their little slice of life, willing to forfeit a better future for all, to not disturb the way things are now. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I was talking to a guy who immigrated to the U.K. and then the USA and is doing well with his own business here but I think we should have higher standards for ourselves, our country and our impact on the world then &amp;quot;well it&amp;#39;s a first world country, so no need to improve&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the rant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OldSchoolCool", "name": "t1_dgapvv9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492296492.0, "created_utc": 1492267692.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tycb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gjbk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgalgkj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SirNippleClamp", "parent_id": "t1_dgalakt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OldSchoolCool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not too sure, I think it got stopped 3 decades ago with the rise of Reaganism and it has been made worse with further cuts to arts, culture, the state department etc. Basically it is what happens when the lunatics take over the asylum in the name of small government and labelling the federal government as the root of all evil as Republicans have done.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not too sure, I think it got stopped 3 decades ago with the rise of Reaganism and it has been made worse with further cuts to arts, culture, the state department etc. Basically it is what happens when the lunatics take over the asylum in the name of small government and labelling the federal government as the root of all evil as Republicans have done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OldSchoolCool", "name": "t1_dgalgkj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492288387.0, "created_utc": 1492259587.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgalakt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Gonzo_Rick", "parent_id": "t1_dgakj4m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OldSchoolCool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That sounds Intelligent...Do we do this anymore?
