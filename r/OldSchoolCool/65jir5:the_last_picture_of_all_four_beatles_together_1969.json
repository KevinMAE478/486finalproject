I've argued with one troglodyte who said that they were a boy band because the whole \"the quiet one\" \"dark one\" \"cute one\" archetype inspired future boy bands.  Which is stupid because 1. being an inspiration for a future thing isn't the same as being that thing and 2. people have personalities.  The Beatles' personalities weren't put on...it's just that we were more exposed to their personalities because they were *so* popular we knew every member's personality.  \n\nBoy bands weren't a thing back then.  It was nothing at all like in the 80s and 90s.  The Beatles were a rock group just like every other rock group.  Some groups were a bit harder, and we call those garage rock, which was an awesome genre ([give it a listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOyA7aK0HqU)), but the Beatles weren't particularly different from their contemporaries when they started out.  They were a basic rock band who were especially charismatic and had great songwriters, which propelled them to superstardom.  \n\nThe closest we got to a boy band in the 60s was the Monkees, who *were* a constructed group, but they rebelled against that later on.  Somewhat similar case with the Beach Boys, and the Beach Boys were *masterful*...Pet Sounds is widely considered in the top *three* albums of all time.  Or the archies, which didn't actually exist. \n\nBut none of them were what boy bands were.  Boy bands were 1. constructed by a corporate entity and 2. didn't play instruments and 3. didn't write their own music and 4. primarily vocal focused. \n\nCalling *any* 60s music a boy band is just ignorant.

Some groups were a bit harder, and we call those garage rock, which was an awesome genre (&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOyA7aK0HqU\"&gt;give it a listen&lt;/a&gt;), but the Beatles weren&amp;#39;t particularly different from their contemporaries when they started out.
