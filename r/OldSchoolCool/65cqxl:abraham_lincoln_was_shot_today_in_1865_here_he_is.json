I was just randomly today looking at old west photos and came across this photo of Lincoln on a random website among a huge stack of random photos, and I hadnt seen this one of Lincoln before. Then I thought I should post it to this sub, but then I thought nah today is no special date or anything regarding US history and everybody on reddit have probably already seen it so I might as well skip posting it. And then now I see you posted that very photograph here and there is indeed a special date today!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "OldSchoolCool", "name": "t1_dg9w8ma", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492239455.0, "created_utc": 1492210655.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tycb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cqxl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga9mgf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "khegiobridge", "parent_id": "t3_65cqxl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OldSchoolCool", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Pinkerton looks like he's about to pull a gat and cap the photographer.
