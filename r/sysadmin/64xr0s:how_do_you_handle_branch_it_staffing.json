We just replace them if there are issues and deal with the issues in the HQ.  Thin terminals basically never die but we do the same there.  Printers are under contract so the supplier handle those.  Network is under contract so the ISP looks after those.  For network outages we send out 3G routers and use those when landlines are down for 2+ days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most issues though are solved by remoting onto the device and fixing whatever comes up, we can image from every big site, and do a data transfer from any PC to any PC over the network, external drive, etc. with settings using USMT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All Windows workstations are managed by SCCM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you have an issue you&amp;#39;tr trying to fix? EG if that 30 staff site feels unloved, how about sitting a desktop support person there once a week?  Make sure they&amp;#39;re visible if thats the issue, walk around, talk to admin staff (admin staff know everything in most companies) etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically we save sending staff to sites by shipping replacement hardware, we already ship a TONNE of stuff so we get good rates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sysadmin", "name": "t1_dg5x8rx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492035733.0, "created_utc": 1492006933.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xr0s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5xrcq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "storm2k", "parent_id": "t3_64xr0s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sysadmin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "i think this is one of those catch-all questions that does not have one right answer. i work for a firm that's headquartered in the midwest but has branch offices of different sizes all over the country. most of the core it functions are handled at hq but we have staff at major offices around the country (i'm at our office in nyc, for example) who handle all manners of onsite support and admin. i have a few small branch offices in a close radius to here that i support as well. this works great in a compressed area, but in other parts of the country where branch offices are in far flung areas that a support person can only get to by flying tehre and staying overnight, it gets hairier so they're looking at supplementing with a 3rd party company.\n\nmy .02: since your branch offices are within reasonable driving distance, i would not reach out to any 3rd party resources for them. if anything, figure out one person in each location who can act as an \"it contact\" who could be coached through some basic plugging/unplugging of gear, etc. who can take some trips off your plates. for the bigger stuff, i'd still say that you'll need to send someone out, and that everyone on staff should be assigned an office that is theirs.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i think this is one of those catch-all questions that does not have one right answer. i work for a firm that&amp;#39;s headquartered in the midwest but has branch offices of different sizes all over the country. most of the core it functions are handled at hq but we have staff at major offices around the country (i&amp;#39;m at our office in nyc, for example) who handle all manners of onsite support and admin. i have a few small branch offices in a close radius to here that i support as well. this works great in a compressed area, but in other parts of the country where branch offices are in far flung areas that a support person can only get to by flying tehre and staying overnight, it gets hairier so they&amp;#39;re looking at supplementing with a 3rd party company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;my .02: since your branch offices are within reasonable driving distance, i would not reach out to any 3rd party resources for them. if anything, figure out one person in each location who can act as an &amp;quot;it contact&amp;quot; who could be coached through some basic plugging/unplugging of gear, etc. who can take some trips off your plates. for the bigger stuff, i&amp;#39;d still say that you&amp;#39;ll need to send someone out, and that everyone on staff should be assigned an office that is theirs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sysadmin", "name": "t1_dg5xrcq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492036343.0, "created_utc": 1492007543.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xr0s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5z41c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "vincent_van_brogh", "parent_id": "t3_64xr0s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sysadmin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "we have about 150 employees, one main office, and 10 remote offices with about 1-4 employees that usually only do light office work. about 5 of those offices aren't within driving distance.
