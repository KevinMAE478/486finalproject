Become his ally, and a valued resource for him. People will notice, he will notice, he will talk about what a great and helpful guy you are, and that can only help you.\n\nThat's how you survive this, by not being bitter, and embracing your situation while continuing to do everything you can to support your team and your organization.

Try not to hold any ill will toward him. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t hate the player...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, you shouldn&amp;#39;t be taking on his responsibilities without the pay or title. That&amp;#39;s not fair.  Here&amp;#39;s the kicker, though, life isn&amp;#39;t fair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could refuse to help your fellow team members, and force them to seek help from the incompetent person, but then you&amp;#39;re not a team player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could refuse to do the big boy work and force management to assign it to him, but then you&amp;#39;re being uncooperative and insubordinate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality is, if you want to keep working at this company you&amp;#39;re going to have to suck it up and be a valuable team member who does work above his pay grade. I would hope that your management is able to recognize your contributions, and give you appropriate recognition based upon your performance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget to self promote! It&amp;#39;s sometimes tacky, but it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt to remind people of all of the wonderful work you&amp;#39;ve done. It&amp;#39;s and incredibly effective tactic, even if it&amp;#39;s tasteless. Be proud of yourself and your abilities. Make yourself shine and stick out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While you&amp;#39;re doing this, don&amp;#39;t talk smack about the other guy. You&amp;#39;ll only appear to be a bitter whiner. You&amp;#39;re not going to affect his career, and you shouldn&amp;#39;t care to. Good for him that he got the position, he&amp;#39;s a lucky guy, especially since he&amp;#39;s not qualified. Maybe he&amp;#39;ll fake it &amp;#39;till he makes it, maybe he won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, and you&amp;#39;re going to hate this advice, help him out.  Share your knowledge with him, help him to succeed. Become his ally, and a valued resource for him. People will notice, he will notice, he will talk about what a great and helpful guy you are, and that can only help you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how you survive this, by not being bitter, and embracing your situation while continuing to do everything you can to support your team and your organization.  If that&amp;#39;s too much, find another job, because if you become unhelpful and bitter at this one you&amp;#39;ll either become stagnant, or you&amp;#39;ll be pushed out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sysadmin", "name": "t1_dg9ew82", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492218175.0, "created_utc": 1492189375.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65cozw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ia3k", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dl1828", "parent_id": "t1_dg99lcn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sysadmin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Learn to say no.
