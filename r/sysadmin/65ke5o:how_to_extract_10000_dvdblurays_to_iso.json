People are talking about setting up hardware to auto-rip 100 dvd&amp;#39;s at a time. The whole point of my post was to say &amp;quot;just give it to a cheap minion&amp;quot;. Okay fine, maybe they can only rip 25/hour. Double  your labor cost. The point is you have something to compare against when getting an outsourcing quote or considering purchasing $20k in equipment to be used once so that a sysadmin can quickly do the job without offloading to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sysadmin", "name": "t1_dgdphnl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475227.0, "created_utc": 1492446427.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdlbbj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "THedman07", "parent_id": "t1_dgde0as", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sysadmin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They should expect it to be expensive, I just think throwing out a number for labor without estimating something for equipment doesn't make sense when the equipment will likely be multiple times the labor.
