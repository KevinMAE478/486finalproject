But I also despise the way many SANs are licensed, how some require having Special People (TM) coming over just to plug in the toys I've bought, and for us as consumers, VSAN promise a simpler approach to storage.\n\nStill, now that I'm actually doing a VSAN based Horizon 7 project, having my storage wishes come true suddenly has me worried like never before ;)\n\nVSAN is still quite young, so it might just be a question of maturity, and you always hear of the horror stories, not successes. That said, the SAN sales pitch - often from the same people who peddle VSAN - is in essence that all parts of a SAN are more tightly coupled together and and go through a rigorous, true and tried testing regime that result in a complete storage product.
