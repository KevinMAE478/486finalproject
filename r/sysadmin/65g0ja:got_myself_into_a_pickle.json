Everything went reasonably well but we've run into an issue. These folks live and die by their contacts. They have 5000 or so contacts that need to be shared globally and editable by everyone in the organization.\n\nThere are three outlook 2016 users, a web app user, 2 mac mail users and one who is trying both outlook and web app.\n\nI found a third party marketplace app that allows sharing and editing of a contact folder and that's working fine except for the outlook users. Apparently when you use outlook the shared folder and the personal contacts are grouped together in \"my contacts\". When they add a contact to that group in outlook it's not shared with the rest of the org. \n\nSo next I thought I would use the universal directory and yes, using a third party app I can add users to the directory and it even shows up as the global address book in outlook. The bad news is that the directory is not editable by the users directly so no go.\n\nI suggested that they proceed as is and just the gmail web app to update the contacts and that was a non starter. \n\nSo I have to come up with an alternative that does the following:\n\n1. Share 5000 contacts that are currently in .pst format from exchange 2010 (bonus if the attachments that are in the contacts are usable)\n\n2. Be shared across outlook for windows, mac mail, android and iOS devices \n\n3. Directly editable on all those devices. \n\n4. Be relatively seamless to the user\n\nHere are the ideas I've come up with:\n\n1. Crm solution that integrates with g suite (I'd rather they not migrate email to exchange now that we've gone through the pain of migrating to g suite). \n\n2. A hosted exchange account with one user and have everything sync with that account for contacts only\n\n3. Find some sort of way to sync the individual my contacts folders of the users?\n\nAny help would be appreciated..\n\nThanks!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "65g0ja", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Chumpy36", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_65g0ja", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sysadmin", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.sysadmin", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/sysadmin/comments/65g0ja/got_myself_into_a_pickle/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492241644.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/65g0ja/got_myself_into_a_pickle/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Got myself into a pickle....", "created_utc": 1492212844.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 14, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65g0ja", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65g0ja", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65g0ja", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65g0ja", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65g0ja", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga4in4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TronLightyear", "parent_id": "t1_dga496x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sysadmin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The big issue is you need to find a crm that suites their needs and wants.
