Sharepoint has an annoying tendency to add &lt;a href=\"https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/exchange/en-US/23804eed-8f00-4b07-bc63-7662311a35a4/why-does-sharepoint-put-in-character-code-8203-in-a-richtext-field?forum=sharepointdevelopment\"&gt;zero width spaces&lt;/a&gt; to text. So if you copy text from Sharepoint, you have a bunch of &amp;quot;formatting characters&amp;quot; that make any sort of text manipulation (even just simple search) painful to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another random example. Sharepoint gives you the ability to build custom views of information. However, to edit the view, you have to click on a &amp;quot;magic spot&amp;quot; to get the list ribbon option to show up. I&amp;#39;d like to emphasize that &lt;em&gt;to edit a custom view, you have to &amp;quot;just know&amp;quot; where to click to get the menu options to show up&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another random example. Sharepoint gives you the ability to interact with data via Access, using a connector. This connector can randomly just shit itself, resulting in corrupted and lost data. Having a view that you&amp;#39;ve spent all day getting set up just right disappear in a split second, for no apparent reason, gets frustrating very very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a ton more. Some of them, I&amp;#39;m quite sure, are the result of incorrect configuration. Some are probably user error on my part.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no single reason I dislike Sharepoint. It&amp;#39;s the buildup of years of &amp;quot;little&amp;quot; bugs and &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; problems that result in headaches for me nearly every single time I interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sysadmin", "name": "t1_dgb4unl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492317143.0, "created_utc": 1492288343.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga5g7u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tr1pline", "parent_id": "t1_dg7x3rk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sysadmin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "What's with the Sharepoint hate?

However, I am of the opinion that somehow our auditors just did not pay any attention.\n\n- local admin account on every domain PC with full access to everything. 5 digit password that has not been changed in over 10 years. Probably still has not been changed. Many, many employees knew it outside of the IT department. Why? Because our IT management didn't want to have special accounts for people who needed only certain access. Too much work to maintain. Once you were logged in with it, you could easily view the local cache (many GBs) of radiology images on the radiologist computers. How do I know this? I built them and tried to explain how we had patient data sitting behind a very insecure account. Didn't matter. Same thing goes across all doctor's computers.\n \n- freely handed off master keys to contractors / vendors who needed access to our DCs or network closets. Most of the time they were not accompanied because they were \"trusted\". We would hand off keys at 8am and not see them until 4 or 5pm when they were returned. Quite a few times the guys accidentally took the keys with them. No biggie...\n\n- We actually approved management using Dropbox to share hospital documents and spreadsheets with outside companies. Why? Because our Sophos email encryption client was broken and they did not want to pay for it to be fixed. Best part? They (end users) set it all up themselves. We never verified if files were password protected or anything.\n\n- Our System admins all used a shared DA account with the username \"administrator\". That password also was not changed regularly until our new PW policy came into effect. Quite a few of them ended up adding themselves to the DA group because they didn't want to have to remember the DA account password since it changed every 90 days. \n\n- We didn't lock down USB ports on our thin clients. We didn't lock down USB ports on anything. We had symantec client that \"scanned\" attached USB drives and checked documents being copied off the local PC. However, I proved many times that it didn't work. I could transfer patient data full of PPI and it was never detected. Same goes with emailing attachments containing patient data. It was better at false positives than it was at actually detecting things that should not have been able to be sent unencrypted. Management refused to make all attachments encrypted by default because it took too much time for people receiving emails to log in to the encryption client that eventually stopped working and was never fixed.\n\n- We didn't control the passwords on vendor PCs. EG. blood bank vendor Windows 7 PC (that was on our network) has a local admin account with default password being a very easy to guess number combo. Did not have any group policies applied to it because \"we did not want to be responsible for maintaining the sensitive information on it\".All the department employees knew it and we did not want to change it because it would inconvenience them.\n\n- We didn't have a WSUS server. We would deploy machines with updates disabled (yes, the service and client were perm. disabled per Management) and they would sit there for quite a few years until it was time to upgrade again. I remember pulling a Windows 7 PC out after 3 years that had not been updated in 3 years. Same goes with XP, which was still in existence when I left 6 months ago. We still has old terminal servers running 2003 that were not updated because \"we did that once and it broken them. so we rolled them back\".\n\n- Groups had full local admin powers by default. So Shirley in Accounting could install anything she wanted without having to get it approved. And people wonder how we got hit with ransomware. \n\n- We got hit with ransomware (Cerber) from a malicious .rtf attachment opened in our Patient Billing department. Sophos didn't block the attachment or even see the file as malicious (I tested this in an offline environment). I tried to advocate that our Sophos being outdated was the issue and that we needed better protection. Nothing changed and the solution was to send a hospital-wide email saying not to open sketchy looking attachments. Took about two weeks for it to happen again. Still nothing changed. \n\n- A couple months after Cerber hit us, I found a couple servers that STILL had encrypted files with the original infection date. I reported it and was asked why I was looking at those servers in the first place. I explained that it was necessary due to a custom vendor pc needing software re-installed. Fine... I asked how was this not caught before. They apparently never did a full scan or search of the entire network to find any other servers that were encrypted. Good thing the encryption did not sit dormant and reactivate. Which I warned everyone against and suddenly my managers were experts on ransomware and \"knew that was not how it worked\".\n\n- We have a wireless network for \"doctors only\". The network ssid is not hidden and the password is the name of the network with the word order swapped. So \"xdoctor\" network has \"doctorx\" as the password. I can still connect to the network when I go there for appointments. Imagine what someone could do sniffing traffic on there... or worse if someone left a wireless device that tunneled all that traffic through a VPN and then back in. I proved this possible when I left a random old hospital PC plugged in at our patient billing as a proof of concept. It sat there for a couple of months chugging along (offline of course... but it had a network cable sitting behind it). I had to remove it due to my manager disagreeing with me on \"how easy it would be for someone else to do that with a malicious intent\". I went above her head and presented this as a HUGE security hole and was told off.\n\n\n- I was Help Desk during this time. It was astounding that simply because I was low on the totem pole, I could not have a better idea of how to secure things than the folks who had been there 15+ years. Probably does not help that these same people were the ones who had left our entire infrastructure in this sad state.\n\nThat is a short list of the things that were going on. Ultimately, I burned myself out in a year because I cared too much about trying to do my job right instead of \"the way they wanted me to\".
