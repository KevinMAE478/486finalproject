So...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our solution was to logically make the new capacity in DC1 part of DC2, then start building our DC3 capacity sooner than anticipated. In this way, we had excess logical capacity in DC2, but were able to start the physical hardware moves from DC1-&amp;gt;2 and To 3 slowly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it best practice? Probably not. But it allowed the business growth to continue, projects to keep going, and while tedious, we had an immediate then long term solution to the balance problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That probably wasn&amp;#39;t the best story to pick for this, but to me it was one of those things that we took immediate non-ideal action on with a long term mitigation plan (now complete), so timeline of solution and acceptable risk made this work for us. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sysadmin", "name": "t1_dgcyx7y", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492424654.0, "created_utc": 1492395854.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ru9y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ru9y", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ru9y", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdbe1i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "1s44c", "parent_id": "t1_dgd9tsv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sysadmin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yet it's often good advice when it becomes clear management are insane, or sitting back and letting insanity happen because they don't want to get involved.\n\nWe should all count ourselves lucky that there is strong demand for IT jobs and that we can (mostly) leave when we like.
