Ethically this is fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your employer can decide they don&amp;#39;t like you after a day and terminate you, and ethically, that&amp;#39;s fine too, barring other agreements or contracts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t tell the first company about it until you&amp;#39;ve got the job in hand, or you might lose both opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But speaking as a person who hires, I&amp;#39;ll be a bit frustrated, but it&amp;#39;s by no means an unprecedented situation for people to accept a position and then later cancel, especially in the case of shorter term positions for this exact reason. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be unethical to, say, have a company that you never intend to work for pay your moving expenses and stick them with the bill over a contract loophole and leave them for another job.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But just pursuing a more suitable job offer before the company has invested more than a couple of conversations with you is by no means unethical.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, don&amp;#39;t think that this means that the person or company that was originally offering you the job won&amp;#39;t be upset.  Some people are unreasonable assholes, and they could certainly be angry with you for it.  They shouldn&amp;#39;t, but they might be.  This has no bearing on the ethics of it, and if they are, you&amp;#39;re probably much better off not being there anyways. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sysadmin", "name": "t1_dg863u4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492144013.0, "created_utc": 1492115213.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655zvr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg867yd", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "StrangeCaptain", "parent_id": "t3_655zvr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sysadmin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Never\n\nThey would do you the same in a heartbeat ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They would do you the same in a heartbeat &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sysadmin", "name": "t1_dg867yd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492144143.0, "created_utc": 1492115343.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655zvr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8701r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zapbark", "parent_id": "t3_655zvr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sysadmin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Leaving a position with in the first week or so isn't all that disruptive to them.\n\nMost people take months to get up to speed.\n\nYou're just saving them that trouble.\n\nDo what you gotta do.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving a position with in the first week or so isn&amp;#39;t all that disruptive to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people take months to get up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re just saving them that trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do what you gotta do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sysadmin", "name": "t1_dg8701r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492145028.0, "created_utc": 1492116228.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655zvr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg87jwv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Elemental33", "parent_id": "t3_655zvr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sysadmin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Omg this actually happened to me.
