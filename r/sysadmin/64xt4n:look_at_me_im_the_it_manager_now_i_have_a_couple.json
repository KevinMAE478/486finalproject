So my $.02 will kind of be a \"I am in the same situation\" but slightly different.\n\nThere are some things that I will call \"Firsts\" because they are all important:\n\n* FIRST THING...   MAKE A NEW BACKUP OF EVERYTHING!\n* Learn the Environment\n* Learn what the business goal is and what part you currently play in that goal\n* Learn how your budgeting works\n* If you have multiple distinct departments or segments you need to figure out how they all work/interact\n* Also if you have multiple departments etc. then you need to know which the company deems as more important\n* Learn that you are replaceable.\n\nAfter that you want to do the simple things like:\n\n* Take Inventory\n* Figure out all your licensing\n* Get a handle on your back end and network (what connects where and what runs what)\n* Figure out your MRC (Monthly Recurring Costs)\n* Schedule a meeting with all your various \"reps\" to become acquainted with them.  Find out what terms your are on with them (both relationship wise and pay structure e.g. net 30 etc.) \n\nNow that you have a baseline on what you have you need to start digging:\n\n* Talk to all the managers and have them define pain points for you.  Some should become obvious immediately.\n* See if you can schedule group meetings with the end users by department/job role and do the same here.  Often times end users have vastly different pain points than management.\n* Talk to director level management and see how they see things running and what pain points they have\n* Talk to ownership (if you can) and get a feel for what they are concerned about.  Make sure you bring up things like security (both physical and digital) as well as how they are handling legal type things (mail/data retention, GLBA, PCI etc.).\n\nNOW you look at processes in place in regards to how IT interacts with the end-users and how things are handled:\n\n* Is there a ticket system\n* Is there centralized updating happening\n* Do you have a phone system, do you manage it, do they call in issues?\n* Who do you report to when there is an issue\n* If equipment needs to be replaced does it come out of your annual budget or a separate budget\n* Does one group or department get a higher priority than another?\n\nFinally you take all the above and look at software and hardware and start to make a list that would be the start of a larger plan:\n\n* Servers - Severity of Replacement Need/Upgrading, both software and hardware from RIGHT NOW/ASAP to \"Year or Two\"\n* Desktops - Same\n* Software - Same however you have \"security risks\" to look at here\n* Services - Are you still on an old two bonded T1 connections that you pay $1,500/mo. for when you can bring in new services that would get you 100mbps for say $800/mo.\n* Printers - How old and how much goes into repair costs etc.  Lots of companies will come in and replace machines for free or low cost to get you on a contract for $0.0001/page black and say $0.04/page color etc.\n\n\nStart coming up with a plan for all of this to take to management.  Use your budget to work on things like software updates.  Do not be so quick to jump to SaaS as you have to pay in perpetuity for those things where \"On Prem\", if you are local can save costs if you do not have a \"need\" other than security for updating.  For example there are many locations that can still operate just fine with Office 2003.  It all comes down to your needs which is why defining them is so important.\n\nMake sure you have a ticketing system if one is not in place.  Spiceworks is free and will do inventory management and has a ticketing system built in as well.  If a company does not have a ticketing system in place then you will find it hard for people to adopt it however you will open lots of eyes by starting one and making a ticket yourself for every single problem out there.  You can start showing trends etc. and management loves graphs and numbers.  Make sure you are logging your time on every issue as well so you can make sure when you come to them with a proposal for say like you said, Office that you can show how much time you spent working on troubleshooting files that were from outside sources (like vendors your company works with or even sent between departments internally) and show how that will free up these issues to show better ROI.  Second those numbers with backing from the managers of the end users that will complain how much time is spent \"reworking spreadsheets\" or \"migrating data\" because of outdated versions.\n\nOften times management/ownership has been scarred in the past by incompetent IT people or even just oversold one too many times because of a lack of understanding technology because sales people love to promise the world.  Just always be up front and back everything you say with solid numbers from your data collected that can be backed by the supporting cast (the end users and management of said end users).  Often end users will complain about everything so real issues turn into Chicken Little scenarios and it will be up to you to determine for management what is \"chicken little\" and what is not.\n\nGLHF\n:)\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok so I found a PC to post on here because typing here is much faster than on a smartphone.

Make sure you bring up things like security (both physical and digital) as well as how they are handling legal type things (mail/data retention, GLBA, PCI etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOW you look at processes in place in regards to how IT interacts with the end-users and how things are handled:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is there a ticket system&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is there centralized updating happening&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do you have a phone system, do you manage it, do they call in issues?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Who do you report to when there is an issue&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If equipment needs to be replaced does it come out of your annual budget or a separate budget&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Does one group or department get a higher priority than another?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally you take all the above and look at software and hardware and start to make a list that would be the start of a larger plan:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Servers - Severity of Replacement Need/Upgrading, both software and hardware from RIGHT NOW/ASAP to &amp;quot;Year or Two&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Desktops - Same&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Software - Same however you have &amp;quot;security risks&amp;quot; to look at here&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Services - Are you still on an old two bonded T1 connections that you pay $1,500/mo. for when you can bring in new services that would get you 100mbps for say $800/mo.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Printers - How old and how much goes into repair costs etc.  Lots of companies will come in and replace machines for free or low cost to get you on a contract for $0.0001/page black and say $0.04/page color etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start coming up with a plan for all of this to take to management.  Use your budget to work on things like software updates.  Do not be so quick to jump to SaaS as you have to pay in perpetuity for those things where &amp;quot;On Prem&amp;quot;, if you are local can save costs if you do not have a &amp;quot;need&amp;quot; other than security for updating.  For example there are many locations that can still operate just fine with Office 2003.  It all comes down to your needs which is why defining them is so important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have a ticketing system if one is not in place.  Spiceworks is free and will do inventory management and has a ticketing system built in as well.  If a company does not have a ticketing system in place then you will find it hard for people to adopt it however you will open lots of eyes by starting one and making a ticket yourself for every single problem out there.  You can start showing trends etc. and management loves graphs and numbers.  Make sure you are logging your time on every issue as well so you can make sure when you come to them with a proposal for say like you said, Office that you can show how much time you spent working on troubleshooting files that were from outside sources (like vendors your company works with or even sent between departments internally) and show how that will free up these issues to show better ROI.  Second those numbers with backing from the managers of the end users that will complain how much time is spent &amp;quot;reworking spreadsheets&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;migrating data&amp;quot; because of outdated versions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often times management/ownership has been scarred in the past by incompetent IT people or even just oversold one too many times because of a lack of understanding technology because sales people love to promise the world.  Just always be up front and back everything you say with solid numbers from your data collected that can be backed by the supporting cast (the end users and management of said end users).  Often end users will complain about everything so real issues turn into Chicken Little scenarios and it will be up to you to determine for management what is &amp;quot;chicken little&amp;quot; and what is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GLHF\n:)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sysadmin", "name": "t1_dg6jmb2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492059265.0, "created_utc": 1492030465.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnp7", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xt4n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5tran", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "telemecanique", "parent_id": "t3_64xt4n", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sysadmin", "controversiality": 0, "body": "you chose a bad example, that office thing you can't win, especially if it's all 2007+ and everything supports the \"new\" formats.
