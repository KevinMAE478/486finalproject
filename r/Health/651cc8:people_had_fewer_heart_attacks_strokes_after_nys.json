Likewise normal 70 year olds would be distraught to be given an average IQ around 90. This is why we always renormalise by age, but using human ages for another species would give misleading and inconsistent results.\n\n&gt; Attempting to account for all these problems and factors would be a mammoth task. A fair comparison with animals in the wild would be against a Western seven year old at best (that would give a 21 year old living in the West today an average IQ of around 150 on this fixed scale). **Seven would also be around the age at which a chimp reaches its cognitive peak**. No one, as yet has attempted such a systematic task, but **this human standard (ie, a 7yr old) is approximately the testing reference used when it is claimed that a typical score for a chimp is about  30-50 IQ points**.\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Using-human-standards-what-would-be-the-approximate-IQ-of-a-chimpanzee\n\nSo our dumb children, make chimps look dumb.  That's not a huge shock.  Most dogs don't have a concept of object permanence.\n\n&gt; If humans are so much more advanced than other animals; why do we do studies on other animals to investigate whether they will work on humans?  We are surely wasting our time on something that will not generalize if we have different brain structures and different capacities. \n\nWhat?  Biology is not the same thing as cognitive function.  We all have a metabolism.  We all process drugs.
