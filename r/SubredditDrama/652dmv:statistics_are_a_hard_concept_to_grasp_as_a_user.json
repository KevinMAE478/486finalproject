How are they not able to understand that 70% probability of a win is not the same as a 100% probability of winning?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/64vzac/what_do_the_results_of_the_kansas_special/dg6pgbe/?st=j1gne1ti&amp;amp;sh=96467cc2\"&gt;This comment&lt;/a&gt; is just amazing. The comment above showed them the probability of landing two heads is lower than the 30% chance of Trump winning and they make it sound like 538 predicted Trump&amp;#39;s odds of winning similar to a coin landing on its side. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the confidence with which they are talking about something they have absolutely no clue about that boggles my mind.
