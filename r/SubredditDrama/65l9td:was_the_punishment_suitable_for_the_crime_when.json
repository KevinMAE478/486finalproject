She stated misconduct, then immediately associates it with &amp;quot;lying&amp;quot; &amp;quot;going back on his word&amp;quot; etc. She even said something about lying to get him an illegal sentence. I didn&amp;#39;t see her talk about the ex parte communication or other issues. It seemed to me she thought it was &amp;quot;misconduct&amp;quot; for the judge to decide on a sentence instead of probation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we have transcripts of the plea deal, Polanski was made aware the judge didn&amp;#39;t have to give him probation after the evaluation. That the judge could give him a sentence instead, and that the sentence would be determined by the judge. The plea deal was for the other charges to be dropped and for one to remain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;eta, clarifying something: She also talks about his jail time in Switzerland over the warrant. And that &amp;quot;jail time should be jail time&amp;quot; and it should count towards his charge here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dgbf27c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492331564.0, "created_utc": 1492302764.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 104}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l9td", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbymln", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "omghi2posers", "parent_id": "t1_dgb67jw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Of course Reddit is eating it up, it enforces the world view of all the pedos.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course Reddit is eating it up, it enforces the world view of all the pedos.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dgbymln", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492373056.0, "created_utc": 1492344256.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l9td", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l9td", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65l9td", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbysow", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HornedGryffin", "parent_id": "t1_dgbc8ex", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;  since the judge was going after him in a way she considered abusive.\n\nYeah, pedophiles really don't like it when the tables are turned. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;since the judge was going after him in a way she considered abusive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, pedophiles really don&amp;#39;t like it when the tables are turned. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dgbysow", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492373509.0, "created_utc": 1492344709.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbc8ex", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 41, "report_reasons": null, "author": "muieporcilor", "parent_id": "t1_dgb95ii", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No, no, it's not the light sentence she opposes.
