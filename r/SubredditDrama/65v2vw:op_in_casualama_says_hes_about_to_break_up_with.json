I see them enjoy a cozy night in with movies and popcorn and cuddles on the couch and I don't feel jealous that I'm not doing it, because I might as well do it tomorrow night? \n\nIt doesn't detract from our relationship that she's able to be happy with another girl, just as it doesn't detract from our relationship that she's able to go out and have a night on the town with her friends while I might sit at home with video games. It doesn't lessen our connection or our intimacy. \n\nMight it be that we could be closer connected if we were monogamous? I'll concede that maybe we could, but I'm very happy with our level of intimacy and the depth of our relationship, so I don't think it's at all necessary to be in a \"2 against the world\" type situation. \n\nEdit: My general takeaway from having had this type of discussion before is that being polyamorous isn't really any better or worse than monogamy - we're all just people trying to be happy in our own way.

Several people in the linked thread defend polyamory by talking about how the OP should have been more clear in his needs. That he should have been more clear about wanting to be monogamous. I think this goes for both parties though. Polyamory is much more rare than monogamy, and therefore, polyamorous people should be *very* clear about their desires. The OP is a bit vague about how things went for him. So in his case, it is possible that his girlfriend was actually very clear about it. But I have seen several stories from other people in which the polyamorous person did not take enough care in making absolutely sure that their partner is okay with it. I see a lot of polyamorous people talk about how important this is. How there needs to be enthusiastic consent. And how polyamorous people can't help but be polyamorous, just like monogamous people can't help being monogamous. But then I see so many stories of a polyamorous person getting together with a person who they know is monogamous. What's the logic there?\n3. From a general standpoint, I would say some of the dislike comes from people considering polyamory to be somewhat contradictory.

Polyamorous people try to argue that polyamorous relationship are no less legitimate than monogamous ones. But I think a lot of people don't believe that, for this reason. If you need other partners on top of the first one, you, by definition, are not fully satisfied with that first partner. You need additional people to be romantically/sexually satisfied.

I know that&amp;#39;s not the ideal poly relationship, but that&amp;#39;s most of what I&amp;#39;ve seen personally, and therefore, I think a lot of other people have seen it only in that way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second most common poly people I have met are divorcees who are clearly not over their marriage ending.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have met a few poly people, who are poly, but are fairly reserved about it until you get to know them better. Their lifestyle is simply not one that I would want, but I could understand it. Because they&amp;#39;re dealing with it in a healthy manner, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have known unless I really got to know them better.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen far more of the first two examples than the third - people who publicly changed their relationship orientation, and everyone else got dragged into their drama. The drama-free version just doesn&amp;#39;t get nearly as much exposure, because, well... it&amp;#39;s drama-free. Nobody wants to gossip about that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what poly people who are making it work are competing against - the public drama that comes from flame-outs. Unless you&amp;#39;re in a poly circle, that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re going to see.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you&amp;#39;re deeply mono, the idea of having sex with more than one person can be disgusting. That&amp;#39;s my theory on why so many people hate it - the worst of the worst are the standard-bearers, and it&amp;#39;s just an icky thing to consider if it&amp;#39;s not your jam. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dgdsi5h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492478575.0, "created_utc": 1492449775.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v2vw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdox32", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "throwsawaynames11111", "parent_id": "t1_dgdifcp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "i would gander that a majority of poly relationships are initiated by 1 person instead of both. i can respect and understand a true poly relationship where both the male and female have multiple partners and multiple stable relationships. where all partners are okay with eachother and their multiple SO's. that is polyamorous. but this is very rare. that takes a lot of emotional control and you just kinda have to be okay with it or it wont work theres no middle ground.  but an example like that guy in the other post, clearly hes not poly and the girl clearly wants multiple dudes in her. maybe shes experimenting, maybe she thought he was bi, maybe he is, but hes clearly not capable of forming a secondary or tertiary relationship and probably never tried. so to answer your question simply, its because the polyamorous lifestyle is hard to live by and be comfortable with. especially when a majority of society is full of entitled and selfish people who want one persons special attention all to themselves. not saying im not monogamous just stating reasons why poly is so difficult.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i would gander that a majority of poly relationships are initiated by 1 person instead of both. i can respect and understand a true poly relationship where both the male and female have multiple partners and multiple stable relationships. where all partners are okay with eachother and their multiple SO&amp;#39;s. that is polyamorous. but this is very rare. that takes a lot of emotional control and you just kinda have to be okay with it or it wont work theres no middle ground.  but an example like that guy in the other post, clearly hes not poly and the girl clearly wants multiple dudes in her. maybe shes experimenting, maybe she thought he was bi, maybe he is, but hes clearly not capable of forming a secondary or tertiary relationship and probably never tried. so to answer your question simply, its because the polyamorous lifestyle is hard to live by and be comfortable with. especially when a majority of society is full of entitled and selfish people who want one persons special attention all to themselves. not saying im not monogamous just stating reasons why poly is so difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dgdox32", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492474588.0, "created_utc": 1492445788.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v2vw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgduo63", "gilded": 1, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bluescrew", "parent_id": "t1_dgdifcp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 1, "body": "In my experience they are projecting their baggage.
