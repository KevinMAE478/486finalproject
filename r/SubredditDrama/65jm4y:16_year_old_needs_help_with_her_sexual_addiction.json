Everyone I knew was aware of mutual pleasure in sex, and expected this, *even if* the first few times were painful. There's a difference between having a bit of sensitivity and things being a bit awkward at first, and having humiliating, painful sex where the guy doesn't even try to contribute. To be honest, when I was a teenager if any guy acted like that during sex it would have been the gossip of the school, because no one thought that kind of thing was okay. It's unfortunate that many young people feel negatively about sex, and I'm not disputing that at all - however, there are obviously many too that don't, and that is why I don't find the OP hard to believe. \n\nMy sex ed consisted of anatomy lessons that included diagrams of the vaginal area and clitoris, covering what happens during puberty etc, talks on different types of contraceptives, sex toys and the like.

Honestly it would never have occurred to me that someone wouldn't have realised women could orgasm. Like, we were shown vibrators and things so what else could they be for? By the age of 16, literally everyone in my peer group had seen at least some porn - girls do orgasm in that, even if it is super fake sometimes. So honestly, that sort of lack of knowledge seems like a different world to me.\n\n\nI wasn't trying to make it seem like I pitied you, and I'm sorry if it came off that way. I think it's sad that girls may be growing up (or may have done in the past) thinking that sex is entirely for the pleasure of men, is humiliating, etc. That makes me sad. But there are also plenty of girls, especially now in the internet age where any sort of porn you like and detailed information on sexual matters is just a few clicks away, who are more able to discover precisely what they want and what they're into sexually from a younger age. Obviously they are still children, but fuck, I had discovered all of my major turn-ons at least in terms of scenarios/types of partner well before I was 16. And it wasn't like I was having sex or anything - I just watched porn, read stories, and fantasised by myself. And just as I'm sure there were many girls who struggled with their sexuality as you did, I highly doubt I was an anomaly either. \n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I skimmed through the talk you linked, so I may have missed something but she seemed to be talking about girls she&amp;#39;d spoken to personally - illuminating probably, but hardly scientific.

It&amp;#39;s unfortunate that many young people feel negatively about sex, and I&amp;#39;m not disputing that at all - however, there are obviously many too that don&amp;#39;t, and that is why I don&amp;#39;t find the OP hard to believe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sex ed consisted of anatomy lessons that included diagrams of the vaginal area and clitoris, covering what happens during puberty etc, talks on different types of contraceptives, sex toys and the like. While it&amp;#39;s true that I don&amp;#39;t think we ever &lt;em&gt;expressly&lt;/em&gt; were taught about relationships etc, we were told several times about erogenous zones in both men and women, in the context of each type of lesson. Honestly it would never have occurred to me that someone wouldn&amp;#39;t have realised women could orgasm. Like, we were shown vibrators and things so what else could they be for? By the age of 16, literally everyone in my peer group had seen at least some porn - girls do orgasm in that, even if it is super fake sometimes. So honestly, that sort of lack of knowledge seems like a different world to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t trying to make it seem like I pitied you, and I&amp;#39;m sorry if it came off that way. I think it&amp;#39;s sad that girls may be growing up (or may have done in the past) thinking that sex is entirely for the pleasure of men, is humiliating, etc. That makes me sad. But there are also plenty of girls, especially now in the internet age where any sort of porn you like and detailed information on sexual matters is just a few clicks away, who are more able to discover precisely what they want and what they&amp;#39;re into sexually from a younger age. Obviously they are still children, but fuck, I had discovered all of my major turn-ons at least in terms of scenarios/types of partner well before I was 16. And it wasn&amp;#39;t like I was having sex or anything - I just watched porn, read stories, and fantasised by myself. And just as I&amp;#39;m sure there were many girls who struggled with their sexuality as you did, I highly doubt I was an anomaly either. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dgccr82", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492395078.0, "created_utc": 1492366278.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc1d46", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ftylerr", "parent_id": "t1_dgba8ps", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "If it was just me, I would have said it's anecdotal at best.
