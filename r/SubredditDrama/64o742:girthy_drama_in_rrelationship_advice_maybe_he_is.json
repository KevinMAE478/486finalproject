Here&amp;#39;s what they wrote about the nuking:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s a choice we&amp;#39;ve made because every...single...time a post shows up on SRD, we get a flood of 0 day accounts posting in that thread, usually abusing the OP. We report them, for all the good it does - Reddit isn&amp;#39;t exactly good at banning to any degree that actually STOPS multi-accounting. But make no mistake, those people start in your sub... see the cross-post there... follow it here... and create a throw-away in another browser/session to feed the drama here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you do anything to stop them from doing it? Of course not. No one, including Reddit admins, can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can stop feeding the flames by cross-posting our stuff... and I appreciate your willingness to do that. We absolutely get trolls who like to create dramatic posts about insane situations just to stir up the community... but in the main, most of our users are people finding themselves in crisis within a relationship, who just need some help finding their way. Having their pleas for help then flooded with a bunch of 0 day trolls, sucks. So we appreciate anything you do that helps mitigate that - including, and perhaps especially stopping the cross-posting from our sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, rereading our series of exchanges now, it makes me want to start linking to them again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dg4rga7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491967092.0, "created_utc": 1491938292.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4qig9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FistofanAngryGoddess", "parent_id": "t1_dg4nngs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm a little confusing by their thread nuking, seems a bit extreme.
