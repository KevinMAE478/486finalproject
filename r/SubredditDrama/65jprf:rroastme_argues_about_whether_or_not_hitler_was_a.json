Communism does not necessarily blame &amp;#39;the rich&amp;#39; (more accurately capitalists, which is not quite the same thing) as much as it blames the system of capitalism. Of course, the rich (or capitalists, but the distinction means less in this case) are frequently scapegoated by Communist demagogues, but scapegoating is what demagogues do no matter what beliefs they hold. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is, I believe, the crucial difference. Nazism scapegoats people by its very nature, whereas it is a possible outcome of Communist rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To end on a strong note: All together now: &amp;quot;Fuck off you communist piece of shit, how dare you condone genocide&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dgbgn2s", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492333787.0, "created_utc": 1492304987.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbbwam", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "30blues", "parent_id": "t1_dgaszyt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 1, "body": "The best part is that you can't even tell the difference between them\n\n&gt;Communists: The rich are spreading their capitalist propaganda and they're the reason I'm still a walmart greeter at 35\n\n&gt;Nazis: The jews are spreading their jew propaganda and they're the reason I'm still a walmart greeter at 35\n\nAll together now: \"How dare you compare us!!!
