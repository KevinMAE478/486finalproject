I went there a few times thinking the TERF stuff might have been overblown, but nah, it&amp;#39;s nasty.  Scrolled through /new/ just now and saw at least 4 posts in the last day criticizing trans* people.  Nooooo thank you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yeah, it&amp;#39;s frustrating because, while there is some overlap because there are plenty of people who want to cover regressive attitudes with a progressive label, there are just as many people on the other side who are fine with maintaining the status quo with a progressive label (i.e. sex-positive feminists who are unwilling to openly criticize anything regarding sex because consent magically erases all cultural context, or libertarian feminists who think any type of government action to promote equality is oppressive and paternalistic).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever, either way I wish TERFs would just stop talking about anything other than their transphobic bullshit.  They&amp;#39;re losing that battle anyway.  Stay in your corner and leave all the other issues alone.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dg9qh6x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492231961.0, "created_utc": 1492203161.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9nhum", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 11, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rooftop_jenkem_farm", "parent_id": "t1_dg8t6if", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "i agree with you (seemingly in opposition to the rest of this thread?) that sex negativity does not necessarily have anything to do with trans exclusivity. intuitively that doesn't make any sense.\n\nthat being said, the original linked post takes place in somewhere called r/gendercritical, which strikes me, just from reading their sidebar, as a trans-exclusive community. i assume that's where people are getting the \"TERF!\" stuff from.\n\nwhat makes less sense is the contrary reaction of this thread, i.e. \"lol terfs are so sex-negative they hate blowjobs.\" i know plenty of self-identified \"sex negative\" feminists who absolutely regard transwomen as \"real\" women and i have read plenty of trans-exclusive feminists who don't necessarily connect the politicization of sexual acts with their strict essentialism of gender identity.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i agree with you (seemingly in opposition to the rest of this thread?) that sex negativity does not necessarily have anything to do with trans exclusivity. intuitively that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;that being said, the original linked post takes place in somewhere called &lt;a href=\"/r/gendercritical\"&gt;r/gendercritical&lt;/a&gt;, which strikes me, just from reading their sidebar, as a trans-exclusive community. i assume that&amp;#39;s where people are getting the &amp;quot;TERF!&amp;quot; stuff from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;what makes less sense is the contrary reaction of this thread, i.e. &amp;quot;lol terfs are so sex-negative they hate blowjobs.&amp;quot; i know plenty of self-identified &amp;quot;sex negative&amp;quot; feminists who absolutely regard transwomen as &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; women and i have read plenty of trans-exclusive feminists who don&amp;#39;t necessarily connect the politicization of sexual acts with their strict essentialism of gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dg9nhum", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492228371.0, "created_utc": 1492199571.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8t6if", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 27, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NANAs_Mic", "parent_id": "t1_dg8jwgi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This doesn't really have anything to do with being TERF, though.
