It reminds me of drama we occasionally see when someone suggests that expecting an hour or more of uninterrupted gaming time to play MMOs per day, or you&amp;#39;ll lose your shit, is unrealistic. Uh, if you have a spouse, a job, and maybe kids, more than one hour of uninterrupted &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; on a daily basis is unrealistic unless you&amp;#39;ve structured your life around eschewing any interruptions to gaming. And if you go that far to isolate yourself in order to play videogames\u200b, yeah, that sounds like an issue. Sure, you can have hobbies you spend hours on a week. But if you get to the point you&amp;#39;re biting off someone&amp;#39;s head because they&amp;#39;re asking what you&amp;#39;d like to do for dinner, it&amp;#39;s not a hobby as much as it&amp;#39;s an addiction.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dg8rzlk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492174137.0, "created_utc": 1492145337.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 103}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8ns53", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 128, "report_reasons": null, "author": "brendamn", "parent_id": "t1_dg8m6j3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah I'm 15 years clean and use to be pretty involved with recovery.
