That is, some things happening might make a good person to hold some racist opinions, and vice versa, if a person holds some racist opinions that doesn't mean that they are forever lost and should be send to a gulag to die there.\n\nFrom that opinion follows an extremely non-obvious idea: that when some Chinese-Australian shop-owner turns racist because he had been robbed twenty times by a black gang, with the police doing fuck all about it because afraid of being called racists themselves and fucking fired, **maybe** the correct way of laying blame is not to say that since this guy became a racist fuck him, maybe the correct way is to say that it's the liberal ruling party that caused the police to ignore that guy's complaints and made him into a racist is to blame. And their holier than thou electorate that caused them to do that.\n\nLike, the moment they get their shit together and go and imprison the fuckers who were robbing him, he would stop being racist. Well, not the exact moment, that's a bad thing about this shit, that there's one hell of inertia about the results of insane liberal policies being crushed by the cast-iron butt of reality. But still.\n\nAnd also, maybe some time later, after the immigrant youth gangs get the message that they can be actually prosecuted for stealing shit, they'd stop stealing shit and start being productive members of the society. Sure, that'd involve a lot of other support measures, and there should be lots of support measures, but making it so that stealing shit is no longer a low-effort, high-reward activity is the absolutely necessary first step.\n\nThe same thing that I said about social policies inadvertently turning people into racists fully applies here as well, retarded social policies turn the Australian Sudanese immigrants into shoplifting thugs. They aren't shoplifting thugs because of their genetics, they do it because it's a low-effort high-reward thing that they are not being punished for (and also the inadequacy of integration programs, but first and foremost because of not being punished for).\n\nAnd that all is a well deserved (for whites, not for the poor people doing the robbery or being robbed) fruit of the actual real world political correctness, the way we can't point out the problem without being called racists, and only actual racists promising to do something about the problem.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I strongly believe that the Sudanese-Australians have the inalienable right to Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness.

That is, some things happening might make a good person to hold some racist opinions, and vice versa, if a person holds some racist opinions that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they are forever lost and should be send to a gulag to die there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From that opinion follows an extremely non-obvious idea: that when some Chinese-Australian shop-owner turns racist because he had been robbed twenty times by a black gang, with the police doing fuck all about it because afraid of being called racists themselves and fucking fired, &lt;strong&gt;maybe&lt;/strong&gt; the correct way of laying blame is not to say that since this guy became a racist fuck him, maybe the correct way is to say that it&amp;#39;s the liberal ruling party that caused the police to ignore that guy&amp;#39;s complaints and made him into a racist is to blame. And their holier than thou electorate that caused them to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, the moment they get their shit together and go and imprison the fuckers who were robbing him, he would stop being racist. Well, not the exact moment, that&amp;#39;s a bad thing about this shit, that there&amp;#39;s one hell of inertia about the results of insane liberal policies being crushed by the cast-iron butt of reality. But still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also, maybe some time later, after the immigrant youth gangs get the message that they can be actually prosecuted for stealing shit, they&amp;#39;d stop stealing shit and start being productive members of the society. Sure, that&amp;#39;d involve a lot of other support measures, and there should be lots of support measures, but making it so that stealing shit is no longer a low-effort, high-reward activity is the absolutely necessary first step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same thing that I said about social policies inadvertently turning people into racists fully applies here as well, retarded social policies turn the Australian Sudanese immigrants into shoplifting thugs.
