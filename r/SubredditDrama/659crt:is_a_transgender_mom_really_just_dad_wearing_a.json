Similar hormonal/developmental abnormalities that can lead to people having intersex physical developments can also lead to a psychological gender identity, including bodily dysphoria, at odds with one&amp;#39;s physical development. Like, it is a scientific fact that the same way certain conditions can result in someone with testes and a female physical development, certain conditions can also result in someone with the psychological development for being female and male physical development.
