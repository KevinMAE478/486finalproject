I ask not to come up with some dumb &amp;quot;gotcha!&amp;quot; or anything, but because that&amp;#39;s sort of the situation I&amp;#39;m finding myself in. I have a vegan friend who loves showing me stuff like videos of pigs drowning in an attempt to escape slaughter, but I look at them and I just think &amp;quot;those employees fucked up,&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;killing animals is wrong!&amp;quot; That said, I can&amp;#39;t deny the massive negative environmental impact animal use has, and I do think animal suffering ought to be minimised wherever possible, so if I was really being true to my morals, I wouldn&amp;#39;t consume any animal products except those I produce myself. I&amp;#39;ve already cut out most meat and dairy from my diet and stopped buying leather and wool, but I guess I did always suspect that even if I did take the final steps, I would still be completely unwelcome in places like &lt;a href=\"/r/vegan\"&gt;/r/vegan&lt;/a&gt; for not consuming animal products for the wrong reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dge9eyn", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492498189.0, "created_utc": 1492469389.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x9zp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x9zp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgebs4r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AsDevilsRun", "parent_id": "t1_dge9wzr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wouldn't that still be plant-based?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;#39;t that still be plant-based?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dgebs4r", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492501266.0, "created_utc": 1492472466.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dge9wzr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gokutheguy", "parent_id": "t1_dge8akj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I know vegans who live off oreos and hard liquor so I don't think plant based is the best descriptor.
