She was a tank. She could rip through everything, go toe to toe with anything the game could throw at her. Every single time I needed her to hit, she came through. Didn&amp;#39;t matter if it was 38% or 98%, she was levelling whatever the hell she shot at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she got mind controlled and turned her voodoo witchcraft accuracy against the rest of the squad. RIP in peace, boys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Actually, I don&amp;#39;t think she ever died. Before she had the chance, I discovered that Enemy Within was actually just EU but better, rather than a continuation of EU to be played after the fact, so I switched over. I like to think she&amp;#39;s still in my hard drive, swatting aliens.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dg5kt7w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492008226.0, "created_utc": 1491979426.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64si1n", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg584ry", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 8, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fiercedeity05", "parent_id": "t1_dg4wmj8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My frontline man was the guy.
