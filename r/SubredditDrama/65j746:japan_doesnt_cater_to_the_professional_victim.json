If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"pedophile family\" you're referring to the paraphilia grouping of chronophilia, which includes things from nepiophibilia to hebepohilia to gerontophilia.\n\nSo your reasoning for calling ephebophilia pedophilia is because random people \"call the ephebopophilia ones pedophiles?\" Let's get teleiophiles and mesophiles in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape?

Goddamn, those comments.\n\nAll of which basically treat the intentional choices of what to put into a game as a kind of accidental found art \"well these are just two people.\"  Fuck that diegetic bullshit,\n\n&gt;This sums it up pretty well. The game isn't saying \"lol gay people!\" it's just two creepazoids, who just happen to be gay.\n\nAnd who just happen to be the only two gay characters in the game.\n\nSo the joke is that the only characterization of gay people in the game are \"creepazoids\"?  And that's somehow not just making fun of gay people?\n\n&gt;If people actually get offended over this they're taking it way too far imo, I don't see how someone could look at the two guys in the game and just go \"oh yeah those are regular gay people\", it's an obvious joke.\n\nRight, but the game then doesn't have any regular gay people.  The only portrayal of homosexuals in the game is \"an obvious joke.\"\n\nHow is that better?\n\n&gt;it doesn't need to include every race or sexuality perfectly portrayed because it's a fictional story for Christ sakes.\n\nThat's true.  And while there'd have been *some* hemming and hawing about just not having any homosexual characters, this is worse.  They intentionally included homosexual characters solely to be the butt of a joke.\n\n&gt;Look, there's quite a gap of difference in culture between the west and Japan. You gotta accept that. They view homosexuals in a completely different light\n\nAh the good old \"well they're Japanese so of course they're going to portray homosexuals in a negative way\" bit.\n\nBeing Japanese doesn't make them immune from criticism.\n\n&gt;Persona 5 wasn't made with the western public in mind, so Atlus doesn't bother trying to not offend anyone with their jokes.\n\nThat doesn't make it not offensive.  \"The creator doesn't give a shit\" doesn't change whether it's actually bad.\n\n&gt;Can't there be at least slightly negative portrayals of homosexuals in video games? \n\nThere absolutely can be.  Though it isn't \"slightly\" negative.  The bigger problem is that this is the only representation of homosexuals in the game.\n\n&gt;Why does it all have to be sunshine and roses? Can we crest the point of caring and just treat everyone equally?\n\nWe sure can!\n\nBut that would mean rough parity between \"proportion of gay characters who are shown positively or negatively\" and \"proportion of straight characters who are shown positively or negatively\".\n\nEquality *isn't* \"of the hundreds of straight characters a dozen are awful human beings\" as compared to \"of the two gay characters, both are awful.\"\n\n&gt;so you want games to never ever offend anybody. no character can ever be shown in a negative way or made fun off because some group will always cry.\n\nA character can be shown in a negative way.\n\nWhen a discriminated-against and often-disparaged group's *only* representation is a negatively portrayed character, that's bad.\n\n&gt;There is literally a gym teacher who's molesting and raping/beating kids. Do you think all gym teachers playing the game are fucking offended by that? \n\nYep, because \"the job you happen to have which isn't normally associated with the stereotype of being a rapist is shown in a negative character\" is *exactly* the same as \"the immutable sexual orientation you have no choice in which is subject to the stereotype of being mincing and sexually aggressive/deviant is shown to be those things.\"\n\nIt's why I'm *obviously* just as offended by lawyer jokes as by jokes about the holocaust.\n\n&gt;\nAs for wanting gay romance options in P5 uh...well, as a writer, I never write a character with their sexuality in mind. I've written gay, lesbian, and bi characters...but not often. Possibly because I'm straight, but most likely because, again, I do not write characters with sexuality in mind.\n\nWhich *really* means that you write them with a default sexuality of \"straight\", and anything else would need a reason to deviate from that.  Which is kind of part of the problem.\n\n&gt;note how the only problem with that gay pair was how uh, rape-y they were\n\nYep, and when those are the only gay people in the game, that's kind of a problem.\n\n&gt;P5 is about justice to those ignored by society, or mislabeled\n\nYep, it's about how stereotyping is bad.  Which is part of why it's bad that their only representation of homosexuality is a stereotype.\n\n&gt;That doesn't mean they need to repeat it.\n\nWhich would be less of a problem if they just didn't include gay characters at all.  That'd have been shitty (especially since the entire point of the game is to break down shitty social constructs and retrograde societal restrictions), but less shitty than including gay characters for the *sole purpose* of making a joke at their expense.\n\nRemember, Mr. Author that *none of this is unintentional*.  This isn't a documentary, those characters were put there entirely on purpose.\n\n&gt;As a foreigner, I will leave it up to them to decide whether or not they should change their depiction of homosexuality.\n\nOh fuck that.\n\nCulture is always subject to criticism.\n\n&gt;They are just playing on the gay stereotype of outgoing and like to have fun.\n\nAnd the gay stereotype of mincing and sexually aggressive.\n\nWhich is kind of a problem when your only gay characters are a stereotype.\n\n&gt;I'm overweight and was bullied pretty heavy in middle school for that but when Hanako from P4 crushed that scooter with her ass I just sat there and laughed for minutes.\n\n\"By personal actions I belong to a group which was made fun of, therefore my view can delegitimize the feelings of people who had no choice in their group being made fun of.\"\n\nOne wonders if he'd apply the logic to \"I'm fat, therefore if I don't care about being called fatty you don't get to complain about being called the n-word.\"\n\n&gt;IMO it is better to not do something, than to create plot holes and disconnects. Or make characters that is simply lacking in depth\n\nYep, because if someone is going to be anything other than default heterosexual that needs some kind of justification.\"\n\nI also like that apparently things like \"is attracted to the different races including giant goat people\" fits within this asshole's suspension of disbelief, but \"could be attracted to a man or a woman depending on who the PC is\" is just too wacky.\n\n&gt;Uh, \"...'flamboyant' men as a joke\" is common in East Asians work, and yes, used as a joke\n\nThat doesn't make it better.\n\n&gt;Gay male here. The game portrays straight men much worse and social links where the MC is dating adults is awful - but it's cheeky humor. I think people are being over sensitive.\n\nThe problem is that straight men are also portrayed much better.\n\nI'm not a gay man, and I wouldn't gainsay someone else not having the same reaction as I did.  Especially for themselves.\n\nBut I can't help but think of it the same way I would if there were a game with one Jewish character who was a greedy dude with a huge nose.\n\n&gt;And why get offended by that when an actual rape happened in the first arc\n\nBecause the rape was portrayed as both *bad*, and an aberration from the normal (and good) other heterosexual male characters.\n\nIf the entire main cast (and positively-represented supporting characters) were women, and the *sole male characters* were rapists, that would be decried as anti-male.\n\nAnd let's say all of those defenses really do reflect Atlus' approach and attitude.\n\nThat makes me not like Atlus.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing like a thread full of fans to make me ashamed of liking something.

They view homosexuals in a completely different light&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ah the good old &amp;quot;well they&amp;#39;re Japanese so of course they&amp;#39;re going to portray homosexuals in a negative way&amp;quot; bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being Japanese doesn&amp;#39;t make them immune from criticism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Persona 5 wasn&amp;#39;t made with the western public in mind, so Atlus doesn&amp;#39;t bother trying to not offend anyone with their jokes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t make it not offensive.  &amp;quot;The creator doesn&amp;#39;t give a shit&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t change whether it&amp;#39;s actually bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t there be at least slightly negative portrayals of homosexuals in video games? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There absolutely can be.  Though it isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;slightly&amp;quot; negative.  The bigger problem is that this is the only representation of homosexuals in the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why does it all have to be sunshine and roses? Can we crest the point of caring and just treat everyone equally?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sure can!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that would mean rough parity between &amp;quot;proportion of gay characters who are shown positively or negatively&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;proportion of straight characters who are shown positively or negatively&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Equality &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;of the hundreds of straight characters a dozen are awful human beings&amp;quot; as compared to &amp;quot;of the two gay characters, both are awful.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;so you want games to never ever offend anybody. no character can ever be shown in a negative way or made fun off because some group will always cry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A character can be shown in a negative way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When a discriminated-against and often-disparaged group&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; representation is a negatively portrayed character, that&amp;#39;s bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is literally a gym teacher who&amp;#39;s molesting and raping/beating kids. Do you think all gym teachers playing the game are fucking offended by that? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep, because &amp;quot;the job you happen to have which isn&amp;#39;t normally associated with the stereotype of being a rapist is shown in a negative character&amp;quot; is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same as &amp;quot;the immutable sexual orientation you have no choice in which is subject to the stereotype of being mincing and sexually aggressive/deviant is shown to be those things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; just as offended by lawyer jokes as by jokes about the holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As for wanting gay romance options in P5 uh...well, as a writer, I never write a character with their sexuality in mind. I&amp;#39;ve written gay, lesbian, and bi characters...but not often. Possibly because I&amp;#39;m straight, but most likely because, again, I do not write characters with sexuality in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; means that you write them with a default sexuality of &amp;quot;straight&amp;quot;, and anything else would need a reason to deviate from that.  Which is kind of part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;note how the only problem with that gay pair was how uh, rape-y they were&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep, and when those are the only gay people in the game, that&amp;#39;s kind of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;P5 is about justice to those ignored by society, or mislabeled&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep, it&amp;#39;s about how stereotyping is bad.  Which is part of why it&amp;#39;s bad that their only representation of homosexuality is a stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t mean they need to repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which would be less of a problem if they just didn&amp;#39;t include gay characters at all.  That&amp;#39;d have been shitty (especially since the entire point of the game is to break down shitty social constructs and retrograde societal restrictions), but less shitty than including gay characters for the &lt;em&gt;sole purpose&lt;/em&gt; of making a joke at their expense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, Mr. Author that &lt;em&gt;none of this is unintentional&lt;/em&gt;.  This isn&amp;#39;t a documentary, those characters were put there entirely on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a foreigner, I will leave it up to them to decide whether or not they should change their depiction of homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh fuck that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Culture is always subject to criticism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are just playing on the gay stereotype of outgoing and like to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the gay stereotype of mincing and sexually aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is kind of a problem when your only gay characters are a stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m overweight and was bullied pretty heavy in middle school for that but when Hanako from P4 crushed that scooter with her ass I just sat there and laughed for minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;By personal actions I belong to a group which was made fun of, therefore my view can delegitimize the feelings of people who had no choice in their group being made fun of.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One wonders if he&amp;#39;d apply the logic to &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fat, therefore if I don&amp;#39;t care about being called fatty you don&amp;#39;t get to complain about being called the n-word.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;IMO it is better to not do something, than to create plot holes and disconnects. Or make characters that is simply lacking in depth&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep, because if someone is going to be anything other than default heterosexual that needs some kind of justification.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also like that apparently things like &amp;quot;is attracted to the different races including giant goat people&amp;quot; fits within this asshole&amp;#39;s suspension of disbelief, but &amp;quot;could be attracted to a man or a woman depending on who the PC is&amp;quot; is just too wacky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Uh, &amp;quot;...&amp;#39;flamboyant&amp;#39; men as a joke&amp;quot; is common in East Asians work, and yes, used as a joke&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t make it better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gay male here. The game portrays straight men much worse and social links where the MC is dating adults is awful - but it&amp;#39;s cheeky humor. I think people are being over sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that straight men are also portrayed much better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a gay man, and I wouldn&amp;#39;t gainsay someone else not having the same reaction as I did.  Especially for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t help but think of it the same way I would if there were a game with one Jewish character who was a greedy dude with a huge nose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And why get offended by that when an actual rape happened in the first arc&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the rape was portrayed as both &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, and an aberration from the normal (and good) other heterosexual male characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the entire main cast (and positively-represented supporting characters) were women, and the &lt;em&gt;sole male characters&lt;/em&gt; were rapists, that would be decried as anti-male.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And let&amp;#39;s say all of those defenses really do reflect Atlus&amp;#39; approach and attitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That makes me not like Atlus.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dgbgmuy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492333777.0, "created_utc": 1492304977.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65j746", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgavedb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 21, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Teath123", "parent_id": "t3_65j746", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It didn't offend me, it just made me roll my eyes that we're still having stuff like this in games, its just cringy.
