It&amp;#39;s just inherent in the issue. Our cultural and political institutions are founded on white supremacy. While it&amp;#39;s no longer as overt, it&amp;#39;s still there. I&amp;#39;m really not sure why that&amp;#39;s so controversial. Yes, I define something differently. It&amp;#39;s supported by history and philosophy. I&amp;#39;m not really sure why I should just believe the other side&amp;#39;s definition is right just because they another definition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that I support all of these measures.

It&amp;#39;s not the one I use.
