It was like they were trying to make users leave and hate the mods more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching this whole thing unfold, I thought I was probably just wearing a tinfoil hat...but it seemed like &lt;a href=\"/u/dublzz\"&gt;/u/dublzz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/u/bluemerling\"&gt;/u/bluemerling&lt;/a&gt; had planned this in a very calculated attempt to 1. get back at the mods in &lt;a href=\"/r/NatureIsMetal\"&gt;/r/NatureIsMetal&lt;/a&gt; by using reddit&amp;#39;s hatred for censorship, and 2. Grow the new sub he requested from &lt;a href=\"/u/Hopesandoval\"&gt;/u/Hopesandoval&lt;/a&gt; and offered to help &amp;#39;launch&amp;#39; it to get more users. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently I wasn&amp;#39;t the only one with suspicions because the old top mod of &lt;a href=\"/r/NatureIsBrutal\"&gt;/r/NatureIsBrutal&lt;/a&gt; made &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Natureisbrutal/comments/64nc1k/ive_just_encountered_some_bizarre_shit_involving/\"&gt;this post today&lt;/a&gt; in the sub after looking more closely into everything...which of course &lt;a href=\"/u/dublzz\"&gt;/u/dublzz&lt;/a&gt; deleted(even though he is a warrior against censorship). Please excuse the wall of text, I&amp;#39;m going to post exactly what was in &lt;a href=\"/u/Hopesandoval\"&gt;/u/Hopesandoval&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s post because he put a lot of effort into finding links, but I&amp;#39;m sure he would be willing to provide screencaps to verify, it was deleted too fast for me to get anything but the source text. The post read:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This might get long. Bare with me. I&amp;#39;m either going to come off as a nutjob or there may be something here...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been suspicious of dublzz for months. It all started when I noticed the mod team of &lt;a href=\"/r/NatureIsFuckingLit\"&gt;/r/NatureIsFuckingLit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The subreddit was created on Sunday Sept. 18 16:12:38 2016 UTC &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/NIFL_\"&gt;/u/NIFL_&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s account was created Sunday Sept. 18 18:43:35 UTC&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/NatureIsFuckingLit\"&gt;/u/NatureIsFuckingLit&lt;/a&gt; was created Sunday Sept 18 18:53:33 UTC&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the thing is, dublzz acts like there are multiple people running this sub. And most people just assume it&amp;#39;s true since there are 3 accounts. I made a comment pointing this out, maybe a month ago, but I think I deleted it because I was afraid he would ban me from NIFL. When I first handed over &lt;a href=\"/r/NatureIsBrutal\"&gt;/r/NatureIsBrutal&lt;/a&gt; to him he created &lt;a href=\"/u/NatureIsBrutal\"&gt;/u/NatureIsBrutal&lt;/a&gt; and made it the second mod. The time stamps on the accounts and that right there make it pretty clear they&amp;#39;re all his accounts. Yet he repeatedly referred to himself as &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;all of us&amp;quot; when he was talking to me about the NIFL mods helping grow this sub. I ignored it for the time being and played along because I genuinely thought he could be useful in growing this sub since the /Metal mods were not getting their shit together. But then things started getting weird:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/trendingsubreddits/comments/64bx29/trending_subreddits_for_20170409_rnatureisbrutal/dg0z2rk/\"&gt;In the /r/TrendingSubreddits thread yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/MostOfAllFuckYou\"&gt;/u/MostOfAllFuckYou&lt;/a&gt; pointed out some sketchy occurrences in the past with dublzz. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/Imthejuggernautbitch\"&gt;/u/Imthejuggernautbitch&lt;/a&gt; noted the same thing &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/645phg/moderators_discover_that_reddit_is_brutal_when/dg0220z/?context=3\"&gt;in this /r/SubRedditDrama thread 2 days ago&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/571g6v/someone_just_used_reddit_to_force_their_youtube/\"&gt;the link to the /r/HailCorporate post from /u/Imthejuggernautbitch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I can&amp;#39;t verify what he is saying in this thread because if you click every single link he provides, they have all been deleted and &lt;a href=\"/u/--zach--\"&gt;/u/--zach--&lt;/a&gt; has been suspended. That itself is suspicious. If there was nothing there, then why has it all been deleted? And why was &lt;a href=\"/u/--zach--\"&gt;/u/--zach--&lt;/a&gt; suspended?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is where it gets really weird. &lt;a href=\"/u/dublzz\"&gt;/u/dublzz&lt;/a&gt; is a mod of &lt;a href=\"/r/political\"&gt;/r/political&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"/u/endemickeyChain\"&gt;/u/endemickeyChain&lt;/a&gt; is also a mod of &lt;a href=\"/r/political\"&gt;/r/political&lt;/a&gt;.

(Edit- Fixed link) What rational person would make these comments unless they were purposely sabotaging the sub. Her account was made Sept. 24 2016, 6 days after the NatureIsFuckingLit alt mod accounts were made. Coincidence? Hmmm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/ManofTheNightsWatch\"&gt;/u/ManofTheNightsWatch&lt;/a&gt;, the current top mod of /Metal, &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/natureismetal/comments/64c1kp/the_end_of_all_drama_we_as_people_of_the_sub_have/\"&gt;accused BlueMerling of being a &amp;quot;sleeper agent&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; in his mod post yesterday. Most people probably thought he was saving face, but now I think he had a valid point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/endemickeyChain\"&gt;/u/endemickeyChain&lt;/a&gt; was the user who made &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5rf8xn/remember_to_unsubscribe_an_rnatureismetal_tale_of/\"&gt;this highly in depth post to SubRedditDrama 2 months ago&lt;/a&gt; detailing the previous mod drama in natureismetal. You will notice the post goes out of it&amp;#39;s way to praise BlueMerling:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/BlueMerling\"&gt;/u/BlueMerling&lt;/a&gt; can stay, of course, since she is very nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That really nice mod I mentioned earlier introduced herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what are the chances endemickeyChain and BlueMerling both just happened to be the only two people to have posted that random Youtube video and both played a role in the mod drama over the last few days and months. It has already been documented that dublzz used alt accounts. It has been documented that he uses alt accounts to fill out mod positions. Is he behind this entire thing? Just biding his time, waiting for the right time to reclaim his metal sub?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also suspect &lt;a href=\"/u/58Ninjas\"&gt;/u/58Ninjas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"/u/WayneWong_\"&gt;/u/WayneWong_&lt;/a&gt; could be other alt accounts of his. But I&amp;#39;m not positive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There appeared to have been some manipulation from dublzz &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5rf8xn/remember_to_unsubscribe_an_rnatureismetal_tale_of/dd71pae/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; dublzz has likely been using alt accounts to stir up trouble. And yes, I know, I have no life. Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also &lt;a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Natureisbrutal/comments/646vta/reddit_is_brutal/dg1o8lq/?context=3\"&gt;removed this comment yesterday&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"/u/rynosaur94\"&gt;/u/rynosaur94&lt;/a&gt;.

He then took to modmail to tell &lt;a href=\"/u/HopeSandoval\"&gt;/u/HopeSandoval&lt;/a&gt; to stop stirring drama...and the real kicker, &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/WJ7Wv\"&gt;ADMITTED&lt;/a&gt; to using alts to manipulate users into leaving &lt;a href=\"/r/NatureIsMetal\"&gt;/r/NatureIsMetal&lt;/a&gt; and joining &lt;a href=\"/r/NatureIsBrutal\"&gt;/r/NatureIsBrutal&lt;/a&gt;. Then he stated that he did it &amp;#39;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/5ZCws\"&gt;for fun and because he thought he could do a better job&lt;/a&gt; after he was demodded from natureismetal&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks for the gold, but it should go to &lt;a href=\"/u/kesha_paul\"&gt;/u/kesha_paul&lt;/a&gt;, not me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "TL;DR from /u/riemann1413:\n\n&gt; I'll give another TL;DR since it is a lot of text with a lot of links.

You will notice the post goes out of it's way to praise BlueMerling:\n\n\n&gt;/u/BlueMerling can stay, of course, since she is very nice.\n\n\n&gt;That really nice mod I mentioned earlier introduced herself.\n\n\nSo what are the chances endemickeyChain and BlueMerling both just happened to be the only two people to have posted that random Youtube video and both played a role in the mod drama over the last few days and months. It has already been documented that dublzz used alt accounts. It has been documented that he uses alt accounts to fill out mod positions. Is he behind this entire thing? Just biding his time, waiting for the right time to reclaim his metal sub?\n \n\nI also suspect /u/58Ninjas /u/WayneWong_ could be other alt accounts of his. But I'm not positive. \n\n\nThere appeared to have been some manipulation from dublzz [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5rf8xn/remember_to_unsubscribe_an_rnatureismetal_tale_of/dd71pae/) as well.\n\n\n**TL;DR:** dublzz has likely been using alt accounts to stir up trouble. And yes, I know, I have no life. Thanks. \n\nHe also [removed this comment yesterday](https://np.reddit.com/r/Natureisbrutal/comments/646vta/reddit_is_brutal/dg1o8lq/?context=3) from /u/rynosaur94. Which I found to be pretty ironic considering his post to /Metal. What does he have to hide that he felt the need to delete that comment?] ]\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n/u/HopeSandoval had tried to message /u/dublzz several times about his concerns before he made the post in the subreddit, but /u/dublzz was a ghost until he saw and removed the post with accusations against him. He then took to modmail to tell /u/HopeSandoval to stop stirring drama...and the real kicker, [ADMITTED](http://imgur.com/a/WJ7Wv) to using alts to manipulate users into leaving /r/NatureIsMetal and joining /r/NatureIsBrutal. Then he stated that he did it '[for fun and because he thought he could do a better job](http://imgur.com/a/5ZCws) after he was demodded from natureismetal'.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, but it should go to /u/kesha_paul, not me.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Buttery!", "id": "64tkue", "gilded": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 3424, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TownIdiot25", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64tkue", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.SubredditDrama", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cpYUmKaVVOOvpyhwApnNTxPFw2G1mZ7NAl_X7XQL-3c.png?s=45e2a7aa9e40263be76723f7498a55ba", "width": 1149, "height": 206}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cpYUmKaVVOOvpyhwApnNTxPFw2G1mZ7NAl_X7XQL-3c.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=f0485375394252fb250167eb8c9c7ae6", "width": 108, "height": 19}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cpYUmKaVVOOvpyhwApnNTxPFw2G1mZ7NAl_X7XQL-3c.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=eb8e398b80ccb189d0e2c11803d659b0", "width": 216, "height": 38}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cpYUmKaVVOOvpyhwApnNTxPFw2G1mZ7NAl_X7XQL-3c.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=ffb3f26230b949ef5e3fe1b244d04b76", "width": 320, "height": 57}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cpYUmKaVVOOvpyhwApnNTxPFw2G1mZ7NAl_X7XQL-3c.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=d6bc580068d664268c259b9875bd9254", "width": 640, "height": 114}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cpYUmKaVVOOvpyhwApnNTxPFw2G1mZ7NAl_X7XQL-3c.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=416da677af1c906acb8c5033d8ac4282", "width": 960, "height": 172}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/cpYUmKaVVOOvpyhwApnNTxPFw2G1mZ7NAl_X7XQL-3c.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=9f5bdef0d02ef005ed79a171b4dc2b77", "width": 1080, "height": 193}], "variants": {}, "id": "lAg0FHz1X_WLR8dc3j8Jfu_z-3XgmPsoBxdslSv7C2w"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "edited": 1492009776.0, "link_flair_css_class": "bu", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/SubredditDrama/comments/64tkue/exmod_of_rnatureismetal_causes_huge_drama_in_the/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491972172.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/64tkue/exmod_of_rnatureismetal_causes_huge_drama_in_the/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Ex-mod of /r/NatureIsMetal causes huge drama in the sub....turns out he spent months planning a take over of the sub using alt accounts.
