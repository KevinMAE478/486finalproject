Clearly having a concern about a possible harsh punishment and the well being of prisoners means you are just going to become a criminal yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said I&amp;#39;m not defending the actions of the swatters, they deserve their punishment for what they did, but the people who do defend them can be doing it for loads of other reasons beyond merely &amp;quot;being swatters themselves&amp;quot;. The thing is, you can debate the merits of a punishment for a crime at the same time agreeing that a given action is in fact a crime. We can both agree that putting people in danger for the sake of a &amp;quot;prank&amp;quot; should be treated seriously, but your sophomoric position on why people might speak up for the human rights of criminals is unsettling to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dg7dsi9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492108141.0, "created_utc": 1492079341.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -34}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652ziu", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ss5b", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652ziu", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7r7pg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 29, "report_reasons": null, "author": "freefrogs", "parent_id": "t1_dg7qlze", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You'd probably be getting a lot less flak if you had said something more in line with what you just said here than what you started the argument with in the other thread, \"...making a prank phone call to the police\", which seems to dismiss the seriousness of the charge with lighter language than the action deserves.\n\nI might agree with you that 20 years is too long and that the US is too focused on \"revenge\" justice rather than rehabilitation (hence our recidivism rate), but the way you wrote your messages was undermining the gravity of his actions, which a lot of reasonable people take issue with.\n\nIt is possible to both think and convey that you believe his actions deserve a lesser punishment without needing to completely undermine the potential consequences and sheer stupidity that is swatting, and completely washing away its severity by calling it a prank in line with putting saran wrap on a toilet seat.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d probably be getting a lot less flak if you had said something more in line with what you just said here than what you started the argument with in the other thread, &amp;quot;...making a prank phone call to the police&amp;quot;, which seems to dismiss the seriousness of the charge with lighter language than the action deserves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might agree with you that 20 years is too long and that the US is too focused on &amp;quot;revenge&amp;quot; justice rather than rehabilitation (hence our recidivism rate), but the way you wrote your messages was undermining the gravity of his actions, which a lot of reasonable people take issue with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is possible to both think and convey that you believe his actions deserve a lesser punishment without needing to completely undermine the potential consequences and sheer stupidity that is swatting, and completely washing away its severity by calling it a prank in line with putting saran wrap on a toilet seat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "SubredditDrama", "name": "t1_dg7r7pg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492128022.0, "created_utc": 1492099222.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7qlze", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -28, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Alberta-canada", "parent_id": "t1_dg7c9zh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SubredditDrama", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why would I \"approve\" of swatting?

Guns owned by the public.\n\nThere is a secondary problem: In aggregate, the actions of the State are the actions of its people. I don't mean that every action a state employee takes is your fault personally, but on balance, it is our votes, our tax dollars, our morals that make up the State. And so we have a responsibility to it, just like a house we'd built or a dog we'd fed.

Sentences are the public saying \"you lose this amount of citizenship.\"\n\nAnd when the State acts falsely, it is the equivalent of all of us getting it wrong. Like a sin spread across an entire people. This is over-simplifying a few thousand years of political theory, but the long and short of it is:\n\n*That anger and sickness you feel when the wrongly accused get set free? That's guilt over the society we've built, and fear that it could turn on any of us.*\n\nSwatting undermines both of those things. It uses a system we're always been afraid of in order to hurt someone for no gain. Whether you or the perpetrator know it or not, swatting hurts the social contract in a way that one assault or even one murder does not. Because it hurts our belief in each other and ourselves.\n\nThere are a lot of trade offs with laws, the police, and all the other trappings of the State. And I'm not here to defend the police or anyone else for the shit they cause.\n\nBut swatting is a separate thing from this (in the way that crash tests, speed limits, and DUI laws are different things).
