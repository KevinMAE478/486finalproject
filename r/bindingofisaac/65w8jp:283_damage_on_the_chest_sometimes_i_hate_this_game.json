I can&amp;#39;t use HP up items!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4th floor, there&amp;#39;s no Breakfast in either the item rooms or the shop!  Woo hoo!  I buy one item, and it restocks with ... Breakfast.  I use the re-roll machine (I&amp;#39;ve got lots of money at that point because I haven&amp;#39;t been buying Breakfast), and one of the items rerolls to ... Breakfast.  I re-roll again and get ... 2 Breakfasts.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This wasn&amp;#39;t a broken run.  I realize the game will default to Breakfast when the item pool is depleted.  That&amp;#39;s not what was happening.  For some reason, the item pool just kept coming up with Breakfast.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bindingofisaac", "name": "t1_dgejx2v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492511299.0, "created_utc": 1492482499.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sxpk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65w8jp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeng71", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kingharbubbles", "parent_id": "t3_65w8jp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bindingofisaac", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Has moms knife\n&gt;complains about damage\n\nLiterally NL", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Has moms knife\ncomplains about damage&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally NL&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "bindingofisaac", "name": "t1_dgeng71", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492515920.0, "created_utc": 1492487120.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sxpk", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65w8jp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgevd8t", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mrocza_", "parent_id": "t3_65w8jp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bindingofisaac", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Try [this mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=880598518).
