After I finally bought it I am watching the videos about it on youtube, and the general consensus seems to be that BF1 is not that good, gets boring after a while, some classes are useless, there is too much grenade spam, and mother of all complaints: the game pushes away skilled players, and invites casuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that I jump into it and literally can not stop playing, of how much fun I am getting out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all I think I get where complaints are coming from. Ever since BF2 skilled players could pretty much dominate the match. You could learn inner mechanics of guns and vehicles to the point you are efficient on most ranges. The culmination of this was BF4 assault class. With such a low recoil, high RPM, good damage projection, and almighty heal + revive a single very skilled player could destroy opposition, and a single well coordinated and skilled squad could win matches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In BF1 this changes. Assault class is changed and it&amp;#39;s weapons are balanced towards short ranges. Medic class is better at mid range, but not really good at anything while having heal + revive. Scouts now have actually dominant long range weapons but the class is far from OP. Support actually has most all all around weapon but it&amp;#39;s high time to kill denies it ability to dominate even to the most skilled players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally like those changes. Takes away an ability for skilled player to always beat average joe no matter the range or strategy used. THIS DOES NOT MEAN skill sealing is too low, cos there is still a plenty of room to master your shooting in ranges that your gun is meant for. For example at close distance, given no prior disadvantages, more skilled assault with better chosen weapon will beat  any class. But on most weapons magazine count will hamper the his to make triple+ kills. To make multikills possible you have to go for worse weapon, and open yourself up to getting beaten but a sold player, who has better weapon for 1v1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This all ads a bit of strategy to it, and in my opinion is an improvement over previous BF games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest flaw is actually server selection, matchmaking, map design and ticket mechanic. We all know skill stat is crap. There is not enough servers where skilled players could make small communities where they actually enjoy themselves. Some maps have such layout that tactically covering just 2 alleys of approach there is no alternative way to push through without vehicles. But have you ever seen 1 vehicle squad and 2 skilled infantry squad actually coordinate an attack in BF? Unless you were at a huge LAN party, you probably never did! And those tickets in conquest... they make people quit trying not just at the end, but as soon as flags are initially taken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people say a well coordinated squad of skilled players can will almost all matches for it&amp;#39;s team. Well in which BF it couldn&amp;#39;t? BF2 after player base was left to only hard core players?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, those are my thoughts. There is no real summary to it.
