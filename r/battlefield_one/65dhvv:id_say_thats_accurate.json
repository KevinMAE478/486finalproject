Steel wool can scratch the metal and also the steel wool will break off small shards and can potentially leave rust stains where the small shards remain in any pitting. Lots and lots of oil during this process. This method is great for removing rust from a firearm. But also, restoring a historical artifact may make the piece worthless, like restoring old coins and antique firearms. Also if you search for gun oil online you may want to be specific and type in firearm oil with Remington or hoppes in the search, turns out there is a sex lube out there for men called gun oil. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "battlefield_one", "name": "t1_dg9rm4j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492233385.0, "created_utc": 1492204585.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3eer4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dhvv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3eer4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dhvv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3eer4", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dhvv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9r161", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Krixus1", "parent_id": "t1_dg9ptce", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/battlefield_one", "controversiality": 0, "body": "well in that case I would say restoring it is totally fine and having it in workable condition would be excellent. lots of people find these old items with some great value and then they \"clean them up\" and are really upset when its worth nothing now lol.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;well in that case I would say restoring it is totally fine and having it in workable condition would be excellent. lots of people find these old items with some great value and then they &amp;quot;clean them up&amp;quot; and are really upset when its worth nothing now lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "battlefield_one", "name": "t1_dg9r161", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492232649.0, "created_utc": 1492203849.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ptce", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "_EXPUNGED_", "parent_id": "t1_dg9p77b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/battlefield_one", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's something my father kept from his military days.
