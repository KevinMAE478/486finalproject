Sure, the US saved the day in the great war. But we really dragged our feet in World War 2.\n\nThe U.S. did much more in World War II than in World War I. \nBelow the Soviet Union the U.S. suffered the most casualties of any allied nation (China is also in a weird spot, but considering the Second Sino Japanese war was considered to have started pre-war, and was somewhat separate from the rest of the war overall, I did not include them).\n\nAlso, the importance of lend lease is often ignored.\n\n &gt;U.S. deliveries through Lend-Lease amounted to $11 billion in materials: over 400,000 jeeps and trucks; 12,000 armored vehicles (including 7,000 tanks, about 1,386[39] of which were M3 Lees and 4,102 M4 Shermans);[40] 11,400 aircraft (4,719 of which were Bell P-39 Airacobras)[41] and 1.75 million tons of food.\n\nAnd that is just to the Soviet Union. When accounting for inflation the U.S. sent a total of $667 billion in aid. \n\n&gt;We stayed out for as long as possible and only entered when Japan forced our hand.\n\nWhat reason did the U.S. have to enter the war prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor?\n\n&gt;but we didn't even intend to necessarily go to war with Germany in World War 2\n\nYes we absolutely did. What evidence do you have to the contrary?\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_first\n\n&gt;First we invaded Africa, leaving the Soviets to fend for themselves even longer.\n\n*We* did not invade Africa, we were supporting the British who had already been fighting there, and the invasion was done so in part specifically to relieve some of the pressure on the Soviet Union. \n\n&gt; Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, had long been demanding a second front be opened to engage the Wehrmacht and relieve pressure on the Red Army, it provided some degree of relief for the Red Army on the Eastern Front by diverting Axis forces to the African theatre, tying them up and destroying them there.\n\nYou don't have to fight arm in arm with an ally to support them. (I'm going to use examples from World War I, because I know more about it than World War II) The Brusilov Offensive on the Eastern front diverted German forces from the Western front, the battle of the Somme diverted German forces from Verdun, the Italian front diverted Austro-Hungarian forces from the Eastern front, etc.\n\n\n&gt;we delayed even further by making an invasion of Italy which cost us many men and earned the Allies comparatively little.\n\nDespite what you imply, Italy was an important objective. Not only in itself that Italy was an Axis power, but again, by fighting in Italy we were preventing German and Italian troops from reinforcing their forces in the East. I don't think you quite understand how harmful it was to Germany to open yet another front against them.\n\n&gt;During this time the Soviets not only halted the once unstoppable German war machine at Moscow, but they did what nobody expected and actually pushed the Germans back with a ferocity never imagined. \n\n\nWhile that is undeniably primarily due to Russian blood and iron, you have to remember that a huge portion of the food and equipment they used in doing so came from the United States. \n\n&gt;Then, nearly two years after we had promised, we finally made the invasion of Normandy. \n\nD-Day is not something that could have been done in 1941. Do you really think that the Allies simply waited until 1944 because they didn't think retaking mainland Europe was important? How do you think the assault would have gone if it was launched while the Germans had air superiority? What about if they still had naval superiority? \n\nAnd isn't it fairly hypocritical for you to keep saying \"we did this, we did that\" and ignoring the other countries who fought with us?

Sure, the US saved the day in the great war. But we really dragged our feet in World War 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. did much more in World War II than in World War I. \nBelow the Soviet Union the U.S. suffered the most casualties of any allied nation (China is also in a weird spot, but considering the Second Sino Japanese war was considered to have started pre-war, and was somewhat separate from the rest of the war overall, I did not include them).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the importance of lend lease is often ignored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;U.S. deliveries through Lend-Lease amounted to $11 billion in materials: over 400,000 jeeps and trucks; 12,000 armored vehicles (including 7,000 tanks, about 1,386[39] of which were M3 Lees and 4,102 M4 Shermans);[40] 11,400 aircraft (4,719 of which were Bell P-39 Airacobras)[41] and 1.75 million tons of food.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that is just to the Soviet Union. When accounting for inflation the U.S. sent a total of $667 billion in aid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We stayed out for as long as possible and only entered when Japan forced our hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What reason did the U.S. have to enter the war prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;but we didn&amp;#39;t even intend to necessarily go to war with Germany in World War 2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes we absolutely did. What evidence do you have to the contrary?\n&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_first\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_first&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First we invaded Africa, leaving the Soviets to fend for themselves even longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; did not invade Africa, we were supporting the British who had already been fighting there, and the invasion was done so in part specifically to relieve some of the pressure on the Soviet Union. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, had long been demanding a second front be opened to engage the Wehrmacht and relieve pressure on the Red Army, it provided some degree of relief for the Red Army on the Eastern Front by diverting Axis forces to the African theatre, tying them up and destroying them there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to fight arm in arm with an ally to support them. (I&amp;#39;m going to use examples from World War I, because I know more about it than World War II) The Brusilov Offensive on the Eastern front diverted German forces from the Western front, the battle of the Somme diverted German forces from Verdun, the Italian front diverted Austro-Hungarian forces from the Eastern front, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;we delayed even further by making an invasion of Italy which cost us many men and earned the Allies comparatively little.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite what you imply, Italy was an important objective. Not only in itself that Italy was an Axis power, but again, by fighting in Italy we were preventing German and Italian troops from reinforcing their forces in the East. I don&amp;#39;t think you quite understand how harmful it was to Germany to open yet another front against them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During this time the Soviets not only halted the once unstoppable German war machine at Moscow, but they did what nobody expected and actually pushed the Germans back with a ferocity never imagined. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While that is undeniably primarily due to Russian blood and iron, you have to remember that a huge portion of the food and equipment they used in doing so came from the United States. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then, nearly two years after we had promised, we finally made the invasion of Normandy. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;D-Day is not something that could have been done in 1941. Do you really think that the Allies simply waited until 1944 because they didn&amp;#39;t think retaking mainland Europe was important? How do you think the assault would have gone if it was launched while the Germans had air superiority?
