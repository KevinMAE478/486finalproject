The tech told me about one that they made for a telecom company that made bundles of fiber optic filiments that then went on to be made into a coupler. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about how labor intensive and costly , and prone to error if you had a person do any kind of task like this? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After each kit was bagged up it was sent across a very sensitive scale conveyor where it was rejected if it was under or over weight. Operator would visually count and if wrong, tear it open and put all the parts back into their respective bowl feeders. The scale was so sensitive that they had to put a plexiglass sheild over it so air flow wouldn&amp;#39;t disrupt the readings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was my favorite machine we ever built, it was really cool to see all the different ways the bowls feeders rejected parts and also the way they would manipulate them to get a preferred orientation if it was an oddly shaped part.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "mechanical_gifs", "name": "t1_dg5419u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491982115.0, "created_utc": 1491953315.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wg6i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64th08", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wg6i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64th08", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wg6i", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64th08", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4x2n1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "8spd", "parent_id": "t1_dg4wyu5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mechanical_gifs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you, this makes sense.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you, this makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "mechanical_gifs", "name": "t1_dg4x2n1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491973310.0, "created_utc": 1491944510.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4wyu5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 111, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Quartinus", "parent_id": "t1_dg4wiqk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mechanical_gifs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Usually these feed automated assembly equipment, something would be located at the output to grab the screws (since they're oriented) and screw them into the product. \n\nProbably just set up as a demonstration, it's an awfully slow and expensive way to move screws between buckets.
