I grew up traveling a lot, I have family members working for US carriers, friends who are pilots, and I&amp;#39;ve spent my entire career as an engineer in the aerospace industry. In the last year alone, I&amp;#39;ve flown across the country dozens of times (work related), and at least once on every major US airline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m pretty familiar with most aspects of the industry. The incident on Sunday is a big deal, but I want to go through what happened and talk about it a little. So, from everything I&amp;#39;ve read, here&amp;#39;s the chain of events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;United Airlines had &lt;del&gt;an overbooked&lt;/del&gt; &lt;strong&gt;edit:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;a fully booked&lt;/em&gt; flight from ORD to SDF.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;UAL also had to ferry a crew from ORD to SDF, and decided to put the crew on the already overbooked flight because said flight was the only one available. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ORD gate agents asked for volunteers to give up their seats, but still permitted passengers to board the planes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gate agents then said the plane would not depart until four volunteers gave up their seats, and increased the offer amount.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gate agents then randomly selected passengers to have their seats pulled. A couple was deplaned without incident and then the doctor was selected.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The doctor refused to give up his seat, stating that he had medical proceedings to attend to in the morning and needed to take that flight.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gate agents continue to order the passenger off the plane, and he again refused and begun to call his lawyer. Gate agents informed him that they would bring airport security and he continued to refuse.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Airport Police showed up and confronted him, passenger continued to refuse to deboard. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Two more police officers arrive and the passenger continues to refuse to deboard.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The video that we&amp;#39;ve all seen begins. The airport police grab the passenger, drag him out of his seat (knocking him unconscious in the process) and off of the plane.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The passenger eventually managed to get back on to the plane, exhibiting symptoms of a serious head injury.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The plane was completely deboarded and cleaned due to biohazards (blood).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On bigger subs, I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of discussion around this issue that tend to gravitate towards these opinions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The airline had no right to revoke his ticket, as he was a paying customer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The airline was using law enforcement illegally to enforce their will.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The airline employees were lazy for wanting to fly to Louisville, instead of driving.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here are my (personal) comments on the chain of events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Airlines should be prohibited from overbooking flights. Yes, I know it is an optimization trick and it keeps ticket prices down, but it&amp;#39;s not really fair to passengers and creates very problematic situations. Airlines should increase ticket prices or cancellation fees if need be, but they should be forced to eat the cost of lost revenue from missed itineraries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is actually a semi-common practice. I don&amp;#39;t know UAL&amp;#39;s specific policies, but airlines generally can&amp;#39;t require their flight crew to have to drive to their destination to make a flight. However, the airline &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; that the plane was already booked to capacity, so planning on the flight crew to take this route was already a fuckup on their part. They could easily have sent the flight crew down on a flight on another airline, even one the next day. Instead, the airline decided to use their own plane which is not illegal, but is problematic for passengers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I assume the gate agents thought they could save time by boarding pax while calling for volunteers, because often enough people will volunteer. In this incident, the flight was the next day and the offer obviously wasn&amp;#39;t good enough for anyone. Gate agents shouldn&amp;#39;t board pax until they know they have the seats to fit everyone, but, again, I don&amp;#39;t know UAL&amp;#39;s policy here so they weren&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; violating anything. This was a pretty big fuckup though.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;And the decision to board bites the gate agents in the ass, when they realize they didn&amp;#39;t actually get any volunteers. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The gate agents definitely had room to keep increasing the offer amount, but they decided it wasn&amp;#39;t worth it. Per most carrier contracts, they were not doing anything illegal though. Airlines &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; permitted to revoke tickets at basically any time at their discretion.  The justification in this case of &lt;em&gt;we need these seats to ferry crew&lt;/em&gt; is not illegal. It&amp;#39;s frustrating, but DOT rules do handsomely reward passengers who are booted involuntarily. Airlines typically will offer flight vouchers, but if the passengers request it the airline must cut the passengers a check for 4x the price of the ticket, or a maximum of $1300. You still get the ticket the next day, too. That&amp;#39;s a good deal of money. The couple that got bumped before the doctor could have taken their $2600 and had a very, very good night in Chicago. In many cases that doesn&amp;#39;t fix it, but it softens the blow a lot.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gate agents have probably heard it all, and were probably thinking something like: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone on board has a million reasons why they have to be on this plane tonight. We need to get this guy off so we can get this plane out of the gate.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; Now. Granted. They have the power to have changed their minds here and and redone the selection to pick someone else, but they weren&amp;#39;t required to and they didn&amp;#39;t, for any number of reasons. In hindsight, they probably should have, but I&amp;#39;m sure it crossed their mind and they assumed that if they relented on this &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; passenger, everyone else would refuse to deboard too.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Situation escalates. Passenger calls his lawyer. This is where the passenger also starts to take some of the blame. The airline does legally have the right to remove the passenger, so the passenger was actually trespassing by this point because his ticket was cancelled and he was informed of it. You can argue whether or not airlines &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be permitted to do this, but currently the airline &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; permitted. This is what some of that fine print that you scroll through when buying a ticket says&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand that at this point, the passenger had had his ticket revoked and was no longer legally permitted on the plane. The doctor was disobeying gate agent orders and the gate agents need him to be off the plane. The gate agents were &lt;em&gt;not in the wrong&lt;/em&gt; for calling airport police in this situation, because airport police are responsible for removing unruly passengers. Again, the doctor was, technically, trespassing. The gate agents clearly couldn&amp;#39;t remove him so they had no other choice. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;By this point, I believe the passenger is at fault. When police officers are ordering you to get off of the plane, at some point you should. At this point, it&amp;#39;s a maturity thing. The man was a highly educated doctor and &lt;em&gt;should have known&lt;/em&gt; what would happen if he continued to disobey the airport police. I know this sounds like a &amp;quot;Citizen, pick up that can&amp;quot; kind of moment, but by the contract that the passenger agreed to, he needed to leave. This could happen anywhere. He should have gotten off of the plane, collected his money, and pursued other means to legally punish UAL for booting him. He wasn&amp;#39;t losing any rights, he probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have been arrested (More likely received a stern lecture), but he continued to resist the officer&amp;#39;s direct orders.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is where the Airport Police fuck up severely. From the video you can &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; see that the officer loses his patience and forcefully drags the doctor out of his seat. The officer leaves the arm rests down and yanks the doctor across the row and out into the aisle. This is a gross overuse of force by the police. The doctor was not violently resisting, but he was treated with violence and seriously injured in the process. Getting knocked unconcious happens all of the time in movies, TV shows, etc. But it&amp;#39;s actually a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; deal and requires a lot of medical attention to ensure that a TBI hasn&amp;#39;t occured. The officer also dragged him out of the plane by his arms, which is the wrong way to move an unconscious individual due to the risk of causing further damage. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The fact that the doctor managed to get back onto the plane indicates that the police officers did not immediately call for medical assistance or continue to properly detain the doctor once he regained consciousness. This is, again, a colossal fuckup on their part, because it demonstrates that they probably did not follow any real sort of procedure once they got the guy off of the plane. Unfortunately, we don&amp;#39;t have footage of what happened, but it is apparent that they straight up left the guy lying on the ground and stopped attending him long enough for him to stumble down the gate and back on to the plane unhindered. As I mentioned, if you watch the video, the doctor is &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; exhibiting signs of a concussion. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The plane was delayed for a couple of hours due to the actions of the gate agents and the police. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here are the major issues &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have with the whole event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airline policies that permit pretty awful treatment of passengers, including overbooking and involuntary removal, and policies where the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; solution was to boot paying customers for crew logistical reasons. That&amp;#39;s poor planning and the airline should have found a better way to ferry the crew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gate agents are given a lot of power. Sometimes they use this to help passengers, but they also can inconvenience everyone as they did here. The gate agents should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have boarded the plane until they had room for everyone, and they could have given the doctor leeway to fly on the plane given his extenuating circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor should have deboarded when the first airport police officer arrived. At that point, he should have known he wasn&amp;#39;t going to win, and frankly I agree with the assertion by the former Continental CEO that the doctor was being immature at that point. He would have been handsomely compensated and as other people have mentioned, it would not have been difficult to rent a car and drive to Louisville, or to book a later flight with another airline, or to have taken a train, or a bus... I&amp;#39;ve had flights cancelled on me before, and in one instance I split a car rental with a few other passengers and we drove to our destination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The airport police were obscenely out of line with how they handled the situation. From violently removing the passenger, to causing a serious head injury, to literally &lt;em&gt;dragging&lt;/em&gt; him off of the plane, to leaving him on the floor of the airport without treatment or supervision. No part of their handling of the matter was ok. The officers should have lifted the arm rests and pulled the passenger out and escorted him off. Violence was absolutely the wrong answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So; my long-winded rant is out of the way. What do you guys think of the situation? What could the airline/crew/doctor/police have done better? Who do you think could be assigned blame here? How does this affect your opinion of UAL? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I don't work for an airline, but I have spent my entire life deeply connected to aviation.

First and foremost, this is an unfortunate situation for all involved.  The passenger, witnesses, flight crew, and United employees.\n\n2.  United employees were only following their SOP in terms of dealing with an overbooking situation.  Overbooking will always exist at the airlines, it is not arbitrary, the airline has studied and plans accordingly.  In this case the flight crew that was trying to get on that flight resulted in the overbooking.  I have been this flight crewmember as recently as last week.  It stinks, but take a step back and look at the big picture.  At United the minimum amount of passengers for an aircraft with 4 crewmembers seats 70.  If this crew cannot get on, they risk 70 passengers affected for one flight.  If this crew must fly 2 or 3 flights, we are talking upwards of 210 passengers affected.  This results in rebookings, and eventually overbookings, and we are back to where we are now.  \n\n3.  More than likely this gentlemen booked the cheapest ticket and checked in the latest.  There is another parameter regarding frequent flier status, but more than likely the first two were looked at over the latter.  I have been this pilot where unforeseen events has required us to remove passengers after boarding begins.  It stinks, it's uncomfortable, but it has to happen.  You must ask who should be removed, the highest paying person whose been at the airport the longest?  Or the person who picked the cheapest ticket?  Sadly someone has to be removed and airlines have found this is the most fair way to do it.  EDIT:  Wanted to add a thought, the flight crew attempting to deadhead were not flying on a \"free ticket.\" In situations like this the flight crews airline has to book a specific ticket for each crew member.  More than likely the ticket booked was a higher fare class (more expensive) ticket than the passengers.  I've had a situation like this arise where my airline had no choice but to last minute book me an expensive first class ticket because it was the only \"fare class\" still available for purchase.\n\n4.  Now for the unpopular opinion, the use of force though sad, at some point becomes necessary.  I can remember countless videos on Reddit where we laugh at unruly passengers being dragged off an aircraft by law enforcement.  Lets reiterate United did not use force in removing this passenger, law enforcement did.  Gate agents and their superiors may ask to have a passenger step off the aircraft, but they cannot use force in removing a passenger.  If a customer is unruly and resisting we are trained to immediately call law enforcement.  Pilots and flight crew will never remove a passenger.  Most do not know about \n[this](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/07/28/2-men-accused-attacking-pilot-at-miami-airport.html) situation that arose a few years ago.  For the record, the pilot never returned to the job from his injuries and this is the single example I use in immediately calling law enforcement.  Now this is where I get blunt.  United is a private business, and at a point the passenger is trespassing on private property.  Law enforcement's job is to enforce the law, if a person will not leave they are now criminally trespassing, and at some point resisting arrests.  An officer may use reasonable force for the crime committed to bring the person into custody.  Again probably not a popular feeling, but I think the officer used appropriate force to remove the passenger, but unfortunately he hit his head on the armrest injuring him.  We have all seen countless videos of officers tackling those resisting and in the process the assailant being injured in some way, it's unfortunate, but it occurs.\n5.  I feel bad for the employees at United, all of them.  United is a company of 86,000.  This industry is one of best practices and SOP's.  Both failed in this situation, they worked countless times before, but it failed once, and it will have a profound affect on 86,000 people.  A successful boycott will put hard working people out of jobs and affect thousands of lives.  People that have no control over what happened and may agree with the outrage of so many.  Yes, the passengers on board will have their lives profoundly affected as well, and that stinks! United should work to help those affected by this rare failure.   United should work to improve their policies.  United should work to better improve themselves, which we in this industry always strive to do.  One of my biggest fears as a pilot is doing everything right and still failing.  IMO this happened here and it just plain sucks.\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1491941180.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be a unpopular opinion but here is my two cents (I&amp;#39;m a U.S. Air Carrier Captain).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, this is an unfortunate situation for all involved.

More than likely the ticket booked was a higher fare class (more expensive) ticket than the passengers.  I&amp;#39;ve had a situation like this arise where my airline had no choice but to last minute book me an expensive first class ticket because it was the only &amp;quot;fare class&amp;quot; still available for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for the unpopular opinion, the use of force though sad, at some point becomes necessary.  I can remember countless videos on Reddit where we laugh at unruly passengers being dragged off an aircraft by law enforcement.  Lets reiterate United did not use force in removing this passenger, law enforcement did.  Gate agents and their superiors may ask to have a passenger step off the aircraft, but they cannot use force in removing a passenger.  If a customer is unruly and resisting we are trained to immediately call law enforcement.  Pilots and flight crew will never remove a passenger.  Most do not know about \n&lt;a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/07/28/2-men-accused-attacking-pilot-at-miami-airport.html\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; situation that arose a few years ago.  For the record, the pilot never returned to the job from his injuries and this is the single example I use in immediately calling law enforcement.  Now this is where I get blunt.  United is a private business, and at a point the passenger is trespassing on private property.  Law enforcement&amp;#39;s job is to enforce the law, if a person will not leave they are now criminally trespassing, and at some point resisting arrests.  An officer may use reasonable force for the crime committed to bring the person into custody.  Again probably not a popular feeling, but I think the officer used appropriate force to remove the passenger, but unfortunately he hit his head on the armrest injuring him.  We have all seen countless videos of officers tackling those resisting and in the process the assailant being injured in some way, it&amp;#39;s unfortunate, but it occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel bad for the employees at United, all of them.  United is a company of 86,000.  This industry is one of best practices and SOP&amp;#39;s.  Both failed in this situation, they worked countless times before, but it failed once, and it will have a profound affect on 86,000 people.  A successful boycott will put hard working people out of jobs and affect thousands of lives.  People that have no control over what happened and may agree with the outrage of so many.  Yes, the passengers on board will have their lives profoundly affected as well, and that stinks! United should work to help those affected by this rare failure.   United should work to improve their policies.  United should work to better improve themselves, which we in this industry always strive to do.  One of my biggest fears as a pilot is doing everything right and still failing.  IMO this happened here and it just plain sucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "aviation", "name": "t1_dg4toxp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491969508.0, "created_utc": 1491940708.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64r1ua", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64r1ua", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4vhzw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ChicagoPilot", "parent_id": "t1_dg4macd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/aviation", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Jumpseating while on a deadhead is a big no-no.
