Look up pictures of an A-1 Skyradier (same engine...for the most part), the sides behind the engine exhaust will be absolutely oil soaked. \n\nOn the R-1820's that our B-17 (Yankee Lady) uses, we assume 1 gallon of oil burned per engine per hour. Tanks are 50 gallon, one each per engine. Fuel burn rates (100LL) is around 50 gallons per engine per hour, depending on how lean we're running and what we're doing.\n\nand for those who don't know, the number in a radial engine is the approximate cubic inch displacement (they round up or down to the nearest decent round number). An R-3350 would be approximately 54.9 litres, An R-1820 would be 29.8 litres. Even more fun; An R-3350 is an 18 cylinder engine, so you're talking roughly 186 cubic inches (3 L) displacement *per cylinder.* The R-1820 is only a 9 cylinder, so it's pumping 202 cubic inches (3.3 L) per cylinder. The pistons in a radial engine are positively massive.
