Taking out American Aircraft Carriers is somewhat of a lynchpin of all Irani defence strategies, be it with swarms of anti-ship missiles, or small boats.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. The aircraft has VERY thick wings with downward angled tips. This can mean only one thing. It counts on ground effect for most of its mission. Also the big fat FLIR means this isn't meant to fly fast. This aircraft would fly terribly at any high altitude or speed. Before you say conventional ground-attack or close-air-support, even those aircraft have to cruise and maneuver. I strongly suspect this is designed to fly low over the sea. Flying low of course means delayed detection. I am not sure how well airborne radar assets can differentiate between the sea and a low flying jet.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. The intakes are located on the top of the aircraft. This is a bad idea for anything that has to pull any sort of high angle of attack maneuvers. I'm sure their engineers know this. I think it's not supposed to maneuver just fly low over the sea. The placement has everything to do with avoiding sea-spray ingestion into the engines.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 4. They have tried to incorporate low observable shaping and materials to further delay detection by the carrier group.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 5. The small protruding cockpit may be a temporary fixture which may be removed to make this unmanned. It may be even used as a suicide drone.

I will here on give the benefit of doubt and assume that they knew exactly what they were doing and it was designed for a practical purpose. I have a pretty good guess of what that purpose is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this is an Anti-Aircraft Carrier Attack Jet. Yes, I made that term up but here are my reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking out American Aircraft Carriers is somewhat of a lynchpin of all Irani defence strategies, be it with swarms of anti-ship missiles, or small boats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aircraft has VERY thick wings with downward angled tips. This can mean only one thing. It counts on ground effect for most of its mission. Also the big fat FLIR means this isn&amp;#39;t meant to fly fast. This aircraft would fly terribly at any high altitude or speed. Before you say conventional ground-attack or close-air-support, even those aircraft have to cruise and maneuver. I strongly suspect this is designed to fly low over the sea. Flying low of course means delayed detection. I am not sure how well airborne radar assets can differentiate between the sea and a low flying jet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intakes are located on the top of the aircraft. This is a bad idea for anything that has to pull any sort of high angle of attack maneuvers. I&amp;#39;m sure their engineers know this. I think it&amp;#39;s not supposed to maneuver just fly low over the sea. The placement has everything to do with avoiding sea-spray ingestion into the engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have tried to incorporate low observable shaping and materials to further delay detection by the carrier group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small protruding cockpit may be a temporary fixture which may be removed to make this unmanned. It may be even used as a suicide drone.
