I can&amp;#39;t find any details on anyone in Hong Kong at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can trace the flight back to &lt;a href=\"https://planefinder.net/flight/SPAR16/time/2017-04-07T21:20:00%20UTC\"&gt;Washington, D.C. on the 7th&lt;/a&gt;, probably to Yokota AFB, then to &lt;a href=\"https://planefinder.net/flight/SPAR16/time/2017-04-09T06:30:00%20UTC\"&gt;Hong Kong on the 9th&lt;/a&gt;.  Again, no information, suggesting that it may have been some military official.  Might also have something to do with the USS Makin Island visiting Hong Kong as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "aviation", "name": "t1_dg8lonf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492164328.0, "created_utc": 1492135528.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659hu0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8tts9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cvl37", "parent_id": "t3_659hu0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/aviation", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sadly not this livery, but there are other C-40's of which 02-0203 is currently at Amsterdam", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly not this livery, but there are other C-40&amp;#39;s of which 02-0203 is currently at Amsterdam&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "aviation", "name": "t1_dg8tts9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492177751.0, "created_utc": 1492148951.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659hu0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8xybr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "YourNightmar31", "parent_id": "t3_659hu0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/aviation", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This looks like madeira", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This looks like madeira&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "aviation", "name": "t1_dg8xybr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492188991.0, "created_utc": 1492160191.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659hu0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg95k3d", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mike734", "parent_id": "t3_659hu0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/aviation", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Air Force 47", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air Force 47&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "aviation", "name": "t1_dg95k3d", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492206907.0, "created_utc": 1492178107.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhu8", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_659hu0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg977la", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JMG_99", "parent_id": "t3_659hu0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/aviation", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Maybe Tillerson.
