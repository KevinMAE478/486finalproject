So not boring.\n\n- Shirt Club sucks I agree.\n\n- Okay your Season 2 picks I agree with -- I find Steven's Birthday boring (as an episode, but really he probably had a bomb ass birthday) but that's because I don't really enjoy the whole romance thing it's probably actually not that bad (AND the \"clearly-not-coming-from-a-baby\" crying is annoying but it was a good effort I guess). \n\n- Also Sadie's Song isn't actually as awful as I remember it being, but it does teeter on being boring and unnecessary.\n\n- Drop Beat Dad I agree\n\n- The New Lars????? TRIGGERED. I love love love that episode, even if I hate the resolution. Idk I just can't explain it.\n\n- Kiki's Delivery Service felt wholesome to me, but I can see how people would find it boring.
