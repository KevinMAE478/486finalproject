If you have a medical condition (In my case a poor thyroid, which causes my body to not metabolize things correctly which causes me to be overweight no matter how little i eat/how much i exercise and i lack funds currently to go and get all the bloodwork and pills required to put it in check.) then you have an actual reason to be overweight, but should actively be trying to remedy it. If you're overweight because you can't jog around the block and refuse to put down the KFC bucket, then you shouldn't be praised for it. Being fat is not healthy, being fat isn't something you should be proud about. You shouldn't be shamed for being fat, but you should actively be trying to slim down. There is no denying that you would be happier being skinny, you'd have more energy, you'd be more social (depending if being social is your thing or not), and you'd be a lot less likely to develop numerous a multitude of health issues. \n\nIf you believe being fat is the key to happiness then, by all means, sit in your living room surrounded by old McDonalds wrappers while watching Jeprody reruns because you're too large to waddle over to grab the remote. Be happy knowing that you'll have a heart attack, have a stroke, or be diabetic when you turn 50 if you even live that long. \n\nSure we shouldn't be shoving these unrealistic goals to kids about how you should have perfect glowing skin or a chiseled chin by 15. We shouldn't be teaching them that they need to fit a perfect make or model to find love or happiness.

We shouldn't be teaching kids that it's alright to eat their pain away and then blame the world that no one likes them because of their weight.
