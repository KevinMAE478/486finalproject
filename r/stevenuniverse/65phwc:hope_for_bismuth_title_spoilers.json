Jasper's trying to get revenge on the person who she believes:\n\n* killed her mom\n\n* killed all her friends/fellow soldiers\n\n* stole her home planet\n\n* caused a resource blight for HW, and most obviously\n\n* betrayed her own kind\n\nSo as Jasper sees it, she is trying to defeat Super-Duper Hitler, whom she also has a personal grudge against. Bismuth tried to kill Steven just because they had different ideas of what \"winning a war\" meant, and that was after she learned that Steven wasn't Rose.\n\nSecondly, everything that she said in Earthlings was very intentionally done to show us what Jasper really thinks of, not only Earth, but herself. What a lot of people saw as irony of her saying \"you suffer because it's what you deserve, we all get what we deserve\" and then becoming corrupted, was not irony at all. It was some hardcore projection. This is why she just accepts her fate in the end, refusing the help, no longer fighting, because she feels that this is what she gets. For letting Pink Diamond fall, to letting Rose get away, for letting the Earth become this (what she views as) horrible place, she has earned the right to suffer with the others. Because she truly believes that she deserves it, for all of her failures. \n\nWith all that in mind, is it really a wonder that she didn't want to join \"Rose?\" This gem who was able to cheat destiny, and never get what she deserved? Who was trying to cheat Jasper out of the fate that she deserved? Because that's what a theoretical Jasperedemption arc would be about. Not convincing her to join the team, but convincing her that she doesn't deserve the eternal suffering of corruption, no one does.\n\nI'm thinking of the \"It's not your fault\" scene from Good Will Hunting. She comes to realize that she doesn't deserve corruption, but maybe she deserves to stay here on Earth with all these other misfits and shmucks (or something like that, idk, I'm not a writer).\n\nAs for the CG's not wanting her out because of Peridot, look how that situation ended up. New Crystal Gem, savior of the planet, meme queen. Two totally different situations. As for the focus on other corrupted gems part, it's very possible (though obviously we don't know for sure) that corruption gets worse with age or through a direct hit, instead of Jasper's more recent catching of it and that it was caught through fusion. Again, we don't know that, but that could be a way out for the crew in order to just heal Jasper.\n\nSwitching gears towards Bismuth, here's approximately how that situation would go down:\n\n&gt; *bubble pops*\n\n&gt; \"Where am I?...Steven? What's going on?\"\n\n&gt; \"Bismuth, we've decided to give you another chance but there are some ground rules. Number 1, don't try and kill me when we disagree on hiw to handle things... that's it.\"\n\n&gt; \"Okay, I can manage that.\"\n\nAnd that's it. No conflict, no drama, nothing compelling. The only chance at conflict will be between Bismuth and Lapis, but Bismuth is just such a smooth talker and such a genuinely kind person that Lapis would probably forgive her by the end of that first episode. There's so little that you can do with Bismuth coming back, especially when compared to what you can do with Jasper coming back.\n\nThere's also the fact that Jasper is voiced by a voice actress who works for voice actress pay, while Bismuth is voiced by a two-time emmy-winning actress, who probably made more on guest appearances then Zach Callison does for a whole year. So they'd have to recast her if they want to bring Bismuth back full time.\n\n**TL;DR** Bismuth is liked more by the characters in the show, yes, but from a storytelling standpoint, Jasper gives you this entire range of things to work with, while Bismuth gives you almost nothing.
