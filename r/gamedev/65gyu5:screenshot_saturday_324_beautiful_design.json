Two weeks ago I decided I want to improve my modeling and texturing skills to increase the chances of getting a job (our game is non-profit yet). And of course I wanted to combine this training with our project, so I tried to create my very first car model for the police department in the game. I was inspired by two cars - a sport car model on my desk (can you guess the model? :) ) and Dodge Charger SRT-8. But result is a little different, because I wanted to create some unique car and also it's very hard to stick to the original :)\n\nAnd here is the police car: http://hungerofdarkness.com/public/development/PoliceCar.gif\n\n**Hunger of Darkness** is an open world game.

But result is a little different, because I wanted to create some unique car and also it&amp;#39;s very hard to stick to the original :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here is the police car: &lt;a href=\"http://hungerofdarkness.com/public/development/PoliceCar.gif\"&gt;http://hungerofdarkness.com/public/development/PoliceCar.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunger of Darkness&lt;/strong&gt; is an open world game.

I posted a game engine called Rayne here, a friend and me had been working on, but then we went silent mostly due to having a job next to university. Now I am done with university and got some spare time to make games again.\nSo I dug out a rewrite of Rayne which we had already started on some time ago with a somewhat working Metal renderer, wrote a DirectX 12 renderer for it (still writing...), modernized the old OpenAL and Bullet plugins for audio and physics and added a brand new Oculus plugin to that collection.\nOh and then I took an old game prototype I made for Ludum Dare 31 using the old version of Rayne and started polishing it into a much more polished VR experience.\n\nBlobby Tennis relies on Oculus Touch to control a tennis racket and a tennis ball. You are standing in front of a net with your opponent \"Blobby\" on the other side, who will try to play every ball back to you, but also has a bit of a stamina system so if you want to outplay him, you can. But just playing the ball back and forth works too. There is no real goal, besides what ever you set as your own goal.\nWhile it is mostly a tech demo and not a full game with real goals or anything, I actually find my self stuck in it for quite long sessions almost every time I test. Just trying to finally manage to play the ball back and forth 20 times or more (my current record is at 18).\nSince the ground is beach sand, it isn't bouncy at all, so it obviously isn't anything close to real tennis.\n\nI did spent a lot of time on getting the physics to work well, meaning it is almost impossible to make the racket go through the ball and unless you have tracking issues, the ball should consistently behave the way you'd expect it to based on how it was hit.

I posted a game engine called Rayne here, a friend and me had been working on, but then we went silent mostly due to having a job next to university. Now I am done with university and got some spare time to make games again.\nSo I dug out a rewrite of Rayne which we had already started on some time ago with a somewhat working Metal renderer, wrote a DirectX 12 renderer for it (still writing...), modernized the old OpenAL and Bullet plugins for audio and physics and added a brand new Oculus plugin to that collection.\nOh and then I took an old game prototype I made for Ludum Dare 31 using the old version of Rayne and started polishing it into a much more polished VR experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blobby Tennis relies on Oculus Touch to control a tennis racket and a tennis ball. You are standing in front of a net with your opponent &amp;quot;Blobby&amp;quot; on the other side, who will try to play every ball back to you, but also has a bit of a stamina system so if you want to outplay him, you can. But just playing the ball back and forth works too. There is no real goal, besides what ever you set as your own goal.\nWhile it is mostly a tech demo and not a full game with real goals or anything, I actually find my self stuck in it for quite long sessions almost every time I test. Just trying to finally manage to play the ball back and forth 20 times or more (my current record is at 18).\nSince the ground is beach sand, it isn&amp;#39;t bouncy at all, so it obviously isn&amp;#39;t anything close to real tennis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did spent a lot of time on getting the physics to work well, meaning it is almost impossible to make the racket go through the ball and unless you have tracking issues, the ball should consistently behave the way you&amp;#39;d expect it to based on how it was hit. Compared to a real tennis racket the racket is a lot more bouncy, which helps getting the ball over the net without any real physical feedback from hitting the ball and in my opinion works well for this experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one must have feature I still have planned are shadows.

This game has a similar (but improved) [single-player elo system](http://www.dinofarmgames.com/auros-single-player-elo-system/). I think of it as a combination of DotA, Rogue-likes, and puzzle games. But like *Auro*, it's one of those evergreen can-play-it-forever skill based single player strategy games.\n\n**Coming to Windows, OSX and Linux late 2017.**\n\n* [**How It Works**](http://i.imgur.com/pCqfi8v.png) - Gems are crashing into each other in the middle of the board, along three lanes. If a gem reaches the other side, the lane gets \"pushed\" one tile in that direction. If a gem reaches the end while the lane is pushed all the way, your team scores a point. First side to 30 points wins!\n\n* [**Animation**](http://i.imgur.com/GgLhpaJ.gif) - What Tennor's \"Divebomb\" spell might look like in action.\n\n* [**Story Mode**](http://i.imgur.com/wZLwLQF.png) - There's a story about the main character, Tennor, and her struggles with failure. She flies out to the *Push the Lane* television game show contest to compete and try to reunite with her bandmates.\n\n* [**Buildings**](http://i.imgur.com/Qs1IhqD.png) - In addition to your character's abilities, you can purchase Buildings which affect the map long-term. Some buildings produce new gems, some power up gems, some move gems around in specific ways. Combining the Buildings, you can create machines that do a lot of work for you.\n\n* [**Title Screen**](http://i.imgur.com/tNMkGOD.jpg) - This is Tennor, the game's main character. I have hired an artist for these portraits named Fariza Dzatalin, she's really great!\n\n* [**Lemon**](http://i.imgur.com/9EPBSP8.jpg) - This is Lemon, Tennor's best friend and former keyboardist. Sort of the antagonist of the story.\n\nThe game is still in early development. Let me know what you think! I will be launching a Kickstarter for the game at some point in the next few weeks, so stay tuned!\n\n[Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=905399570&amp;tscn=1492222084) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pushthelane/) | [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/keithburgun) | [My site](http://www.keithburgun.net)\n\n---\n\nAs to the question of the week - probably *Master of Magic* or *Fantasy General*!

She flies out to the &lt;em&gt;Push the Lane&lt;/em&gt; television game show contest to compete and try to reunite with her bandmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Qs1IhqD.png\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buildings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - In addition to your character&amp;#39;s abilities, you can purchase Buildings which affect the map long-term. Some buildings produce new gems, some power up gems, some move gems around in specific ways. Combining the Buildings, you can create machines that do a lot of work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/tNMkGOD.jpg\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title Screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - This is Tennor, the game&amp;#39;s main character. I have hired an artist for these portraits named Fariza Dzatalin, she&amp;#39;s really great!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/9EPBSP8.jpg\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - This is Lemon, Tennor&amp;#39;s best friend and former keyboardist. Sort of the antagonist of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game is still in early development. Let me know what you think!

Still needs work, but some good progress, nonetheless.\n\n[Nerfed sneak attack](http://imgur.com/AXwAPBF) - Sneak attacks used to disable enemies with just one hit, but they will now only do a normal knockdown, like with door slams and bottle hits, where the enemy will get get back up after awhile. Punching enemies multiple times while they're on the ground will lead to the knockout, though. I also added an option to show a timer, which will indicate how much longer they have until they get up.\n\n[Upgradable punch](http://imgur.com/cKFMR0p) - I added punch strength as an upgrade option, which increases the amount of time that an enemy will stay down when punched. When maxed out, you get the one-hit knockout back. Although it may seem a bit pointless to remove something and then bring it right back in, what this does is provide a bit of balance to it, in that rather than starting out with the super-punch, you must invest in it and use points for it, which would have gone into other upgrades.\n\n[Better character design](http://imgur.com/Uj6KJVN) - I finally took a shot at fleshing out the characters a little more, so that they look a little more human-like. Enemies will have a uniform to fit with the specific level's situation, and other things like their skin, hair style, and hair color will be randomly selected. My next step with this is to allow players to customize their character to look however they want.\n\nThe game is on Greenlight, so any vote is appreciated. I'll most likely be redoing the trailer in order to implement these changes.\n\n----\n\n[Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=890164606) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HollowHeadedDev) | [Gameplay Albums](https://hollowheaded.imgur.com/) | [Development Blog](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=57550)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=890164606\"&gt;Silent But Deadly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This week was all about balance and appearance.
