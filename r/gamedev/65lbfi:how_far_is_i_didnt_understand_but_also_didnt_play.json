Same with blobs of text. If the tutorial is lengthy, full of obscure words, or generally confusing, then it is the designer's fault if the person doesn't understand. But we don't know what OP's tutorial looks like, and there's no reason to assume it's difficult. It's perfectly reasonable to assume that it's pretty clearforward, and it's reasonable to expect people to give it a shot.\n\nIt's not though.  Designers have studied this.  We KNOW people tend to either skip, or at best, skim, large screens full of text.  Especially if that text is stopping them from getting into the game.  My point is, you need to take your audience's limitations into accounts when designing your lessons.  In this case, one of the \"limitations\" of game players is that no, they really aren't interested in reading a screen full of text when they'd rather play the game.\n\nAnd sure, I have no idea if this is what the OP was doing or not.  I'm using this as an example, to illustrate my point:  If your instructions depend on your audience having a skill that they're not likely to have, then no, the problem isn't the people. It's your lesson plan.\n\n&gt;Yes, of course it fucking is, because they fucking skipped reading the manual.\n\nIf I give them a manual that I know they won't read, is it their fault for not reading it, or mine for not recognizing that they wouldn't read it, and planning around that?  Communication isn't just about broadcasting information - it's also about making sure the other side receives it.\n\n&gt;I'm not talking about difficulty of understanding a tutorial. I'm talking about people who literally decide not to bother reading it. \n\nSo again, the question is - *why* didn't they read it?  \"Because they're terrible people\" is a cop-out.  They didn't read it because either they didn't think it would tell them anything they didn't know, or they didn't think it was necessary, or any other number of reasons that made them want to avoid it.\n\n*Unraveling those reasons is part of a game designer's job.*\n\nAgain, I don't know how to stress this any more clearly:  A designer's job is not just to broadcast the necessary information on how to play the game.  It's also to *make sure the players receive it.*  And part of that means presenting it in a way that they don't object to.\n\n&gt;How about dwarf fortress? Very complex game, difficult to play and understand, not for everyone. And if anyone blames the developer for not making game mechanics more clear when they don't even read a tutorial...they deserve to be laughed at. Do you disagree with that?\n\nEr, yes, actually.  I think \"This game is impenetrable - I couldn't make it through the tutorial, and it's too complicated to figure out on my own\" is a perfectly valid complaint about a game.\n\nNow, \"Yeah, it's a bit impenetrable, maybe this isn't the right game for you\" is an equally valid response.  But if a developer is finding that people can't figure out the game, and don't want to read the tutorials, then they really do need to figure out *what they are doing wrong with their instructions.*  Since they are obviously doing something wrong - the instructions are failing at *their one job:*  Teaching people to play the game.\n\nAt the end of the day, it doesn't matter if the instructions are failing because they are poorly written, or too hard to find, or don't seem relevant, or are too long, or too impenetrable, or written in the wrong font... None of those matter.  What matters is, they are not doing their job.\n\n&gt;But the person playing a game thinking they got it figured out, and blaming the developer when they don't is probably a narcissistic lazy douchebag.\n\nSee, I would say this is a failure *of the developer.*  Because the developer made a game that did not give good enough feedback to the player for the player to recognize that they needed to learn more about it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Same with blobs of text. If the tutorial is lengthy, full of obscure words, or generally confusing, then it is the designer&amp;#39;s fault if the person doesn&amp;#39;t understand. But we don&amp;#39;t know what OP&amp;#39;s tutorial looks like, and there&amp;#39;s no reason to assume it&amp;#39;s difficult. It&amp;#39;s perfectly reasonable to assume that it&amp;#39;s pretty clearforward, and it&amp;#39;s reasonable to expect people to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not though.  Designers have studied this.  We KNOW people tend to either skip, or at best, skim, large screens full of text.  Especially if that text is stopping them from getting into the game.  My point is, you need to take your audience&amp;#39;s limitations into accounts when designing your lessons.  In this case, one of the &amp;quot;limitations&amp;quot; of game players is that no, they really aren&amp;#39;t interested in reading a screen full of text when they&amp;#39;d rather play the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And sure, I have no idea if this is what the OP was doing or not.  I&amp;#39;m using this as an example, to illustrate my point:  If your instructions depend on your audience having a skill that they&amp;#39;re not likely to have, then no, the problem isn&amp;#39;t the people. It&amp;#39;s your lesson plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course it fucking is, because they fucking skipped reading the manual.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I give them a manual that I know they won&amp;#39;t read, is it their fault for not reading it, or mine for not recognizing that they wouldn&amp;#39;t read it, and planning around that?

Because it highlights a serious problem with your design:  You haven't figured out a way to explain the game to people that doesn't make them want to tune out and skip it.\n\nHere is the single hardest truth in game design.  Are you ready?  Here goes:\n\n*You cannot make someone retroactively enjoy a game experience by explaining.*\n\nIf someone had a bad experience, you can't change that.  If you tell them \"you would have had a better time if you'd learned about doublejumping like you were supposed to\" then that's great, but they still had a bad experience.\n\nUltimately, the buck stops at you.  Everything about the game experience is your fault.  You won't be there to offer excuses to 99% of your players, or to tell them why they *should* have had a better time if something went wrong.  Even if you were, they don't care about excuses; they care about if they enjoyed themselves or not.\n\nSo your job as a designer at this point is to either say \"Ok, I need to figure out how to convey this information in a way that people don't want to skip\", or \"Ok, X% of my playtesters never read the instructions and have a terrible experience, but I'm okay reducing my potential audience/market share by X%.\"\n\nYou'll never please everyone of course, and there will always be outliers.  But if you consistently find people aren't having a good time playing your game, then you need to seriously consider the possibility that the problem is probably not your testers.  It's your game.\n\nAnyway, if you want ideas on how to make your tutorials more interesting, and how to give players the necessary information in a good way, I highly recommend [this GDC keynote](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1015541/How-I-Got-My-Mom).

Because it highlights a serious problem with your design:  You haven&amp;#39;t figured out a way to explain the game to people that doesn&amp;#39;t make them want to tune out and skip it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the single hardest truth in game design.  Are you ready?  Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You cannot make someone retroactively enjoy a game experience by explaining.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone had a bad experience, you can&amp;#39;t change that.  If you tell them &amp;quot;you would have had a better time if you&amp;#39;d learned about doublejumping like you were supposed to&amp;quot; then that&amp;#39;s great, but they still had a bad experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the buck stops at you.  Everything about the game experience is your fault.  You won&amp;#39;t be there to offer excuses to 99% of your players, or to tell them why they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have had a better time if something went wrong.  Even if you were, they don&amp;#39;t care about excuses; they care about if they enjoyed themselves or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So your job as a designer at this point is to either say &amp;quot;Ok, I need to figure out how to convey this information in a way that people don&amp;#39;t want to skip&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Ok, X% of my playtesters never read the instructions and have a terrible experience, but I&amp;#39;m okay reducing my potential audience/market share by X%.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll never please everyone of course, and there will always be outliers.  But if you consistently find people aren&amp;#39;t having a good time playing your game, then you need to seriously consider the possibility that the problem is probably not your testers.  It&amp;#39;s your game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you want ideas on how to make your tutorials more interesting, and how to give players the necessary information in a good way, I highly recommend &lt;a href=\"http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1015541/How-I-Got-My-Mom\"&gt;this GDC keynote&lt;/a&gt;.

Most games favour a hint or a persistent info button on their Ui assets which opens up a tooltip anytime or anywhere. Some use the info button to bring up an overlay but this truly helps when u explain the base concepts of a game's mechsnics and it's Ui to a player.\n\nI think addressing your tutorial is a prime concern. (I'd have a better idea if I played it) People generally hate long tutorials and unskippable tutorials. Making your tutorial appear as part of the campaign/story like Agebof empires (as someone pointed out) is a good idea. Starcraft did it too, and so did Civ. This way it doesn't differ from the main game. Another way is (generally the f2p way) an incentivised tutorial which gives the player something just for finishing the tutorial like portraits, etc. Mainly cosmetics (most people frown upon this) and hey who doesn't like free stuff.\n\nI hope this helps.
