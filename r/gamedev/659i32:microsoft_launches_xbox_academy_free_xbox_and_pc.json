And before anybody brings up the new indie dev bullshit that&amp;#39;s only $19. That is not an Xbox release. That&amp;#39;s a windows live universal release and your game will not be on the Xbox live store. Yes, people can buy it on the Xbox but there&amp;#39;s an entirely separate shop for that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/heavy-rain/3030-21304/forums/apparently-microsoft-rejected-this-game-1451620/\"&gt;Heavy Rain declined &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-02-20-microsoft-turned-down-playstation-4-exclusive-rime\"&gt;Microsoft turns down Rime&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vg247.com/2014/02/19/rime-microsoft-rejected-tequila-works-game-before-it-became-ps4-exclusive-rumour/amp/\"&gt;tequila works rejected by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.kotaku.com.au/2008/04/microsoft_rejected_portal_for_xbla-2/\"&gt;portal rejected by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/rare-ltd/3010-174/forums/former-rare-we-wanted-to-make-ki3-and-more-ms-reje-558025/\"&gt;killer instinct 3 rejected&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And these are all high profile games. You really think that Microsoft doesn&amp;#39;t reject some random Indie person just because their game is shit in their eyes? Down vote me all you want but you&amp;#39;re delusional if you think that. Microsoft also has a giant list of technical requirements and criteria that your game absolutely has to meet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also as &lt;a href=\"/u/arendjr\"&gt;u/arendjr&lt;/a&gt; said a few comments above me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For more recent examples, look up Phantom Dust, Fable Legends or Scalebound. They treat triple-A studios and even their in-house studios like shit. Do you think you as an indie will be better off?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg8yy4w", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492192234.0, "created_utc": 1492163434.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8vczg", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BluShine", "parent_id": "t1_dg8narq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Has this actually happened to you?
