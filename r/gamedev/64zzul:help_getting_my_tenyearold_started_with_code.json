We know and parents know that they know all the words and learn them from each other (often originally from hearing them from their parents) but to say them is taboo.

It would risk him being expelled. Changing school isn't an option either, you ever heard of a school that was fine with children shouting fuck?

The amount of illogical shit we do just because others do it or because our ancestors did it is immeasurably large.\n\n\n&gt;It's problematic, but parents have a responsibility to raise their children and if the school gives them a hard time for irrelevant things they should reinforce with their children that the school is not the sole/primary arbiter of right and wrong and should have some conversations with the people at school and maybe find a different school if it is within their means.\n\nIt's not that simple. If you teach a child that a lot of what is taught in schools is wrong you are going to create several problems:\n\n1. Child has no trust in what they are learning in school. Are you going to have a big list that says listen when they talk about this, don't listen when they talk about this? \n\n2. If you tell a child what someone is teaching them is wrong, that child will mention it to that person. Often in the worst possible scenario, such as in front of a class.

They will blurt out what ever crosses their mind regardless of where they are so long as they think they are allowed to say it. They aren't good at what are essentially double standards \"You can say this here but not there\", you tell them they can say it, they will say it anywhere. \n\nTrust me I know it's illogical, it's just fucking letters in a specific order, but that is the way the world is and we are not the majority.

Now imagine the reaction of most people. It would not be majority positive. People like you and me would applaud, most people would not. I know people who &amp;quot;swear&amp;quot; in nearly every sentence who get offended when their child swears. That is the type of people you are up against. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Societal norms and tradition are huge problems in the world. The amount of illogical shit we do just because others do it or because our ancestors did it is immeasurably large.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s problematic, but parents have a responsibility to raise their children and if the school gives them a hard time for irrelevant things they should reinforce with their children that the school is not the sole/primary arbiter of right and wrong and should have some conversations with the people at school and maybe find a different school if it is within their means.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that simple. If you teach a child that a lot of what is taught in schools is wrong you are going to create several problems:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Child has no trust in what they are learning in school. Are you going to have a big list that says listen when they talk about this, don&amp;#39;t listen when they talk about this? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you tell a child what someone is teaching them is wrong, that child will mention it to that person. Often in the worst possible scenario, such as in front of a class. Most schools will get upset by this and it could lead to an expulsion and most countries have a legal requirement for children to be schooled. So unless you are going to homeschool, you have no option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children aren&amp;#39;t good at judging social situations. They will blurt out what ever crosses their mind regardless of where they are so long as they think they are allowed to say it. They aren&amp;#39;t good at what are essentially double standards &amp;quot;You can say this here but not there&amp;quot;, you tell them they can say it, they will say it anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust me I know it&amp;#39;s illogical, it&amp;#39;s just fucking letters in a specific order, but that is the way the world is and we are not the majority. In the current political climate where people act like offending someone should be a crime, we wont see it change any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg7r2gd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492127868.0, "created_utc": 1492099068.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7o3r4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "istarian", "parent_id": "t1_dg7cjda", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Certainly you have to make your own decisions in life, but if parents don't push back against BS school policies that are ridiculous and harmful to children then who will?  \n  \nI don't know about other people and I am neither in a relationship nor do I have children, but I take general offense with the notion of 'bad words'.

They teach interesting programming techniques in very engaging way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) That was a long Zachtronics ad. I hope i get noticed..., btw there is only one game left on my mind and it&amp;#39;s MHRD (&lt;a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/576030/\"&gt;http://store.steampowered.com/app/576030/&lt;/a&gt;) Again it&amp;#39;s closer to hardware than programming, but i discover this &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; just after i finished reading &amp;quot;Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software&amp;quot; by Charles Petzold, and it blew my mind with urge to program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all of this i will turn to &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; programming &amp;quot;tools&amp;quot;, and suggest some of virtual consoles, like pico-8 or TIC-80.
