I really like the background music / atmospheric sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since parts of the game are so polished, other parts that are less polished kind of stick out. Things like the injury sound effect, enemy death sound effect, enemy death particle effect, and health bars seem a little unfinished compared to the rest of the game.

What can you do to stick out, make something original here as an indie? Some hook that wouldn&amp;#39;t take too much work on your part?

The setting is the year 3000, hundreds of years after a nuclear fallout that forced humans to abandon Earth. Now that it&amp;#39;s safe to return, planet nations are sending settlers (the players) to claim land for their nation.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game is an MMO, where users can join nations or create their own. Nations battle over territory and resources, and ultimately try and build their cities and nations to dominate a region.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any feedback would be great!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg6bt4r", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492051190.0, "created_utc": 1492022390.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ytla", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ytla", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ytla", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ytla", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ytla", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8nbq7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "onlyhumangame", "parent_id": "t1_dg89t84", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Indeed!
