QA is meant to go and evaluate your product feature by feature as you are implementing them to ensure you met the goals you set to achieve and didn&amp;#39;t negatively affect other parts of the product with each addition. If you aren&amp;#39;t QA&amp;#39;ing throughout your project, it&amp;#39;s impossible for some team to roll in and do some kind of full regression when they themselves aren&amp;#39;t familiar with how everything is supposed to behave. This would have been a good asset when you got started, but by now it&amp;#39;s too late; You&amp;#39;ve been your own QA, and you&amp;#39;ll have to keep running your own QA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you feel you&amp;#39;re feature complete, just shift your focus from creating to that of running the business - do all the marketing yourself (and actually put in the effort it requires), run all the numbers, take in lots of feedback, plan and schedule patches, you&amp;#39;ll be fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg4ai33", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491948269.0, "created_utc": 1491919469.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 93}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pxku", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg445vl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 48, "report_reasons": null, "author": "GrillChill", "parent_id": "t1_dg43p7h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You don't need a publisher.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need a publisher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg445vl", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491937493.0, "created_utc": 1491908693.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 48}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pxku", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4d889", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 16, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JordyLakiereArt", "parent_id": "t1_dg43p7h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You definitely don't need a f-ing publisher!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You definitely don&amp;#39;t need a f-ing publisher!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg4d889", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491951537.0, "created_utc": 1491922737.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64pxku", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg50u76", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrMimiMe", "parent_id": "t1_dg43p7h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "marketing is a big reason. the question is: what are they going to do?\n\nif you kind of want to do it on your own, let them pitch the plan to you. whats their marketing plan? whats their budget? what are their distribution ways? what is their cut? etc \n\nyou have nothing to lose", "edited": 1492097783.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;marketing is a big reason. the question is: what are they going to do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if you kind of want to do it on your own, let them pitch the plan to you. whats their marketing plan? whats their budget? what are their distribution ways? what is their cut? etc &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;you have nothing to lose&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg50u76", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491977909.0, "created_utc": 1491949109.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg43p7h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 39, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jhovgaard", "parent_id": "t1_dg439ia", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, I actually watch this one multiple times, he's so good!

Here&amp;#39;s my tips:\n1. Start by streaming without a microphone or webcam. Get used to have people watching your screen. You&amp;#39;ll have almost no viewers, it&amp;#39;s fine. \n2. Train saying what you&amp;#39;re thinking while developing. It takes time. It&amp;#39;s easier when no one hears you in the beginning.\n3. Never turn on webcam until you feel confident. People love to troll. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope it helps!
