Something closer to 1000 users from multiple gamedev communities.\n\nBecause it's extremely interesting stuff, and the results here fit very VERY well into a lot of stereotypes &amp; common narratives the more experienced developers have when talking about communities like /r/gamedev.

Was there anything which kindof indicated this is for professional developers only? Something to sour the sampling by scaring off hobbyists or people who already gave up on their project?

Very skeptical of that high percent.\n\nedit: The title seems to imply that the only people who should participate are those who have successfully complete a game. \"Survey for Indie Developers about their first game!\" This makes sense, as that kind of title IMV enticings already successful developers to give their input &amp; discourages not yet successful developers. This could explain the ridiculously high rate of releases. People don't want to talk about their failures as their \"First Game\". \n\n**I strongly advise better wording in the title for any future surveys of this kind.**\n\n* The Title is everything.

Knowing the tools gamedevs use is fascinating! I wish there was so much more information. I absolutely love this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d really like to see the Race &amp;amp; Gender of those survey. My guess is something like 95% Male, 95% White, to fit with the 83% privileged enough to have attended university &amp;amp; typical demographic of redditors &amp;amp; game developers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also love to see more surveys, including a much better &amp;amp; bigger sampling. Something closer to 1000 users from multiple gamedev communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s extremely interesting stuff, and the results here fit very VERY well into a lot of stereotypes &amp;amp; common narratives the more experienced developers have when talking about communities like &lt;a href=\"/r/gamedev\"&gt;/r/gamedev&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of what I read from the Pro&amp;#39;s, advising against common newbie mistakes, seem to be reflected in these results. Especially that &lt;strong&gt;shocking&lt;/strong&gt; success in &amp;lt;1  year vs unsuccess if &amp;gt;1 year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was also honestly surprised by the high percent of users who took the survey who actually released their game. I thought it would be much, much, MUCH lower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then again... since there were only a bit less than 100 respondants in such a popular community, I imagine that the majority of amateurs did not participate. Was there anything which kindof indicated this is for professional developers only? Something to sour the sampling by scaring off hobbyists or people who already gave up on their project? I really am surprised at the high number of games published. Very skeptical of that high percent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: The title seems to imply that the only people who should participate are those who have successfully complete a game. &amp;quot;Survey for Indie Developers about their first game!&amp;quot; This makes sense, as that kind of title IMV enticings already successful developers to give their input &amp;amp; discourages not yet successful developers.
