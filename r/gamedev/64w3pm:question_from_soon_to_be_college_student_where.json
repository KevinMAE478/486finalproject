When you finished with your college you will that much experience that you can basically you don&amp;#39;t even need to find job or anything. Apply for any company they will accept at high price. I did it without knowing all these things i got really great job offers when i left. NO MATTER WHERE YOU FINISH YOUR COLLEGE FORM IT WILL ALWAYS GONNA COME DOWN TO YOUR SKILLS :) so sharp your skills and just finish your BFA program at NYU and do a lot of jams and make a ton of games GOOD LUCK!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg5m0a5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492011456.0, "created_utc": 1491982656.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w3pm", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w3pm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5molf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "emuscles", "parent_id": "t1_dg5mji9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "also NYU's gamecenter is your best bet for game design (mainly in terms of networking), but still isn't worth the debt if your family can't afford it.\n\nbeing in a lot of debt with some sort of game design degree is a good way to ruin your life.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;also NYU&amp;#39;s gamecenter is your best bet for game design (mainly in terms of networking), but still isn&amp;#39;t worth the debt if your family can&amp;#39;t afford it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;being in a lot of debt with some sort of game design degree is a good way to ruin your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg5molf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492013440.0, "created_utc": 1491984640.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5mji9", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "emuscles", "parent_id": "t3_64w3pm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "whatever it is you do, make sure that you learn to code. preferably in c++, 'video game industry' opportunity wise.\n\nyou'll have to do well on their programming tests, and you'll also need a portfolio of sorts to be considered to begin with.", "edited": 1491985137.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;whatever it is you do, make sure that you learn to code. preferably in c++, &amp;#39;video game industry&amp;#39; opportunity wise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;you&amp;#39;ll have to do well on their programming tests, and you&amp;#39;ll also need a portfolio of sorts to be considered to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg5mji9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492013011.0, "created_utc": 1491984211.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w3pm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5qos8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zebrakiller", "parent_id": "t3_64w3pm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Google, YouTube, and Unity forums.
