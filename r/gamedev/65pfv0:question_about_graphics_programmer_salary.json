It's never that simple, and I'd argue when talking about salary with your employer that's a horrible way to think about it.\n\nI think the heart of this thinking is that you see an informational imbalance - they have some amount of money they could pay you, but you have no idea what that is.  That is true, but that's not the whole picture.  More on that below.\n\nFirst up, some psychology - being the first to throw a number on the table gives you the chance to pin the thinking of the other party (or parties).  That's why you see high-pressure sales people (like, say, rug merchants in Istanbul) toss out a ridiculous number - it gets you thinking things are higher value than they are, and weights the price negotiation in their favor.  EG: say the rug cost $30.  They say they'll sell it to you for $500 and let you talk them down to $60.  If they'd started at $60, or even $80, you might have wanted to go down to ~$40.\n\nOf course, the question is then - what is a fair price for the rug?  You would say $30!  That's what he paid!  But... then he makes no money.  So how much profit is \"fair\"?  Sure, it's not your problem to keep him in business, but really, if you want to buy rugs, you need to give some markup to the salesman, or you're going to have a heck of a time finding a good rug when you come back and they've all gone out of business.\n\nAnother example is if you go to a wine shop, look at the way the bottles are arranged on the shelves.  Notice that there is no really clear pattern to the pricing - you'll see cheap, moderate, and expensive bottles all interleaved.  Sure, they may put more expensive, in general, bottles on the top shelf (thus the term \"top-shelf liquor\"), and cheaper stuff lower down.  But within a given shelf there will be a variety of prices, often with very cheap and expensive bottles next to each other.  The reason they do this is that they then put a third bottle near by - with a high, but not as high price as the expensive one.  People tend to go for the middle of a price range.  That arrangement lets the shop owner drive you to something that's just a little less expensive than the expensive bottle.\n\nNow, back to this employment situation - That's a whole different beast.  You're about to enter into a long-term contract with someone who will pay you money to provide services for them.  It's going to be an on-going thing, not a one-off transaction.  Sure, you don't want to be taken advantage of.  But on the flip side, you have a lot of factors to weigh when considering the compensation for your services.  For one, what other forms of compensation do they have?  Stock?  How's their health insurance?  Do they have a 401k?  Do they make matching contributions?  Do they do bonuses?  What about intangibles - like the coworkers, or the particular project?  What about the commute time?  How much of your day will you spend in a car to get to and from work?  What about vacation policies?  What is the rest of the team like?  Do you know any of them, do they seem cool?  What sort of extra-curricular stuff does the company do?\n\nYou're never going to have \"all things equal\" when comparing two (or more) offers.  Weighing all of them is difficult and very personal.\n\nFinally - getting back to that informational imbalance - the best thing you can do when negotiating is to be doing it with multiple potential employers at once.  Each one knows they're competing against the other companies, so will be pressured to make the best offer they can (because they won't know what the other company might be offering).  This re-balances the informational imbalance.  Neither of you knows everything, but now at least there are roughly equal pressures on each side.\n\nSo - what's the TL;DR?  Do the research you're doing right now!  Ask around, get a sense for a reasonable rate in your area, then give them a higher number when they ask.  Be sure to phrase it as a starting point for the negotiation - you don't want to come across as demanding that salary, they may well walk away.  But also don't sweat it that much.  Get a few interviews going at once, let them all know you're talking with other companies, and you'll get a good deal out of it.\n\nAnd really finally - once you have the offer and agree to it, chill and stop looking.  One of the worst things you can do after making a decision is to go back and keep researching it.  Ever buy a TV or new GPU only to see something new and better come out a month later?  The regret is deep, even though for that month, you were super happy with your purchase.  What changed?  The TV or GPU you have is not any worse... it's only by comparison that it seems to have become worse.  In some ways, once you're happy with what you have, and short of discovering there's a massive discrepancy, ignorance is bliss.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In any negotiation, the first person to say a number loses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is wrong in many ways.
