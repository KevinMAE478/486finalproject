I was enjoying the game play and decided to continue the development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to firstly find a theme for the game, so I brainstormed a list of words (i.e. war, combat, explosions, military, world war). I thought it would be cool to have an alternate-reality WW2 game with some imagination added to the secret military/technology programs all the war nations were developing at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stuck with the idea of Soviets vs Nazi&amp;#39;s with a focus on hidden technology. I&amp;#39;ve ended up with the name of [The Red Front](&lt;a href=\"http://www.theredfront.com\"&gt;www.theredfront.com&lt;/a&gt;) as I want to give an alternate history (with some sci-fi elements) of WWII &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg6ungo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492072662.0, "created_utc": 1492043862.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xhiv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6v3op", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ButterPenguin", "parent_id": "t3_64xhiv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Same way as everything else: Write down EVERYTHING.\n\n* every title idea you can come up with..\n* every existing game title you think is neat, clever, or stands out.
