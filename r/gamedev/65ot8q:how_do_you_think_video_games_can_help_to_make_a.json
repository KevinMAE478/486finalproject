In 5-10 years, VR game therapies may be commonplace for some conditions. A couple of examples:\n\n**Anxiety and panic attacks:** There's a developer here in Ireland named Owen Harris who developed a VR game called Deep that reportedly has an incredible effect on anxiety. It's this immersive stylised ocean exploration experience controlled using a strap that goes across your chest, so your breathing controls the game. The game essentially teaches you deep breathing techniques that are proven to help with anxiety, but you don't even realise you're doing it because you're busy trying to play this game. Owen has had people break down in tears after testing Deep because it's the first thing that's ever helped with their anxiety.\n\n**Immersive avatar tech:** CCP Games has a new VR sport game called Sparc that uses roomscale VR with touch controllers, and it also got me thinking about alternative uses of that technology. Using nothing but the position and rotation of your head and two hand controllers, Sparc is able to generate and move an on-screen waist-up solid avatar with spooky accuracy. It moves exactly as you do, and when you look down at your virtual hands your brain is convinced they are your real hands because the hand model is in the same grip as your hands and so the visual input agrees with your proprioception. There are similarities there to mirror box therapy, which has been proven to cure people of phantom limb pain. It could potentially be used to help people with body dysmorphia, movement disorders, etc.\n\n**Empathy games:** One of the huge things VR can do is put you in someone else's shoes, such as with the 360 degree video experiences that put you places like war-torn Syria or inside someone's home. The above avatar tech expands that greatly, and lets you do things that aren't physically possible in real life. Imagine you're in a VR environment with an avatar that your brain has accepted as being you, and then you're put in a simulated environment where you're 4ft tall or a different race or gender. You can't put someone in that position in real life, but VR makes it possible and it'll be interesting to see if that turns out to be useful.\n\n**Learning and social disorders:** On the other side of the scale, there's potential for immersive VR to be used for teaching tasks that involve complex motor skills or specific techniques. Because the entire environment is virtual, a computer can easily characterise and analyse your movements and then determine what you did wrong and provide exact corrective feedback. The technology isn't there yet to do this on a fine motor skills level (we don't have individual finger tracking etc), but it COULD be used for broader things like body language and posture. Especially as society is becoming more aware of people being on the autistic spectrum, easy access to tools that can help with things like body language could be very useful. Making it a game gives the player a primary motivator other than the task itself (like with DEEP where the primary motivator is exploring the world), and the player learns as a byproduct of the game.\n\nApologies for the wall of text, just splatting some thoughts on the topic!", "edited": 1492356604.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think VR gaming is going to have some amazing capabilities for improving the human condition and some real medical applications.

This has proven especially true with historic games, as well as architectural and cultural portrayals. But, though I do love these themes, I&amp;#39;d argue they&amp;#39;re not such a far cry from the way movies and books can also garner interest in history and art.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s so important about systematic demonstrations, in my opinion, is that they might constitute a huge intuition pump for some of the most difficult concepts of modern thought. And I&amp;#39;ve heard many writers express concern that, as modern science advances, the gap between laymen and academia widens, meaning that citizens who might need to understand the impact of new science in order to stake a proper political say, don&amp;#39;t have that understanding at all. I suppose examples are numerous, particularly &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; science: denial of global warming, stem cell research, anti-vaxxing ... but you could also argue that the new threats that science inevitably invents need to be at least cautiously considered by the voting public. Any acceleration in how we can cram knowledge into people&amp;#39;s heads is welcome, and these types of games could really be that saving grace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dgcrtue", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492415096.0, "created_utc": 1492386296.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ot8q", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcsb4c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TehLittleOne", "parent_id": "t3_65ot8q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I believe video games are seriously underused for the purpose of education.
