If you&amp;#39;re developing a piece of networking or system infrastructure, the value of open source in combatting closed source lock-in is readily apparent.  In gaming it&amp;#39;s the absolutely dominant use case to deal with closed source software on a regular basis, and the alternatives aren&amp;#39;t perceived as being that good.  Also games are perceived as being (and at least sometimes actually are) short-term projects that don&amp;#39;t have to worry about maintaining compatibility with changing systems over time, that removes another benefit of open source.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg6z31h", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492078111.0, "created_utc": 1492049311.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tiwy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tiwy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tiwy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64tiwy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6k75u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AI221", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ofps", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You can't run it without a license I believe.
