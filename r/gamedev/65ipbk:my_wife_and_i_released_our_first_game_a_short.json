It saved a great deal of time in making a single code base work for iPhone and Android.  But, it gave me quite a few hangups where I think I would have saved some time using my own 2d &amp;quot;engine&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve actually spent about a week on my engine codebase I started before Runevale.  As long as I don&amp;#39;t go crazy, I think the next game I make will use my own engine (SDL2 / OpenGL).  Aiming for a PC release next with the options of any consoles I can get a SDK for (come on Switch).  Definitely a much larger project idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dgdt654", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492479316.0, "created_utc": 1492450516.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbhweq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RGBAPixel", "parent_id": "t3_65ipbk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Which engine did you end up using? \nEDIT: Ah nevermind, see you ended up with Cocos", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which engine did you end up using? \nEDIT: Ah nevermind, see you ended up with Cocos&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dgbhweq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492335617.0, "created_utc": 1492306817.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
