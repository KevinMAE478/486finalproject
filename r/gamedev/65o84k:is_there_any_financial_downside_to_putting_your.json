But I have spent the last 4 months cleaning up and polishing the game and my sales are slowly increasing. Overall I enjoyed the feedback I got from my early adopters. I have also decided to go hibrid, meaning both for VR and without. I am about to do the full launch in the next week or two. Working on the final trailer now and putting a press kit together. It will be interesting to see how much sales I get on the second release if any... you keep an eye on my game here: &lt;a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/500110/\"&gt;http://store.steampowered.com/app/500110/&lt;/a&gt; Hooefully it explodes soon haha.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dgcyl8b", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492424192.0, "created_utc": 1492395392.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
