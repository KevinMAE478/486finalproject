Nothing screams amateur more than having sprites with different pixel resolutions, or with different line widths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always always mockup your graphics in a real resolution scenario.  Create a mockup that&amp;#39;s 2x your target resolution, and draw your graphics at the correct size.  Resizing graphics after the fact will not look nearly as good as designing them to be the correct size in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, make good use of motion tweening, fading and particles to give your game a layer of polish.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dge2n06", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492489932.0, "created_utc": 1492461132.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65v23b", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge5cpv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BruceNY1", "parent_id": "t3_65v23b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I didn't know how to draw either, but I find pixel art way easier to get into.
