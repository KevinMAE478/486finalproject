Only a simple change of disallowing comments on your blog [I know this has happened a long time ago] made me raise my eyebrow and wonder what's going on.\n\nAlso, as a bonus, what's going on with Corona Cards? It looks like an abandoned project. I've tried several times to make use of it, but the usage is very limited and didn't change in my eyes for a year.\nSame thing goes for Windows support. There are tons of APIs which doesn't work, and since there's no Corona Enterprise for windows version, there's not much we can do about it.\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. What does it mean 'part' of Corona Enterprise will be free?\n2. When will you change licensing terms of Corona Enterprise?\n3. Are Corona Enterprise users still limited with choice of plugins?\n4.

When are we going to get some more details, and not only empty brief information thrown at people who potentially could invest in you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about custom plugin usage? Did this policy change after last acquisition or are we still limited?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making CE open source would be great, I would love to be able to fix your IAP implementation and stop using direct native functions... and it would definitely give me more faith in the platform. \nAt the moment, with all the changes to the company, with decrease of users [just take a look at the number of questions on StackOverflow - it&amp;#39;s clearly visible], with limitations to the Corona Enterprise I find it difficult to &amp;#39;sell&amp;#39; idea of using Corona Enterprise in applications which are supposed to be maintained for several years.\nMore than that, I&amp;#39;ve got clients who are very worried about current state and they are looking for different options. Some of them already moved [well, the idea of limitation of Corona Enterprise usage was a nail to your coffin from their perspective].\nI don&amp;#39;t like the idea of migrating my apps, as this is just a big waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that you need to make money, but doing that only based on monetization does not build confidence in your platform. Only a simple change of disallowing comments on your blog [I know this has happened a long time ago] made me raise my eyebrow and wonder what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, as a bonus, what&amp;#39;s going on with Corona Cards? It looks like an abandoned project. I&amp;#39;ve tried several times to make use of it, but the usage is very limited and didn&amp;#39;t change in my eyes for a year.\nSame thing goes for Windows support. There are tons of APIs which doesn&amp;#39;t work, and since there&amp;#39;s no Corona Enterprise for windows version, there&amp;#39;s not much we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What does it mean &amp;#39;part&amp;#39; of Corona Enterprise will be free?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When will you change licensing terms of Corona Enterprise?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are Corona Enterprise users still limited with choice of plugins?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How many active developers of Corona platform have you got now?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do you have plans for Corona Cards, or is it a dead project?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are you going to improve Corona for Windows  [desktop, not phone] to support all of the APIs, or is this dead as well?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks\nKrystian&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dg7jer3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492118994.0, "created_utc": 1492090194.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z3wq", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z3wq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg69ctb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CoronaLabs_Rob", "parent_id": "t1_dg64vch", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for asking! \n\nQ.
