Model out something in a program like MagicaVoxel\n\n2. See how many layers in the Y direction that model has.\n\n3. Now just extract the very bottom layer from the model, and look at it from the top\n\n4. Go into an image editing / pixel editing program and create the same view\n\n5. Do the same for every other layer\n\n6. Import all the images of the different slices as I call them into your game engine\n\n7. Draw them like so; have your first image, the one of the bottom layer, be anywhere, then take the second image, and put it in the same position, except the Y should be +1.\n\n8. Do the same for all the images\n\nNow if you want to rotate it you can do that, but if you want more perspective, you can scale that group of sprites according to rotation. For example if it is rotated downwards then scale it down on the Y axis.\n\nAs someone else mentioned in another post here, the LOVE engine (a favourite of mine 2D, but not as good as SFML), has the same functionality, someone had made an entire system including 3D camera system, which is nice. But if you head over to the GitHub page, and head to the boat folder, than you'll see a .jpg. If you open it, you'll see it has the same layer systems. Now these have been combined into one image, or sprite sheet which is then cropped to get get each frame.\n\nOne big downside is performance, it will be an unpleasant experience running it on old hardware.
