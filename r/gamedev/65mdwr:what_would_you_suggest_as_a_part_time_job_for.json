Your resume will be full of things like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 4-6 years of making dogshit and networking like crazy, get your first real job at a major developer. They will be in the most expensive cities on earth, so get used to living in your car. Learn, learn, learn and in 4-5 years you will be competent enough to escape the &amp;quot;imposter syndrome&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 15 years at that major dev, they might give you a crack at being lead developer, or project manager. You are now about 45 years old, and your glorious moment in the sun has come! Your reward for that long painful grind is to make &amp;quot;trolls&amp;quot; for playstation and xbox... in 11 months.. with the &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game fails to meet corporate sales expectations, and you and the &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; team are made redundant. You can no longer pay your mortgage, so you resort to selling the dev systems you stole out of the dumpster on ebay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You find a new job doing updates to the photo kiosk software at walmart, and when you hit 55, they get rid of you because no one wants old people doing IT or programming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You bounce around for ten years doing anything you can, and wish you had become an engineer instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dgbn2ng", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492343335.0, "created_utc": 1492314535.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mdwr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbka03", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "frameinteractive_ben", "parent_id": "t3_65mdwr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd say figure out a job that pays enough and leaves you with enough brainpower to put in the time coding your own stuff.
