But just listen to the way he feels about the *unavoidable* latency inherent in a video game's input system:\n\n&gt;Video games have this ugly thing going on called \u201clatency\u201d. It\u2019s not only related to networked games, unfortunately \u2013 your single-player platformer will have latency from video as well as input devices. I\u2019ll dedicate an entire \u201cgame feel\u201d article just to talk about latency, but for now let\u2019s look at one of its most common and frustrating effects: the Bullshit-Fuck-I-Pressed-The-Button-and-I-Still-Fell-Into-the-Sodding-Pit\u201d, or \u201cThe Bullshit\u201d for short.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Bullshit happens when you try to jump from the very edge of a platform to maximize your jump distance. But, alas, the game raises you the middle finger as your character stupidly falls to its demise without ever attempting to jump. Most of the time, it is not actually the player\u2019s fault: a combination of input and video latency gives them the clear impression that, in fact, the button was pressed while the character was still on the platform.\n\nSee how he **feels**?\n\nYour question, and OP's, reads to me like this:  \"Should I make The Bullshit worse on purpose, and thus extend even more rudely my game's middle finger at the player?\"\n\nMy answer is, \"hell fucking NO!\"\n\nIf you get deeper into that same series of articles you can read about [stiff nonsense](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MarkVenturelli/20140821/223866/Game_Feel_Tips_II_Speed_Gravity_Friction.php) and his thoughts on proper acceleration curves.\n\nBut look at the end, when he makes an exception for jumping.  Note that the speed curve for jumping is INSTANTLY at full speed.\n\nBottom line, I want the game to respond to my input.  When the response is to start a timer, rather than to move my character, this feels a lot worse.  There had better be a REALLY good reason why the game is made this way, and I don't buy OP's reason about how that's more like real life.  I don't really much care what real life is like when I'm deciding what inputs feel best.\n\nThis a really really important aspect of your game!\n\nIf you simply must have a way of powering up your jump before you lift off (and again I ask \"why\"?) then consider following canon and doing what super mario bros did: you have a sprint button and the duration of the sprint can make the jump higher.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I don&amp;#39;t go into the air the frame after I hit the jump button, I&amp;#39;m going to be unhappy about it.
