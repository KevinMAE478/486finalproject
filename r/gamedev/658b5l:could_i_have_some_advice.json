Called when starting something (the game probably, but maybe a new round or something too).  This one liner produces a vector pointing from the paddle to the ball. Usually vectors like these can be used for object translation, or maybe to indicate direction, depending on purpose. To go into more depth (maybe it will help), it accesses the position of each object from its transform. Each object starts at the origin of the world, and then some transform is applied to it to bring it to a specific rotation, position, and scale. Setting the position actually modifies the transform of the object.\n\nNow for the `Update` function. It does as it says, and is called literally every frame of the game (I'm pretty sure).\n\n    if (!hasStarted) {\n        // Lock Ball to paddle\n        this.transform.position = paddle.transform.position + paddleToBallVector;\n\nIf the game `!hasStarted` = has not started, then we will begin by keeping the ball (`this`) locked to the position of the paddle. It seems to not actually keep it at the position of the paddle, but 'locked' to it. This is because of the `paddleToBallVector` which keeps the ball offset a certain distance from the paddle. Presumably, you could move the paddle left or right across the floor, and the ball will be elevated above it by whatever distance `paddleToBallVector` is, before the game begins. \n\n    if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) {\n        print (\"mouse button clicked\");\n        hasStarted = true;\n\n        this.rigidbody2D.velocity = new Vector2 (2f, 10f);\n    }\n   \nNow the important part. The `Input` handler is listening for the `GetMouseButtonDown(0)` event (which returns an object that is evaluated to be true or false), which is when one clicks the mouse. When it fires, the event becomes true,  and the 3 things happen. The statement is printed, `haStarted` becomes true, and the ball (`this`) is given a velocity. The reason the velocity is a property of the rigidbody is because the rigidbody is the physics object, and it uses the velocity along with its collider to deal with hitting the blocks. The velocity vector has an x and y component, from which you can calculate the direction of the ball and the speed it moves at (magnitude of the vector). Also, now the `hasStarted` is true, it never goes through this whole thing again, because of the beginning `if` condition. \n\nHopefully this all made more sense to you.

The &lt;code&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt; handler is listening for the &lt;code&gt;GetMouseButtonDown(0)&lt;/code&gt; event (which returns an object that is evaluated to be true or false), which is when one clicks the mouse. When it fires, the event becomes true,  and the 3 things happen. The statement is printed, &lt;code&gt;haStarted&lt;/code&gt; becomes true, and the ball (&lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;) is given a velocity. The reason the velocity is a property of the rigidbody is because the rigidbody is the physics object, and it uses the velocity along with its collider to deal with hitting the blocks. The velocity vector has an x and y component, from which you can calculate the direction of the ball and the speed it moves at (magnitude of the vector). Also, now the &lt;code&gt;hasStarted&lt;/code&gt; is true, it never goes through this whole thing again, because of the beginning &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; condition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this all made more sense to you. Feel free to push further, I can go into more depth if you&amp;#39;d like.
