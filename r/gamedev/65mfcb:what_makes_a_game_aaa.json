Not only is it a hit or miss market for independent video game companies, but also, &amp;#39;having an extremely strong capacity to meet its financial commitments&amp;#39; also means having a formidable marketing budget, QA testing, CS/Mods/Admins on staff, and a whole bunch more to really &amp;#39;seal the deal&amp;#39;... and all that takes money (or more accurately: manpower that is afforded by money). Usually that money comes from publishers and investors, which by that point, they would arguably no longer be independent. With that said however, if you (as a development company) were independently wealthy and you made a &amp;#39;super good game that everyone would like&amp;#39;, and also had an immense marketing budget, CS budget, et al..., then sure, you could technically be an indie (as in, self financed) &amp;quot;making the move into the AAA sphere&amp;quot; (as in, high risk of success).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dgbugmg", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492359489.0, "created_utc": 1492330689.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mfcb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbxdru", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ravioli_king", "parent_id": "t3_65mfcb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I might be crazy, but I remember 10 years ago when AAA was a review score for 90% or more.
