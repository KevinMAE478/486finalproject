As a designer, you sort of need to be a jack of all trades and be able to talk shop with all other disciplines, so it&amp;#39;ll require some amount of familiarity with all of the above, unless you&amp;#39;re a specialist designer, like a Systems Designer,  who should know quite a bit about programming, a Level Designer,  a UI/UX designer, who would be best off with a strong art background, or an experience designer, who should be very well-versed in narrative design. All of the above should probably be comfortable with scripting in engines like Unity and Unreal also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all of that aside, getting your feet wet and starting to build up a portfolio of work is hands-down the best way to get your start.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dgd008r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492426160.0, "created_utc": 1492397360.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65r4yj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65r4yj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcnwm5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Seth_Michael", "parent_id": "t1_dgcnahe", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks!", "edited": 1492381208.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dgcnwm5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492409723.0, "created_utc": 1492380923.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcnahe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ninichimusic", "parent_id": "t3_65r4yj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This article won't cover the technical aspects but may help you think about some of the things you may need to create and plan out your next steps...\n\n[5 Top Tips for Indie Game Developers](http://ninichimusic.com/blog/2016/10/31/5-top-tips-for-indie-game-developers) \n\nI hope it helps a little!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article won&amp;#39;t cover the technical aspects but may help you think about some of the things you may need to create and plan out your next steps...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://ninichimusic.com/blog/2016/10/31/5-top-tips-for-indie-game-developers\"&gt;5 Top Tips for Indie Game Developers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope it helps a little!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dgcnahe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492408923.0, "created_utc": 1492380123.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65r4yj", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65r4yj", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd0q2l", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Seth_Michael", "parent_id": "t1_dgcxjrp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "OK, thanks for the advice.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, thanks for the advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "gamedev", "name": "t1_dgd0q2l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492427176.0, "created_utc": 1492398376.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcxjrp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ReltivlyObjectv", "parent_id": "t3_65r4yj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Learn basic programming \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nC++ and Java are good places to start.
