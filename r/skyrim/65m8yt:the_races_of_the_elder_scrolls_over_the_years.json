Masser&amp;#39;s full, waxing, new and waning cycles will make Khajiit medium beasts, large humanoids, small humanoids, or small beasts. Secunda further changes them. Aside from whether they&amp;#39;re quadruped or bipeds, Secunda&amp;#39;s changes seem to have very few bonds with the other moon&amp;#39;s. The effects have a pretty huge range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s interesting is a third moon - unnamed - which can modify the Khajiit born under it even further. Supposedly this moon increases the types of Khajiit from 16 to more than twenty, but it is unknown how. One species of this third type is known; the Mane. When all three moons are aligned in a specific way, a Mane is born. Natural leaders, these often end up ruling the Khajiit. It is unknown how exactly they have to be aligned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is theorised that this third moon&amp;#39;s path around the planet is not aligned with the other two moons, and only a select few alignments will produce a special type of Khajiit, which makes them so rare. So basically if a Khajiit would become an Ohmes-raht and the third moon is in a specific position, Ohmes-raht is &amp;quot;overwritten&amp;quot; by something else. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "skyrim", "name": "t1_dgbvywh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492364543.0, "created_utc": 1492335743.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s837", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m8yt", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s837", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m8yt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcwxq1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Creacel", "parent_id": "t1_dgc9mhk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/skyrim", "controversiality": 0, "body": "casu-el fargoths", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;casu-el fargoths&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "skyrim", "name": "t1_dgcwxq1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492421888.0, "created_utc": 1492393088.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc9mhk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "archaicScrivener", "parent_id": "t1_dgbh0xm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/skyrim", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Excuse me, that;s not just any old Bosmer, that is the mighty lord [Fargoth Ur](http://i.imgur.com/8R1OFTS.png) and you will refer to him with the respect accorded.\n\nDang n'wahs.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excuse me, that;s not just any old Bosmer, that is the mighty lord &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/8R1OFTS.png\"&gt;Fargoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and you will refer to him with the respect accorded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dang n&amp;#39;wahs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "skyrim", "name": "t1_dgc9mhk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492390943.0, "created_utc": 1492362143.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbh0xm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 104, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Athelric", "parent_id": "t3_65m8yt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/skyrim", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Morrowind's Imperial vs the Nord woman next to him is hilariously creepy.
