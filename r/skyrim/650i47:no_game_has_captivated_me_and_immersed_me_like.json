Sadly the games are riddled with bugs and they feel like unfinished products, so definitely install Zone Reclamation Project for Shadow of Chernobyl, and be sure to check out &lt;a href=\"/r/stalker\"&gt;r/stalker&lt;/a&gt; for further interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "skyrim", "name": "t1_dg819wp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492138736.0, "created_utc": 1492109936.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7d7vu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "silvercorrosion", "parent_id": "t1_dg6m5ud", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/skyrim", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is that the Chernobyl games?
