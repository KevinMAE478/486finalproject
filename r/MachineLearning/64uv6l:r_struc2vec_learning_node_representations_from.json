This work presents struc2vec, a novel and flexible framework for learning latent representations of node's structural identity. struc2vec assesses structural similarity without using node or edge attributes, uses a hierarchy to measure similarity at different scales, and constructs a multilayer graph to encode the structural similarities and generate structural context for nodes.
