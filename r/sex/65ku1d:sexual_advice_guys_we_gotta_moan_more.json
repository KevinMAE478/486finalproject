Believe me or not but our moans are like aural switches for our lady which makes her squirm with intense pain and lust for you, and how I reached this conclusion is what I wanna share with you guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a CS major who basically deals with writing numerous codes and programs each single day, and people who code clearly can understand the tiredness and lethargy one feels after writing a long piece of code. My gf on the other hand is a nursing major and practically deals with, you know, nursing (IM SORRY I DON&amp;#39;T KNOW WHAT YOU LEARN IN NURSING). So here was I in my room, locked and writing my code, and in the living room was my gf who was watching TV and having some laughs. Amidst her laughs and the TV noise, I decided to &amp;#39;bust my stress off&amp;#39; because I really needed to and since there was a good amount of aural distraction from the living room, I said &amp;quot;Why not mate&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now we guys have a natural tendency to not moan when making love with our girl since we tend to hold our orgasm for a long time. Holding it in itself takes self control and focus so irrespective of how good or awesome it feels, we don&amp;#39;t want to finish before making our girl finish on us with 100% satisfaction. And also, us guys feel a lot conscious about our moaning noises we make so therefore moaning in front of your girl really does not happen until you release your love juice for her, and since I myself am a guy I also am a part of this group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I was alone in the room and there was a good amount of noise to cover up my moans in my room, I decided to do the deed and begin my work. (Now some might ask why not ask your gf for any help. Well she herself was tired from the day working with patients and wanted some rest to loosen up, so I did not bother to disturb her in any way). Now here I am, jerking my cock off and moaning with light tingles down me while obviously making sure she does not hear me moaning by listening for any changes in volume in the living room, but the closer I approached to my release, the more my body started giving away its cues of moans and hip jerks and &amp;quot;Im gonna cum for you love&amp;quot;. The release felt real good after a long day of work, so after my deed I decided to clean it all up, wash my hands and spend some time with my gf but this is where the story took a twist and things went in the other way ;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I opened the door, I saw my gf standing right in front of the door, staring at me as if she saw something really lewd. Me, realizing that she heard me do myself sunk me into embarrassment below measurable depths, but to what I expected she pushed me back to the bed, undid her clothes and rubbed herself on my cock and I swear to god, she was wet beyond limits and told me that my moans were something she always wanted to hear and finally hearing them made her so horny that she just wanted to have me after that. And in a few minutes, she had me so much that I had the best sex of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this is a long post to convey something short, but many guys like me out there are missing out on something very important in their sexual relationship and it is conveyance of your pleasure to your partner. Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to moan guys because it is something your girl really wants from you for her sexual confidence and your pleasure.

After all if a guy is quiet, is he really enjoying himself? Why do American guys have a tendency to be so quiet during sex?\n\nOne of the most sensitive and pleasurable zones on the penis is the frenulum and inner foreskin. These tissues are similar to the vaginal canal in the sense that both are mucosal tissue, both are sensitive to stretching and temperature changes, and both are normally kept warm, moist, and protected from the outside environment. For many men (myself included) this area is the most important source of pleasure for sex. Personally, I don't like glans stimulation all that much, inner foreskin is much more important.\n\nThe junction between a mans inner foreskin and outer outer shaft skin (called the ridged band) is densely innervated elastic tissue and very sensitive to light touch and temperature. The quality of sensation is similar to fingertips, toes, and lips and can detect very fine changes in texture and temperature. This allows men to feel all the little bumps and ridges inside the vagina in High-Def. On a female, the inner labia and clitoral hood function as the transition between mucosal vaginal tissue and hairy cutaneous tissue (outer labia). This tissue is also very sensitive to light touch, temperature, and stretching sensations.\n\nOK so now that we've established the main erogenous zones on a male and rough comparisons to female anatomy, let's get to the point:\n\nWhen a man is circumcised he loses ALL of the ridged band tissue and about HALF of the inner foreskin and frenulum. Some cuts are more or less damaging than this, but ALL circumcisions remove primary orgasm inducing erogenous tissue.\n\nThis is why cut men last longer in bed and are generally quieter than their intact counterparts....the amount of sensation they feel during sex has been drastically reduced by the removal of erogenous tissues.\n\nDon't believe me? Research the history of circumcision in America. The procedure was originally offered by American doctors explicitly to reduce a mans sexual pleasure in the hopes that he would be less tempted to commit sexual sins. These doctors had foreskins themselves and knew exactly how circumcision would affect the sexual experience of their patients.\n\nI was cut as a baby. I love sex, and have had some wonderful partners who I was very attracted to. Despite this, I am generally quiet during sexual activities. Not because I am suppressing my urges to vocalize pleasure...but because I have no such urges in the first place. Sex is physically underwhelming for me and has never produced remotely enough sensation to trigger any kind of involuntary vocal response from me. If I was to moan during sex it would be 100% fake and likely distract me and make it harder to orgasm.\n\nAmerican ladies - If you would like your men to be more vocal in bed, lose your preference for circumcised men, and start advocating for men to be allowed to keep their penis in one piece.\n\n**TL:DR - Circumcision removes highly erogenous tissue from the male genitals.
