I did this in order to keep from softening my words when I spoke with my boyfriend about it, so my message was clear. It might help you as well. \n (4) encourage him to consider, without telling you out loud immediately (or perhaps even at all), why he seems to be upset at your refusal despite knowing you're uncomfortable with it and not interested.

Remember, it's \"us vs. the problem\" not \"you vs. him\" there's a way to talk it out without ultimatums.

My boyfriend understandably did not pick up on my hesitation).  State clearly that you will not participate in a threesome because it goes beyond your boundaries.

People have difference preferences. In my experience, my partner never intended his fleeting interest in a FFM threesome to be something that jeopardized our relationship. It was always much more important to him than a FFM experience. \nYou don&amp;#39;t have to fulfill his every desire to be an amazing match for him.

I want to please you and make you happy.  I want to make you come super hard and enjoy sex with me, but please understand that you can&amp;#39;t change my mind on this so we need to work out a compromise.  Let me repeat: you canNOT change my mind on this.  It will not be a thing that we do or experiment with or anything.  It will not happen.  So, to continue, we need a compromise.  If you want me to dirty talk, I can do that.  If you want to watch threesome porn and then come have sex with me, then let&amp;#39;s do that.  But, please don&amp;#39;t pressure me to do something that I have no desire to do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he still doesn&amp;#39;t get it, try putting it in his perspective with a hypo.  Ask him if he would be into you shoving pies in his crotch or face because you have a pie fetish.  If he says, &amp;quot;No, that doesn&amp;#39;t turn me on or do anything for me, so definitely not.&amp;quot;  Then point out that&amp;#39;s how you feel about a threesome.  Except the stakes are higher because it&amp;#39;s jeopardizing your feeling of self-worth in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, seriously, do not buckle on this if you don&amp;#39;t want to do it and think it might damage you.  Do NOT compromise by saying you&amp;#39;d be down for it if you baby stepped towards it if you think that even your baby steps would be solely for his benefit, not for yours.  Keep the compromise strictly to what you&amp;#39;re up for and what you think you would be okay with in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sex", "name": "t1_dg5zetm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492038234.0, "created_utc": 1492009434.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5y5sc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "topaz_07", "parent_id": "t1_dg5i3in", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You've put my feelings into words perfectly.

I myself am very uncomfortable with them and I even tried one to see if I could get over my uncomfortableness.  I couldn't and didn't and I don't ever want to have another unless my partner REALLY needed it (not want, but needed) or unless it was just to knock it off my bucket list and be done with it forever.\n\nLong version:\n\nYou're not the only one or unusual.  I kind of hate threesomes, if I'm completely honest.  And I even gave it a good ole college try.\n\nI did one once in hopes that it would be a \"one and done, now let's go do other things\" sort of thing and I got way more damaged from it than I ever let on or realized at the time (yay, numbing and dissociation).  For a while, the thought of doing another one would send me into a panic attack because of how it made me feel (or not feel, more appropriately).  The idea of a threesome turns me off completely now.  I mean, it turned me off beforehand for sure, but now there's a negative numbers percent chance of it turning me on.  \n\nMy SO and I will dirty talk about it (which sometimes makes me panic and stress out inwardly because I wonder how serious he's being and have to check in with him after to make sure it was just a fantasy), but that's about as far as I can go until any further action about threesomes make me get a little numb around the edges of my brain (dissociate) and makes me want to stop sexy times and do something else.\n\nIf it's an MFM, I feel like I'm being used for two men's pleasure regardless of what I want or feel.  I feel like a prop that's there to help them get off, not as a person who has her own needs and desires. Porn's portrayal of MFM threesomes has not helped this feeling in me get any better.  Plus there's double pressure as a woman to not ruin a good time for people bigger and stronger than you are.  \n\nIf it's a FMF, then I would feel insecure, heartbroken, and overall inadequate.  Basically, to me it feels like, by myself, I'm not interesting or exciting enough just by myself.  I would feel like my SO just wants a way to have sex with someone new with my presence and blessing.  Plus, I'm not into women.  I'm not attracted to them and don't find them arousing in a way that I want to be hands-on about.  So, it would be another threesome solely for my partner's benefit where I would feel like a prop.\n\nI also know that under both situations, I'd dissociate again.  I would give the best porn star performance possible, complete with screaming orgasm, but inwardly be going through my grocery list and wondering about who killed who on Law and Order.  It's not fair for any of the parties involved.\n\nAt this point, I'd only do it again if I had to or to knock it off my bucket list.  And half the things I have on my bucket list are just to say I did them in a game of \"never have I ever,\" not because I'm turned on or jonesing for one.\n\nThat said, I'm conflicted because I want, very much so, to be a GGG partner and be open to new things and especially what my partner needs or wants.  I want to be GGG almost as much as I want to not have another threesome ever again (which means sometimes I think I could do one and be okay and have an okay time too.  In those moments, I honestly believe that and it causes frustration and confusion later for me and my partner when I shut the gates again.). I want to be able to do those things and be the hot, cool girlfriend that my partner deserves.  I push myself to do so, but even I have to admit that, realistically, threesomes and I probably have a burned bridge dynamic.  However, that part of me that wants so badly to be GGG and to be hot, cool girlfriend is the same one that looks at the burned bridge and tries to figure out how to pole vault it, even though she knows she really doesn't want to pole vault it for her own pleasure.\n\nYou see my problem?
