We&amp;#39;ve been to two house parties (parallel play, no swap), and were having a follow-up conversation recently. She used a similar phrase that you did &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m excited by how much it gets you going, but I&amp;#39;m mostly doing this for you&amp;quot;... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m obviously going to follow up on that, but I&amp;#39;d be interested if you could expand your thinking on that phrase. My worry is that this could build resentment because she is doing something she doesn&amp;#39;t actively take some kind of joy/pleasure from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sex", "name": "t1_dgdquw0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492476743.0, "created_utc": 1492447943.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
