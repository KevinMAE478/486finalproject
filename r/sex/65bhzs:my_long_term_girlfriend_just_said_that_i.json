I get the impression that she was more of a passive partner who *allowed* it to happen, as opposed to being an active participant.  Yes, she could have been more clear about her boundaries and desires not to have sex... but she was drunk so clearly her critical thinking and decision making skills were hindered.  As the other half of this equation, he could've used affirmative consent to realize that maybe she wasn't that into it and waiting for another time when his partner would be *excited* to have sex and not just allowing the sex to happen.  Now yes, he was also drunk (and horny) so his judgement was hindered by the alcohol and his desire to have sex.  I get that.
