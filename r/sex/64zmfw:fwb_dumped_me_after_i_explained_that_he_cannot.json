This is largely an opinion...  Also, I'm going to abbreviate the act of going from anal to vaginal as a2p.\n\nMedical side: The health risk is likely increased with a2p. Technically, the bacteria you harbor in your rectum should be similar to the bacteria on the skin around your anus, which has a tendency to migrate throughout your groin spontaneously (or accidentally) anyway. That \"normal\" migration is less likely to go to the extent of penile penetration though. So while I'm unaware of any scientific studies quantifying (or qualifying) an increased risk of infection with a2p, logic suggests that there is an increased risk of uncertain extent. While we are taught that the bladder should be free of any bacteria, recommendations are to only prescribe antibiotics if we think a urinary tract infection is causing symptoms. There are instances in which some would not prescribe antibiotics for what amounts to a bladder colonization. Logically, it is likely that some women have GI tracts colonized with the same bacterial strains that colonize their vaginal vaults +/- their bladders. For these women, I would expect that the medical risk from a2p is minimally increased, if at all.\n\nAnal loving guy: As a millenial guy who essentially received most of his (admittedly unrealistic) sexual education via porn, a2p is a kink that I've come to appreciate *in porn*. Frankly, if I'm having anal sex, more than likely I'm too ecstatic about it to acknowledge the nearby vagina as a potential play zone. (Anal is a very special treat in my relationship). But I could see myself wanting to change positions, realizing that anal doesn't work in the new position, remembering the vagina, and getting turned on by the thought of real life a2p. So yes, while it is something I intellectually reserve for porn fantasy, a very significant part of me would love to experience it.\n\nWhere hormones meet science (so basically.... me): Like I said, I would love to feel like a porn star: double dip, get you to orgasm repeatedly into a blissful mush, see you squirt, jackhammer like it's my job, and have my huge erection bring you to the intersection of ecstasy and pain, etc. But most of that is a fantasy. The main reason my SO considers anal with me is because of my love for it- she's learned that it doesn't do much for her. The fact that I am a bit smaller than average helps make it more palatable for her. While I would love to experience a2p myself, I would ask if that is on the table *before* things get heated. If she said yes, I would want to make sure that she feels the same way I do from a scientific and health standpoint. If she also understands that there is probably some increased risk, but thinks a2p outweighs that risk, then I would eagerly do it in a heartbeat. Similarly, if she's done it in the past without problems or does it in the present using toys without problems, I suspect she's one of those happily colonized women, and I would eagerly do a2p.\n\nTLDR: The guy is a fool. Casual FWBs are not easy to come by as a guy, let alone a FWB who enjoys anal and who you can safely have unprotected anal sex with. (You need a lot of trust to do that safely, IMO). Your request to not do a2p is more than reasonable.
