The beginning was a bit rocky because she had mild mental health and sexual identity/self esteem issues. She&amp;#39;s beautiful and has an amazing body but refused to believe so. She started therapy 2 years ago and is doing much better now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back then we used to have sex about once a week - or every two weeks and I was always initiating, we talked about it and she admitted that she found it difficult to enjoy because she felt shame centred around sex. This was all about a year and half ago, she found a more sex positive therapist and we currently have sex almost everyday, I still initiate most of the time but I don&amp;#39;t mind as much because she&amp;#39;s more responsive and enthusiatic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing:&lt;/strong&gt; When she does initiate, it&amp;#39;s right before we go out. We&amp;#39;re both pretty extroverted, so during a good week we go out - not dates, things such as dinner with friends and events - about 3 or 4 times. She does it about half the time (so if we go out 4 times in a week, she&amp;#39;ll do it twice) but never before something important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She won&amp;#39;t just kiss me and ask if I want to fuck. She&amp;#39;ll tease me until I&amp;#39;m basically begging and then asks (which is a pretty big mind fuck because she has all the power and then asks like it&amp;#39;s been my decision) but she always does this about half an hour before we&amp;#39;re supposed to leave, so by the time I&amp;#39;m ready to fuck and she&amp;#39;s actually willing to let me fuck her we can&amp;#39;t even have a quickie without being late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;ll do things like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If i&amp;#39;m sitting on the couch waiting for her, she&amp;#39;ll come out when she&amp;#39;s done and sit on my lap, grind on me and ask me how I think she looks, tell me that she&amp;#39;s been thinking about me all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If i&amp;#39;m the one getting ready, she&amp;#39;ll stand in front of me telling me how good I look while stroking me -never a hand job, just stroking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes she&amp;#39;ll act completely normal but when we arrive she&amp;#39;ll initiate a really hot make out session in the car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 100% sure she knows what she&amp;#39;s doing. She&amp;#39;s normally meticulous about time, she always knows what time it is and how much time has past. Whenever I straight out ask her to fuck, she&amp;#39;ll bite her lip and say &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;re gonna be late&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I sound like the kid who complains about having too much candy. All of this is extremely hot and I love it, she&amp;#39;s knows exactly what buttons to press. I feel like she spent the first 8 months of our relationship not cumming and studying me, but it&amp;#39;s not sustainable. We start becoming unreliable and no-one invites us anywhere if we keep cancelling to fuck and if we don&amp;#39;t fuck, I&amp;#39;m a horny and hazy mess during the whole event/dinner. (I haven&amp;#39;t told her this)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve asked her why she only initiates right as we&amp;#39;re supposed to leave and she acted like she didn&amp;#39;t realise the pattern and apologised. She stopped initiating all together after this -but was still receptive when I did - and I admitted that I loved it and missed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, the pattern became more or less the same but she&amp;#39;s started whispering things like &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not supposed to be doing this, am I?&amp;quot; and asking me if she should stop because we&amp;#39;re gonna be late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think she does this because she likes seeing how much I want her, she likes seeing me fight between needing to leave and wanting her. I&amp;#39;m also pretty clingy and attentive at the events we go to after she&amp;#39;s teased me and she&amp;#39;s expressed how much she enjoys the attention. I feel like instead of asking me for the attention she craves, she uses this to get it. Which I don&amp;#39;t think is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do think this stems from her past of not feeling attractive -and now realising that she does have sex appeal. I feel like she has built some of her self esteem around how responsive I am to her (Although I have a pretty high libido, I worry she&amp;#39;ll take it personally when I reject her one day) and maybe that&amp;#39;s not entirely healthy for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question for you all:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe this is a selfish way to put it. How do I suggest that she brings up this dynamic with her therapist and work through it without losing out on the amazing sex that we&amp;#39;ve been having?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Almost everyone said that there wasn&amp;#39;t an issue with her but with me. I asked her why she only initiated before we go out again and she asked me if it bothered me. We spoke and she said that she had been working on initiating and she had decided to try it out in a low risk situation (before going out because if I turned her down, she could focus on the night and forget about it). She liked the way I reacted and decided to carry on that way. She also said that she liked the feeling of being aroused and having that last, which is why she made sure to do it right before we left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mentioned my worries and I took her enjoying the attention the wrong way. She liked the sexual attention I was giving her because it was more aggressive and daring. If I can hide it, I&amp;#39;ll normally place my hand on her thigh and squeeze it. We normally have sex on these days when we get back and it&amp;#39;s more aggressive/rough because i&amp;#39;m so pent up from her teasing me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She simply likes teasing me and what she gets from it.
