Used to get ansy after a couple days but he was only interested once a week or so, so i got used to that &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if we even go a day beyond that now without a legit reason (sick etc) i notice i get seriously irritable. Like you wouldnt believe. Everything he does annoys me until we have sex again lol. He could easily go weeks id say. Ive literally left it a few times out of curiosity to see how long i would have to wait for him to come to me and except towards the end of my pregnancy, the longest was 2 weeks (it was torture to me that it took him so long to make a move - i initiate 95% of the time) but he still didnt seem to get irritable before that though lol. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sex", "name": "t1_dg6pd21", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492066147.0, "created_utc": 1492037347.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64uufo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg77h7q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Abraham_Drincoln", "parent_id": "t3_64uufo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A week.
