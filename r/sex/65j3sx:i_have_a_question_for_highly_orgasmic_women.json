I don't remember having an intense orgasm during sex until I had about 15 encounters (between 2 male partners). Before then I think I was definitely more excited about other things.\n\nI have been with my current sexual partner (also male) for just over 5 years now. We have had sex somewhere between 500-1000 times. I definitely remember being able to cum when we first started having sex (he was a virgin when we met), but I would have something in the single-digit amount of orgasms. It is definitely much, much more intense now. During any given 30-45 minute encounter, I can get off dozens of times. Many multiples. I think it definitely has to do with how the intimacy makes me feel, because I can get off just from being touched/fondled/kissed/etc. After having so many orgasms everything becomes so sensitive that it all becomes even easier. For instance, I usually get off at least once after he's finished and trying to get up/clean up, because feeling his penis throb or move just totally sets me off. I had one of the most intense orgasms in my entire life removing a pillow from underneath my butt after we had finished having sex. \n\nThere are also some other things I've been able to teach myself how to do in the process. For years he wanted me to ejaculate and I wasn't able to achieve that until we had been together for about 4 years. We're also experimenting with anal toys, and I've been training myself to have simultaneous vaginal/anal orgasms during PIV sex (totally recommend because it's amazing). \n\nI've been this way for so long that it is \"normal\" to me.
