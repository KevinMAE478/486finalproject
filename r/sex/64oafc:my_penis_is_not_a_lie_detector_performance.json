Heart-breakingly beautiful. I have a hard time keeping my hands off her body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On our third date, she came over to my place to watch a movie. Afterwards, we went right from our first kiss to taking clothes off. I prefer to take things slowly; and when she stopped me and said the same, I admit I was glad. Rock hard, disappointed  \u2014 but glad. Because it meant she was taking this as seriously as I was. I held her, we cuddled, we shared secrets and insecurities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our next date was at her place \u2014 and we ended up in her bed. I was confused but trying not to question it. I didn&amp;#39;t know what had changed since our last date, but clearly, all of a sudden, she was ready. And just as suddenly, I wasn&amp;#39;t. I went from full mast to a half chub. As soon as I started thinking about my erection like that, I entered a vicious circle of insecurity. I tried to put the condom on, which was actually way more painful than I remember&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t had sex in ten years, and I haven&amp;#39;t been in a long-term relationship for even longer than that. And because I was an irresponsible ass, I can count on one hand the number of times I&amp;#39;ve used a condom. (Part of the reason I&amp;#39;d taken a break from the dating scene was to get my head on right about respecting myself and my sexual partners, making better choices, etc. Getting back into the dating scene once I&amp;#39;d made those changes was... difficult. So ten years went by.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She knows the rough details. I had told her it&amp;#39;d been a long time since I&amp;#39;d been on a date, that&amp;#39;d I&amp;#39;d taken a break from it to work on myself and afterwards found it difficult to get back into the pool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after I went soft, I went down on her to give myself time - and also because I fucking love giving cunnilingus. She seemed to enjoy it. Had an orgasm. I think. It&amp;#39;s been a while since I&amp;#39;ve seen one. Anyway, afterward, she rolled me onto my back, took the condom off, and gave me head. It felt great! But I was still trapped in that vicious cycle of boner monitoring, so for as much pleasure as she was giving me I wasn&amp;#39;t coming. I ended up taking myself in hand, and I was able to come after I told her to put her hand on mine. The orgasm I had was really intense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t talk about the ED. I could tell she was disappointed. She went to sleep. I stayed awake for hours staring at the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She left town for about a week the next day. We parted on good terms. I ultimately blamed the ED on the condom, and while she was gone I tried to find a way to wear the brand I&amp;#39;d bought so it didn&amp;#39;t feel like it was going to twist my dick off. No success. I checked the size with a length/girth calculator online, which recommended \u2014 the exact brand I&amp;#39;d bought. I masturbated a couple of times with a condom on, as a test run. It took longer than usual, but I was able to keep an erection until I came.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a terrible knot in my stomach all week. I thought it was something I ate for a couple days but then I realized it was pure anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night was our fifth date. Again, great conversation, sparks, laughter. We end up making out on her couch. As I&amp;#39;m fingering her, I realize I&amp;#39;ve tensed my stomach really hard to get a better angle into her, and that knot of anxiety has become agonizing. I&amp;#39;m at about half mast, but as soon as we go into the bedroom I&amp;#39;m flaccid. Worse, because of the pain I&amp;#39;m in, it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;ve been in cold water for hours. I go down on her, but I can tell she has given up. She tells me she&amp;#39;s tired, and just wants to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ask her if she wants me to go. She shakes her head. It&amp;#39;s dark but I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;s meeting my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I lay for hours, wide awake. The lump in my stomach is beyond anxiety now. It&amp;#39;s dread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the night, she lets me put an arm around her. She rests her hand on mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morning finally broke, and as she made us coffee I told her, by way of explanation, I was going to lay off wine next time (we&amp;#39;d split a bottle), and I confessed I&amp;#39;ve always had a lot of body shame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She understood - but then she told me how important it is to her that she be with someone who&amp;#39;s attracted to her. She told me there are a lot of people out there, and that if I&amp;#39;m not attracted to her I should just be honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to reassure her, but she seemed resigned to believing that my mouth was lying and my dick was telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know how to interpret what she&amp;#39;d just said. Was it an ultimatum, as in &amp;quot;There are plenty of men out there who can get it up for me, so figure out your shit, quick?&amp;quot; Or was she trying to let me off the hook, like, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t feel like you have force it if you&amp;#39;re not feeling it, just because we happened to hit it off and had a couple nice dates.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We kissed before I left for work, so passionately that I found myself stirring. But I was already cutting it close, so I left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The implied ultimatum in what she told me is freaking me out. I&amp;#39;m seeing her again in two days. There&amp;#39;s lots of great advice on this sub about meditation and mindfulness, exercises, dietary considerations, no masturbation, etc. I&amp;#39;m following as much of that advice as I can between now and then, but... I&amp;#39;m really, really scared. Which is precisely the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could really use a pep talk.
