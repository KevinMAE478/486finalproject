Everyday weather permitting. Then i started to add 100 squats, 50 situps, and 20 pushups, yeah I know pathetic but hey everyone has to start somewhere. This Friday I&amp;#39;ll start doing weight lifting in addition to that, 5 days a week for 1.5 hours. I also got a chin up bar. I&amp;#39;m eating more/healthier, drinking more water. I feel better so &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to go freakishly big or anything. I&amp;#39;m going for this or little less defined because I think it would still be in the realm of perfect&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/zc3CgZG.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/zc3CgZG.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anytime I feel negative I immediately do pushups, situps, squats, and/or pull ups. I find myself doing A LOT of these. That said it really helps and I guess weirdly enough that negative energy kinds of fuels me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside of that i&amp;#39;m just working on my art career and investing in my nerdy hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Going outside really helps.
