And, yeah, having to pee while doing it isn&amp;#39;t the best thing ever, but thankfully I can cum even when I have to pee, and even when I occasionally can&amp;#39;t, having non-goal oriented sex is also pretty good, and builds up excitement for when we do aim for the finish line later during the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sex", "name": "t1_dg8x33i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492186209.0, "created_utc": 1492157409.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65azd8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65azd8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65azd8", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65azd8", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8wvwz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jennifersecret", "parent_id": "t1_dg8wv8s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh no totally not unpleasant.
