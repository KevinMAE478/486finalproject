I don&amp;#39;t want to take that away from her though, I want to be able to satisfy her every desire. Can anyone give me any ideas how to get past this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can sort of see where you are coming from, as sometimes my wife likes the sub-style of being used, some slight degradation and light humiliation.  And while I found that in porn quite arousing, it was a transition for me to actually do/say any of those things to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What helped me is to understand that because we are involving ourselves in a kink, or a sexual fantasy, or a roleplay scenario, or anything sexual in nature that we both enjoy together - DOES NOT alter my value for her, and our family, outside of the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might smack her ass, call her my dirty slut, pinch and tug her nipples really hard.  But its &lt;em&gt;ONLY&lt;/em&gt; in the moments of those dirty, rough sex situations.  I&amp;#39;m not going to start smacking her tits when we are making dinner.  I&amp;#39;m not going to treat her differently that I have been while we are out watching a movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still going to hold her hand. I&amp;#39;m still going to cuddle with her when we watch a movie.  We are going to act like big dorks while grocery shopping with kisses and being playful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, she needs that &lt;em&gt;rawr&lt;/em&gt;, that fire, in the bedroom.  Grab her hips and really pound into her, make her feel like you need her more than anything and that she is there to help you get off. Smack her ass, put your hand around her throat (Please look up how to do this safely!) and look into her eyes like you own her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For my wife, this works immensely, and we don&amp;#39;t have to do it everytime.  And when we are done? I kiss her, tell her she&amp;#39;s fucking amazing and incredible.  Make sure she knows she&amp;#39;s loved and I&amp;#39;m gentle with her again.  Once sex is over, that &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; of being in control is done, and its back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this too long-winded, or too specific to my situation, but just wanted to give you insight into how I did it / how it can work, and maybe you can relate to it that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sex", "name": "t1_dgdk9lq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492469081.0, "created_utc": 1492440281.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vsub", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vsub", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vsub", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdyyld", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tidho", "parent_id": "t1_dgdl042", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can't hurt to keep in mind, this is something she wants too.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t hurt to keep in mind, this is something she wants too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sex", "name": "t1_dgdyyld", "score_hidden": true, "stickied": false, "created": 1492485804.0, "created_utc": 1492457004.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65vsub", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge1kyb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tmfythandle", "parent_id": "t1_dgdl042", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Being vocal during sex is important too.

It's hard being a man because we're programmed to be respectful with women  constantly, and always ask for consent, and focus on giving her an orgasm first, etc. none of that is wrong, but as men we have a lot of social programming to 'correct' or mask our deep animalistic nature.

Here's a general outline of how I get in that mood: use your body, workout some how that day; remind yourself that you're a man however works for you. Maybe a beer or two to loosen up some inhibition. take charge from the start of the sexual encounter. Make it clear that you're in control.

Take what's yours and focus on how good you feel and your sexual experience. The great irony is that, in my experience, this will result in her having a fantastic experience as well. Power moves, hard pounding, grabbing, just a touch of biting from time to time. Grunt, growl, groan. Smack her ass. Pull her hair. Do what comes naturally when you're in that headspace of I'm a god damn cave man and I'm going to take what's mine. Now, the hard part is moderating everything above with not being a piece of shit and crossing any lines. It's a balance, but once in a while you need to fuck your wife hard. Also, after a pretty rough session, make sure to get out of that headspace and reconnect with her on a more caring, comforting level. Cuddle, tell her you love her, ask her if anything that you did was a turn-off or crossed any lines.
