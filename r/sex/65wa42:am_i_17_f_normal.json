There's nothing bad about this, providing you're safe about it and happy in yourself.\n\nYour sexual fantasies aren't \"bad thoughts\" - they're completely normal. The thing about thoughts is that they're internalised so we have no real way of knowing how other people think, and if our thoughts are normal. I can reassure you and tell you that you're fine in that regard, though.\n\nAt 17 I'm guessing you're still in school - the people around you will be at all different stages of sexual development, and as immature teenagers they'll be looking to find people who are different from them and judge and bully them for it.
