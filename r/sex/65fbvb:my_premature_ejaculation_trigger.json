I am much better than I used to be but still pretty bad overall. I can go slow and last for a while, but my trigger is when she moans or I can feel her get close to orgasm it really excites me and makes me cum before she can. This is after 1 minute or 15 minutes of sex. I can be doing fine and be under control and she will start moaning like she is getting close and I will rapidly catch up and beat her to the orgasm. Over time this causes her to not open herself up as much and moan or outwardly enjoy it because it will make me cum, yet it actually reduces her enjoyment and chances of orgasm because she has to suppress it for me to keep going. She doesn&amp;#39;t like it if I detach myself, she wants me to talk to her and caress her, etc...
