I know every girl a guy goes out with is &amp;quot;amazing&amp;quot; on reddit, but she genuinely is. I could gush about how awesome she is for hours without even having to mention that she&amp;#39;s gorgeous, which could prolong it into a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve known each other about two years, met through friends and really bonded quickly. We have alot of common intrests, share a sense of humour, and became good friends after a while. For about the last year we&amp;#39;ve been spending alot of time together and somewhere along the line I&amp;#39;ve realised I was crushing hard on her (I know, I spent alot of time with a great person of the opposite sex and delevoped a crush, I&amp;#39;m a basic bitch flavoured like pumpkin spice).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had feelings she had similar feelings to me, but I was too nervous to test it for the obvious reasons - great friendship, out of my league, etc... and one thing that I&amp;#39;m now ashamed to admit put doubt in my head. She&amp;#39;s paralysed from the waist down and wheelchairbound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this didn&amp;#39;t bother me in the way you might be thinking - that I&amp;#39;m some shallow guy who &amp;quot;could never date a girl in a wheelchair, ewwww.&amp;quot; Fuck that. It was really about not knowing how to care for her, deal with some of her issues, connect with some of the problems she had, etc... A few times I became a shoulder to cry on for her, but I honestly couldn&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;I know how you feel&amp;quot; because I obviously have no clue what it&amp;#39;s like to be disabled and that made me feel like I could never be with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the more I&amp;#39;ve hung out with her the more I&amp;#39;ve learned what it&amp;#39;s all about, what she needs, what&amp;#39;s no problem actually, etc... So for the last month or two it was really a case of fearing I still wouldn&amp;#39;t ever be able to &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a few nights ago, we went out with some friends and got drunk and I was her &amp;quot;designated driver&amp;quot; to get her home. (Me being her driver is kind of a running joke we&amp;#39;ve got). On the way home, we were laughing and joking the way we usually do when she just broke the fuck down. She&amp;#39;s such a strong person, so I&amp;#39;d never seen her like this. She starts saying about how she really likes me, how she knows it&amp;#39;s unrealistic for me to want to be with her, etc... I felt horrid because here was this angel having a breakdown and fireworks are basically going off in my mind while Godzilla dances to Kool and the Gang&amp;#39;s Celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that moment I grew some balls, leant down, and kissed her. Holy fuck what a kiss. She even swung herself around me to hold onto me. It was incredible. When we broke apart I basically pleaded with her to be my girlfriend, she actually had the balls to argue after giving me the best kiss I&amp;#39;ve ever had, and I finally talked her into going out with me. She broke down harder, but it was a happy breakdown (stupid as that sounds). So I take her home, as we both air out how much we&amp;#39;ve liked each other for so long. Got to her apartment block, she said it had been such an amazing night but she hoped I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind if she didn&amp;#39;t invite me up &amp;quot;for coffee.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I was still a little tipsy from the kiss. So the idea of sex hadn&amp;#39;t even crossed my mind. And oc I wasn&amp;#39;t going to pressure her into sex. So I just asked for one more kiss (which I got, FUCK YEAH!) and agreed we&amp;#39;d see each other the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since, we&amp;#39;ve hung out alot. It&amp;#39;s basically been alot of acknowledging how much of a couple we were anyway, with kissing and more shameless staring than usual. And there&amp;#39;s been alot of &amp;quot;well, it&amp;#39;s about f***ing time&amp;quot;s from friends and family. I&amp;#39;ve also been bragging wherever anyone will listen, oc. Which you&amp;#39;ve probably guessed after reading a few paragraphs of me doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now onto why I&amp;#39;m posting this on &lt;a href=\"/r/sex\"&gt;r/sex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have spoken about sex. She hasn&amp;#39;t had it before (paralysed after an accident at 12). But she wants me to be her first (my bragging might spill out a little bit through the rest of this post, please forgive me). She&amp;#39;s perfectly functional down there, so that won&amp;#39;t be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m unsure of two things - 1 - is taking a girl&amp;#39;s virginity any different from regular sex? Yes, despite being a sexual stallion with a wealth of experience (some facts may be exaggerated) I have never actually been a girl&amp;#39;s first. That&amp;#39;s my smaller worry. If there&amp;#39;s anything I need to make sure of, please do tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, what exactly are the ins and outs (pun not intended but it&amp;#39;s getting kept in here) of sex with a paralysed partner? Should I avoid certain things? Are there any convenientional things that are just pointless when someone can&amp;#39;t feel their legs? What should I be prepared for? And, if anyone has tips/suggestions, do share (not those tips, you pervs).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that so much of sex is knowing the person and taking time to learn what they like. But she&amp;#39;s said when she&amp;#39;d like to do it for the first time (it&amp;#39;s soon), and I&amp;#39;m really excited, nervous, scared and, obviously, overjoyed. I just want this to be as great for her as possible, and it&amp;#39;d be just like my dumbass to ruin it by doing something stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been scouring wherever I could find to learn more, and I&amp;#39;ve come across one or two things, but if anyone on reddit has anything to offer, I&amp;#39;m yours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re both 23, btw, if that&amp;#39;s at all relevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Recently, I've started going out with an amazing girl.

So just because you've done it already and she's 23 doesn't mean you have to go from kissing straight to sex.  Honestly that's a lot at once.  You took all this time getting to know each other- easing into full on sex might be more enjoyable.  You can get some of the initial nervousness dissipated like seeing eachother naked for the first time, just exploring each others bodies.

So just because you&amp;#39;ve done it already and she&amp;#39;s 23 doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have to go from kissing straight to sex.  Honestly that&amp;#39;s a lot at once.

You can get some of the initial nervousness dissipated like seeing eachother naked for the first time, just exploring each others bodies.

Only she knows can tell you how  she feels! \n\nI'm not sure others have mentioned it but if she has an injury ABOVE T6 (thoracic spine) she may have autonomic disreflexia which is a condition in people with SCI that comes on with painful /noxious stimuli. Which could include sex. The signs of that are severe Inc in blood pressure,  sweating excessively, above injury level, and or a bad  headache. If this happens, sit her up to Dec blood pressure - do not lay her down if this happens!! The best way to help this is take away whatever is causing it. If needed, call 911. Not trying to scare you with this by any means but it is a serious situation that could happen.
