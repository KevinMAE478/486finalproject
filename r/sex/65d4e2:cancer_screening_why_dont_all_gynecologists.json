Another, I believe more dubious claim, is that mammography finds too many cancers that are indolent, i.e. cancers that would never go on to become invasive and kill the woman. While this statement is not entirely wrong, the problem is that we do not have any way currently available that can reliably tell us if a cancer will become invasive or not. Personally, I don't see how you can reasonably argue that this is a reason to not do mammography. If I tell you that you have a cancer that we can surgically remove and it has a 50% chance of killing you if we don't remove it, what would you do?
