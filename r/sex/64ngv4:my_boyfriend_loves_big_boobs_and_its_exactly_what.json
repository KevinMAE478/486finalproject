Or the prevalence of &amp;#39;petite&amp;#39;/small chested girls in porn. There&amp;#39;s certainly a demand for it. I don&amp;#39;t think you can compare it to penis size. When a penis gets below a certain lenght, it can affect one&amp;#39;s ability to have (satisfying) sex, as the girl might not feel enough. The same is not true for breast size. Breast size doesn&amp;#39;t influence one&amp;#39;s ability to have sex.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m confused as to what not wanting kids or being &amp;#39;disgusted&amp;#39; by pregnant women has to do with liking small boobs. By the way, I find pregnant women very hot. I find the big belly extremely attractive. Sadly, most of the times this means her breasts will also be big(ger). Though I&amp;#39;ve seen some girls who maintained their small breasts and slim figure and just got a big belly. So hot!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sex", "name": "t1_dg4ckxu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491950806.0, "created_utc": 1491922006.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ngv4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ngv4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ngv4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4lezy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "retrick", "parent_id": "t1_dg4dkuv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why? does liking small breasts scream chomo too?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? does liking small breasts scream chomo too?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sex", "name": "t1_dg4lezy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491960562.0, "created_utc": 1491931762.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4dkuv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheItalian93", "parent_id": "t1_dg48m86", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was thinking the same thing when I read that comment.

She even seriously considered breast implants, but ultimately didn't do it, for reasons similar to those you gave. Now she's glad she didn't do it. She has learned to embrace them and rock what she has. She's never short of male attention and she feels confident about herself. It took her some time, but she got there. I'm sure you'll get there as well.   \n\nNow about your boyfriend: he said that boobs are his favorite thing in general. That doesn't have to mean he (only) likes big boobs. I'm a \"boobs guy\" myself, yet I prefer (very) small boobs. People just assume that you must be into big breasts when you like boobs, but it doesn't have to be that way. Secondly, he said he loves your breasts and your body. I believe that's true. If he wouldn't, he wouldn't be with you. If big breasts really were that important to him, he would've gotten with a big chested girl. But he loves you and he loves you for who you are. Please take his word for it. I'm not saying this to make you feel bad/guilty, but as a guy, I have found it frustrating when a woman wouldn't believe me when I said I adored her tiny tits. He wants to make you feel good; so let him.   \n\nI sometimes look at big breasted women also. Even though I prefer them small, I can't help but let my eyes wander sometimes. Often, it's out of sheer amazement (\"holy fuck, those are big!\") or just a natural response to just boobs in general when they're out on full display (I'm going to notice a low cut out shirt, whether the boobs are big or small). This may also be happening with your boyfriend.   \n\nMaybe he likes all kinds of breast sizes. That's okay too. As long as he doesn't ogle other women when you're around. Doesn't matter of they're big breasted or flat chested: it's not respectful to look at other women when you're out with your girl. It's fine if he's looking at them when he's alone or with his friends. That's even healthy. But not when he's with you. Just tell him that. He should be able to understand that.   \n\nI think your sex life will only worsen if you keep your bra on and keep 'hiding' them from him. It only reinforces your negative image of yourself.
