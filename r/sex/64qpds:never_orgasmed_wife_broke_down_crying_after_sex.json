[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "sex", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backstory:\nMy wife does this thing where after sex she just gets upset sometimes, even if I feel that it was an intense lovemaking session, I always ask her if she wants more after I finish which if she says yes, would be some fingering while she holds her vibrator (magic wand) to her clitoris. During foreplay she doesn&amp;#39;t like receiving oral, nor does she like for me to finger her, she only wants penetration. I have an average penis size which is 5.5 inches and I have somewhat above average girth but I&amp;#39;m no pornstar in terms of stamina etc. The standard advice on this sub seems to be please your woman using fingers or tongue before the actual penetration part, which I can&amp;#39;t do since she doesn&amp;#39;t like it. Yes we&amp;#39;ve tried it many times in the past and I think she used to like it when it was new for her but she once suddenly stopped liking it. I thought I was bad at it so I watched the Nina Hartley video everyone recommends and even read the entire book she comes first and convinced her to give it another shot a few times after she said she doesn&amp;#39;t like it. And no I didn&amp;#39;t mention orgasming or anything like that during those times, I just asked her to enjoy it. She stopped me after 5 minutes every time stating it doesn&amp;#39;t feel good. It&amp;#39;s common knowledge that 5 minutes is barely getting started for oral. And  bye the way when I say &amp;#39;stopped&amp;#39; I mean she physically will move my head and close her legs even after I truthfully proclaimed that I love the way she tastes and I love licking her, I really don&amp;#39;t want to stop, telling her I haven&amp;#39;t even touched the clitoris yet etc. she won&amp;#39;t ever talk to me about what she likes, what feels good what doesn&amp;#39;t. She barely talks at all during sex besides answering questions I ask her. She says it feels weird to talk. So ultimately I gave up on trying oral because she&amp;#39;s obviously not having it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife has never had sex with anyone else before me. She also does not masturbade at all. She has  never had an orgasm. She also does this weird thing which I&amp;#39;m 99% sure is part of the problem, where when I used to give her oral or when we play with the vibrator, she&amp;#39;ll start shaking, I&amp;#39;m talking both legs, stomach, hands legit (what I&amp;#39;ve seen from porn) pre-orgasm type shaking. She lets the shaking happen once or twice and then stops. And again I don&amp;#39;t want anyone to say you shouldn&amp;#39;t let her stop or you shouldn&amp;#39;t stop licking or fingering her until she comes so let me say this again, she will physically pull me out of there and shut down all access. I&amp;#39;ve tried many times to tie her hands and feet up (with her permission) but she will start yelling and screaming if she gets that far, and close up with the little leeway that she has to the point that it is uncomfortable and frankly a bit rapey for me to continue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for about a year or so now we&amp;#39;ve been just having sex like this; foreplay (kissing, touching, her giving me oral, me kissing her everywhere), penetration (various versions of missionary , cowgirl, doggy etc.) followed by me fingering her while she holds the wand up to her clit if she asks for more. Yesterday after I finished I asked if she&amp;#39;s in the mood for some more and she angrily said no and ran to the bathroom. She came back My wife did something that no husband ever wants to hear, feel, or experience and started straight up crying. Saying stuff like she doesn&amp;#39;t get from sex what I do and every time we have sex and she doesn&amp;#39;t enjoy it she feels like she&amp;#39;s being used. Keep in mind that I&amp;#39;m being blindsided by all of this, except her being upset after sex which happens often. She also said she feels something is wrong with her which is why she&amp;#39;s the way she is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It hurt a lot to hear that. Honestly typing that up I had to hold back my emotions. I always figured that she enjoyed sex to a degree since she moans during penetration, and sometimes asks me to fuck her in a certain way but I knew that degree wasnt on par with mine  (which seems common in marriages and relationships in general) but I had no idea that she felt &amp;#39;used&amp;#39;. In the moment I didn&amp;#39;t show my emotions towards what she said but I told her that maybe we&amp;#39;re trying to find a building inside her that she doesn&amp;#39;t herself know the directions to and for it to be enjoyable she will have to find out how to get there and show me the way so I can help her go there. I also said that it&amp;#39;s almost like we&amp;#39;re both trying to solve this Rubik&amp;#39;s cube and we can turn and turn and turn but we won&amp;#39;t magically get there without her knowing the algorithms. (Sorry I do this weird thing with examples) I begged her to explore herself on her own time and even told her to get any new toy her heart so desires, she only has the wand so far. She agreed and said she would do some research. I asked her what the whole &amp;#39;used&amp;#39; this was about and she said she didn&amp;#39;t mean it the way it sounded but she meant the sex is only for me and that&amp;#39;s not how it&amp;#39;s supposed to be. But those words won&amp;#39;t stop ringing it my head, my stomach has been in this weird knot ever since. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About me: I just basically told you all that&amp;#39;s wrong with my wife in bed but believe me I still love her to bits and pieces. However I also have many flaws. When she first started getting upset after sex it kind of made sex less fun. So i started jerking off more frequently and I&amp;#39;ll admit I adapted to a &amp;#39;deathgrip&amp;#39; which I&amp;#39;m working on. My dick isn&amp;#39;t as hard as it used to be and there have been times where I couldn&amp;#39;t get it up or keep it up. (More often than id like to admit) but I&amp;#39;ve been working on it by jerking off less frequently, buying toys for myself (to avoid death grip), medicating with drugs like weed/cialis etc. also since we first started dating I&amp;#39;ve put on some weight and so has she to be fair.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Backstory:\nMy wife does this thing where after sex she just gets upset sometimes, even if I feel that it was an intense lovemaking session, I always ask her if she wants more after I finish which if she says yes, would be some fingering while she holds her vibrator (magic wand) to her clitoris.

Both of you should get some help to sort it all out. It could be just a matter of some resentment about one thing or another on her part, and frustration on your part for not being able to fulfill what you want either. First, I'd say work to get healthy. You both have put on weight that can have a lot of impacts beyond the obvious appearance ones, as you probably have discovered. Eat better, exercise, get to your desired state of health. Simultaneously, you can both see a counselor. I'd say to the same one by yourselves first, then come together after a few sessions. May be more constructive that way once you've both had a chance to objectively think and discuss it all with an unbiased person. And lastly, be prepared to accept that she may have changed, may have not been has honest with you in the beginning about how important or fun sex is for her, for you to have changed, or for you to come to the realization that you could/should be doing something differently to help the situation.

It could be just a matter of some resentment about one thing or another on her part, and frustration on your part for not being able to fulfill what you want either. First, I&amp;#39;d say work to get healthy. You both have put on weight that can have a lot of impacts beyond the obvious appearance ones, as you probably have discovered. Eat better, exercise, get to your desired state of health. Simultaneously, you can both see a counselor. I&amp;#39;d say to the same one by yourselves first, then come together after a few sessions. May be more constructive that way once you&amp;#39;ve both had a chance to objectively think and discuss it all with an unbiased person. And lastly, be prepared to accept that she may have changed, may have not been has honest with you in the beginning about how important or fun sex is for her, for you to have changed, or for you to come to the realization that you could/should be doing something differently to help the situation.

That sometimes leads them to seek other experiences -- through cheating or dissolving the relationship and seeking others elsewhere.\n\nIt would appear that neither you nor I know what her true motivations are, but I suspect one of these elements are at play.\n\nIt's clear you love this woman dearly, and if she is going through a buyer's remorse scenario it doesn't necessarily mean the end of the relationship. You have made numerous attempts to accommodate her situation while simultaneously expressing your unconditional love for her. That's all great and shows the type of guy you are. But I will say this -- don't go too far with it. If she continues to express a reluctance for you as a partner, don't surrender your dignity and self-respect just to make her happy -- because that's a heavy price to pay and you probably won't even make her happy in the end.\n\nI've been where you are -- so in love with your woman that you would literally do everything in the world before you would ever opt to leave her. But you must remember, love is a two-way street. It must go both ways. No one person can love enough for the two of you. It takes two to start a relationship but it takes just one to end it.\n\nI once loved a girl more than I've ever loved any person or thing in my entire life. We dated for almost exactly two years and I wanted nothing more than to stay with this girl forever. I seriously lost all interest in other women due to her. However, in the end she decided she would regret it if she didn't date a little bit and gain other experiences, apart from me. We began dating straight out of her divorce after she'd been married 9 years. Thus, her dating resume was precariously lean. It didn't matter how much love I showed to her, it just came to a point where she decided she couldn't be happy without experiencing the waters out there. It crushed me and still does a little bit to this day, and we broke up 3 years ago. I felt like it would be impossible to replace her and that I wouldn't be capable of loving someone again. Clearly, I was wrong and I now can see we are better off apart. But the one thing I'm glad I did was I preserved my dignity and self respect through the ordeal.\n\nDon't tolerate bad or hurtful behavior. It's okay to weather occasional storms, but if her actions and words are repeating, your best option is to leave the relationship. Divorces aren't the end of the world. Believe me, I'm divorced. And it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nTry to work with her to resolve whatever the problem is. But if you get to a point where you feel you've exhausted your arsenal -- and she is still dismissive of you -- I strongly advise you to walk away, peacefully and respectfully. She is NOT the only woman in the world for you. There are plenty of women out here who would love to have what you offer. Love your wife, try and help her, but don't lose yourself for her. It will only cause lasting pain, resentment and will not lead to happiness.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something is going on with her and she is not communicating it with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As much as I hate to write this, I feel it&amp;#39;s appropriate and just might help you. But she may be experiencing a bit of buyer&amp;#39;s remorse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I mean by that is this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This possibility entered my head the second you said that you&amp;#39;re the only person she&amp;#39;s ever had sex with. Some women are notorious for taking this path in relationships, regardless of whether there&amp;#39;s a marriage certificate or not.
