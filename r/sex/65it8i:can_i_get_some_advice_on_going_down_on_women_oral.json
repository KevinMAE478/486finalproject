[It started as a joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/3qo906/advice_psa_blowjobs/cwh7q9j) where I used a fellatio guide as a template and swapped out the anatomy, but I think it would be a good outline for anyone who's looking to learn the mechanical techniques that most women will enjoy. But always remember that everyone has different preferences, and that one of the most important sexual techniques you can develop is effective communication.

Experiment to find out what works for the gal your attention is on. The use of the mouth is what makes it a box-lunch.

Some women might like that, of course. Use your discretion)  \n\n*When her clit's inside your mouth*  \n\n - Teeth hurt. For a large majority of women, they don't like this. Be very cautious of her clit near your teeth, it can be an immensely unpleasant experience to feel like someone is trying to chew through your pussy.\n - Adjust your suction as you go. Everyone's different, some like none, some like you to be a vacuum, many like somewhere in between. The amount of suction you're applying changes how it feels to her because it pulls the various surfaces in your mouth tighter to her clit to varying degrees.\n - Use your lips and your tongue together. You can wrap your lips around her clit, use your tongue to move her clit around in the space made by your lips, and stimulate it with up/down or circular motions. This can be very soft or very firm depending on what your partner is enjoying. Same goes for speed of stimulation. Starting off slow &amp; gentle is good, and check for extra enjoyment when you gradually try increasing pressure and/or speed of stimulation. \n - Pressure from your face (typically your upper lip) can be applied to provide stimulation to the general area of the clitoral hood. Some women have a lot of clitoral tissue buried just below the surface, and this can be a good way to provide additional stimulation. If you provide pressure and she bears down on your face and/or \u201cgrinds back\u201d, you'll know she\u2019s enjoying it.
