I&amp;#39;ve a got bit of experience in the squirting department and have a pretty good technique for those interested. This is just a guide, and has worked for me with partners, but YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: I am just a man who has had this work for me with partners. Feel free to tell me what works for you..take it or leave it! This is NOT meant to spark a debate over what squirting is, or if it&amp;#39;s a turn on or turn off, liked/disliked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to replace your/you with your partner if you are doing this for someone else. Same rules of the road apply. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget to trim your fingernails (male or female). Essential part of any hand play. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instructions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As someone pointed out to me, edging will be key. I&amp;#39;ve added some pauses, but stopping and starting, delaying the gratification with/without a partner is a good way to up the ante.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Find a comfortable place where you can be flat on your back. Knees bent or flat against the bed to begin with. Thighs slightly apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Start by caressing your entire body. This is something most people miss out on in any foreplay. Loving yourself and allowing to be loved puts you in a mindset to receive pleasure. Caress even the parts that are not usually paid attention to...along the outer edge of your ears with the tips of your fingers, jaw line, shoulders and collar bone. Avoid the lower half of your body for now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Caress from the head downward. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Breast play is a great way to get things started. Pay attention to the inner and outer parts of the breast working up to nipple play. A tug or pinch is great if you so desire. Spend as much time as you can holding off on the final destination for now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Spend time continuing down to your stomach and thighs, all the way down to the feet. Massage and caress, this is about loving the self and relaxing into your body, not focusing on any kind of result. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) Once you get to the vulva, massage the outside working in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) Bend your knees, thighs spread a little more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8) DO NOT TOUCH the clitoris (this is key), but feel free to massage around it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9) Focus around the opening of the vagina, and slowly press one finger inside once you are a few inches deep, make a come hither motion, brushing the upper wall/ceiling of the vagina. You want to focus on finding a soft sponge-like area (Spot) a few inches in and up. Up and in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10) Focus on this area with the tip of your middle or index finger, which ever will reach. Slow, light pressured, circles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11) At a certain point add a second finger (ring and middle are best) to slowly massage the Gspot. Soft wide circles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12) Make sure your legs are wide enough and everything other than the bare minimum of muscles that need to be working are relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13) Slowly increase pressure and speed of your fingers on that spot. Focus more on the center. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14) If the feelings become too intense, slow down and back off, or go back to caressing other parts of your body. Stoping and starting can build the tension and make for better orgasms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;15) Take a pause and close your legs going back to other parts of your body. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;16) Once the pressure builds inside, gradually increase pressure and speed to a maximum effort you feel comfortable with, rocking your fingers up and down into your Gspot, almost like you are opening and closing your hand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;17) Take a pause and close your legs going back to other parts of your body. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;18) Apply a LOT of pressure and speed the Gspot. Force is your friend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;19) Take a pause and close your legs going back to other parts of your body. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;20) Press UP up up&lt;sup&gt;up&lt;sup&gt;up!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt;. Go as hard and fast as you can into your Gspot.
