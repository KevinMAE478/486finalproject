I've also worked retail, food service and call centers and those are some of the jobs I found demeaning. Those were some of the jobs I took because I was desperate and needed rent money. No one tries to \"save\" you from working at Starbucks. \n\nNot liking strip clubs is totally fine, it's a personal opinion. But saying you feel bad for the dancers and hoping no one you know ever finds themselves in a situation where it would be appealing is just kinda...ugh. Stripping is a hard fucking job that involves lots of physical work, being In shape, putting together costumes and routines, being great at hair and makeup, being excellent at sales and talking to people, and on top of all of that, putting up with the stigma surrounding it.
