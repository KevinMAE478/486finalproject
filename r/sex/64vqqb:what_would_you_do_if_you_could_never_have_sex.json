Your value as a person doesn&amp;#39;t diminish because of what happened to you, nor does your value rely solely on whether or not you&amp;#39;re capable of having sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mentality is so heavily intertwined with sex that I&amp;#39;m sure there could be a way for you to derive pleasure or enjoyment from sexual things without what you consider the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; sex stuff. It&amp;#39;s upsetting to have the option of normalcy taken away from you without your consent, but unfortunately shitty people don&amp;#39;t need permission from anyone to be shitty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I implore you to talk with a professional about how you&amp;#39;re feeling, or even just someone you trust and care about. If someone you loved were feeling this way...wouldn&amp;#39;t you want to know? You&amp;#39;re at a pivotal state where you&amp;#39;re simultaneously grieving the loss of what you imagined for your life, and trying to rebuild what image of the future you could ever have given your circumstances. Profession help can give you guidance on how to move forward and cope with these changes. Support groups for victims of drunk drivers are another option; drunk drivers wreak havoc everywhere and us survivors are left trying to come to terms with the everlasting effects they&amp;#39;ve had on our lives. There&amp;#39;s something comforting in the fact that you&amp;#39;re not alone in your experiences, but at the same time it sucks that devastating things like this are a common occurrence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please do not make any rash or impulsive decisions; give yourself adequate time to process everything completely. There is no timeline on grief, so please be kind to yourself... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OP, I wish you the very best. It&amp;#39;s selfish for me to say this, but I want you to have a great life. I hope your physical and mental healing progresses so well that you&amp;#39;re able to live a happy, fulfilled life despite these circumstances. Other&amp;#39;s opinions of what&amp;#39;s important in life should not matter to you because it&amp;#39;s not as if you&amp;#39;re living their lives. It&amp;#39;s up to you to decide what&amp;#39;s important to yourself and fight for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sex", "name": "t1_dg7aade", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492097641.0, "created_utc": 1492068841.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vqqb", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7e2ry", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "-blasian-", "parent_id": "t3_64vqqb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Have you seen an occupational therapist?
