A woman&amp;#39;s mind is capable of the most erotic fantasies, which is why so many women read their porn from fanfic to erotic novels. That would be why Fifty Shades of Grey is now a household name. Fantasy is hot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order for her to enjoy her amazing ability to fantasize, you have to clear her mind of all the stress and bad thoughts of the day. Massage provides her the relaxation she needs to clear her mind of all the bad thoughts and stress that makes reaching orgasm, or even enjoying anything she loves, so darn hard. It&amp;#39;s especially beneficial if you create an inviting environment. Light candles, turn off the lights, make it warm enough for her to be naked and dark enough where she doesn&amp;#39;t feel self conscious if she hasn&amp;#39;t shaved or has a pimple. Give her nothing to think about, except positive things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So men are aroused from sight. Combine that with sex and you get sex you can see. I think a lot of guys enjoy sex you can see. Combine the ability to fantasize and sex and that&amp;#39;s when you get sensation. Being able close your eyes and feel an amazing touch slide down you can imagine all the ways it could be happening. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, lucky you, massage therapy is a wonderful exercise that brings all of the minds attention to what you feel. After you&amp;#39;ve relaxed, had all your worries melt away and have had the amazing feeling of massage, all your focus is on how you feel, not to mention the blood that has rushed to her skin making it ever so sensitive to erotic touch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Massage doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily turn her on, but creates the perfect conditions to TURN HER ALL THE WAY ON. now light some scented candles and here&amp;#39;s how to give a massage:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are so many books, articles, YouTube videos that demonstrate massage therapy so much better than I can explain here without making this a novel, so I will just share some tips on GIVING AN EROTIC MASSAGE that I wish I had known when I started learning around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) People usually look back and remember the immediate aftermath of an orgasm, not the actual orgasm, i.e. cuddling. Cuddling is amazing, but after you&amp;#39;ve come, if someone flips you over and continues to make you feel good, with all the warmth and touching of cuddling, you would think you died and went to heaven. And THAT is something they will remember, which leads me to number 2. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Coming once is NOT ENOUGH after you&amp;#39;ve put in the work of an hour or hour and a half massage. Go down on him or her until they come for you, than give a second, shorter massage until they recover, and kindly get on top of them until they finish again. After the incredible massage you gave, they&amp;#39;ll still be horny after the first time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) The butt is such a wonderful cluster of nerves and my current lover&amp;#39;s favorite spot to be massaged. Do not neglect it. And that also includes the butthole. WHAT?!?!? Ew, you can massage that too?!? Yes you can, it feels amazing and a great part of an erotic massage and can be a turn on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Coconut oil is king. Just make sure you or your partner isn&amp;#39;t allergic by rubbing a little on the inside of your elbow first. The stuff makes your skin ridiculously soft, and works well as a sex lube so long as you&amp;#39;re using a birth control besides condoms. It destroys condoms. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Toward the end of a massage you can start combing kisses and touches to turn your partner on, blending the massage into lovemaking. Because if you suddenly switch from massaging to trying to seduce, they may just want you to keep massaging, but if you ever so slowly switch between massaging and more erotic sensations, they&amp;#39;ll just be impatient for you to hurry up and give them more, making them even more aroused. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#39;s all I got for now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there anything I left out?
