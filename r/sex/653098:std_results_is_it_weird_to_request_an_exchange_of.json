As long as it wasnt one way then it&amp;#39;d be good. But I&amp;#39;d suggest getting checked out every time with a new partner and going together as a trust/bonding exercise. We had a right laugh going to the clinic especially as I fucked up the day of the appointment and then rebooked for later in the day then got turned into a pin cushion when I had my blood taken because I apparently have no veins xD &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yeah someone who takes offense at this probably has something to hide and is untrustworthy. But its something i will always offer at the start of a relationship. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sex", "name": "t1_dg7po06", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126379.0, "created_utc": 1492097579.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653098", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7rbkz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stink3rbelle", "parent_id": "t3_653098", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It would turn me on, shows you're responsible with your health and your partners' health.
