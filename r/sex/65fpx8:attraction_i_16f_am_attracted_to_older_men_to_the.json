A lot of people will tell you it's not ok.  A lot of people will tell you it's gross, you're a gold digger, etc..  The truth is, you can't help who you're attracted to.  And, people who aren't attracted to the same thing as you, probably wont understand it. \n\n2.  The majority of people will say that it's gross, mostly just because it's a western social construct.  HOWEVER, there is some truth to it. A 40 year old man willing to date a 20 year old \"girl\", probably has some issues.  As /u/FuzzyManPeach said, a lot of these guys will need validation, are womanizers, or have a whole slew of other problems. Again, not all older men, but enough.  My current boyfriend for example, spent 12 years getting completely walked all over by his ex-wife and only now has really come into his own as a man.  More time, means more baggage.  I love him, but a relationship where I'm not cleaning up his ex's damage would be hella nice.  Unfortunately, I love the shit out of him, and if I had to choose, I'd date him all over again.  :)\n\n3. YOU ARE 16.  I don't mean this in a patronizing way.  When I was 16, I made a dating profile saying I was 18, met up with an older man.  Amazing sex. A-MAZ-ING.  He took care of me. He took me out to fancy restaurants.  He treated me like a princess.  Then after no time at all, he became suuuper emotionally abusive.  But 16 year old me didn't understand what emotional abuse looked like, how sly it could be, or how slowly it could breakdown my self-confidence.  I'm not saying you're me, I'm just saying, I hope that no other girl has to go through what I went though.  STAY AWAY FROM DATING SITES, they will tempt you, and eat you alive.  \n\n4.  These years are going to be rough.  You're sexual desires probably aren't going to change considerably, so you need to woman-up and stop thinking with your vagina.  If you honestly believe you don't have the control to not jump your friends' fathers, then you do need to be in therapy.  However, I don't think this is the case.  I think you're just freaked out because your sexual desires are different than the norm and you don't have an outlet to discuss it with other people.  So exercise some damn control WOMAN, hang out with your friends, have crushes on their dads, and work off your sexual frustration at home by yourself.  You CAN sleep with an older man at your age, but you DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T.  Wait a few years for your brain upstairs to catch up with your brain between your legs. \n\n5.  If you need someone to talk to, don't be afraid to message me.  \n\nAnd finally this: I am 23, I'm dating a 41 year old, and, most importantly, *I am happy*.  I dated and slept with enough older guys to know that they are fucked.  I've also dated or slept with enough 20 year olds to know they are also fucked.  You just have to decide what kind of fucked you want to end up with: the kind that has never done his own laundry and doesn't know what a 401k is, or the kind of fucked that has baggage.  \n\nAlso, /r/DadsGoneWild is the bomb.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;23 female here...

Unfortunately the person they were looking into being with was significantly older to the point where it was not only dangerous, but much like yourself the individual was underaged. This whole situation ended when my friends had to betray the trust of the person and reach out to their school so that the proper authorities could get involved to ensure the safety of the person and all the rest of the students in the near area.\n\nOn the other hand an older family member of mine later married a woman who was younger than one of his daughters. Which shows that love and attraction have no age to a point.\n\nNow when I compare and contrast these two situations I have encountered, the takeaway I get is this: \"There is a point where you cannot control what you find attractive, but there is also a point where you need to understand that some things need to wait for the proper time. Once you have given yourself the chance to grow and live yourself for who you are as a legal adult who loves themselves first then it is no longer a point if dangerous sexual fantasy, but it becomes purely sexual preference when you are a legal consenting adult.\"\n\nI would also suggest you work to understand what may be driving this feeling so that you can be more at one with yourself and make better decisions for yourself as a result. :)\n\nI want you to know that you've made a fantastic step recognizing the dangers and possible consequences of your situation and I'm sorry to see that so many people did not take the opportunity to help someone such as yourself who is very brave in speaking about something I'm sure you are very vulnerable about. I wish you the greatest of personal victories. In the meantime I would suggest you turn your focus not to other people, but to yourself in a sexual manner.

Unfortunately the person they were looking into being with was significantly older to the point where it was not only dangerous, but much like yourself the individual was underaged. This whole situation ended when my friends had to betray the trust of the person and reach out to their school so that the proper authorities could get involved to ensure the safety of the person and all the rest of the students in the near area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand an older family member of mine later married a woman who was younger than one of his daughters. Which shows that love and attraction have no age to a point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now when I compare and contrast these two situations I have encountered, the takeaway I get is this: &amp;quot;There is a point where you cannot control what you find attractive, but there is also a point where you need to understand that some things need to wait for the proper time. Once you have given yourself the chance to grow and live yourself for who you are as a legal adult who loves themselves first then it is no longer a point if dangerous sexual fantasy, but it becomes purely sexual preference when you are a legal consenting adult.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would also suggest you work to understand what may be driving this feeling so that you can be more at one with yourself and make better decisions for yourself as a result. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want you to know that you&amp;#39;ve made a fantastic step recognizing the dangers and possible consequences of your situation and I&amp;#39;m sorry to see that so many people did not take the opportunity to help someone such as yourself who is very brave in speaking about something I&amp;#39;m sure you are very vulnerable about.

I would say go to a therapist and talk to them about it. Preferably a woman because you'll be more comfortable telling her this kind of thing than an older man. I hate to say this, but school counselors are not always helpful. It doesn't make you a bad person to be attracted to older men. In some parts of the world it's actually normal for a teenager to marry a man in his 30s or 40s. But obviously that comes with risks. Less likely to treat you as an equal. More likely to get abused.
