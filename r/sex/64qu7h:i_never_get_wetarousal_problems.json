They also have an &lt;a href=\"http://www.early2bedshop.com/about-lubes\"&gt;info page about lube.&lt;/a&gt; Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "sex", "name": "t1_dg4mwxr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491962195.0, "created_utc": 1491933395.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qu7h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4zcjv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DaenerysTargaryen3", "parent_id": "t3_64qu7h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sex", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're not alone!
