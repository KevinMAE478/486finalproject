I&amp;#39;m quite into older guys sometimes so I was thinking it might go somewhere. He told me he was married, separated - with kids.

The sex was ok - he was considerate and had a nice body. He made me come with his fingers then fucked me until I came again. He hadn&amp;#39;t cum so I offered to go down on him but he said no, save it for the morning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We both went to sleep and sure enough he woke up hard. He fucked me from behind until I came, then we cuddled for a bit - kissed some more and had sex again, cowgirl position, and I tried to hold off coming so we could come together but after a while my the urge to orgasm was too strong and I came again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told him I really wanted to make him cum - he was still hard - and he said &amp;#39;is it ok if I watch porn to help me cum?&amp;#39;. So I&amp;#39;m like yeah sure, I&amp;#39;ve got no issues with guys watching porn during sex. So he gets some porn up on his iPad and I go down on him, and I suddenly realise he&amp;#39;s watching gay male porn. Guys fucking guys. And for the first time he seems to be enjoying himself - previously I&amp;#39;d assumed he was one of those guys who is silent during sex but now he was moaning and breathing heavy and getting really into it.
