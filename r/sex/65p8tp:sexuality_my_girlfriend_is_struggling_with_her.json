Because of my situation I also turned to getting romantically attached or involved with people online. Of course this was purely on the emotional level as sex wasn't possible (aside from phone sex which I definitely did), and this was perfect because I didn't want anyone to see my body. Why would I? It wasn't the body I felt was mine, I didn't want anybody to see me in my female body. \n\nMy relationships with people online were incredibly intense and though there was distance I still don't hesitate to say I was in a relationship with whoever. Emotionally, we were completely invested in the other and it was fantastic. \n\nDuring all of this though, I was never dishonest. Before meeting people I would definitely present as male, though never in photos just in the chats I'd find friends and such. This still wasn't a lie because ultimately that's who I am, the physical body just hadn't met me there haha. Though I did this, if there was somebody I was interested in I told them as soon as I felt something could be there. Their acceptance is a huge factor in whether things will work out. If I'm with someone I should be able to tell them everything, and before I started medically transitioning a lot of my everyday was consumed by being trans so to have to be silent about it all the time? I couldn't do that. \n\nIn that regard I have some degree of sympathy for your partner. I'm sure they're having a hard time mentally. That's all I have sympathy for though as they are the ones who are putting themselves in this position. They are lying to you and lying to this poor girl online. This girl is being taken on a years long ride for nothing. You're not so far in so you're lucky that way. I think you need to end things not only for yourself but for your partner. They can not keep living like this as it's incredibly toxic for everyone, especially their self. \n\nYou will not be able to figure out their identity for them. This is a completely individual journey and you will just be in the way. You already are actually because they're doing all this behind your back. This isn't your fault though, and I'm sorry you've ended up here. It's not the best situation at all. They need the freedom to try cutting their hair without a boyfriend potentially judging them.

", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As trans guy I&amp;#39;ve been in that confusing period of life, too. Because of my situation I also turned to getting romantically attached or involved with people online. Of course this was purely on the emotional level as sex wasn&amp;#39;t possible (aside from phone sex which I definitely did), and this was perfect because I didn&amp;#39;t want anyone to see my body. Why would I? It wasn&amp;#39;t the body I felt was mine, I didn&amp;#39;t want anybody to see me in my female body. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My relationships with people online were incredibly intense and though there was distance I still don&amp;#39;t hesitate to say I was in a relationship with whoever. Emotionally, we were completely invested in the other and it was fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During all of this though, I was never dishonest. Before meeting people I would definitely present as male, though never in photos just in the chats I&amp;#39;d find friends and such. This still wasn&amp;#39;t a lie because ultimately that&amp;#39;s who I am, the physical body just hadn&amp;#39;t met me there haha. Though I did this, if there was somebody I was interested in I told them as soon as I felt something could be there. Their acceptance is a huge factor in whether things will work out. If I&amp;#39;m with someone I should be able to tell them everything, and before I started medically transitioning a lot of my everyday was consumed by being trans so to have to be silent about it all the time? I couldn&amp;#39;t do that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that regard I have some degree of sympathy for your partner. I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;re having a hard time mentally. That&amp;#39;s all I have sympathy for though as they are the ones who are putting themselves in this position. They are lying to you and lying to this poor girl online. This girl is being taken on a years long ride for nothing. You&amp;#39;re not so far in so you&amp;#39;re lucky that way. I think you need to end things not only for yourself but for your partner. They can not keep living like this as it&amp;#39;s incredibly toxic for everyone, especially their self. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will not be able to figure out their identity for them.
