You should be improving your product year-by-year so that customers want to keep using it for as long as possible.\nWith that being said, sticky revenue (I.e. Paying monthly/yearly subscriptions) is, in most cases, the most desirable route to take, for a few reasons.\n\n1. Value multipliers\n    When you are valuing your company, usually, finding that valuation involves a combination of looking at your revenue, your projected future value/revenue, and how likely you are to keep that revenue stream. Usually, you take some valuation, and attribute some multiplier given these and other factors. Companies with sticky revenue (I.e. Subscription models) have a higher multiplier (I believe it's something like 7x) to their valuation than regular companies (which may be something like 2-3x, I don't remember exactly). This means a company with sticky revenue of $1 million a year is more likely to be worth $7 million a year, whereas a company with the same revenue, but non-sticky, is likely to be worth $3 million. This is due to the risk involved, as you have to gain enough customers to make $1 million the next year, which is MUCH harder then retaining new customers.\n2. Customer retention\n     I kind of already went into this above, but as stated, customer retention is MUCH easier then customer attraction. If you apply a non-sticky revenue model, once you do business with a customer, they are gone. You have to factor in the customer acquisition cost, which you will be paying every time you acquire a customer. With a sticky revenue model, you could make a steady stream of income simply by attending to current customers and having superb customer service (as well as a superior product, of course). Acquiring a new customers means that steady stream of revenue becomes a steady stream of even more revenue. Investors will look at this with a smile on their face.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're going into a market that is very well-known for selling products for one-time prices, perhaps there's a reason for it. I would suggest looking into it if that's the case. This is not to say that you should sell for a one-time price simply because everyone else is doing it (entrepreneurship is about challenging the status quo, right?), but you want to understand the market you're getting into when making decisions like this.
