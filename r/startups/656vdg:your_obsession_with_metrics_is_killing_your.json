I see a ton of startups that are having conversations about data and marketing which is awesome!

I\u2019m actually known for a phrase that has led some people to dub me as \u201cinflammatory\u201d or an \u201casshole\u201d that has to do with my love of marketing metrics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYour opinion on marketing doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now of course that\u2019s nothing but a truism designed to shock people into changing their mindset about how marketing works. For the vast majority of people data driven marketing is a new thing. For even more people interpreting the results correctly is even more difficult. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re reading this on Medium. Likely you came here either from one of our social properties, reddit, Hacker News, or some other similar technologically savvy community. You likely have made the jump from 0 to 1 when it comes to thinking about marketing and data. That is, you understand that modern marketing can be measured for it\u2019s effectiveness, it can be tested and iterated on, and marketing can be tied to revenue.\nYou are probably just dangerous enough to kill your own marketing program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this isn\u2019t intended for me to be a jerk, although as I re-read this I\u2019m starting to see why I have that reputation. Rather it\u2019s to point out that knowing enough to be dangerous isn\u2019t the same as truly knowing. When you know the lingo and jargon but don\u2019t truly understand what it means, you can often do more harm than good.\nA great example. I hear people, especially in the tech community, running around saying things like \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cconversions\u201d as goals of their marketing programs all the time. Yet very few people understand what either of those things mean, nor how they\u2019re defining it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hear a word like value, and that doesn\u2019t mean anything particular to me. It\u2019s so vague that, to me, it could mean any of the following:\nReturn on ad spend\nReturn on investment\nShiny things people like\nThings your nephew who is good with computers likes\nAwareness\nBrand Recall\nMarket Penetration\nAuthority\netc. etc.\nThe truth is value is defined by each individual largely as what\u2019s important to them. They substitute their own biases for objective reality and expect, either maliciously or in a more benign sense, for everyone to perceive and anticipate what they want. What\u2019s dangerous about this is that data driven marketing is not a personal experience of marketing, it\u2019s a thing. More so it\u2019s a thing that you don\u2019t get to decide, your customers do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conversions is another one of these. People shout from the rooftops they need conversions, but conversions to what? Conversion to get an email to a newsletter? To a customer? To visit a specific page or perform a specific action? This is a term that has great value (ha!) that has been stomped into the ground by people posturing and trying to say the right things. When you think about conversion as literally just x to y in a granular sense, you can work on your funnel piece by piece rather than running around like a chicken with its head cut off.\nThis also manifests in other ways like optimizing for a specific metric like click through rate, or cost per click etc. People start focusing down on these things like they\u2019re a silver bullet that will fix everything. Nah.\nMetrics are only valuable in the context of other metrics. Having a dirt cheap cpc isn\u2019t worth anything to me if it\u2019s an irrelevant and un-engaged audience. A great ctr is meaningless if the people clicking through aren\u2019t my audience. A form completion conversion is wasted if the potential customer isn\u2019t qualified. In fact I can envision many scenarios where these metrics could be in the metaphorical toilet where I would be happy. It\u2019s all about how they work together, not alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve seen it before, and I\u2019ll see it again, otherwise smart people getting stuck on specific points for seemingly random or emotions based reasons. I say all of this not to be a jerk, but to help you. Too many companies and teams that I see have brilliant insights in front of them that could make them successful but they\u2019re too blind or self interested to seize very real opportunities. Don\u2019t be the team that focuses down on specific things you feel are important. Be the team that looks at all the data and knows what the market is saying to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point of this long winded rant is basically this. It\u2019s awesome there\u2019s a lot more people thinking about data than there were even 6 months ago. If you\u2019re thinking about data that\u2019s great. Learn more. Try stuff. Ask lots of questions. Don\u2019t get tunnel vision, and understand that you know enough to know there\u2019s a lot that you don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s okay. I wake up every day learning about things I\u2019ve never heard of as a marketer. If you don\u2019t you\u2019re stagnating, and in this industry stagnation is akin to death. So be confident and bold, and always keep learning and testing.
