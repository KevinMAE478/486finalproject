Unemployed, newborn baby in hospital, debt growing by the day; it was a nasty time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of days &lt;a href=\"https://lambdaschool.com\"&gt;LambdaSchool&lt;/a&gt; booked 32k in revenue, bringing us to 70k over the past 3 months. Hoping to grow it very quickly from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Totally non-scalable waste of time&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in addition to getting a job I decided to write a book. Yes, a freaking book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d written some blog posts that taught people user acquisition step-by-step that were very well received and had been viewed millions of times, so I took those blog posts, packaged them up, wrote another 10 chapters, and decided to call it a book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I was concerned, because I&amp;#39;d been trained in VC-land that you should only spend your time on things that could end up being really big, and this by definition wouldn&amp;#39;t. But I didn&amp;#39;t care, I needed money, so I stopped that part of my brain and just got started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was the first lesson I learned. &lt;strong&gt;Shut up, don&amp;#39;t think too hard, just get started.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I partnered up with another marketer who had a big following, and we combined our marketing efforts to see how big of a launch we could have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Kickstarter Day&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The day we launched the book on Kickstarter was one of the most important days of my life. We threw it out there, hit up our lists, had a lot of viral stuff tied into the purchase and sign-up flow that actually worked. It went very well, and we sold $18,000 worth of a book that&amp;#39;s in a pretty crowded market (Internet marketing/user acquisition) on the first day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll never forget the feeling of going to lunch, coming back, and realizing I&amp;#39;d made $1,000 while I was gone. I still make $1,000 every week or so from the book, but &lt;strong&gt;that was the first time I&amp;#39;d ever earned money without working for it directly&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&amp;#39;ve never felt that, I&amp;#39;d recommend you do anything you need to to feel it. I don&amp;#39;t care what it is you&amp;#39;re selling or how much it&amp;#39;s for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had just a baby taste, and now I was hungry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Flailing and Being Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figured that the secret that I&amp;#39;d figured out is that if you take something people need to make more money and sell it to them it&amp;#39;s a pretty good way to live. You can justify high prices that way in a very straight-forward manner. I still like that idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I teamed up with another friend and created a new course - this time on the functional programming language Haskell. It sold about $10,000 in a month, despite me really working on the marketing; about 1/6 of what my book did. It was an OK win but not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We slowly realized the market we had chosen was too niche. A small percentage of the population can program, and an even smaller percentage are interested in functional programming. A smaller percentage yet still were interested in Haskell. It seemed like the entire Haskell community bought the course, but it&amp;#39;s just not that big.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we tried to work our way backwards to more beginning programmers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The Bootcamp&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of my friends had attended a code bootcamp and had a pretty miserable experience. Not because the idea of a code bootcamp is bad, but because the particular one they went to was a joke. It pitched itself as the cheapest, but few who left there had any idea as to what they were doing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That kind of pissed me off, and I wanted to do a better job. I would never pay for a bootcamp myself, because I don&amp;#39;t trust them, so what if I created the bootcamp I would want to attend?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, what if we made it like heaven? What if we created the ideal experience; you show up, there&amp;#39;s housing, food, everything taken care of, you stay there and learn until you get a job, etc. That would be so cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started finding housing (had to be in Silicon Valley, after all), caterers, instructors, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difference this time is that instead of just going out and trying to raise I started to run the numbers. I ran them a million different ways, in every scenario, and calculated exactly where things would need to be to start turning a profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I realized &lt;strong&gt;I was getting way too big for my britches.&lt;/strong&gt; It would have come out to something like $28,000 per student, and there&amp;#39;s no way you&amp;#39;re going to spend that on an unknown bootcamp. So we pared down until we landed at the other end. &lt;strong&gt;We really pared down, until all that was left was us and hustle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if we went online-only? Cut out the expensive rent, find only a great teacher, but don&amp;#39;t be one of those online courses that just gives you a bunch of videos and good luck? Could we truly create an extremely low-cost version of what we thought was the perfect individualized experience online, for cheap?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could actually make it a lot cheaper, and access a lot of people who couldn&amp;#39;t otherwise attend a bootcamp. I threw together some prices based on what we would need to replace our salaries (which in retrospect is the wrong way to do it), and came out that at 4 full-time students at 7k each and 4 part-time students at 4k each we would be able to replace our salaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And instead of just any instructor I started searching far and wide. &lt;strong&gt;The instructor was our product, and it had to be perfect.&lt;/strong&gt; I looked at examples of lessons taught, combed through experience, and ended up (magically) teaming up with a childhood friend. He was phenomenal. Now we had... an idea. And that was all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you get 8 people to spend thousands of dollars for something they&amp;#39;ve never heard of, that has no reviews, and how would we do so with a $0 user acquisition cost?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out you still can&amp;#39;t, and I realized we needed a way to pull people in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The Mini Bootcamp&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if we just started teaching a bit for free? Give people a taste, and give them a great (albeit mass) experience, and then see if there are some people who like it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we did just that. We set up a landing page for a free mini bootcamp, and started spreading the word to a few people. If it failed, oh well, we would just spend some time teaching people some skills for free. That would suck, but worse things have definitely happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It grew like wildfire (as does anything that&amp;#39;s free and genuinely trying to help people), and eventually we had 7,000 people signed up. Pro tip: be helpful first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had about 7,000 people sign up for the mini bootcamp, and people started asking if they could get a certificate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A certificate? Who cares? But people &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted one, so we created one. And a few weeks later I spent hour after hour verifying homework, generating tickets, and sending it to the right people. It was a nightmare, but you give the customers what they want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually we had hundreds of applications, and selected a total of 14 people sign up for the first class. More applications are flowing in by the day. I really think given the current numbers we could do $1m this year. I don&amp;#39;t think we will, because we want to scale carefully and keep the quality ultra-high, but that&amp;#39;s what we did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best part for me is that there are no investors involved. I don&amp;#39;t have to spend mental cycles convincing anyone that what we&amp;#39;re doing is a good idea or spend a ton of time trying to sell our concept to people who don&amp;#39;t understand our space or our customers. 100% of time is focused on making the customer experience &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;, and making sure our students are ready to get a job, prepared with the skills, and understand the process of getting hired the minute they&amp;#39;re done with the bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No fancy tricks, nothing too crazy, both of us kept our full-time jobs until cash was in the bank, just a lot of hard, hard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now we know that every moment of our work will define our brand going forward. And the hard part is just starting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Because I know people will ask, the book is &lt;a href=\"https://www.secretsaucenow.com\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the company is &lt;a href=\"https://lambdaschool.com\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
