It\u2019s easy to hand off less desirable tasks to employees that are \u201cin the trenches,\u201d and focus on high-level strategy instead. But by staying humble, rolling up your sleeves, and working alongside your team, you\u2019ll stay connected to both your colleagues and your customers. Making genuine relationships with your team makes them more likely to stick with you, something you\u2019ll be especially grateful for when you hit rough patches (and you will). Staying humble means you\u2019ll have help through the down times, and it also means you won\u2019t get so cocky during the good times, leaving room for an underdog competitor to surprise you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stubbornness&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t refuse to pivot in the name of perseverance. If you\u2019re captaining a sinking ship, it won\u2019t do any good to insist your team keep rowing instead of scanning the horizon for a new port. Keep an open mind, and a strategic move could turn a bleak prognosis into a million-dollar opportunity. After all, YouTube was originally a floundering dating site.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vanity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s easy to start measuring your success by the wrong metrics: the number of press mentions and interview requests, the size of your new office, or the number of products your logo is printed on. But don\u2019t let surface-level shine distract you from digging deeper to focus on what matters, and insist on the same from your team. Lead by example by prioritizing foundational targets like the number of active users, churn rates, revenue growth, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wrath&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not that great leaders don\u2019t have high expectations or demand a lot from their employees. But you can\u2019t expect your team to do every task exactly as you want it, every single time. Even if they did, mistakes and miscalculations are an inevitable part of human nature. And when those situations pop up, you can\u2019t fly off the handle.\nSo keep your team happy. Yes, your office should be professional, and so should your relationship with your team. But that doesn\u2019t mean your workplace should be cold, or that you should act like a drill sergeant. People are more productive when they\u2019re in a good mood. Happy people have more energy, creativity and motivation, make fewer mistakes, and work better with others. They fix problems instead of whining about them. A positive work culture built around your team\u2019s happiness is just as essential to profitability as your product.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Selfishness&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good leaders need a confident sense of self. Independence and self-reliance are admirable traits, so be driven. Pursue your goals without distraction. But listen as often as you speak. Build relationships that will last \u2014 with your team, with investors, with customers. Selfish leaders ignore customer needs in pursuit of their own vision and run with their favorite idea without evaluating or asking for feedback. They refuse to accept ideas that aren\u2019t their own, reject constructive criticism, and see themselves as lone geniuses. Just remember: you can\u2019t do it all by yourself. Even Tony Stark had Pepper Potts and The Avengers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Laziness&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Planning, launching, and running your own business takes a lot of hard work, and few people would accuse any entrepreneur of being lazy in the traditional sense. Pushing yourself and your team and taking calculated risks is at the heart of the entrepreneurial spirit. But once you\u2019ve found success, don\u2019t get complacent. Even if your product has millions of happy, devoted users and your brand is a household name, you need to keep moving forward or you\u2019ll fade into obscurity. (Just ask Blockbuster, Pan Am, or Tower Records.) Always ask yourself, your team, and your customers: \u201cWhat\u2019s next? What can we do better?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Greed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your vision should go beyond making piles of money so big you can swim around in them like Scrooge McDuck. People want their work to mean something. In a study by The Intelligence Group, 64% of respondents said they would rather get paid $40,000 for a job they found meaningful than $100,000 for a job they didn\u2019t. So create a tangible vision for the kind of impact you want your company to have, rooted in something meaningful, and keep it at the forefront of everything you do. You\u2019ll not only attract top talent that\u2019s dedicated to their work, you\u2019ll keep them around.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "- Arrogance\n\nGreat leaders are humble.
