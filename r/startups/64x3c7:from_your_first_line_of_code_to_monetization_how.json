This is common in many tech startups (where most of the team are techy&amp;#39;s) - its the dream of a perfect product and the &amp;quot;pride to create a truely awesome technology piece that is long term sustainable&amp;quot; - its 10 times easier for us techys to focus on what we are good at, and push off the stuff we hate (business dev).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always use the analogy, on your right hand you have your skills and the stuff that makes you the professional you are today (all your tech background, experience, ability to create truely awesome technology), then on the left hand, you have the things you need to be doing to make your business (ie tech you built) successful ... they are SOOO far from one another that its easy to simply gravitate towards what you are good at, and focus your time there. But you need to stop using your right hand now ALL TOGETHER. Its hard, been there, done that, made those mistakes, wasted time in areas that came easy to me, and not focused on the areas that were needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startups", "name": "t1_dg6ibwo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492057903.0, "created_utc": 1492029103.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh26", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64x3c7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6m062", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "177mph", "parent_id": "t3_64x3c7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startups", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Our business is also entirely geared around service APIs - in fact, 99.6% of our work travels over an integration channel utilizing these APIs.
