Schedule face-to-face meetings with various stakeholders (philanthropists, education leaders, politicians, parent groups, etc.) Pitch your technology and get their feedback. Ask for a specific amount of money that is fair. (The ask is a big subject). Some of them might invest right on the spot or make a referral. Politicians might know of grants you can apply for.

The Board should give money and time to the nonprofit and not be dead weight. Ask a lawyer to be on the board and help with incorporation and other legal matters.
