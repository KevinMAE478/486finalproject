In the past, my marketing plans were too high level and generic, which I believe led to the failures of past side gigs. This time, I have a step by step plan with pre-written text and images ready to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve decided to focus mainly on Instagram marketing. Moms are heavy users of this social media platform and there is an active community to tap into.
