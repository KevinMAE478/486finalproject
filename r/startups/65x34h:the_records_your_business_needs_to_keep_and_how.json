How much paperwork? Travel records, entertainment receipts, filed tax documents, vehicle expenses, and\u2026 well, you get the idea. The good news is you usually don\u2019t need to keep your records in perpetuity, but the maybe-bad news is you can\u2019t throw them away immediately, either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your financial records will serve a number of purposes. You will surely need them for your dealing with the CRA (which we\u2019ll address in this article), and they also serve as an invaluable tool for precise bookkeeping and as proof of value during a potential acquisition. With accurate records, you can also tap into the financial analytics provided by your bank to get insights into your financial health and performance. So, which records do you need and for how long? Here\u2019s a brief overview.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Records Do You Need to Keep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The CRA requires all businesses in Canada to maintain three main categories of records. These are &lt;a href=\"http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/slprtnr/rcrds/menu-eng.html\"&gt;income, expense and property records&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, within each category, there are myriad of forms and receipts you must hold on to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Income records include things like sales invoices and fee statements, while expense records are comprised of receipts and vouchers for the things you buy that are associated with running your small business. Property records are, as you guessed, the documents showing any property you bought or sold as a business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what don\u2019t you need to keep? Technically, the CRA says you don\u2019t need to keep receipts related to &lt;a href=\"https://www.fbc.ca/blog/avoid-these-5-common-tax-mistakes-made-small-business-owners\"&gt;entertainment or meals that are less than $50&lt;/a&gt;. But here\u2019s the rub \u2014 you may still want to hold on to those documents to prove other things, like the date of your travel expenses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Long Should You Hold On to Tax Records?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should retain the tax records for your business for &lt;a href=\"http://quickbooks.intuit.ca/r/cloud/record-retention-requirements-for-small-businesses/\"&gt;six years&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, for the tax year that ended on December 31, 2016, you must keep the tax documents on file until January 1, 2023. This is required by the Income Tax Act as well as several other acts of government legislation, and you\u2019ll need special permission to destroy your records early. To do that, apply in writing using &lt;a href=\"http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/t137/README.html\"&gt;form T137&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some special circumstances, the six-year rule does not apply. If you\u2019re involved in a long-term acquisition, for example, you should hold on to the documents indefinitely. In other words, if a larger company comes along and wants to buy your company, check with the CRA to find out when you can ditch your documents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Can You Store Receipts and Tax Documents?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rule of thumb is to store all tax documents for a small business in Canada within the country. If you want to keep your records elsewhere and have a good reason, write to your &lt;a href=\"http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/cntct/tso-bsf-eng.html\"&gt;tax service office&lt;/a&gt; and get permission. Only registered charities, public bodies and a few other types of organizations absolutely must store their records in the country with no chance of a waiver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a pile of papers sounds out-dated, it is. There are loads of tax preparation software options and file storage programs that let you scan receipts into digital form and help you calculate taxes. Just remember that the rules about keeping your records in the country apply to electronic storage too. That means you should find out where the servers are for all cloud-based storage you want to use. If you get your heart set on a tech-savvy storage system with servers in another country, write for permission to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "* Hi all, I wrote this for [The Ferst Digital blog](http://blog.ferstdigital.com/2017/04/17/the-records-your-business-needs-to-keep-and-how-long-you-need-to-keep-them/ ).
