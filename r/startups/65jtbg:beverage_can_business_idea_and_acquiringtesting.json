I cannot and do not want to commit to ordering several thousand pieces of packaging (cans) without first trying out different cans, sizes, and different closures. This includes testing whether I have the right tooling and procedure for the beverage packaging. Is there some magic words, or convincing emails/calls to wholesalers to convince them to sell a few pieces to a possible client? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and responding!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello!
