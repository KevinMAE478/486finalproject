Likes, comments, shares, re-tweets and subscriptions - When that little notification pops up, we need to see who it came from and we\u2019ll likely send one right back. This might seem like it doesn\u2019t benefit the social network very much, but they\u2019re not in the business of selling to you, they\u2019re in the business of selling YOU to advertisers. Reciprocation, in this case keeps eyeballs on the website.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Content marketing is everywhere and there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s so popular. When you read a helpful blog post, you\u2019re accepting a favour from the author. A good example of this might be blogs and community sections of hosting companies like digital ocean. They&amp;#39;ve have created loads of helpful content on many relevant topics, and every time you read the post, the reciprocity is building. Sooner or later you might just give their service a try - I mean they\u2019ve been so helpful, right?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Community Engagement - Being helpful can be a really powerful way of engaging with people and building reciprocity in a community, and that\u2019s not limited to blog posts. If you\u2019re a programmer, consider contributing to open source software projects. If not, perhaps try youtube Community Contributions feature and Contribute video captions, subtitles and translations. Even simply engaging with potential customers on twitter can be useful and really simple. Often, you can find a hashtag or search for a phrase that your customers use and start chatting. When was the last time you were tweeted to by a real person and didn\u2019t at least check out their profile?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Free Trials - Lastly, and perhaps most obviously, if you have a software product - free trials or a freemium subscription model can be a really powerful way to build reciprocity. If your product really adds value to your users\u2019 life, they should be more than willing to pay a fair price and become a customer after a free trial. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Diving a bit deeper into the principals of persuasion with a focus on how they can be put to use online in 2017.

Likes, comments, shares, re-tweets and subscriptions - When that little notification pops up, we need to see who it came from and we\u2019ll likely send one right back.

When you read a helpful blog post, you\u2019re accepting a favour from the author. A good example of this might be blogs and community sections of hosting companies like digital ocean. They've have created loads of helpful content on many relevant topics, and every time you read the post, the reciprocity is building. Sooner or later you might just give their service a try - I mean they\u2019ve been so helpful, right?\n3. Community Engagement - Being helpful can be a really powerful way of engaging with people and building reciprocity in a community, and that\u2019s not limited to blog posts. If you\u2019re a programmer, consider contributing to open source software projects. If not, perhaps try youtube Community Contributions feature and Contribute video captions, subtitles and translations.

When was the last time you were tweeted to by a real person and didn\u2019t at least check out their profile?\n4. Free Trials - Lastly, and perhaps most obviously, if you have a software product - free trials or a freemium subscription model can be a really powerful way to build reciprocity.
