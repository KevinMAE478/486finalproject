Because I&amp;#39;ve had to network a lot, I have great conversations with some extroverts and leave it there; what I do appreciate about them is that they are more likely (not saying introverts don&amp;#39;t) to reach out when they suddenly think of you and that&amp;#39;s good exposure to new stuff. As a team, though, I feel like someone who&amp;#39;s that extroverted can&amp;#39;t be someone that I work directly with / see every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "startups", "name": "t1_dga2kmd", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492247915.0, "created_utc": 1492219115.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9wxsw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hustletogether", "parent_id": "t1_dg9gu1v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/startups", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Agreed.

I think a big weakness for extroverts is the need to be \u2018on the flow\u2019 so they sometimes just can\u2019t sit down and spend hours and hours solving a difficult problem properly. I think this relates mostly to the conscientiousness trait but it is often more common in the outgoing extroverts I think than in introverts.\n- Able to listen to the people. Many extroverts are not necessarily comfortable in exchanging deep and profound thoughts to others and they\u2019d maybe rather just seek out exhilarating experiences to make themselves feel good. While not a bad thing if there is no deeper guidance in the process the superficiality will cause people to not care about the issue on a deeper level. Extroverts =&gt; scale horizontally =&gt; many friends. Introverts =&gt; scale vertically =&gt; deep friends. :)\n- Doing the boring work. Granted this is not an extrovert vs. introvert issue but more of the conscientiousness problem. The one of many tasks of a leader is keeping the schedule and if unable to do so the culture will radiate downwards and cause uncounted problems for years to come IF not corrected.\n- Focusing on important issues. For extroverts they might only see an immediate result of sales or an important investor but if the product is bad it will not matter in the long run. I think introverts are more capable of thinking and iterating the product over and over until they feel it is as perfect as it can be in solving the required problem. This is what separates in the end the \u2018killer-products\u2019 from the mediocre/bad.\n\nHowever I should say that no one is perfectly an introvert or extrovert but something between so it is more of a balance between the traits. Extroverts should bring much needed dynamism to the process and pragmatism to get things moving. But as an introverted leader you should be able to account for this and aim to hire a perfect mix of both, the planning part is your asset remember ;). I think if you are an introvert and have developed social skills so well that people have hard time telling which one you are you are set to go and require only \u2018good people\u2019 to success in whatever you are doing.\n\nA good cause for what you are doing and good motivation for all involved is what is far more important than separate personality traits.\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an introvert who has extrovert friends I must say for a technical team/product being an introvert is an asset if you can manage the extrovert side of things: speaking/explaining a lot to a wide variety of people, creating contacts, managing other people et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;My main reasons for this:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not afraid of solving the hard nitty-gritty problems.
