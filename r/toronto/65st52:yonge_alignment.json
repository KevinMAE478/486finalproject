There is the municipal adress, which most people know about (E.G. 250 Yonge Street). There is also the Legal adress, which never, ever changes. This is often convoluted, something like \"Part of block 4, plan 65R-1245, part of lots 4 and 5, concession 4, east of Yonge Street, New Toronto Township\". Complicated, but there will only be a single property in Ontario with that legal address.\n\nThese legal names are generally based on two levels, the original subdivision of the land in the 1800's, and any more recent plans of subdivision for the land since. The first part of that theoretical legal address, \"Part of block 4, plan 65R-1245\", is for the more modern plan of subdivision. The vast majority of properties have this, as there is very little land that has not been modified since it was first laid out two centuries ago. \n\nThe important part for this question though, is the second part, or the concession blocks. The way land was first subdivided by the crown was done slightly differently across the province, but in the case of yonge street, followed a very specific pattern. A Concession Block was to contain 10 lots to be sold off for farming, and would be 100x100 chains (the measurement used at the time), or around 2kmx2km. On each side of this concession block would be a concession road, to provide servicing to the concession blocks. These have since become our modern arterial roads like Sheppard, Finch, and Steeles (and many others). This concession block would be repeated again and again for an entire \"township\", which was a sort of administrative boundary that would form the municipalities in the area after settlement. Each concession block would then be numbered running from the south, upward, and each lot numbered from west to east. So concession 4 would be the 4th concession block up from the southern boundary of the township, and lot 10 the 10th lot from the western border of the township. Thus you could describe an exact lot as \"Lot 10, concession 4\". This forms the basis of our legal land naming system today. Almost all lots in the province (except for the areas that predate the concession lotting system, such as in downtown) follow this pattern.\n\nSo Surveyors had the challenge of laying this out. They came up with a plan that would see them lay out a \"baseline\" concession road, which would be the first street laid out, then have every concession block be laid out from there. Yonge Street was this baseline. So they wanted to make sure it had some sort of significance.\n\nBut first, I have to explain what Yonge Street was like at the time when they were beginning this work. When Toronto was founded in 1793, the first surveyor laid out 10 blocks for settlement in what is today the St Lawrence area. These 10 blocks were aligned according to the lake. For the next 20 years or so as the village of York grew, all new streets were based on how these were aligned, including the first bit of Yonge Street.\n\nThis brings us back to the Surveyors problem for the baseline. Yonge street was a good candidate, but problem was, Yonge was at a funny angle. In its then current form, due to the angle of the original layout of the Town of York, Yonge street when extended would have seen it run off into the hinterlands of Southern Ontario with little apparent purpose. The Surveyors and Politicians decided they wanted the road to be a direct route from York to Lake Simcoe, so they realigned it slightly so that it would run straight to the Holland Landing area, which is also the southernmost point of Lake Simcoe. With this done, they then drew the rest of the concession road and lot system out accordingly, or about as close to as accurate as you could in the 1820's through thick forest.\n\nAnd that is the very long, complicated answer to what seems like a simple question, that hopefully taught you a thing or two about why our modern road system looks like it does.\n\nThat said, not sure why it shifts earlier. The whole concession system corrects itself at Steeles by shifting east a bit to align with Yonge to fix the problem.\n\nTl;dr: The politicians wanted a road to Lake Simcoe.", "edited": 1492436812.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of a long and complicated reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, the basics of surveying and the concession lotting system used in most of Southern Ontario. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you know, all properties in Ontario have 2 forms of addresses?
