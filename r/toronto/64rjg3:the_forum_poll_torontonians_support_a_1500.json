The company I work for has slightly under 100 employees. 80 of them work in production is various factory positions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To simplify the math, let&amp;#39;s assume we&amp;#39;re looking at a $4 increase and 50/80 currently make min wage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;50*$4 = 200\n200 x 10 (hours) = 2000\n2000 x 6 (days) = 12,000\n12,000 x 50 (weeks) = $600,000&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So an increase to $15 an hour will add 600k to payroll overnight and I certainly cannot (immediately) charge more for my product.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So who wins in this situation?
