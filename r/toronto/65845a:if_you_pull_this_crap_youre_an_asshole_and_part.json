I was making a left turn onto westbound Harbord, off Spadina. There was a streetcar to my left, entirely blocking my view of the intersection beyond. I had two options: 1) run out my advanced green and piss off the drivers ahead of me, or 2) make the reasonable assumption that the intersection would be fairly clear and go. I chose #2 and unfortunately was wrong, as a truck was blocking the entire lane ahead. So I got stuck, blocking the box for one southbound lane for about half a light cycle. I felt super embarrassed and regretful, but there was nothing I could do. The best part was the guy on the motorbike who screamed \"way to think only about yourself\" as he roared by. Funny thing is at that moment I was thinking of everyone else I had inconvenienced, and not myself. So fuck that guy I guess is my point. That and sometimes shit happens when you force thousands of people behind gaint steel machines into a crammed little grid.

I was making a left turn onto westbound Harbord, off Spadina. There was a streetcar to my left, entirely blocking my view of the intersection beyond. I had two options: 1) run out my advanced green and piss off the drivers ahead of me, or 2) make the reasonable assumption that the intersection would be fairly clear and go. I chose #2 and unfortunately was wrong, as a truck was blocking the entire lane ahead. So I got stuck, blocking the box for one southbound lane for about half a light cycle. I felt super embarrassed and regretful, but there was nothing I could do. The best part was the guy on the motorbike who screamed &amp;quot;way to think only about yourself&amp;quot; as he roared by. Funny thing is at that moment I was thinking of everyone else I had inconvenienced, and not myself. So fuck that guy I guess is my point.
