The fact that it's a territory doesn't play into it as much as a person thinks.  Much of Canada is not aware of Yukon's unique bilingual nature.\n\nUnlike what's happening in Yukon, The NWT and Nunavut are officially bilingual for *essential* services  (and even there, some are deemed more essential than others for the purpose of bilingual services).  You can be educated in French in the NWT and Nunavut, but other services, such as health care services, incarceration services, business services, provincial immigration program services, social assistant services, environment, etc are not necessarily offered in French in the NWT or Nunavut unless you *chance* upon a civil servant who speaks French (in a non-designated position).\n\nHowever in Yukon, [all services are designated bilingual](http://www.gov.yk.ca/fr/index.html), like in New Brunswick, with certain positions mandated to be staffed in French throughout the ministries.   The fact that Yukon is a territory has little bearing (As a territory, essential services are required to be bilingual, but Yukon goes far beyond this).  \n\n- Just a few examples:  You can walk into a [hospital](https://i.cbc.ca/1.2627790.1398902496!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/whitehorse-general-hospital.JPG) and expect to get [treated in French](https://yukonhospitals.ca/fr) in Yukon (good luck with that in the NWT or Nunavut).  You can undertake to start a business and do all formalities (and subsequent government business support services) [in French with the Yukon government](http://www.gov.yk.ca/fr/services/24.html), but good luck doing that in NWT or Nunavut.   You can do all your [vehicle services (registration, etc) in French in Yukon](http://www.hpw.gov.yk.ca/fr/mv/index.html), but you can't in the other two territories.  All government signage is [bilingual in Yukon](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/1/yukon-welcome-sign-anthony-dezenzio.jpg) (whereas is certainly is not in the other two territories).  All civil services and public works services are offered in French in the Yukon ([marriage/divorces](http://www.hss.gov.yk.ca/fr/marriage.php), birth registration, [workers compensation](http://www.gov.yk.ca/fr/services/80.html), and you can even do things [like calling the public works department in French to let them know about a burst pipe or a road which needs repairs, etc.](http://www.511yukon.ca/fr/)).  That doesn't happen in the other two territories\n\nAs a sub-national government within Canada, Yukon is the only other officially across-the-board French/English bilingual entity in Canada apart from New Brunswick.\n\nBecause of Yukon's unique nature, it has one of the fastest growing French-speaking populations in Canada.  According to the Yukon ministry of statistics, [Yukon has the 3rd most bilingual population in Canada](http://www.eco.gov.yk.ca/pdf/Census_2011_Summary.pdf), and CBC reports that [French as a mother tongue in Yukon has increased by 63% in the past 10 years](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-becomes-canada-s-3rd-most-bilingual-region-1.2486462) (there are significant populations of Francophones moving to Yukon from Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, as well as more and more Yukon students being educated in French).\n\nStats-Canada reports that [15% of Whitehorse is bilingual](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/as-sa/fogs-spg/Facts-cma-eng.cfm?LANG=Eng&amp;GK=CMA&amp;GC=990), and that 5% of the city was French-first language in 2011, with a 5.3% annual growth rate in French as a first language, with an estimated 7-8% of the city now being French first language in 2017.  \n\nThe numbers drop outside of Whitehorse (4.3% territory wide in 2011, but perhaps closer to 5% in 2017).  Yukon's French is mostly concentrated in Whitehorse.\n\nYukon is still very much English majority, but much of the above makes it so Yukon's government French operations have been expanded over the past couple of decades.", "edited": 1492450270.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yukon is certainly not French-majority (quite far from it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not quite like what you mentioned either (I lived up in that neck of the woods in my early years).  The fact that it&amp;#39;s a territory doesn&amp;#39;t play into it as much as a person thinks.  Much of Canada is not aware of Yukon&amp;#39;s unique bilingual nature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike what&amp;#39;s happening in Yukon, The NWT and Nunavut are officially bilingual for &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; services  (and even there, some are deemed more essential than others for the purpose of bilingual services).  You can be educated in French in the NWT and Nunavut, but other services, such as health care services, incarceration services, business services, provincial immigration program services, social assistant services, environment, etc are not necessarily offered in French in the NWT or Nunavut unless you &lt;em&gt;chance&lt;/em&gt; upon a civil servant who speaks French (in a non-designated position).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However in Yukon, &lt;a href=\"http://www.gov.yk.ca/fr/index.html\"&gt;all services are designated bilingual&lt;/a&gt;, like in New Brunswick, with certain positions mandated to be staffed in French throughout the ministries.   The fact that Yukon is a territory has little bearing (As a territory, essential services are required to be bilingual, but Yukon goes far beyond this).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Just a few examples:  You can walk into a &lt;a href=\"https://i.cbc.ca/1.2627790.1398902496!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/whitehorse-general-hospital.JPG\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; and expect to get &lt;a href=\"https://yukonhospitals.ca/fr\"&gt;treated in French&lt;/a&gt; in Yukon (good luck with that in the NWT or Nunavut).  You can undertake to start a business and do all formalities (and subsequent government business support services) &lt;a href=\"http://www.gov.yk.ca/fr/services/24.html\"&gt;in French with the Yukon government&lt;/a&gt;, but good luck doing that in NWT or Nunavut.
