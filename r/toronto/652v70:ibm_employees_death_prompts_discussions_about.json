They absolutely have some level of responsibility for the quality of life of their employees. For fucks sake they control the environment that those people spend most of their waking hours in. To argue that it isn't on them to consider the impact of this is asinine.\n\nA long time ago I used to work for another huge consulting company similar in size and character to IBM. I lasted 3 months before I got the fuck out and found a job that didn't require me to put my entire life on hold at a moment's notice. It was truly hellish. Shortly after I left the stress in that office became so bad that some programmer who sat just down the row from me (yes, we had rows of computers like it was an assembly line) lost it on a large conference call with a client and told their executive management to go fuck themselves. Not long after that another guy in the office killed himself. There's no question that the level of stress in the office was a major contributing factor in his death. There was other shit going on in his life of course, but if work hadn't been pushing him so hard he might still be alive.\n\nI'm with a small/medium sized consulting company now. I've been a little underpaid for a while now, but overtime is extremely rare and typically came with time in lieu until we switched over to an unlimited vacation time policy. Even though I could bump my salary up a bit by leaving, I don't feel the increase is worth the risk of making my life suck.

The expectation isn&amp;#39;t for bosses to become therapists, but just maybe they should learn to recognize when they&amp;#39;re pushing their workers too hard. They absolutely have some level of responsibility for the quality of life of their employees. For fucks sake they control the environment that those people spend most of their waking hours in. To argue that it isn&amp;#39;t on them to consider the impact of this is asinine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A long time ago I used to work for another huge consulting company similar in size and character to IBM. I lasted 3 months before I got the fuck out and found a job that didn&amp;#39;t require me to put my entire life on hold at a moment&amp;#39;s notice. It was truly hellish. Shortly after I left the stress in that office became so bad that some programmer who sat just down the row from me (yes, we had rows of computers like it was an assembly line) lost it on a large conference call with a client and told their executive management to go fuck themselves. Not long after that another guy in the office killed himself. There&amp;#39;s no question that the level of stress in the office was a major contributing factor in his death. There was other shit going on in his life of course, but if work hadn&amp;#39;t been pushing him so hard he might still be alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m with a small/medium sized consulting company now.
