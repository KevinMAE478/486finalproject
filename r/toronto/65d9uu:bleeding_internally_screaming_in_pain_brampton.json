You can probably make a pretty good guess if you've damaged something extremely badly (like your arm is pointing in the opposite direction or the limb has no feeling, etc) so that could help you pick between urgent care/emerg. But if they're neglecting their fractures because they think it's a sprain.. they most likely don't need to be in the ER. They might need treatment soon in a hospital, but that doesn't mean they need to be in the ER. Like I said, if the pain is in a more serious place like your ribs/skull/neck/pelvis/etc: go to the ER. If you knock your head during the fall: ER. Depending on how you sprained/broke something could also make you want to go to the ER instead (did you randomly collapse while standing? That's suspicious - go to the ER). Diabetic/preexisting conditions: ER. But if you're composed enough to make these decisions, the location doesn't seem life threatening, the way you fell wasn't suspect and your only symptom is pain, you're likely better off going to Urgent Care, you'll be seen by a doctor WAY faster than the ER *everytime*. If you've got more symptoms going on or have reason to believe you're in serious condition, you need to go to the ER. If you're in the ER with a broken toe and no other symptoms/other health conditions, you are part of the problem. Hard to blame people though, they've done a terrible job at advertising urgent care. \n\nI'm speaking from experience. Fell in a stupid way and hurt my left wrist. I waited a whole day because I thought it was a sprain and it was painful but bearable. Overnight the gnarliest bruise I've ever seen had appeared. I was certain it was just a bad sprain and only bruised because my hand slammed into something on the way down, but my family doctor was closed that day and they take a few days to see patients, so I resigned to go to urgent care. My local urgent care has wait times posted on their website and it said 5 minutes, and I knew it was supposed to be wrapped or something (and I wanted painkillers lol) so I decided to check it out. I was shocked when they showed me the Xray and told me it was a fracture. I thought it would be far more painful to break a bone. They splint me up real good (I thought it was an actual cast) and two days later I was in the hospital at the fracture clinic waiting to get my real cast. The fracture clinic at my local hospital is only open a few days a week and it's packed. They told me the ER wouldn't have casted me on the spot either so it's good that I ended up at urgent care, at least I didn't have to wait forever in the ER. They burned a CD for me with my xrays and did some blood work. Again, unsure if my local hospital/urgent care are anomalies with the treatment of fractures, but the setup worked for me. If I had gone to the ER I would have waited for hours and had the same appointment booked. \n\nIf you undermine how bad it is and do still end up needing emergency care, the urgent care doctor could get you through the woodwork of the ER faster than the nurse in Triage, because you've already been formally examined by a doctor who has decided that you do indeed need care/extra testing ASAP. Urgent Care prints a sheet with their examination, you bring that to the triage nurse in the ER. Speaking from experience for that one too. If you want to see a doctor quickly and you're NOT actively dying, urgent care is very valuable. If you may be actively dying or in serious condition, definitely call 911.", "edited": 1492281149.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t make decide if your injury seems minor, you should call TeleHealth Ontario so a nurse can tell you whether you should head to Urgent Care or the Emergency Room. You can probably make a pretty good guess if you&amp;#39;ve damaged something extremely badly (like your arm is pointing in the opposite direction or the limb has no feeling, etc) so that could help you pick between urgent care/emerg. But if they&amp;#39;re neglecting their fractures because they think it&amp;#39;s a sprain.. they most likely don&amp;#39;t need to be in the ER. They might need treatment soon in a hospital, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they need to be in the ER. Like I said, if the pain is in a more serious place like your ribs/skull/neck/pelvis/etc: go to the ER. If you knock your head during the fall: ER. Depending on how you sprained/broke something could also make you want to go to the ER instead (did you randomly collapse while standing? That&amp;#39;s suspicious - go to the ER). Diabetic/preexisting conditions: ER. But if you&amp;#39;re composed enough to make these decisions, the location doesn&amp;#39;t seem life threatening, the way you fell wasn&amp;#39;t suspect and your only symptom is pain, you&amp;#39;re likely better off going to Urgent Care, you&amp;#39;ll be seen by a doctor WAY faster than the ER &lt;em&gt;everytime&lt;/em&gt;. If you&amp;#39;ve got more symptoms going on or have reason to believe you&amp;#39;re in serious condition, you need to go to the ER. If you&amp;#39;re in the ER with a broken toe and no other symptoms/other health conditions, you are part of the problem. Hard to blame people though, they&amp;#39;ve done a terrible job at advertising urgent care. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m speaking from experience. Fell in a stupid way and hurt my left wrist. I waited a whole day because I thought it was a sprain and it was painful but bearable. Overnight the gnarliest bruise I&amp;#39;ve ever seen had appeared.
