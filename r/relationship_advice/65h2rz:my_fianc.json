A few examples:\n\u2022 He thinks drinking alcohol at all is stupid/wrong. Even a single glass of wine with dinner. I respect his choice not to drink but he also expects me not to drink as well. (We are both over 21.) Just today I was on the phone with my maid of honor and she mentioned bringing champagne while the bridesmaids get ready together and when I hung up my fianc\u00e9 said &amp;quot;I will be mad if you drink on our wedding day. And I WILL find out if you do.&amp;quot; He also gets uncomfortable/suspicious when I hang out with my friends because he thinks I could be drinking with them and lying to him about it. We have been together since before I was 21 so at the time I never pushed it because I didn&amp;#39;t drink much anyway/he had a somewhat valid argument but now I don&amp;#39;t feel like he has the right to tell me not to drink/get mad about it. \n2. I&amp;#39;m not allowed to go to gyms to workout or to go jogging outside because he is afraid of men staring at me/flirting with me/following me. When I was in college I got offered a job in the daycare at a gym and he told me he would be mad if I accepted it. (I accepted a better job offer so it didn&amp;#39;t become a big deal) \n3. I&amp;#39;m not allowed to wear yoga pants in public unless he is with me because they are apparently too tight and...(I really don&amp;#39;t understand this rule at all. I ignore it on a daily basis. Yoga pants are too comfy to wear anything else).\n4. I am not allowed to have male friends at all. I do think it is reasonable for him to expect me to not hang out with other men alone, but he gets annoyed if I even mention another guy, and I am certainly not allowed to have text message conversations with them. Sometimes he takes my phone and looks at it and won&amp;#39;t show me what he is looking at. He says he is joking and just teasing me but I honestly don&amp;#39;t believe this. I don&amp;#39;t have anything to hide but it&amp;#39;s still annoying to feel like he doesn&amp;#39;t trust me/respect my privacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in general my fianc\u00e9 is in my opinion a jealous person and untrusting for no reason.

Or is he being crazy and unfair? I&amp;#39;ve tried to tell him that he doesn&amp;#39;t have the right to control me like this but he either doesn&amp;#39;t understand or doesn&amp;#39;t care. He just makes me feel bad by saying that he asks me not to do these things because they give him anxiety. \nEven if I tell him I&amp;#39;m sorry that it makes him uncomfortable but he can&amp;#39;t tell me not to drink he will still be mad about it every time for the rest of our lives. It just doesn&amp;#39;t seem worth it so i just do what he wants. But living the rest of my life being submissive to make my husband happy doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a very good life to me either. \nHow do I make him understand that it&amp;#39;s not fair for him to control me?
