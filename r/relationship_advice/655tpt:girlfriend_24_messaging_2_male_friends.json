Either she needs that constant ego boost (as well as stringing these other two guys along with hopes of something happening) or she&amp;#39;s keeping her options open.  I wouldn&amp;#39;t ask her to quit contact with them.  I&amp;#39;d quit her.  If this is the way she is behaving in a new 5 month relationship, what&amp;#39;s going to happen in a years time when it&amp;#39;s not all fireworks and magic.  Sorry but I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;s mature enough to be able to continue in a committed relationship without the ongoing flirting with other men.  She&amp;#39;s playing all three of you guys and you&amp;#39;re all stroking her ego with the constant attention.  I would wish her well and go your own way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "name": "t1_dg7pize", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126230.0, "created_utc": 1492097430.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655tpt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7p7dy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Hoosierdaddy1964", "parent_id": "t3_655tpt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "She is still your gf why????\n\nYou need to find a girl that actually respects you.

Everything is all good other than these two guys who she speaks to a fair bit. She is open about this and uses her phone next to me in bed, when watching tv etc.\n\n5 months is young.  You also need to clarify if you've discussed exclusivity.  In 2017, if you have not discussed it explicitly, you're not exclusive.\n\n&gt;Guy 1- Messages her every couple of days. Have seen messages such as: 'We know you are mine as soon as we are both single again xx', 'I will take you on a date someday xx'. He often asks her to call him or skype, or send selfies (he has sent selfies, nothing risky just his face). Invites her to meet, come for dinner.\n\nShe likes the attention from this guy.  If not, she'd nip it in the bud.  She's keeping him around for validation and/or backup.  Cannot ascertain whether she's fucked him before, but he sounds too thirsty to have actually been successful.\n\n&gt;Guy 2- Ex-Boyfriend. Has met her for dinner/drinks when he is in town. Has posted a few times on facebook 'Wish you were here x'. Have seen messages like 'When will you be back here so I can see you again? :( xx'\n\nConstantly talking to her ex-boyfriend is a bad sign.  If they meet together for *drinks* when he's in town, that's euphemism for her drinking cum from his cock.  Sorry, guy.\n\n&gt;They both know she is with someone.\n\nSupposedly... and yet, neither of them care.  Nor does she, as she encourages them to keep going.  This is 10000% her fault.\n\n&gt;She will often go a day or two without speaking to them, then spend a whole day glued to her phone and keeps the convo going.\n\nWow!  A whole day?\n\n&gt;We are moving in a couple of weeks back to the city where these guys live, so there is a very real possibility that she will meet up with them at some point. She is very friendly and flirty, makes friends with everyone at the bar, and always says she doesn't realise when guys are interested.\n\nHer choice to move where the extra cock is, no doubt.  You can be sure you'll be the shmuck who buys her stuff (maybe along with guy #1), and the ex will be getting his cum swallowed by her regularly.  Nice of you two to pay for it all, also.\n\n&gt;I feel as though I will just come across as insecure/mistrusting if I bring it up but I do find it a little uncomfortable.\n\nYou're falling into the feminist nonsense.  It's not insecure when your girl is regularly (as in daily) talking to some guy AND her ex.  You're getting fucked, and not in the same way the ex is.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So heres the thing- I have been dating my girlfriend for about 5 months now. Everything is all good other than these two guys who she speaks to a fair bit. She is open about this and uses her phone next to me in bed, when watching tv etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 months is young.  You also need to clarify if you&amp;#39;ve discussed exclusivity.  In 2017, if you have not discussed it explicitly, you&amp;#39;re not exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Guy 1- Messages her every couple of days. Have seen messages such as: &amp;#39;We know you are mine as soon as we are both single again xx&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;I will take you on a date someday xx&amp;#39;. He often asks her to call him or skype, or send selfies (he has sent selfies, nothing risky just his face). Invites her to meet, come for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She likes the attention from this guy.  If not, she&amp;#39;d nip it in the bud.  She&amp;#39;s keeping him around for validation and/or backup.  Cannot ascertain whether she&amp;#39;s fucked him before, but he sounds too thirsty to have actually been successful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Guy 2- Ex-Boyfriend. Has met her for dinner/drinks when he is in town. Has posted a few times on facebook &amp;#39;Wish you were here x&amp;#39;. Have seen messages like &amp;#39;When will you be back here so I can see you again? :( xx&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Constantly talking to her ex-boyfriend is a bad sign.  If they meet together for &lt;em&gt;drinks&lt;/em&gt; when he&amp;#39;s in town, that&amp;#39;s euphemism for her drinking cum from his cock.  Sorry, guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They both know she is with someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Supposedly... and yet, neither of them care.  Nor does she, as she encourages them to keep going.  This is 10000% her fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She will often go a day or two without speaking to them, then spend a whole day glued to her phone and keeps the convo going.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wow!  A whole day?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are moving in a couple of weeks back to the city where these guys live, so there is a very real possibility that she will meet up with them at some point. She is very friendly and flirty, makes friends with everyone at the bar, and always says she doesn&amp;#39;t realise when guys are interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her choice to move where the extra cock is, no doubt.  You can be sure you&amp;#39;ll be the shmuck who buys her stuff (maybe along with guy #1), and the ex will be getting his cum swallowed by her regularly.
