He was verbally abusive and was in general toxic to me. Thing is though that when he met his girlfriend and going to be wife he cheated on her. He has always cheated on his girlfriends previously so i didn&amp;#39;t really put much into it when it happened. We also used to do a bunch of drugs as well that none of them new about, including the one right now. For quite a while he would sleep over at my house maybe 3 times a month and we would just get wasted and do drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally i have stopped doing drugs as it was never really me wanting them or even buying them as well as my drinking has gone down quite a bit. I&amp;#39;m just wondering though before they actually get married if i should tell her about it. I would hate to see her get divorced later on because she found out. Also they have a 2 year old kid. I know she is a good person but also she is quite young and naive compared to him. he is like 35 and she is 24. I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt there relationship or see them go down a bad road in any way, so its not me just wanting to be spiteful to him.

I rsvp&amp;#39;ed to there son&amp;#39;s birthday saying, no, i am not going. she just called me and said whats up. fucking shit, she has no idea that him and i are not friends anymore. fucking a, she is so nice and sweet and doesn&amp;#39;t have a bad fiber in her body. i told her that we got in a fight and he said some unfavorable things to me and did some things i did not appreciate, exact words. she just kept saying &amp;quot;o its alright, we will work it out, i am sorry on his part and i hope we can hang out again still. i know you guys have little arguments every once in a while but it will blow over and we will come together.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;fucking a. god dammit. if this goes bad and this breaks her heart i am going to be so mad. fuck. i can&amp;#39;t believe i let this slid and not doing something about it. maybe she knows, maybe they have worked it out and are fine, but fuck this is tearing me up inside. I just talked to my mom about it and she said not to do anything and that this should give her a big enough sign. i don&amp;#39;t want to tell her before there sons birthday, but i hope that she brings this up and they discus what happened, rationally. i&amp;#39;m pretty sure though that he is just going to say that i&amp;#39;m crazy and i over reacted and some bullshit like that. I have no doubt that he is not going to say what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;for the last year or so (even from right after they were together) every time we would all hang out together they would end up fighting as the night got going. most of the time the second i got over there it was all passive aggressive from him and fucking awkwardness bullshit that you could fucking bottle it was so thick. i told him a couple times that i don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with you two because all you do is fight and i can&amp;#39;t take seeing you treat her like that. he always says that when she gets drunk that she becomes like this. but it happens when were sober and gets worse in the end of the night when they have to interact on anything like getting an uber home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i dunno why i feel this is relevant but a bunch of times when we hung out, me and him, we would be doing nothing important and she would call and he would not pick up. i mean i get it if you don&amp;#39;t want to talk, kinda i guess, but they have a kid to take care of and thats what most of the calls were about. ugh i don&amp;#39;t get it. you call me, i answer, you don&amp;#39;t call (in my view) if you just want nothing. if i call (in my mind) even if we are fighting or w/e its prob something that needs to be taken care of and its important or urgent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;fucking shit, i feel so bad. even without all the drugs and cheating, i would still feel the need to tell her whats been going on and that, i hate to say it, but he is just down right abusive, verbally. we have gotten in some fist fights in the past, but when the hole shit was happening where i couldn&amp;#39;t take being friends with him, i honestly thought he was going to punch me in the face. maybe its just me being a scared little bitch. but i conducted myself in the end very calm and not trying to escalate and verbally fight. i asked him straight up multiple times &amp;quot;hey, what is happening, why are you so angry and shit&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;hey you guys that say i just want to start shit and what not, literally fuck off and fuck you. i&amp;#39;m sorry to say it but that is what i feel after talking to her. i entertained that maybe that is what i am doing and maybe i just want to get revenge, i can&amp;#39;t even think that is a valid idea anymore. while i do say there is not telling and to tell her, causing drama is not what i want in it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i do have this feeling though that might be clouding my decision. when we all first met, it was just by chance that me and her didn&amp;#39;t end up talking and he talked to her. she and i have both said jokingly, so take it what you think its worth, that we could have ended up together. i do feel as well that as much as white knight as this sounds i would never treat her this way and that i wish she could have someone respectful in her life that treats her right. be it me or someone else. its hard to watch someone trip up or fall and not be the one who catches them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;well there you have it kids,&lt;/strong&gt; development in the story, stay tuned next week for probably another shitty fucking long rant. is there anyway to easily update anyone that actually cares to see what i have to say and what happens? either way what you think, i&amp;#39;m going to update you. i&amp;#39;m fucking lost and need some different views, attention and some help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So i \"broke\" up with my best friend of 9 years ago recently.
