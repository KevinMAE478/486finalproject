I know I&amp;#39;m going to blow it today and I need help or I may never see my daughter F/21 again. This is a long story, mostly because I&amp;#39;m desperate and am scared shitless for my daughter. I&amp;#39;ll try to keep it short &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had my daughter at 15. Her dad chose to walk the other way, and has never bothered to acknowledge her. She has the biggest heart for people who have had struggles in life and has always been the kid to make other kids feel like they had a place in the world. She would volunteer at nursing homes to spread her love and help the younger kids in after school programs to keep them off the street. She had tons of friends from here, in the cities around us and from many dance camps she attended throughout high school years. I never had a problem with her except for normal teenage attitudes and pushing limits that kids do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After graduation, she met this guy and started to hang out with him. This guy came out of nowhere. I immediately saw her distancing herself from her friends, I used to have a houseful of teenage girls every Friday and Saturday night for years. All of the sudden, it&amp;#39;s just him and her. I&amp;#39;d question her about it and was told everyone was busy doing their own things, then it was certain girls didn&amp;#39;t like her new boyfriend and then it was he didn&amp;#39;t like them. She said he felt bad they didn&amp;#39;t like him and he played it off as the same. I knew differently. I can see right through this piece of shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two months later, he&amp;#39;s found sleeping in my daughter room. I had never allowed that before, but realized she going to be a freshman in college I needed to give her space and she&amp;#39;s going to do it anyway. It wasn&amp;#39;t like she hadn&amp;#39;t had a relationship before but not like this. So I said nothing and talked to her in private later on in the day. Her attitude shocked me. She immediately said I was judging him and have forgotten how she came about and I needed to get to know him because he really made her happy. I guess I never seen the happy part. What I seen is, my daughter stopped hanging out with the best friends she had since 3rd grade, she stopped going by my parents place to see my father, my father was very important in her life, they never went a day without having ice cream since she was 5. she stopped going to the gym to dance, she stopped going to the nursing home to see her nannies, she stopped dressing in certain clothing, stayed in her room all day with him, most of all, she stopped smiling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout the last 3 years, I&amp;#39;ve lost my daughter. We&amp;#39;ve always had an amazing relationship with very open and honest communication because I didn&amp;#39;t have that with my parents and I think it would have saved a lot of problems. He&amp;#39;s managed to have her move out, quit school to work to pay their bills, loosing 3 scholarships and having to pay them back. He&amp;#39;s had her trade her new  car in for one he liked and put a loan on it, in her and his name. Have a baby with her, she&amp;#39;s not seen her friends in over 2 years, they have all had enough of the way he treats her. She has no care or concern for her hair or makeup. , no self respect and no respect for anyone other than him. Shes wore out, as if she&amp;#39;s 80 years old and done with life. She&amp;#39;s become very distant, I&amp;#39;ve heard several stories of him hitting her, which she denies. Hes disrespectful to me and her step father in every sense. Example. We&amp;#39;re at my niece wedding, a guy was talking about screwing some chic he barely knew and he pops up and says my daughter can &amp;quot;suck dick like a champ and does it on command &amp;quot; said he has the bitch trained and seriously called her over, snapped his fingers and told her get on her knees for daddy! All in front of my extremely catholic father. I&amp;#39;m not even sure my dad knew what he was saying. But my brothers did, and her step father did. They took him outside to &amp;quot; talk&amp;quot; to him and he didn&amp;#39;t see anything wrong with this. My daughter was horribly embarrassed. The next day, my brother offered her to go home with him for a break, ok he didn&amp;#39;t offer, he said she was going. I prayed all night she&amp;#39;d go and she did. I thought then, she was going to be ok. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it began. He was calling her, calling my entire family, saying he&amp;#39;s miserable without her, He was calling my phone all hours of the night, crying, bla bla bla shit. He loved her, and he was going to hurt himself without her. I don&amp;#39;t fall for that shit. Her dad did that crap and I can&amp;#39;t stand it. My sister is a dr, so I helped him out and had him placed in emergency custody for threatening suicide. Big mistake. My daughter came back and was livid. For a month I didn&amp;#39;t see her. It was hell. I Learned my lesson and started to just accept and support her anyway I can regardless if the asshole is there or not. He controlled everything. She works, I stopped working to stay home with my grandson because I need to know he&amp;#39;s ok. They&amp;#39;ve had CPS calls for domestic violence. Our state doesn&amp;#39;t mess around with it and will remove children on a rumor to protect them. He doesn&amp;#39;t work, he drives her car around, screwing other girls and she pays for it. He takes the car payment and uses it so she&amp;#39;ll loose the car. I&amp;#39;ve bailed it out 5 times and that was it. I had to stop enabling her. She lost her car. Then the baby got sick, and of course he was at home without a car and the baby ended up in the hospital with rsv. His O2 was 69%. And it was my fault. Couldn&amp;#39;t be because he smokes in the same room as the baby and the baby has respiratory issues. He refused to let me see him, because I let my daughter loose her car. His mother is just as bad, her son is a great father, my daughter is a bad mom and they threaten her all the time, have her convinced theyll take the baby because she&amp;#39;s gone all the time. She works 60 hours a week. Not a chance in hell we&amp;#39;d let that happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My daughter gets no assistance from the state, she has to work. She doesn&amp;#39;t get help because she has trust funds from both my grandparents and my father. She can&amp;#39;t access these until she&amp;#39;s 25. He refused to pay a dime for the birth, or anything. We paid. I know that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s waiting for, when my father died, he left her quite a bit of money outside of the trust to help with emergencies in case something happened. She wisely spent it on a mobile home, and the rest for her lot rent for the next two years. He has told everyone he owns her and he  can do whatever he wants and she pays him to do it. He posts terrible stuff on Facebook about my family. Saying we think we&amp;#39;re too good for him, there love wins and we&amp;#39;ll never see her or the baby again. He&amp;#39;s convinced her that we&amp;#39;ll never be happy with who she picks because we feel &amp;quot; no one is good enough for our princess.&amp;quot; Never have we ever referred to her as that, He says this because my father was wealthy, and he likes to say we think we are better than anyone. Let&amp;#39;s not forget, I had a child with a 3 time felon at age 15, my family accepted him, loved him but he chose to go. She&amp;#39;s had a job since she could work l it&amp;#39;s called learning responsibility. He&amp;#39;s never had to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, I received a call from the bar from a girl I didn&amp;#39;t know. We own the bar and our number is right by the phone for employees to call. It&amp;#39;s a small bar where everyone knows everyone. She told me everyone in the bar was concerned for my daughter, they wanted to make sure she wasn&amp;#39;t going home with him. After that I received 3 more calls from the doorman and bartender saying they were worried. Apparently he was drunk, telling everyone in the bar that my daughter was &amp;quot;his pussy&amp;quot; he owns it ect. I can&amp;#39;t even type the disgusting things that he said. An old friend of hers was in town, he&amp;#39;s gay and the sweetest guy in the world. They&amp;#39;ve been friends since 4 th grade and he apparently hugged my daughter and a fight ensued. He broke out his two front teeth and threw him down on the ground and was thrown out of the bar. The cops weren&amp;#39;t called because no one wants more stress for my daughter, and the boys at the door caused some damage to his face and also didn&amp;#39;t want to go to jail. She messaged me said they fought and she&amp;#39;s staying at her friends house because he won&amp;#39;t let her back in HER  house or get HER  car, and I&amp;#39;m to keep the baby. She&amp;#39;d see me in the morning. An hour later that piece of shit called me, telling me my daughter is a whore, she&amp;#39;s a drunk and has slept with half the town, and he&amp;#39;s coming to get his son. I told him calmly as \nI always do that I knew nothing,  the baby was asleep,  they&amp;#39;d be fine and work it out in the morning because he&amp;#39;d be sober and he&amp;#39;s to go to sleep. Messages continued for 2 hours of hate/love and he was sorry. His last message said he&amp;#39;d see me tommaro for easter with his family!! Meaning us! You have no idea the things I wanted to say. I&amp;#39;m livid! I know he&amp;#39;s talking to her and convinced her to go home. Again! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now today we start over again. I know he&amp;#39;ll be coming with her, he&amp;#39;ll be smiling as if he&amp;#39;s a king, he&amp;#39;s conquered again. he&amp;#39;ll act like he&amp;#39;s the best dad in the world and he&amp;#39;ll treat my daughter like a dog. Ordering her around as if he&amp;#39;s entitled. I can&amp;#39;t do this anymore, watching your child cater to a creep is devastating. I know my daughter needs me to stay strong. She needs me to be here no matter what and I have been. My whole family has been. Time and time again. I&amp;#39;ve actually been extremely nice and full of fake support for him and he eats it up. It&amp;#39;s the worst feeling in the world knowing some egotistical fuck is hurting your child and there&amp;#39;s not a damn thing you can do about it. I am not a violent person, I don&amp;#39;t judge anyone, But there comes a time where this can&amp;#39;t happen anymore. I&amp;#39;m not far from paying to have this fuck taken out. My heart literally breaks for her, for my grandson. I hate thinking that little boy is watching his mommy get hit, or hearing his daddy call his mommy disgusting names. I hate the fact that he calls her such horrible names, throws shit at her, hits the dogs, breaks the doors and she hangs her head!  What the fuck is wrong with him! I hear the sirens and start praying it&amp;#39;s not her and have to wait for her to call. We can&amp;#39;t message her because he gets the messages. She wasn&amp;#39;t raised with any of that. In fact quite the opposite. I sit and read about domestic violence everyday, trying to find any kind of answers. I can&amp;#39;t help but think its because her dad never cared. I don&amp;#39;t know. Today Is easter, of course he spent all the money on beer and weed, so my grandson won&amp;#39;t have easter if it&amp;#39;s not here. My brothers won&amp;#39;t come, they can&amp;#39;t refrain from beating his ass. My sisters won&amp;#39;t come because they don&amp;#39;t want their daughters seeing it and thinking it is ok. How the hell do I do this? My husband is at his breaking point. He&amp;#39;s extremely calm and has intervened when he needed too, but this isn&amp;#39;t going to go well. He&amp;#39;s angry, he&amp;#39;s raised her since she was 4. To her he&amp;#39;s her dad, and her person she goes to for grounding. He has the ability to calm any situation, but he&amp;#39;s completely had it and said he&amp;#39;d be beating his ass the minute he comes through our door after putting his hands on our child. Yes he&amp;#39;s mad. How does one shake the hand of the devil who hurts the one you love the most. I would die a thousand times for her happiness, I&amp;#39;d commit a million felonies for her to feel safe. I&amp;#39;m just praying that doesn&amp;#39;t become a reality anytime soon. I know there&amp;#39;s many women that have suffered from domestic violence, and it&amp;#39;s one of the hardest things to go through. How did any of their mothers cope? I&amp;#39;m scared shitless for my daughter, she&amp;#39;s not a baby anymore, but she&amp;#39;s my baby and always will be. I have become a hateful person, praying this guy dies, that&amp;#39;s not ok. I have thoughts of doing bad bad things to him and knowing people snap, that scares me. Any advice is greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it has to be her choice, she has to be the one to go, she&amp;#39;s horribly embarrassed, but still will end up going back. It&amp;#39;s like he&amp;#39;s has something over her. There&amp;#39;s nothing we can&amp;#39;t handle for her. I fear the state will step in and take my grandson. In our state, they rarely give the kids to family. It&amp;#39;s one of the worst states to actually get kids back. She loves her son, she&amp;#39;s a good mom, just not right now, she&amp;#39;s placing him in an environment that will hurt him. I can&amp;#39;t do a damn thing about it. All I can do, is count the hours down, sit by the phone, waiting for it to ring or wait for a message from her. Then I know we made it through that last amount of hours since I heard from her.  Please help me make it through today, because that little boy depends on me, he should be able to find the Easter eggs as any other child his age. She needs me, and he&amp;#39;ll be on to anything that&amp;#39;s off in my attitude. He&amp;#39;ll sense that we are against him and that puts her at risk. I&amp;#39;m finding it easier to get rid of him in very wrong ways, and I know I&amp;#39;d gladly do prison time for my daughters safety, and to end this chaos and pain for my family. That can&amp;#39;t be the ending especially today &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm in a panic.
