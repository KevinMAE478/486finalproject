On the surface, it is a simple issue.  My girlfriend of ~1 year is currently in Las Vegas with a man from her home country that I don&amp;#39;t know.  She&amp;#39;s told me he is her roommate and that they&amp;#39;ve been friends since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s where it gets tricky.\nShe is from a Spanish country, and all of her communications with friends and family are in Spanish, which I barely understand.  She often sends and receives voice messages with her roommate and other friends whenever I leave the room.  I&amp;#39;ve got a good ear and I can&amp;#39;t help but notice.  This has gone on since the beginning of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, she is returning to her country soon.  I met her early in her 1 year stay in the U.S. and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing each other ever since.  After a few months went by, I asked her about posting something about us on social media and she got upset at the idea and asked me to take her home in the middle of an otherwise enjoyable time.  We got in an argument about how I am not her boyfriend and that this was just a convenience while she was here.  Later that week she jokingly and nonchalantly mentioned how cute our babies would look and getting married.  I say this to express how flippant her ideology has been through the relationship.  She seems to respond heavily to her environment and to not have a solid outline of our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A month or so later she clarified that we are in a relationship, and has given me the &amp;quot;If someone else touches my man I&amp;#39;ll tear her face off&amp;quot; line more than a few times.  I&amp;#39;m a one woman guy and quite frankly couldn&amp;#39;t handle juggling women, but she frequently questions who met me where, brings up past interactions with females, and questioned me to death over a small meeting with a female friend from high school a few months back.  I&amp;#39;ve always heard this was a sign of untrustwortiness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, about 8 months into the relationship she began planning a trip to explore the West coast of the U.S.  Up until recently, I didn&amp;#39;t realize and she hadn&amp;#39;t mentioned that she was bringing her male &amp;quot;roommate&amp;quot; from her country for the 3 week trip.  Upon finding this out I also realized they were staying in the same hotel room and sleeping in one tent on the journey.  I am already having slight trust issues with her, and on top of that I tend not to trust other men.  She has not reassured me in any sense that nothing will happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dropped her off at the airport yesterday and they&amp;#39;ve already spent one night there.  I&amp;#39;m going out of my mind trying to give her the benefit of the doubt.  I picked up a cigarette and smoked for the first time in 2 years.  Being a dedicated one-woman man, which she knows, I am thoroughly opposed to the idea that she would be fooling around with someone else.  I am afraid to ruin a good thing and bring it up, potentially ruining her clean fun and our relationship, but I&amp;#39;m too afraid of being  oblivious to the obvious to maintain positivity.
