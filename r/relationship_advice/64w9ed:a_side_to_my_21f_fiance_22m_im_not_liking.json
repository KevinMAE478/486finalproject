He is in the military, and recently got back from an overseas deployment about 6 months ago. When he got home I was fully prepared to give him space, be patient, and understanding if he so needed. But he adjusted really well, and we got along great. He proposed in December 2016, and we already have a wedding date set.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lately, though, he&amp;#39;s been demonstrating some qualities that I&amp;#39;m having a hard time looking past. He is under a lot of stress with finishing his education after a huge gap due to deployment. I&amp;#39;ve politely double checked to make sure he&amp;#39;s 100% certain about the wedding date, getting married at this time, etc. and he assures me yes. The issue here is that he gets angry-- but never at me. For the six years i&amp;#39;ve been with him he is extremely patient. But He gets so stressed out and angry at his parents that I&amp;#39;ve witnessed several times he will throw, punch, and slam things. The worst was a few weeks ago when he went to get food from the delivery guy, his mom distracted him, and the delivery guy ran off with a large tip by accident. My fiance came upstairs to where I was and got so angry he threw the food and kicked and threw one of our metal chairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was abused growing up, so I am uncomfortable around angry, drunk, or violent men. When he lashes out, I get easily shook up and extremely nervous. I was so angry at him for lashing out and breaking the chair I ended up leaving. I was very vocal about my concerns, saying that he didn&amp;#39;t need to act that way around me and I was removing myself from the situation. His reaction only made it worse, because once he realized getting mad at his mom actually upset me he shut me out and didn&amp;#39;t speak. When I left, he texted me and blamed me for not being there for him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve expressed my concerns about these lashing outs, and he&amp;#39;s assured me time and time again that &amp;quot;I could never make him that angry&amp;quot; and it&amp;#39;s only his parents. I then explained that men who throw chairs and punch walls are time bombs, and it is only a matter of time before he ends up punching me by accident. He was horrified that I thought that, and somewhat offended. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our relationship is golden except for this behavior I can&amp;#39;t get over. I find myself walking on eggshells around him ever since. I&amp;#39;m nervous when we go somewhere new- what if he can&amp;#39;t park our huge truck? What if something doesn&amp;#39;t go to plan? Will this upset him? These are huge red flags for me, and each and every time I cringe waiting for him to blow up he actually DOESN&amp;#39;T. He acts like he always is with me, which is patient and very kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s just me witnessing his occasion blow ups and attributing it with aspects of my childhood, and thus getting some sort of trigger from the way he&amp;#39;s acting and what I &amp;quot;expect&amp;quot; to happen next. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also not sure if this is some sort of frustration from being away for as long as he was, which was a long time.

I asked him to consider counseling, and he wasn&amp;#39;t open to it, but was open to trying to channel his frustration in another way. He again was hurt when I explained it could be a red flag that he may turn his aggression on me in the future, but he responded again with &amp;quot;you could never make me that angry, it&amp;#39;s only my parents who make me act like that.&amp;quot; \nHe wasn&amp;#39;t aware I was still lingering on the moment where he threw the chair, but told me he understands. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "My fiance and I have been together for 6 years, we started dating when we were 14 &amp; 15 which means we are in our early twenties.
