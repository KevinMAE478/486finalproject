You only ever use a bike 4 months a year here) because he couldn&amp;#39;t afford one. Another has asked her for funds to do their backyard. Countless number of them have asked her to pay their bills because they didn&amp;#39;t have to funds to, and in almost all cases, it&amp;#39;s because they overspent on unnecessary goods (a second car, an expensive gift, a tablet, etc) wayy out of their means. Just a couple of months back another had asked to give him $7000 for a California trip which he wishes to go to with his daughter and his second wife (who she never met).

The dad of that family lost his job and wants to take the opportunity to start a business without putting his own family in a hole and sees my girlfriend as his golden goose. Believe it or not, she&amp;#39;s going through with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m all my girlfriend got. She is going to lose her only asset because of her gullible nature.

I&amp;#39;m not putting a value on the care and sense of belonging she got being a part of those families.
