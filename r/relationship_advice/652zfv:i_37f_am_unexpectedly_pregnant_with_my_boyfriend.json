It&amp;#39;s not horrible to fed formula but breast milk is SCIENTIFICALLY much better for your child.

Oh, wait...\n\n&gt;BUT he has also told me clearly he does not want to get married before the baby is born- because he feels like \"there is too much going on right now\" \n\nThat's like saying you don't want to renew your drivers' licence because there's too much going on right now. No, you just go down to the state government office, fill out some fucking forms, throw a few bucks at them and you're done.

Yeah, well he should have thought about that before he was risking pregnancy by ejaculating inside you. I have to laugh at his reasoning. It's \"convenient\" to take contraceptive shortcuts that are \"good enough\", but having a shortcut wedding isn't? What's he going to say, he learned from his mistakes in regards to shortcuts? *Now* he wants to be thorough?\n\n&gt;I feel scared to move down there to a city where I will be financially dependent on him without the promise of marriage from him- for me and for my baby. I don't want to give up my own home which is my sanctuary with all my plants, etc. I feel unsafe doing that, like he could ditch me and then I would be totally stranded as a single mom who relocated to a small town to be with her 'baby daddy'.\n\nIt's like driving a car without insurance. Why would you expose yourself to risk? Thus...don't drive...or get yourself insured. One or the other. Either get \"marriage insurance\" or don't go. \n\n&gt;I come from a really conservative family and I also feel embarrassed announcing around that I am pregnant as an unmarried woman. In fact, I am dreading going to my hometown for this reason. As a result I don't want to do a baby shower, etc.\n\nJust slow it down. Use your own timetable. People are going to talk regardless. You can't control the narrative. \n\n&gt;I guess I feel hurt that he does not want to officially commit to me- despite the fact he wants me to move in and act like his wife. Is this crazy? \n\nEuh...I just think the bigger concern is practical more than emotional. I wouldn't say \"crazy\" - I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings, I'm just saying that if it were me in your shoes, I would be way more focused on the practical aspects and not really be devoting \"brain time\" to taking it personally. Then again, I have kids and know what to expect. You really don't have time to be personally insulted or disappointed when you need him to resolve serious practical matters. Look at what you've said: you want a practical wedding, but it's not really an emotional thing. To me it seems you both have some things to reconcile which lead you to an impasse. For him it's that he wants a marriage, but won't take the steps to have one. For you, you claim to want practicality, but are worried about things like your hurt feelings or what your peer group thinks. You both have to reconcile your inconsistencies before you can bridge your gap. You both have to get on track with what's really important.\n\nLook - if it were me, I would plan on doing this alone. Leave the door open and your criteria clear. That way, if he fails to live up to his grandiose promises, you have not been an obstacle at all. This is really why I think you need to set all of the \"love\" and \"social circle\" stuff aside so that there is no snag for you. Meaning, you make this 100% about him. It's not marriage to appease some irrational thing where he can hem and haw and then not do it. It's a relationship contract. The \"love\" marriage can happen again, later. \n\nI know this may seem harsh, but it's true. My first kid was a part of my first wedding. My third kid was a part of my second wedding. I've had the kid, then done the marriage later. And the second one was more of a legal formality than anything. I'm not saying to do anything that I wouldn't do/have actually done. \n\nFinally, as a man, let me underscore something he may not get: women need security, especially financial security. The burden is way more on their shoulders. His choice is simple: he either works out an agreement with you and a lawyer or he works out an agreement without a lawyer because you're married.

Meaning, you make this 100% about him. It&amp;#39;s not marriage to appease some irrational thing where he can hem and haw and then not do it. It&amp;#39;s a relationship contract. The &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; marriage can happen again, later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this may seem harsh, but it&amp;#39;s true. My first kid was a part of my first wedding. My third kid was a part of my second wedding. I&amp;#39;ve had the kid, then done the marriage later. And the second one was more of a legal formality than anything. I&amp;#39;m not saying to do anything that I wouldn&amp;#39;t do/have actually done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, as a man, let me underscore something he may not get: women need security, especially financial security. The burden is way more on their shoulders. His choice is simple: he either works out an agreement with you and a lawyer or he works out an agreement without a lawyer because you&amp;#39;re married. Either way, you have to think about your practical interests first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "name": "t1_dg79xfm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492096638.0, "created_utc": 1492067838.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652zfv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652zfv", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_652zfv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7om0y", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DanaBana420", "parent_id": "t1_dg7lu8m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Because people get married without living with that person for at least a year or under false pretenses.
