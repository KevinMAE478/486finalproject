We talked all day, every day. He complimented me, not only physically, but also on my personality and intelligence, which I don&amp;#39;t often get from guys. He&amp;#39;s smart, career military, kind, funny, and so easy to talk to. He often said how much he liked me, how I was the whole package, etc. and stated that he didn&amp;#39;t want to date anyone else, but I could take my time with that choice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our first date was postponed by two weeks because of a work trip. We texted or called daily. He answered every personal question I asked (including confirming he was single), and we talked about everything, including the future. At first, it wasn&amp;#39;t anything intense, more so gauging long-term compatibility, but soon future talk would be sprinkled into our conversations. It excited me. The more I got to know him, the harder I fell. I would use the bits of personal information I gleaned to google him, but being an old, there wasn&amp;#39;t much to be found. Not all of them got on the social media train. That&amp;#39;s fine. The few things I did find matched what he&amp;#39;d told me, assuaging any lingering fears I had. I used the bits of new info to occasionally try to find more about him until I felt confident I&amp;#39;d thoroughly exhausted my google stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he returned, we spent the entire next day together. We met in a public place first for breakfast then went to a nearby hotel room he&amp;#39;d booked. (Hello, red flag.) I wasn&amp;#39;t wild about the idea, but having been gone for over two weeks and arriving late the previous night, he said his place was messy and he wanted it to look nice the first time I come over. We spent the rest of the day kissing, fucking, cuddling while watching bad TV, going for a walk along the beautiful river (very public and safe area), getting dinner, and starting all over again. He seemed genuinely happy. It was an amazing day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then things started going downhill. The day after, we texted but not as much because he was back at his office and I was in pain from my ulcer acting up. He checked in on the pain that day and the next, but soon the texts became sporadic or left unanswered. I finally asked what was up, and he basically said some bs about falling for me but being scared that I, a &amp;quot;beautiful, smart young woman&amp;quot;, wouldn&amp;#39;t want a man so much older forever. (This is probably a huge, eye-rolling red flag for some of you, but I&amp;#39;m needy and like my guys codependent. I have issues.) I told him I was crazy about him too, but no one can promise someone they&amp;#39;ll be together forever, which he acknowledged. I asked to talk to him about it more, but he&amp;#39;s stopped answering my texts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were supposed to spend this weekend together, so feeling hurt, I went back to google and started searching him with different variations of the info I had. That&amp;#39;s when I came upon the site for his upcoming wedding. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe he was engaged. I&amp;#39;ve been obsessively googling her, but she has a generic name and the wedding site has very few details. Nothing about how they met or their jobs. I&amp;#39;ve spent hours because denial is a helluva drug. I&amp;#39;m extremely mad at this asshat and mad at myself for being so stupid and naive. I want him to come clean and fucking apologize. I want him to hurt like he hurt me. I want her to find someone better. I was so excited about him because I&amp;#39;ve never had an LTR, never had a man say I love you. This is the third time in under a year that a guy&amp;#39;s led me on, pretending he wanted a relationship, then dumping me after a month or two. So now my self-esteem, low as it already was, is shattered. I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t seek validation from men, but I currently hate a lot of things in my life (that I&amp;#39;m trying to work on for me), so it was nice to feel cared about on the days I couldn&amp;#39;t do that for myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for such a long story over a stupid fling at best. As far as advice, should I let his fiancee know? I finally found her on facebook through one of the bridal party&amp;#39;s public page. I have damning screenshots at the ready in case she wants proof. However, my friend thinks I should just walk away from it all as he knows where I live from when he dropped me off and he could snap and come after me. Or she could direct her anger towards me and make him drive her.

There's not really anything he can say that would change things or make me feel better except sorry.

The bride's profile is very barebones and private, but the MIL's first post is a picture that includes the cheater and she calls him her future SIL in the comments. It's undeniably him, as much as I had initially wished it weren't. \n\nThanks for the tough love. I'm mad at myself for ignoring the flags, for being so stupid and gullible.
