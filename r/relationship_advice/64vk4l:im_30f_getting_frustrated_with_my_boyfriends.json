I agree with them. But those same women would rather date their own age.\n\nIn fact most women that age think men in their 30s are ancient.   Never mind late 30s or 40s.  I know my  friends and Icertainly did.  Of course there are outliers that prefer older men.  But lets assume a  percentage of them are taken.   \n\nSo that leaves  every available man between 28 and 70 fighting over the remainder of attractive, available early 20 year olds that like older men .The odds arent great, regardless of how successful one is.  The math just doesn't work.\n\nSo someone that is one year past her 20s doesn't start to look so bad once you've struck out with every younger girl available .  Im not saying it doesn't happen because it definitely does,  but its by far the norm for most moderately decent men in their mid 30s to have their pick of compatible,  attractive 20 year olds that are looking for a serious partner.\n\nAlso, it looks like OP is an average, childless woman with a steady job that's looking for a long term, caring relationship.   Not a sugar daddy or a rock star. Just an average, decent man with a job and a heart.  Not super rare.\n\nEither way,  its probably in her best interest to avoid men who's only criteria is that a woman is young.  Because people get old.  Why risk having to start over yet again because her looks faded and she's no longer valuable to her partner. Especially if she is interested in kids.  They really do a number on a womans looks. \n\nThen there are men who are into older women.   There are plenty of them , I can speak from experience. That's always an option if OP is into younger men.\n\nI don't think she has much to worry about besides avoiding douchebags the second time around. Dating around before settling down and screening should be able to take care of that easily. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why wouldn&amp;#39;t they be?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A reason why not would be that there aren&amp;#39;t enough 18-25 year old women interested!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That okcupid study shows that pretty much all men find 18-22 year old the most attractive.  I agree with them. But those same women would rather date their own age.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact most women that age think men in their 30s are ancient.   Never mind late 30s or 40s.  I know my  friends and Icertainly did.  Of course there are outliers that prefer older men.  But lets assume a  percentage of them are taken.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that leaves  every available man between 28 and 70 fighting over the remainder of attractive, available early 20 year olds that like older men .The odds arent great, regardless of how successful one is.  The math just doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So someone that is one year past her 20s doesn&amp;#39;t start to look so bad once you&amp;#39;ve struck out with every younger girl available .  Im not saying it doesn&amp;#39;t happen because it definitely does,  but its by far the norm for most moderately decent men in their mid 30s to have their pick of compatible,  attractive 20 year olds that are looking for a serious partner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, it looks like OP is an average, childless woman with a steady job that&amp;#39;s looking for a long term, caring relationship.   Not a sugar daddy or a rock star. Just an average, decent man with a job and a heart.  Not super rare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way,  its probably in her best interest to avoid men who&amp;#39;s only criteria is that a woman is young.  Because people get old.  Why risk having to start over yet again because her looks faded and she&amp;#39;s no longer valuable to her partner. Especially if she is interested in kids.  They really do a number on a womans looks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there are men who are into older women.   There are plenty of them , I can speak from experience. That&amp;#39;s always an option if OP is into younger men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think she has much to worry about besides avoiding douchebags the second time around. Dating around before settling down and screening should be able to take care of that easily. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "name": "t1_dg75lzn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492087266.0, "created_utc": 1492058466.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6xhpw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KoennonTiger", "parent_id": "t1_dg6lncm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why wouldn't they be?\n\nI'm glad you were entertained :)\n\nIt's not really very nice to lie to women though just to try to make them feel better about themselves.
