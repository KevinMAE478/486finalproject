Even though they don&amp;#39;t speak English &amp;amp; he doesn&amp;#39;t speak Spanish, they want him over again just to see him and they always ask how he is doing!. Now, to the problem: his parents don&amp;#39;t know about me and when they do, he and I are afraid of their reactions (which I know won&amp;#39;t be a positive one). He is planning on telling his parents this November and this secret relationship that both of us have been in has drained me a lot emotionally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of our arguments stem from the fact that I feel left out of his life since:\n1) he refers to me as a friend to his friends (only 2 of his friends really know about me) \n2) because of the secrecy, I can&amp;#39;t post nice pics of us on vacation &amp;amp; having fun in general (I don&amp;#39;t put my whole life of social media, but 1 or 2 pics once in a while is fine in my opinion). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have told him about how this secret relationship is starting to drain me out and is making me feel like I am not good enough for him (let&amp;#39;s be honest, in his parents&amp;#39; view, I won&amp;#39;t be good enough). He reassures me that that&amp;#39;s not the case and that he is also suffering inside because he wishes his parents were more open. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not want to lose him and I want to be there by his side supporting him when he does tell his parents.
