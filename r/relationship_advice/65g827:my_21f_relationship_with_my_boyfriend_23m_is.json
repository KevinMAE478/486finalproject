I have a high sex drive and like being &amp;#39;chased&amp;#39;, my bf has a low sex drive and had long stopped trying to &amp;#39;chase&amp;#39; me, because he has me. I do some things I&amp;#39;m not proud of and end up exchanging some inappropriate conversations with a male friend of mine who lives abroad.

My boyfriend tells me he&amp;#39;s been exchanging inappropriate conversations with a girl he met on a video game, who again lives abroad. I&amp;#39;m hurt, but can&amp;#39;t be a hypocrite so forgive it and we move on, but despite him promising to cut off contact with her, they&amp;#39;re still friends on facebook etc and I think they still occasionally chat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skip to 2 weeks ago, BF tells me his aunt tried to hook him up with a girl she knows (like, what the hell?) and that he rejected it. But last week he told me that this girl invited him for a friendly night out. I was away that week, so I only have his word for it that he didn&amp;#39;t go, but then 2 nights ago, I go downstairs at 1am for a drink, and find him on the phone in the living room with the doors all shut.

I have an exam the next morning and decide to prioritise sleep over questioning him about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decide at this point (after almost a year of questioning it) that the relationship is over. I don&amp;#39;t trust him, he never quite trusted me again after my thing, we have sex approximately only once a month and we have nothing in common anymore (we&amp;#39;ve grown up and drifted apart), so when we&amp;#39;re alone it&amp;#39;s mostly awkward silence. Nothing really worth rescuing.
