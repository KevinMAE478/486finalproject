I used to smoke and I kind of cringe at the thought that I smelled like that. \n\nMy mom was a heavy smoker from the time she was a little kid and she had to quit two years ago because of her health. Her sister is about twenty years older than her and still puffing along. She smokes whatever is the cheapest she can find, so does her husband and they both smoke in the house. One time after she left my mom turns to us and starts to complain about how AWFUL she smelled and did she ever smell as bad as her sister. \n\nMom was not in the least bit amused when everyone said she smelled just as bad as her sister and that yes it was constantly, not just after she had a smoke. Boy was she mad.\n\nTL;DR Smokers stink. Some think they don't, but they all do.
