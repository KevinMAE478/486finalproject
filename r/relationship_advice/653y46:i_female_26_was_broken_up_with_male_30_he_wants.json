I have been in your exBFs shoes...\n\nI was in a (very happy) relationship for 4 years. But I knew something was off. I wanted to go off and be free by myself for a while. We broke up. I went off to \"find myself.\" Am MUCH.HAPPIER now. Much happier. I realized, only afterwards, how much I absolutely needed this: to exist on my own and to be single and free. I am truthfully the happiest I've ever been. \n\nIf he needs to \"figure himself out\", let him go. That's the only thing you can do. Go and figure your OWN self out!  Who are you withOUT your bf? You werent born attached at the hip- you were someone before you found him and that person that you used to be is AWESOME! Go find her again. Learn to be happy by yourself, to laugh by yourself, to dance by yourself.
