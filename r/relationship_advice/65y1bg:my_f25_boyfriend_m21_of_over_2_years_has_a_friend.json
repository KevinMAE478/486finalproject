He apologized and told me he had talked to her a few months back and had been very clear that they would never be anything more than friends. And that he is careful now to make sure they have an appropriate friendship that doesn&amp;#39;t cross any lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was a year ago and I am still jealous every time they hang out.
