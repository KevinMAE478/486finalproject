We were both 47 and the relationship started off amazing and didn&amp;#39;t even get to 3 months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally dumped him 2 weeks ago, 2 weeks after my last post. I watched very carefully. He continued to put me down at every opportunity and if I called him on it he would say he was just joking and I was being over sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The weekend I ended it, I had made him and his boys a wonderful meal and cleaned his entire sticky kitchen. His only response; I could have cooked the stuffed peppers on higher heat. I helped his son rake the front yard for 2 hours. All I heard repeatedly was that we didn&amp;#39;t put the rakes back in the right spot. Then the next day we binged a couple of shows, and he wanted me to sit close, later on he complained I have to touch him too much. That was it. I brought up his regular lack of thanks, the hot/cold and constant dual messages. (I don&amp;#39;t share enough, I talk too much, etc). I said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve never dated someone who saw so many negatives in me&amp;quot;, then I calmly got my stuff and left. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize now after observing the situation for a couple of weeks; he&amp;#39;s an alcoholic and a narcissist. Neither of which I have experience with. When he was drinking his words were exaggerated both + and - . Yes, idealized and devalued. And as time went on it was more the latter. I got hooked on all the positive words (love bombing) and would take the negatives to heart and feel bad about myself (he then called me insecure). I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out why I didn&amp;#39;t measure up to this perfect sought-after guy. He&amp;#39;d frequently tell me how good looking he was and how great his life was. He had very few friends, like 2 and they were from high school, and he talked bad about them too. People didn&amp;#39;t like being around him. His neighbors thought he was arrogant and judgmental. (They wanted only me to come over for their bonfires, ha). He complained about people in general, it&amp;#39;s like he took pleasure in seeing the bad/stupid in people.  Another thing I have no experience with and I&amp;#39;m not judging, he would masterbate to pornography 4-5 times a week. Is that what men just do? I&amp;#39;ve not had a guy tell me all about it before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He would drink 5-8-10 beers then switch to straight whiskey. How can a person think clearly with that much alcohol in their system? And when he chose not to drink for a day or two, he&amp;#39;d be crabby, quiet, awkward and occassionally shitty. When he would really tie one on, the next day he was a thundercloud. But of course this was all normal, he was not an alcoholic, he didn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;have&amp;#39; to drink. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even when I enjoyed spending time with him (we usually did fun things) I would be nervous and wonder when I would do something wrong. I spent a lot of mental energy trying to be perfect. He didn&amp;#39;t go out of his way much for me (wouldn&amp;#39;t even get my overnight bag out of my car) and complained about me a lot. I genuinely feel bad for saying negative things about him and I feel sorry for him now. I was raised to and spent my life looking at the positives in people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why am I here now? You all said before this wasn&amp;#39;t a good relationship or a good person. Now that I ended it; I&amp;#39;m in that sad, confused, second-guessing place that&amp;#39;s a little lonely. Does anyone have experience kicking someone to the curb because they were a narcissist and/or alcoholic? And do you still believe you did the right thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks much everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Thanks to all of you for reading and responding to my two previous posts about the guy who yelled at me over stupid stuff, talked in circles, put me on eggshells and drank too much.
