Not worth the effort. Been there, done that - in my case it was a FOB Chinese girl with big time career aspirations, desire to be a man at times, had desire of trying with a woman at times, desire to be with a Chinese guy (I'm white), etc etc etc. The majority of these ideas were related to her age (23...immature), her upbringing (FOB Chinese female...they are super protected and coddled and raised in a culture that has an abundance of single men vying for the hand of limited single women), and the fact that she was a virgin (lots of Chinese women are virgins). So she really had no idea what she wanted in life.\n\nWithin about 1 month of starting to date her she was ready to call it quits for absolutely no reason, none. Everything was fine, but she was acting like a child. The biggest driver of her desire to end it, which she didn't admit to until I got it out of her (like pulling teeth), was that she was going to Chicago for a short school-related (Masters degree) trip with classmates wherein she was going to meet another guy friend with whom she dreamed of starting a relationship. Had she ever met this guy? No. Was she moving to Chicago? No. Was this guy interested in her? Not to her knowledge. Had she ever talked to the guy? Nope! She just knew him through a female friend and because he was Chinese and from the same town as she was from. It was just going to be Disney-perfect. I convinced her to stay with me - I told her that her dreams were complete nonsense. She was giving up something real (me) for something made up (a relationship with a guy she knew nothing about, wherein she expected to create one within a time frame of 5 days or so). The words I used to get her head back on straight was (beyond telling her that her dreams were a fantasy and that she is giving up something real for a fantasy and that everything between us is working fine) \"just give us a chance. I'm not asking for much. All I'm asking is that you give it a chance, that's it.\" She said OK. She went to Chicago and barely even had a chance to interact with the guy, let alone start a relationship with him, due to the time spent touring and all the work she had to do.\n\nIt was at that point when she came back home that she knew I was right, but it is not like things were perfect. She was damaged goods because she always had this internal battle with herself(once a cheater always a cheater...once a dreamer always a dreamer). It didn't matter how perfect or patient I was. The idea of a relationship with me was getting in the way of her dreams - whether it was her dreams of a PhD (which is what she is doing now, last I checked), dreams of being single, dreams of a Chinese guy, or dreams of being bought the most lavish shit in the world (Chinese women are known for being super high maintenance...because they can be due to the great selection of men from the gender imbalance). Funny thing is, when I couldn't take the craziness anymore (craziness from all the fights of me trying to get her to see things straight vs her ridiculous dreams) and I broke up with her she was an absolute MESSSSSSSS! I mean serious nutty mess. She left me crying voice mails in Chinese, she left a gift at my door, she continued to e-mail me in the months following.\n\n\n\n\nLike wolfoflone said. Let her go. You are going to be trying to convince someone to do something they can't dream of doing. Listen to the Joker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phyYX-8zHEk. Replace \"kill you\" with \"let you go\". Hey, I guarantee that saying something like \"Just give us a chance, have some faith\" (especially for a religious person) will get her to stay, but it's not worth it. Trust us.
