Listen to me.\n\nYou are now in the emotional danger zone.  The dangers are that you will do destructive or emotionally distracting things to deal with the pain.\n\nDestructive things are self-explanatory, but I'll say it anyways.  Pity and grief are wonderful enablers.  They'll encourage you to go get drunk and break things.  They'll encourage you to go get an STD or an arrest with a hooker.  They'll encourage you to blow all of your money on distractions.  Don't listen to them.\n\nBy emotional distractions I mean finding a replacement girlfriend before you're over this one.  Every.  Single.  Terrible relationship of my life can be traced back to this stupidity.  When I call myself a Pro I mean I'm really good at knowing what not to do in these situations because I've done it and cost myself years of happiness and more money than I want to think about.\n\nIt's ok that you are hurting.  It's natural.  I got dumped by a girl one time and I remember thinking that the pain of my heart splitting in my chest was too much and I was going to die, I would never recover.  I seriously can't remember her last name anymore.\n\nThe only thing that is guaranteed to heal this is time.  That shit old people say (I'm one) about time healing all wounds is right as fuck.  The key is passing that time in a way that does as little harm to you and your bank account and your future.  You need to find as many positive or benign ways to pass the time as possible.\n\nBinge watch a shitty TV show on Netflix.  Then another.  Then two more.  Arrange activities with friends as many nights as possible.  Things like the movies or a game of basketball or hiking.  Plan a road trip to see the world's largest plate.\n\nDon't have friends?  No problem.  Join a book club.  Find acting classes.  Join an MMA club.  Take some art classes.  Learn to dance.  Distract yourself by doing things that are going to help you.\n\nThe key is to stop yourself from doing what I've done - let your grief fuel your self-destructive nature into doing things that will hurt you in the long run over a person who will never again matter in your life.\n\nBest of luck, buddy.  I'm pulling for you.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone else has already covered it, so I&amp;#39;ll just say it - sorry about the break-up man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where I&amp;#39;m a pro, though.  Listen to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are now in the emotional danger zone.  The dangers are that you will do destructive or emotionally distracting things to deal with the pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Destructive things are self-explanatory, but I&amp;#39;ll say it anyways.  Pity and grief are wonderful enablers.  They&amp;#39;ll encourage you to go get drunk and break things.  They&amp;#39;ll encourage you to go get an STD or an arrest with a hooker.  They&amp;#39;ll encourage you to blow all of your money on distractions.  Don&amp;#39;t listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By emotional distractions I mean finding a replacement girlfriend before you&amp;#39;re over this one.  Every.  Single.  Terrible relationship of my life can be traced back to this stupidity.  When I call myself a Pro I mean I&amp;#39;m really good at knowing what not to do in these situations because I&amp;#39;ve done it and cost myself years of happiness and more money than I want to think about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s ok that you are hurting.  It&amp;#39;s natural.  I got dumped by a girl one time and I remember thinking that the pain of my heart splitting in my chest was too much and I was going to die, I would never recover.  I seriously can&amp;#39;t remember her last name anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that is guaranteed to heal this is time.  That shit old people say (I&amp;#39;m one) about time healing all wounds is right as fuck.  The key is passing that time in a way that does as little harm to you and your bank account and your future.  You need to find as many positive or benign ways to pass the time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Binge watch a shitty TV show on Netflix.  Then another.  Then two more.  Arrange activities with friends as many nights as possible.  Things like the movies or a game of basketball or hiking.  Plan a road trip to see the world&amp;#39;s largest plate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t have friends?  No problem.  Join a book club.  Find acting classes.  Join an MMA club.  Take some art classes.  Learn to dance.  Distract yourself by doing things that are going to help you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key is to stop yourself from doing what I&amp;#39;ve done - let your grief fuel your self-destructive nature into doing things that will hurt you in the long run over a person who will never again matter in your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best of luck, buddy.

Txt her and tell her you want to give it another try but she has to be 100% into it and committed to it as well. She will likely have to find a new place to live and work on top of all of that because it's really not cool for her to live with and work with someone who she was so recently romantically involved with.\n \nShe's very very likely unwilling to do that. But if you want to ask, do it.  \n \nYou also mentioned something else... the dynamic of you two. It's going to be changed. Absolutely. Change, however, isn't always a bad thing... and the bad changes they come, you have to deal with like an adult and you both have to want to make things better. Key word here is both - you have to as well as her.\n \nOn top of that, what broke you up and could it happen again? Can you two learn how to argue?\n \nYour odds aren't good. However, it can't hurt to ask, to try... just be prepared for failure.\n \nI do feel as if I need to prepare you for something. If she says no and stays with this guy, it's going to end. She lives with and works with him and he's clearly a rebound. When it all falls apart she's going to run to you... but you will have to deal with knowing that you are her plan-b.\n \nSo if she says no. Break off all contact and move on with your life. Break up for real. No txts, tweets, snaps or smoke signals. End it with her and put your energy into you and maybe a new relationship because you want to be in a great place when her life falls apart... so she can see what she gave up and how you aren't anyone's Plan B!\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move on, do better...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t say what the argument is/was to break you two up, and while it may not make much of a difference, it still may lead to some insight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All you can do here is be honest. Txt her and tell her you want to give it another try but she has to be 100% into it and committed to it as well. She will likely have to find a new place to live and work on top of all of that because it&amp;#39;s really not cool for her to live with and work with someone who she was so recently romantically involved with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s very very likely unwilling to do that. But if you want to ask, do it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also mentioned something else... the dynamic of you two. It&amp;#39;s going to be changed. Absolutely. Change, however, isn&amp;#39;t always a bad thing... and the bad changes they come, you have to deal with like an adult and you both have to want to make things better. Key word here is both - you have to as well as her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, what broke you up and could it happen again? Can you two learn how to argue?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your odds aren&amp;#39;t good. However, it can&amp;#39;t hurt to ask, to try... just be prepared for failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do feel as if I need to prepare you for something. If she says no and stays with this guy, it&amp;#39;s going to end. She lives with and works with him and he&amp;#39;s clearly a rebound. When it all falls apart she&amp;#39;s going to run to you... but you will have to deal with knowing that you are her plan-b.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if she says no. Break off all contact and move on with your life. Break up for real. No txts, tweets, snaps or smoke signals. End it with her and put your energy into you and maybe a new relationship because you want to be in a great place when her life falls apart... so she can see what she gave up and how you aren&amp;#39;t anyone&amp;#39;s Plan B!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "name": "t1_dg61cl9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492040373.0, "created_utc": 1492011573.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yuby", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg61vdz", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CyberRaver", "parent_id": "t3_64yuby", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Shes a hoe, sorry to say it but shes not into you\n\nShes banging that guy and keeping you for backup", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shes a hoe, sorry to say it but shes not into you&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shes banging that guy and keeping you for backup&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "name": "t1_dg61vdz", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492040948.0, "created_utc": 1492012148.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yuby", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6784p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MickTheBloodyPirate", "parent_id": "t3_64yuby", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Time to move on, this is over and she's just going to take you over the coals.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to move on, this is over and she&amp;#39;s just going to take you over the coals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "name": "t1_dg6784p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492046543.0, "created_utc": 1492017743.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64yuby", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6g5ob", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kiramaniac", "parent_id": "t3_64yuby", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "*ex girlfriend.
