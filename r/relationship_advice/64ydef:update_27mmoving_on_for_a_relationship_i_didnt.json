I said that if we do that we will need to go to therapy in order to work. She said she wanted to go, gave me her availability and I made the appointment. Two days later, she tells me she can\u2019t make it because she works that night and to reschedule it for the next day. Not even an hour later she says that the next day won\u2019t work either because she has plans to go to a show with her friends. (Which included going with the other guy and she didn\u2019t tell me about). So again, she chose that relationship over ours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple days after I found out she went to the show with him, we were out drinking with her friends (who didn\u2019t know at the time about the other guy) and for some reason this other guy kept on being mentioned. After a lot of consumption of alcohol, we all went back to our place. I blacked out \u2013 turns out I told everyone about her cheating on me and, among other things, I called her a slut \u2013 she left with her friends, I fell into a really dark place but thankfully my friend came over and pulled me out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started going to therapy (with the therapist I originally scheduled for the two of us). She has on two occasions told me that she wants to go to therapy together but has yet to do anything to make it happen. We have been to her parents house and acted like nothing is wrong a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We started having deep conversations about our relationship and what we want. It came out that her immediate ex had contacted her recently and that she thinks she is still in love with him. Well I subscribe to the idea that you can love many people but you can only be in love with one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took her out on a date \u2013 we got dressed up and went to a movie. From the second we got in the cab to the second I went to bed she was texting some other guy. Later forensic investigation revealed that she was sexting with this guy she had talked to before me. She told him that she has only had sex with me and him in the past [length of our relationship + 4 months].

Her shift ended probably at 1 or 2, maybe even earlier. I text her about 3 if the plan is still going on to which she didn\u2019t answer and then her phone \u201cdies\u201d at some point before 5. I don\u2019t hear from her until 4 in the morning when she comes home trashed. I was so worried and anxious like I had no idea if she was okay or anything. I waited until I calmed down to talk to her, she was in her bed and I walked over and was like I was really scared \u2013 I had no clue where you were or if something happened. She pulled my arms around her and we slept (not sex) together for the first time since the break-up. Not going to lie \u2013 it felt amazing.  The next morning I found out my sister (who had a very rough relationship) got engaged so I had a resurgence of hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won\u2019t bore you longer because that hope has been stomped out. She is untrustworthy and disrespectful. She has been staying out nearly every night \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen her since Friday. She comes home just after I\u2019m already asleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer the questions from my previous post:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I am growing and healing \u2013 it is no longer my responsibility to help her and that is not even something I can do unless she wants to help herself. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I remind myself constantly of the lies and pain I have gone through when my mind start trying to generate some hope. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When I meet new people, I do not mention her.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your advice and support.
