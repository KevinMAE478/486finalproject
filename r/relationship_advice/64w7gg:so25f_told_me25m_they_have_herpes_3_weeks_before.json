To start this off, I am mentally broken and cannot rationalize a plan for myself and do not know how to move forward.  My SO and I have been dating for a year and it has been absolutely amazing. We have clicked from the beginning and I love her very much. Her and I started having unprotected sex after about 1 month. She had recently had an IUD put in and so pregnancy was not an issue. We had a conversation about this and it seemed like an ample opportunity for her to bring up any concerns she had. Her and I think the same, enjoy a lot of the same activities, and have become best friends over the year. Our relationship progressed much faster than most because her father passed away 2 months into our relationship. On top of that she made a major career shift and other changes in her social life. I have been by her side and aided her through so much! (Including a severe heat stroke.) While going through this I have given her all my love and been completely honest with her about everything. (Sometimes too honest, but honest.) In her defense, it has not been completely one-sided. I have been dealing with depression and other mental obstacles involving my life and career decisions. She has been a support beam for me and my #1 fan. Always encouraging me to follow my passion and do what makes me happy. About 4 months ago, she was going to book a flight to Europe with a friend because tickets were at a great price, but the friend bailed on her. I opted to go with her even though it was not necessarily the wisest financial decision. I saw at is a great life and relationship opportunity. Fast forward to now. We just had our 1 year anniversary and will be flying to Europe at the end of the month. Two nights ago I told her my lower region has been itching since Saturday. This wasn&amp;#39;t the first time I had experienced this feeling, but in the past it was caused by not enough lubrication and there being rubbed down sores, so I wasn&amp;#39;t worried. (Even though this time was slightly different looking and lasting longer than ever before.) Because I knew I was clean and thought I knew she was as well.... Well last night, she sat me down. I thought she was going to make me meditate with her. Until she started to cry. This is when she told me she has genital herpes and has had it for about 6 years. 6 years!!!! At first I was alright. I don&amp;#39;t like to see her cry. We chatted about it a bit. She said she &amp;quot;forgot&amp;quot; she had it because she hadn&amp;#39;t had an outbreak in years. After a short talk we got ready for bed. As I was laying there it started to sink in. It is still sinking in. I feel sad. Angry. Betrayed. Helpless. She has spit out so many excuses and I just don&amp;#39;t want to hear it. I don&amp;#39;t understand how she could do this to me. I love this girl, but I don&amp;#39;t know how to move forward. I am going to get tested soon and see a counselor next week. I don&amp;#39;t know if I still want to go to Europe with her. I can get 90% of my money back because we got flight insurance, but I was really looking forward to this trip. I just cannot be around her right now. We were also planning on moving in together at the end of May... I feel like by not telling me, she took away any control I had. Telling me from the get go at least allows me to make the decision for myself, as an adult, on how I want to move forward. She waited until after she was pretty much sure I had it to tell me. She is not cruel or malicious in any form whatsoever. I never saw this coming. She is one of the most caring and kind hearted people I know. But man I feel like a I got fucked over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: SO, love of my life, told me after a year she had herpes. Pretty sure I have it now. Travelling together soon. I am a mental mess. Don&amp;#39;t know how to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: I really appreciate the feedback I am getting. I am fairly introverted and do not have many people to talk to about this. I am also a pretty optimostic and light-hearted, so I am trying to make the best of my current shitty situation. It is good to see people&amp;#39;s opinions from both ends of the spectrum. It helps me realize where my emotions and thoughts fall on it. I would never sue her. That would not make me feel better at all. I am not sure how long it will take me to make this decision. Which is scary with Europe approaching.
