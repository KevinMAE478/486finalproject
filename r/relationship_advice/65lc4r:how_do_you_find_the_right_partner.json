For many people, what makes their final partner a good fit is a long list of ways that their partner is not like their ex's. \n\nA good place to start is by briefly reading about [the five love languages.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages) There's a whole book about it, but the book is steeped in religion,  while the overall ideas that you can read about from google results is all you really need. The premise is that each person prefers to express and receive love in different ways. Some people like giving gifts, while others need physical touch to communicate love. Some need to spend time together, while others need to hear compliments and reassurance. There's also [a basic quiz](http://www.beliefnet.com/love-family/relationships/quiz/the-5-love-languages-quiz.aspx) you can take to start getting a better idea of what matters to you. The quiz is also a cutesy thing that you can do with a new partner while in the flirtatious beginnings of the relationship to help give you a little bit of insight into them. If you and your partner like to express and receive love in similar ways, it will help make sure you both feel loved throughout the relationship.\n\nAnother thing that parallels pretty well with the 5 love languages is just being aware of your libido. If you always want sex and your partner never does, it's going to cause friction in the relationship. This isn't always related to the quality of emotion in the relationship, though, as some people simply desire more or less sex than others. This also extends into the physical touch style of communicating love that is talked about in the five love languages. So, after you reach the more intimate parts of a relationship, it's good to make sure sex has a similar level of importance to both of you so one is not chronically unsatisfied.\n\nThe third thing to look for is good communication. Finding somebody that is willing to talk to you about any issue or problem is important. It may not happen all at once, but they need to be trying to communicate well in the relationship. This is also a two-way street, as you need to be able to talk things out when they are bothering you, as well.\n\nThe last thing about finding the right partner is working on yourself. You could find somebody that is perfect for you, but still fuck it up. Knowing whether or not you are ready, at this moment, for a relationship to start is vitally important. If you're still hung up on an ex, or are about to move and can't handle a long distance relationship, then you shouldn't try to dive into a new one.\n\nAll of the above are reasons I've had multi-year relationships fail.
