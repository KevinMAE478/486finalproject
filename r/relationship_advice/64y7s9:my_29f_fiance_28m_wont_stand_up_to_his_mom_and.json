As an example, if her mother thought we did something she didn't like, she would stop talking to us. My wife would then go over and apologise for whatever it was we did and her mother would be saying stuff like \"I won't be here forever...\" hinting towards her death at some point, which was really fucked up since my wife's sister died two years prior and my wife was still having a hard time dealing with that. So I was pretty fucking pissed about what she was doing. The last time my MIL tried doing this she was silent for 5 days. I told my wife to talk to her like its a normal day, saying hello in the morning and stuff like that. If she doesn't want to talk, that's on her. It took five days before my MIL figured out she can't do that anymore, and she never tried it again. Your fiance may already be conditioned into behaviour that you'll have to break him out of. It can take time, and will need a lot of support from you, but if you don't want your MIL to be in charge of your marriage its best to nip it in the bud.\n\nOne last piece of advice, you said you have a bit of a temper and you walked away before you lit off. You can't do that if she flips out at your house. Breathe, stay calm (both of you) and give out the replies you guys have pre-planned. She'll look the fool and people will see that. \n\nGood luck!

When you're looking to buy a house, you take your shoes off and on every time you enter a house with your realtor.

My neighbors are Pakistani and nary a shoe has gone across the threshold of their apartment after it has been walked in outdoors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If people are going to be that concerned about not having pretty feet, they can be tipped off to bring clean indoor slippers, perhaps. That&amp;#39;s what my stepmom and sister do because they hate their feet but also don&amp;#39;t want to wear their shoes inside. So they buy slippers that are very cute and sometimes funny. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get the mat and sign, and everyone is in your house respecting your rules, your MIL will be the one being the rude one. It&amp;#39;s common to not want the great outdoors being tracked around your clean house. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "name": "t1_dg6f834", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492054720.0, "created_utc": 1492025920.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y7s9", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y7s9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg71zru", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mrs_mojo_risin", "parent_id": "t1_dg6vag3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "controversiality": 0, "body": "nope, it is a very casual party. and i am technically not the hostess of the party but we are providing the space for it. like i said before, its not so much the carpet thats the issue. we also decided to get it cleaned due to the massive amounts of dust that blew in the air when FH sanded and floated out our walls prior to repainting them as well as the massive amounts of sanding and spraying we did with our kitchen cabinets which is adjacent to the room where the party will be set up. now that we are finally more settled in, we decided to clean the carpets and start fresh. we put a lot of work into it and now we have someone telling us our own house rules.
