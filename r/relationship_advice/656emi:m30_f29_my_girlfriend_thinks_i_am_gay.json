She said you have a lot of gay mannerisms, I said well I know I&amp;#39;m not the most masculine guy as I don&amp;#39;t really care for sports and I&amp;#39;m pretty sensitive and I think it&amp;#39;s because I was raised by my mom while my dad worked 60 hours a week. She kept at it and I ended up telling her when I was 19 after my first breakup that I thought I might be bi and tried blowing my gay friend, about 15 seconds in I decided I didn&amp;#39;t like it and told him this is not for me and he was cool about it but it did ruin our friendship. I told her I did that because I was super horny and I had no game and no girls would do anything with me (which was my fault) so I figured maybe I could like guys. She kept thinking that and it eventually went away.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well fast forward about 10 months she was talking about how she likes being used during sex and enjoys aggressive blowjobs, ass slapping and hair pulling, we were drunk and I asked if she wanted to bring another guy in so she could have both at the same time.
