Long time lurker here but I finally have a story for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This story takes place in a grocery store where I recently stopped to pick up a couple last minute items for dinner. Personally, I hate shopping but rarely have to do it because my wife generally doesn&amp;#39;t mind. We only needed a few items for dinner so I agreed to stop by on the way home from work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I am browsing the for the perfect rice to pair with dinner this older lady approaches me our conversation went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Old lady: Where is the soy sauce? I need soy sauce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked around and since we were the only two people in the aisle I realized she was talking to me. Normally I have no problem helping people, especially older people, but this lady used such a rude and entitled tone and I wasn&amp;#39;t going to have it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Excuse me?\nOld lady: soy sauce. Go get me a bottle.\nMe: I&amp;#39;m sorry ma&amp;#39;am, I don&amp;#39;t work here.\nOld lady: Yes you do. Go get me a bottle of soy sauce.\nMe: uhhh... I don&amp;#39;t work here. I don&amp;#39;t mind helping you out but you need to ask nicely. \nOld lady: Yes you do work here. Now, please go get me a bottle of soy sauce before I tell your manager.\nMe: That was a little better but I&amp;#39;m still not going to get that for you until you acknowledge that I don&amp;#39;t work here and that I am doing you a favor.\nOld lady: So you&amp;#39;re not going to get it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I had picked out some rice that would work for dinner and I put it in my shopping basket. I looked at my basket and then I looked at her. At this point I decided &amp;#39;screw this lady&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: ok I&amp;#39;ll go get it. Just wait here, I&amp;#39;ll be right back.\nOld lady: Good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t going to get it. Instead I went to get the last two items I needed while wondering how long that lady would stand there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To my surprise she really didn&amp;#39;t stand there long. As I was finishing up at the self check out I noticed her at the customer service desk in front of the registers speaking with a manager. This lady was crazy and I didn&amp;#39;t want any of the real employees to get in trouble when I left her hanging in the aisle so I bagged up my items and wondered over. I was a few steps away when she noticed me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Old lady (pointing at me): There he is. There is the rude employee that wouldn&amp;#39;t help me. \nManager: he doesn&amp;#39;t work here.\nOld Lady: Yes he does. I want him fired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The manager and I looked at each other. We had a short talk right in front of her. I told him what happened and that I wanted him to know he didn&amp;#39;t have a rude employee. He was very apologetic to me (like it was somehow the companies fault a crazy lady shops there) and then:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Old lady to the manager: So are you going to fire him?\nManager: I don&amp;#39;t know how I would do that he doesn&amp;#39;t work here.\nMe: You probably just need to look at me and say &amp;#39;You&amp;#39;re fired&amp;#39;. \nManager: But you don&amp;#39;t work here.\nMe: yeah but she doesn&amp;#39;t know that.\nManager looking at me: You&amp;#39;re fired\nMe: but what about my kids! How am I going to feed the kids!\nManager is like wtf is going on.\nManager: You have kids?\nMe: Yeah I have kids and now their dad doesn&amp;#39;t have a job and they won&amp;#39;t be able to eat. \nManager: I didn&amp;#39;t know you had kids. Well we do need help if you want to get started stocking shelves. \nNow I&amp;#39;m like wtf is going on.\nMe: Just kidding I don&amp;#39;t have any kids. I was just putting on a show for her. \nOld lady speaking to me: See that&amp;#39;s what you get!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all this lady still thought I worked there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Old lady: How&amp;#39;s that make you feel. Maybe you&amp;#39;ll try a little harder at your next job.\nMe: I don&amp;#39;t care I don&amp;#39;t even work here. I told you that back in the aisle.\nManager: Yeah he doesn&amp;#39;t work here.\nOld lady: Yes, cause I just got him fired.\nMe: No you didn&amp;#39;t. We just did that as a show for you because your crazy. I work somewhere else, I&amp;#39;ve never worked here.\nOld lady: You don&amp;#39;t work here.\nMe: finally you get it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I&amp;#39;ve said I&amp;#39;ve been a long time lurker but I knew this was the definition of a story for you all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me (As I go to leave): I&amp;#39;m going to put you on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m guessing something about old people not understanding the internet but she did not like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Old lady: Don&amp;#39;t put me on the internet.\nManager: Don&amp;#39;t put her on the internet.\nMe: you&amp;#39;re crazy and I&amp;#39;m putting you on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey everyone!
