Making friends as an adult is really hard. I wanted to get into aerial silks or lyra (the hanging hoop) but I&amp;#39;m just so shy and afraid to go alone. It&amp;#39;s a dumb fear and I thank my mom for this anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I would also get bored with it if I went just by myself. Like, I&amp;#39;d get on the wall and that&amp;#39;s it. No one to race /compete/friendly shit talk with. What do you guys do to keep repeat customers from getting bored? Or is it all just them wanting to do better than their last visit and actually having motivation?
