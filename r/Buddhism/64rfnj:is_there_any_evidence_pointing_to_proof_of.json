All we are is awareness, everything else exists as a subject of that awareness, and all things subject to our awareness are impermanent.

As a personal example, a decade back I had a strep throat. Strep throat often causes joint inflammation and pain, which in my case was unbearable and left me unable to do basically anything on my own for over six months. However, the doctors I saw couldn't find any inflammation in my joints, to the point where a specialist once basically told me I had absolutely nothing, even when I couldn't move and some of my tests indicated a high amount of white blood cells and the existence of streptococcus on my throat.\n\nCould he have measured my pain? No. He couldn't find evidence of pain, so he rejected the idea that I was in pain.\n\nThis also happens with people with fibromyalgia: You can't measure it, and it's ridiculously difficult to diagnose precisely because it manifests itself as pain with no apparent cause. There are no scientific ways of measuring pain, what we can find (but sometimes we can't) is the cause of pain, not the pain itself or how severe it is.\n\n&gt; Someone should have attained nirvana by this point and should of had tests done on themselves proving that they do not suffer anymore.\n\nSuffering is largely a mental thing, and therefore the existence or lack of it can't ever be proven. Put it this way: We don't have hard proof that clinical depression exists, because it is based mostly in suffering, which we can't measure. We diagnose people with depression and another host of mental issues based on observation of the outside and the reports of people themselves, yet we accept these things to be true. Nevertheless, no blood tests or MRIs or physical examinations will ever tell doctors you have depression, bipolar syndrome, schizophrenia, or autism. Yet that does not mean they don't exist, or does it?\n\nYou'll never have hard proof of the existence of Nirvana or the elimination of suffering, for it is based on things that aren't quantifiable. However, what you can do is look at those who follow the path and try to ascertain whether they are content with their existence or not. If they seem happier with their lives than your average person, or if they seem content with it, then it works in its own way.\n\nAnd here's the thing, since you're a non-believer: Even if everything in the Buddhist faith is a lie, does it really matter as long as following it makes one happy and hurts no one else? If a belief is hurting you you should let go of it, but if it is hurting nobody and it makes you a better person, does it really matter whether it is true or not?\n\n&gt; I'm honestly seeking evidence to show that Buddhism is different than the other religions out there and can actually back up it's bold claims.\n\nIt is different to other religions out there basically because it does not request, nor require, belief, and it's main and only rule is basically doing no harm. Everything else Buddhism teaches you is just a tool you can use to make yourself a better, calmer, happier person. Not all of said tools will fit all people, nor are they expected to, and some people will find their own way without them even. It does not matter. As long as a person's actions are virtuous, they will not be negatively judged regardless of their beliefs. As a matter of fact, some of the agnostics and humanists I know are also the best Buddhists I have ever met.\n\n&gt; When I ask a monk to show me evidence for any of these claims I just get the run around and they usually get upset.......\n\nIf you managed to make a monk upset, you might be talking to the wrong monks. Your lack of belief, after all, should neither matter for, nor affect mine. Your disbelief is not an affront to my beliefs or to anyone's, and in the grand scheme of things it does not matter: If I'm right and both karma and rebirth exists, your disbelief won't in any way harm you, for you'll be judged solely on actions. If you're right, and there's absolutely nothing at all beyond death, then once we're gone you won't be there to gloat at how you were right and I was not.\n\nTherefore, I can't understand why a Buddhist monk, who should be trained on patience as a virtue, would get upset over your disbelief.

As I have largely documented my thinking over the last 12 years in a series of ~500 essays and 10 peer-reviewed articles (most of which are freely available), this is easily confirmed. \n\nI would say that I have undergone three paradigms shifts in the last 12 years - not counting the profound shift occasioned by my ordination into the Triratna Buddhist Order during a 4 month retreat in 2005. The first was prompted by my 2006 meeting with Prof. Richard Gombrich and my subsequent engagement with his oeuvre and that of his former students, especially Sue Hamilton and Noa Ronkin. The second in 2011 was prompted by reading and reflecting on Thomas Metzinger's book *The Ego Tunnel*. And the third in 2016 from my reading and reflecting on *Analysis and the Fullness of Reality* by Richard H. Jones (perhaps better known for his translations of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, Madhyamaka, and Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 texts) followed by two of John Searle's books: *The Rediscovery of the Mind* and *The Construction of Social reality*. I'm also profoundly influenced by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's work on cognitive metaphors. \n\nThis brief exposition is of course a vast oversimplification of what I believe.

Epistemologically, I accept that individuals are limited by Kant&amp;#39;s transcendental idealism, though I argue that by comparing notes we can to make accurate and precise inferences about the nature of mind-independent objects and structures (call this Collective Empirical Realism) - though of course the latter is entirely irrelevant to Buddhism, the proper domain of which is experience itself (for which we have many words: pa\u00f1caskandh\u0101\u1e25, du\u1e25kha, loka, vedan\u0101, etc). In this I am persuaded by arguments made by Sue Hamilton (and latterly by Bhikkhu Bodhi) about the focus and purpose of Buddhist practice and have adapted my practice accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My views are constantly under review and changing as I do my practice, consult Buddhist texts in P\u0101\u1e37i, Sanskrit, and Chinese, books in English about philosophy, and as I discuss the processes of experience with my Buddhist friends, colleagues, and mentors. As I have largely documented my thinking over the last 12 years in a series of ~500 essays and 10 peer-reviewed articles (most of which are freely available), this is easily confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would say that I have undergone three paradigms shifts in the last 12 years - not counting the profound shift occasioned by my ordination into the Triratna Buddhist Order during a 4 month retreat in 2005. The first was prompted by my 2006 meeting with Prof. Richard Gombrich and my subsequent engagement with his oeuvre and that of his former students, especially Sue Hamilton and Noa Ronkin. The second in 2011 was prompted by reading and reflecting on Thomas Metzinger&amp;#39;s book &lt;em&gt;The Ego Tunnel&lt;/em&gt;. And the third in 2016 from my reading and reflecting on &lt;em&gt;Analysis and the Fullness of Reality&lt;/em&gt; by Richard H. Jones (perhaps better known for his translations of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, Madhyamaka, and Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 texts) followed by two of John Searle&amp;#39;s books: &lt;em&gt;The Rediscovery of the Mind&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Construction of Social reality&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;m also profoundly influenced by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson&amp;#39;s work on cognitive metaphors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This brief exposition is of course a vast oversimplification of what I believe. More detail is available in my many essays, and presuming I live long enough, in three forthcoming books that are underway. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; believe?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Buddhism", "name": "t1_dg7g3z4", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492113728.0, "created_utc": 1492084928.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ee9g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "karma_yeshe", "parent_id": "t1_dg7d7yk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Buddhism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's important because, as Ajahn Bramavaso (and others) has pointed out, views play a vital role in our perception of the world and how we interpret what we perceive towards what we think is \"truth\":\n\n    Our views bend our perceptions to agree with the view.
