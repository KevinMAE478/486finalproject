The three kinds of emptiness distinguished in the Sa\u1e43dhinirmocana S\u016btra are: emptiness with respect to characteristics, emptiness with respect to production, and ultimate emptiness. Now what we need is a good example, so we\u2019re going to take the cup. In particular what we are going to look at is how I actually experience the cup, and I want to do this just in a very ordinary, boring way from the standpoint of modern science for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here I am gazing fondly at this beautiful cup, and instinctively I think that I am experiencing immediately an external object that is smooth, round, has beautiful flowers on it, contains water and so forth; and if I asked you, iif I were right you would say: \u201cYes, you\u2019ve got it exactly!\u201d. But on reflection, even if we haven\u2019t studied a word of Dharma, we know that that\u2019s wrong. I am going to tell you a sad story. In fact here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Light is bouncing off some object out there, it\u2019s being bent by the lens of my eye, passed through a bunch of liquid in my eyeball, where it\u2019s causing electrical activity among nerve cells on the back of my eye. I\u2019m not making this up: it\u2019s in scriptures that we all trust, the scriptures of modern science!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What then happens? Nerve impulses go up my optic nerve into my brain. They go into my occipital cortex, where various visual processing happens, and they interact with the parts of my brain that are involved with language and with motor control to give me the labeled cup and to get my hand to grasp it. I want to make it clear that in order to see this cup I need some light but it is very dark in my brain. So whatever\u2019s happening in my brain, I don\u2019t have a cup in there; and the cup itself is not penetrating my skull and if it did I\u2019d be in big trouble; so where I take myself to be directly experiencing an external object, all that\u2019s really happening is bunch of complicated brain activity that is generating an image and a word and a bunch of action based upon some electrical activity in the back of my eye caused by some thing or other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is actually extremely profound, even though it\u2019s just science, and this is actually what the Sa\u1e43dhinirmocana S\u016btra and Vasubandhu are talking about. The imagined nature of the cup, the way that I imagine the object of my experience to be, is that it is external and that it is dualistically related to me as subject, that it is different from my subjectivity. But that\u2019s merely an imagined nature. That\u2019s something that I project, because all I immediately experience is an image and a name. The image and the name are somewhere in my brain not outside. You can\u2019t drink water from an image and a name, but I think that what I am grasping is something from which I can drink water. That\u2019s the imagined nature. I imagine my experience to be external to me, by a mental reflex I project it outside of me but that projection is not part of what I experience at all. What I experience is mind only. It\u2019s only in my mind. Where else could experience be? Experience can\u2019t be somewhere outside of me \u2013 that would be crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the first nature of the cup \u2013 its imagined nature \u2013 and it corresponds to the first emptiness of the cup. When it\u2019s called emptiness with respect to characteristics it means that the cup I experience is empty of all of the characteristics I ascribe to the external cup. I think the external cup is solid and round and beautiful and can be seen; but the cup I experience is something happening in my brain. All those neurons firing are not solid, are not round, are not particularly beautiful and cannot be seen. So the cup that I experience is empty of the characteristics that I attribute to it, and that is emptiness with respect to characteristics and it constitutes the imagined nature of the cup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we can say more about my experience of the cup: it depends upon countless causes and conditions, many of which are not made of porcelain. Many of those causes and conditions have to do with my own eyes, with the fact that there is light in the room, with the way that my brain works, with blood pumped by my heart \u2026 all of those causes and conditions. So, we also say that the cup has a dependent nature. My experience of the cup depends upon all these phenomena, even though I don\u2019t recognize that dependency in the cup as I perceive it, and that corresponds to the second emptiness of the cup: the emptiness in terms of causality, the emptiness in terms of dependence. So, the cup that I experience is causally dependent, whereas the cup that I take, that I posit, is empty of all of those phenomena. It seems to be a porcelain thing outside of me. I continue to think that I\u2019m experiencing external objects when in fact I am experiencing something that arises due to all of these causes and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, in the Sa\u1e43dhinirmocana S\u016btra and in the Trisvabh\u0101vanirde\u015ba we read that the consummate nature, the final nature of the cup, is that the dependent nature is empty of the imagined; and so what we now say is that experience of the cup that depends on all of these conditions is empty of that imagined external cup: the dependent cup in my mind is empty of subject-object duality, it\u2019s not separate from me, it is empty of externality; and so we say that that is the ultimate emptiness of the cup. The ultimate emptiness of our experience is that even though we always take our experience to be constituted by something outside of us, in fact, if we pay attention to science or to Buddhism, if we pay attention, what we experience is our experiences: just mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course this has implications for practice and for ethics as well. The more we practice, especially the more we practice the kind of mindfulness that we are encouraged to practice in the P\u0101li canon, the more we see that what we attribute to our experience is different from the experience itself; and so when I find somebody who I find really annoying, who starts to make me really angry, and I say: \u201cThat person is an annoying person, that person causes anger\u201d, I can direct myself back to my experience, and ask \u201cWhere does that experience come from?\u201d That experience depends upon internal causes and conditions. The\u00a0person I experience\u00a0is not external to me. The\u00a0experience\u00a0of the person is mind only. I can\u2019t change the external person. The only thing I can change is my mind, the person I experience. Mind is all I have to work with. Mind is the basis of practice, and that\u2019s why Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, the third turning is so important, and once again nothing we\u2019ve said about the third turning is inconsistent with anything we said about the second turning. One gives us an understanding of objects, the other gives us an understanding of the subject. Each of them is consistent with everything we saw in the first turning, which gives us the general framework, or the structure, of reality within which we exist.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Full article:\n&lt;a href=\"http://info-buddhism.com/Three_Turnings_of_The_Wheel_of_Dharma_Jay_Garfield.html\"&gt;http://info-buddhism.com/Three_Turnings_of_The_Wheel_of_Dharma_Jay_Garfield.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "\"The three natures are these: the first one is in Sanskrit called the parikalpita-svabh\u0101va or the imagined nature, the second one paratantra-svabh\u0101va or the dependent nature, and the third one the parini\u1e63panna-svabh\u0101va or the perfected or the consummate nature.
