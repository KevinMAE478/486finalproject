Of course, it appears that the asuras and gods basically comprise all of the realms 'above' the human realm, with the asuras likely being those in the kama-loka or desire realm in general (or at least the lower ones), but I'm not really sure why people started talking that way.

In this text, there are ten.\n\nAt the third Bhumi, for example, many of the Bodhisattvas take the form of Indras.\n\nAt the 8th Bhumi, most become great Brahmas.\n\nSo generally, yes, they would not be considered humans.\n\n&gt;When Mahayana was first established as a tradition bodhisattvas were simply humans who had taken the vow to become a Buddha instead of just seeking nirvana.\n\nI'm not sure exactly what your source is there. I would slightly change it and say that they are beings that have taken that vow - whether or not they are consistently human is ... well, I think canonically false, as Siddharta Gautama was said to have been in Tusita heaven prior to his life as the \"Buddha\", which would mean he was not, in fact, human. I believe that all traditions also agree that Maitreya, the current bodhisattva, generally resides in Tusita as well, which makes him not human.\n\nThis is not specific to the Mahayana, of course.\n\nIn general, I don't think you understand the Mahayana.\n\nIn general, I think many who call themselves Mahayana Buddhists don't understand things like the Pali Canon.\n\nIn the Pali Canon, it is said that there are various routes to arhatship.  If you look at [this link](http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/buddhas-words/selections/buddhas-words-introduction-part-x-planes-realization), which is an excerpt from \"In the Buddha's Words\" by Bhikku Bodhi (a Theravadin Monk), says generally that there are two routes to stream-entry - the route of faith, and the route of wisdom.\n\nI personally think that generally, the Mahayana and Theravada (to limit it to those two) can lead to the stages of enlightenment.\n\nNow, one final point that I will make is that one of the big mysteries, if you will, of the Theravada or the Pali Canon is ... what happens when an arahant dies?\n\nSome think that it's basically just extinction, but this is actually considered an 'evil view' in the Pali Canon itself, as evidenced by the [Yamaka Sutta](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.085.than.html).\n\nNow, if it's not extinction, then what is it?\n\nDo you think that the realization of the Buddha is identical, in every way, to that of his disciples?\n\nIn the Pali Canon, the arahants have 4 epithets that are used to describe them - arahant, possessed of true knowledge and conduct, an exalted one, enlightened.\n\nThere are, however, 5 additional epithets - making 9 total - used to describe the Buddha: perfectly enlightened one, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Blessed One.\n\nI think on a reasonable read of the Pali Canon, it is fairly clear that the Buddha is generally superior to his disciples insofar as his ability to understand the minds of others, be able to teach them, and his psychic abilities go.\n\nSo if you accept that premise, then the questions are: what happens when an arahant dies, and how does one bridge the gap between an arahant and a Buddha?\n\nNow, in my read of the Mahayana literature - such as the Avatamsaka - I believe that all bodhisattvas on the Bhumis are actually enlightened in the sense that they are arahants.\n\nI think a key thing here is that they don't, I believe, \"take birth\" in the same way that a samsaric being does.\n\nI also, personally, currently believe that the Mahayana often will lead one to open the dharmic eye and reach the stages of enlightenment - the sotapanna and so on - ultimately leading to arahantship and, subsequently, bodhisattvahood - in this sense, I do not mean an \"aspiring\" bodhisattva but rather an enlightened bodhisattva.\n\nAnyway, I wish you all the best.", "edited": 1492134636.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there are some who call themselves Mahayana Buddhists who look at the Theravada school, or at others who take the Pali Canon or similar texts as their basis, and think that they are of an inferior mindset to the Mahayanists.
