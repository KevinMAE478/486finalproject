I never have time to do the kinds of things I feel like I need to do in order to further my spiritual development. I miss my family (nontrad, I have a wife and 2 kids, and a job). I used to be able to meditate, or even just take a moment to myself to appreciate how beautiful everything is. I feel anxious frequently, and I feel like I'm always thinking about school. As if that's the only thing going on in my life. I'm meaner than usual, and I have been treating people disrespectfully. I'm not happy about it.\n\nI've tried to do a few things to keep my head. The first is to recognize that these are the sacrifices that I have to make in order to get to where I want to be. It's temporary. Everything's temporary. I just have to suck it up and get through it. The second is to take a couple minutes every so often to visualize what it would be like if \"worst case scenario\" happened: Let's just say, hypothetically, everything falls apart and I don't get into med school. That's okay. I'll try again, or I'll do something else. I've done the best I can do, so I'm either getting in or I'm not. I have to accept whatever happens and structure my response accordingly. Another thing is (and I bet you already know this, but I'll say it again anyhow), you **have** to get out and do something besides school **at least sometime**. You just have to. You're gonna drive yourself crazy if you don't. Even if you have something due soon, or an assignment pressing, get out and do something else. I try to do something I enjoy, that's relaxing, at least once a week. There's probably not much you can do right now with finals coming up, but try to do something relaxing before or during finals week. Just once.\n\nOh! Another thing that helps...sometimes, anyhow: Science is amazing. It's really wondrous, and has a remarkable way of revealing the beauty and harmony of the world. Look back on what you've learned. Look how much you understand. Even if you've struggled to learn the material, you know more than you did before, and that's *never* a bad thing.

That is meditation too, isn&amp;#39;t it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, meditation is about stopping the mind from being dragged off by external-senses, including the monkey-mind that thinks wildly. It is about not letting craving dictate you. It is about tracing where these cravings come from, following them backwards through &lt;a href=\"http://www.dhammasukha.org/uploads/1/2/8/6/12865490/4939325.png?594\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dependent origination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as you radiate loving-kindness regardless of what you are doing - studying, memorising, writing, talking to friends, eating, drinking, sleeping, leisure, doing yoga, &amp;quot;sitting meditation&amp;quot;, running, walking, whatever it is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything can be a meditation object. Feelings arise, oh you note that and don&amp;#39;t get dragged off by it. Thoughts arise. Mental qualities change. The body aches and what not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meditation is not just sitting down on a mat. There is a reason why the Buddha said that conduct itself was a crucial component of achieving the end of suffering too, you know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Buddhism", "name": "t1_dg7b17c", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492099774.0, "created_utc": 1492070974.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_651z1l", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6xwd5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rks1157", "parent_id": "t3_651z1l", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Buddhism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Take a bit of advice from an old man.
