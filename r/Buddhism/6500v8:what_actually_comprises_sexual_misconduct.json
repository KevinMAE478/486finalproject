Secondly, I think that sometimes when people have too many rules that they try to live by without knowing *WHY* the rules or precepts are what they are, then they become obsessed with following rules rather than actually making positive efforts. In other words, too many unnecessary rules is not productive, in my mind, at times.\n\nIn this regard, I do not know where Tsongkhapa got his information. I have not read all of the Pali Canon in my life, nor have I read every Mahayana sutra or Tantric scripture, but I have never seen this advice (that you wrote) attributed to the Buddha himself in any writings.
