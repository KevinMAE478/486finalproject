I\u2019ve been dealing with this problem for most of my life. Good news: there\u2019s a lot of things you can do to GREATLY reduce your anxiety:\n\nI strongly recommend you look into cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) - very similar. This can be done with a therapist or own your own. Even just doing a little bit and getting down the basics will provide a ton of relief.

(running, walking, lifting, swimming, playing ball, etc. It's all good.)\n* meditate daily for a minimum of 30 minutes (concentration, Vipassana or Metta meditation)\n* Greatly reduce over-stimulation (gaming, porn, browsing reddit, etc\n\nThe key is to manage that which is manageable (diet, exercise, meditation, CBT). Commit to the above for minimum 3 months. Don't check progress. Just do it. After that, you may decide that some bullet points above need to be negotiated. (Ex. maybe weed/booze/caffeine aren't a trigger for you. In this experiment you'll figure that out.)\n\nFinally, there is strong research that mindfulness meditation shrinks the amygdala (fear center in your brain) . Do two 30 minute sessions of samatha a day and in 6 months see how you\u2019re doing. Look up Jon Kabat-Zinn and MBSR (mindfulness-based stress reduction) for more - he\u2019s been leading the meditation charge from the scientific community for 30 years.\n\nPlease know that you don't have to live like this forever.

This can be done with a therapist or own your own. Even just doing a little bit and getting down the basics will provide a ton of relief. There&amp;#39;s plenty of books out there but here&amp;#39;s one I used with great results called &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Worry-Trap-Yourself-Acceptance-Commitment/dp/1572244801/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1461819594&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+worry+trap\"&gt;The Worry Trap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you haven&amp;#39;t already, you should do the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;eliminate weed, alcohol and caffeine completely&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;limit sugar intake (esp candy, soda, etc)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;start an exercise plan at least 4 days a week. (running, walking, lifting, swimming, playing ball, etc. It&amp;#39;s all good.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;meditate daily for a minimum of 30 minutes (concentration, Vipassana or Metta meditation)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Greatly reduce over-stimulation (gaming, porn, browsing reddit, etc&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key is to manage that which is manageable (diet, exercise, meditation, CBT). Commit to the above for minimum 3 months. Don&amp;#39;t check progress. Just do it. After that, you may decide that some bullet points above need to be negotiated. (Ex. maybe weed/booze/caffeine aren&amp;#39;t a trigger for you. In this experiment you&amp;#39;ll figure that out.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is strong research that mindfulness meditation shrinks the amygdala (fear center in your brain) . Do two 30 minute sessions of samatha a day and in 6 months see how you\u2019re doing. Look up Jon Kabat-Zinn and MBSR (mindfulness-based stress reduction) for more - he\u2019s been leading the meditation charge from the scientific community for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please know that you don&amp;#39;t have to live like this forever. The above should help you get started on dialing this down on the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Buddhism", "name": "t1_dgc6os8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492387072.0, "created_utc": 1492358272.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kf6x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgayxkj", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HipsterMonk", "parent_id": "t3_65kf6x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Buddhism", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Expecting meditation to fix a brain chemistry problem is like expecting meditation to fix a broken leg. \n\nsee a doctor", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expecting meditation to fix a brain chemistry problem is like expecting meditation to fix a broken leg. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;see a doctor&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Buddhism", "name": "t1_dgayxkj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492309114.0, "created_utc": 1492280314.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kf6x", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgay8ew", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jhana4", "parent_id": "t3_65kf6x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Buddhism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sorry to post just a link, but I've pasted this a bazillion times.
