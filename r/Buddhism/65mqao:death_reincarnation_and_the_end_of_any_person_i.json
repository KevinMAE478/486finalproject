My understanding is that your inquiry can be answered in several ways. On a very literal level, if we consider rebirth and the beginning-less and end-less nature of all phenomena, then seeing the reincarnations of all your loved ones and enemies is not only a possibility, but an inevitability. Garchen Rinpoche has taught that we must view every being as if they were our mother or father in a previous life. Because time has no beginning and our mindstreams have taken infinite forms, we have been related to every sentient being in the entire universe in a previous life. We can reverse this observation as well, and assume that we will take many, many more rebirths, and even if we achieve realization, I think a \"bodhisattva\" vow is likely, in which the realized mind-stream continues to take rebirth in order to liberate others. In other words, your mind stream will continue to take form on and off again for endless time. This means that you will have infinite opportunities to reincarnate with all of your loved ones in future lives; however, this is just an aspect of your coming into contact in future lives with all beings.
