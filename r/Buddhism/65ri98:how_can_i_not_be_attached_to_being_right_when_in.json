At first you have to try this, and it will feel real counter-intuitive. The more you do it, the more you see the value in letting it go.\n\nConsider this from Eckhart Tolle's *A New Earth*:\n*\" A   powerful   spiritual   practice   is   consciously   to   allow   the diminishment   of   ego   when   it   happens   without   attempting   to   restore   it.   I\nrecommend that you experiment with this from time to time. For example, when   someone   criticizes   you,   blames   you,   or   calls   you   names,   instead   of\nimmediately retaliating or defending yourself \u2013 do nothing. Allow the self\u00ad image to remain diminished and become alert to what that feels like deep\ninside   you.   For   a   few   seconds,   it   may   feel   uncomfortable,   as   if   you   had shrunk in size. Then you may sense an inner spaciousness that feels intensely alive. You haven't been diminished at all. In fact, you have expanded. You may   then   come   to   an   amazing   realization:   When   you   are   seemingly diminished   in   some   way   and   remain   in   absolute   non\u00adreaction,   not   just externally   but   also   internally,   you   realize   that   nothing   real   has   been diminished, that through becoming \u201cless,\u201d you become more. When you no longer defend or attempt to strengthen the form of yourself, you step out of identification with form, with mental self\u00adimage. Through becoming less (in the ego's perception), you in fact undergo an expansion and make room for Being   to   come   forward.   True   power,   who   you   are   beyond   form,   can   then shine through the apparently weakened form. This is what Jesus means when  he says, \u201cDeny yourself\u201d or \u201cTurn the other cheek.\u201d*\n\n*This does not mean, of course, that you invite abuse or turn yourself into a victim of unconscious people. Sometimes a situation may demand that\nyou   tell   someone   to   \u201cback   off\u201d   in   no   uncertain   terms.   Without   egoic defensiveness, there will be power behind your words, yet no reactive force. \nIf necessary, you can also say not to someone firmly and clearly, and it will be what I call a \u201chigh\u00adquality no\u201d that is free of all negativity.\"*", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Let go.
