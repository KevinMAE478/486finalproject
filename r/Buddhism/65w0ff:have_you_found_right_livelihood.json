I am planning on requesting my next posting to be to a search and rescue squadron, which would be a fully wholesome livelihood, even if they make me shoot an M-16 downrange once a year for Universality of Service reasons. But you never just get what you want in the military so it may not happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am happy with where I am, as my pension will allow me financial security and I will be able to retire quite early and go on to do a more wholesome job after. It is also possible I may need to take in some relatives, and my financial security will help make sure I am capable of doing that. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Buddhism", "name": "t1_dgdwtzo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492483387.0, "created_utc": 1492454587.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65w0ff", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgds9sl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nemo_13", "parent_id": "t3_65w0ff", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Buddhism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I moved out of industrial automation into health care.
