People want to hate, it makes them feel good in a weird way which I don&amp;#39;t really understand but it definitely feels good otherwise they wouldn&amp;#39;t go out of their way to hate. Religion happens to be a useful vessel for hating &amp;quot;others&amp;quot;. Just like race, gender, and all the other ways to distinguish people in groups, it can be a way to push a particular group out. It doesn&amp;#39;t help most of the books they base their ideals on are ancient, translated many times, and &amp;quot;sinning&amp;quot; is such a malleable term and usually includes non-believers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that way religion is a weapon. It not really the religion&amp;#39;s fault, it&amp;#39;s the people you need to look at.
