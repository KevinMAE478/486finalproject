Vasubandhu makes this point discussing the idea that the guardians of hell are not actually sentient beings; rather, he posits the hell guardians are mental projections of the denizens of hell and cites cases of mass hysteria as evidence that group-think can &amp;quot;conjure demons&amp;quot; into reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you misunderstood what I meant by &amp;quot;modes of experience.&amp;quot; The hells are real; the ghost realms are real, but these realms are not distinct from our own realm. Everything overlaps and we perceive reality in accordance to our actions. A hell being might perceive a foreboding fortress where we perceive a mountain. But I do believe that the realms are completely real, tangible, navigable territories for the beings born there. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Buddhism", "name": "t1_dge5y57", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492493783.0, "created_utc": 1492464983.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wn6s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wn6s", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65wn6s", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeecx4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "derpface360", "parent_id": "t1_dgedzij", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Buddhism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The second one.
