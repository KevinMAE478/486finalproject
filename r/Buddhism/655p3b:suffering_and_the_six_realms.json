This might be compared to being a member of a hate group or a street gang.\n\nHungry Ghosts: We see this in people who are always trying to swindle, hustle, or otherwise scam people or institutions for more. Or maybe they don't need to do any of that, they have a job that brings them a lot of money and they just can't stop spending it on food, drink, drugs, and other pleasures. They're totally addicted.\n\nAnimals: I think most people in the developed world, particularly the middle class, fall into this category. Animals like you if you feed them and treat them nice, but they don't like you if you don't feed them and aren't so nice to them. Most people act this way. They think, \"Oh, I like Mary, she's always so nice to me. I don't like Doug, though, he's always pretty rude to me.\" That's how animals behave. You can also lump in the workaholics or the people who live to work, those who believe that unless you're working, you're of no value to society or to anyone. They may believe that the arts hold no value at all, and that we should all be doctors and engineers.\n\nHuman Beings: In seeking fame and profit kinda rise above the liking those who are nice to me thing. They may believe in the idea of \"I don't care what others think of me\" or \"I'm going to go my own way\". They are viewed as being more self-actualized than the \"animals\". They are viewed as the pinacle of what we should all strive to be like.\n\nAsuras: The description of them you wrote makes me think of affluent people who are championing some cause or another. They go to \"war\" against poverty, homelessness,et cetera. Or maybe they're against marriage equality or something of that nature. They have a cause and you're going to hear all about it whether or not you want to.\n\nHeavenly Beings: These are the truly wealthy individuals. The ones who want for nothing, who are utterly divorced from the reality that most of us face. These are the sorts of people we sometimes read about on /r/AskReddit when people talk about what the ultra-rich act like.

This might be compared to being a member of a hate group or a street gang.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hungry Ghosts: We see this in people who are always trying to swindle, hustle, or otherwise scam people or institutions for more. Or maybe they don&amp;#39;t need to do any of that, they have a job that brings them a lot of money and they just can&amp;#39;t stop spending it on food, drink, drugs, and other pleasures. They&amp;#39;re totally addicted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Animals: I think most people in the developed world, particularly the middle class, fall into this category. Animals like you if you feed them and treat them nice, but they don&amp;#39;t like you if you don&amp;#39;t feed them and aren&amp;#39;t so nice to them. Most people act this way. They think, &amp;quot;Oh, I like Mary, she&amp;#39;s always so nice to me. I don&amp;#39;t like Doug, though, he&amp;#39;s always pretty rude to me.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s how animals behave. You can also lump in the workaholics or the people who live to work, those who believe that unless you&amp;#39;re working, you&amp;#39;re of no value to society or to anyone. They may believe that the arts hold no value at all, and that we should all be doctors and engineers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Human Beings: In seeking fame and profit kinda rise above the liking those who are nice to me thing. They may believe in the idea of &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care what others think of me&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to go my own way&amp;quot;. They are viewed as being more self-actualized than the &amp;quot;animals&amp;quot;. They are viewed as the pinacle of what we should all strive to be like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asuras: The description of them you wrote makes me think of affluent people who are championing some cause or another. They go to &amp;quot;war&amp;quot; against poverty, homelessness,et cetera. Or maybe they&amp;#39;re against marriage equality or something of that nature. They have a cause and you&amp;#39;re going to hear all about it whether or not you want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heavenly Beings: These are the truly wealthy individuals.
