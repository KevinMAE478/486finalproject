I find a big part of meditation is proprioception; developing an awareness of your physical body, of how you hold yourself, and how thoughts and feelings often manifest themselves at certain points in your body. Noticing this kind of tension and trying to correct it can also help you detach from discursive mental activities. If you let go of discursive thought, you are brought to a greater awareness of your physical existence. On a similar note however, closing your eyes is not a passive, neutral thing. You're using muscles to forcibly join your eyelids, so it makes sense that you would notice an increase in tension there, because it takes effort to close your eyes. As others have suggested, keeping your eyes \"half-closed\" is a good way of relieving this. It takes some practice to figure out where \"neutral\" is, but the half-closed thing definitely has something to do with trying to find that point of muscular tranquility. I've actually had some strange experiences where I will manage to relax my eyes to such a degree that it's almost as if I stop seeing for a moment, as if my eyes fall into a position where they've entered their natural blind spots. It can be somewhat jarring; when that feeing approaches I'll often reflexively refocus and lose my one-pointedness. One thing that has actually helped is practicing in a dark room, even a room where all the light has been blocked out.
