Similar to the first days of summer holiday from school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But very soon you get used to your new way of living, whatever that is.

I believe it has to do with openess / un-expectedness of the following moment. In the case of summer holiday, it in itself is obviously not unexpected, but if you don&amp;#39;t have plans, that obviously brings unexpectedness to your days. And a new routine, whatever it is (like a summer job), does bring new things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going back to the example of this morning: Unexpectedly in my life, more time opened up. Time that is not yet filled with anything. I didn&amp;#39;t yet have any plans of what to do with it, because I didn&amp;#39;t expect this time was going to be there. As soon as I started planning something, the feeling of freedom started to dissipate. Could I not have started to plan something? Unfortunately, even if I wanted not-to plan something, my mind would have eventually come up with something &amp;quot;important&amp;quot;. This again goes back to why regular practice of meditation is important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Share your experiences, opinions..
