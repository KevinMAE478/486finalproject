Then  we  come  to  the  realisation  that  the\norigin of suffering, desire, can be laid aside and let go of.\nHow do you let go of things? This means you leave them as\nthey are; it does not mean you annihilate them or throw them\naway.  It  is  more  like  setting  down  and  letting  them  be.\nThrough the practice of letting go we realise that there is the\norigin of suffering, which is the attachment to desire, and we  realise  that  we  should  let  go  of  these  three  kinds  of  desire.  Then we realise that we have let go of these desires; there is  no longer any attachment to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When  you  find  yourself  attached,  remember  that  \u2018letting  go\u2019\nis not \u2018getting rid of\u2019 or \u2018throwing away\u2019. If I\u2019m holding onto\nthis  clock  and  you  say,  \u2018Let  go  of  it!\u2019,  that  doesn\u2019t  mean\n\u2018throw  it  out\u2019.  I  might  think  that  I  have  to  throw  it  away\nbecause I\u2019m attached to it, but that would just be the desire to\nget rid of it. We tend to think that getting rid of the object is a\nway  of  getting  rid  of  attachment.  But  if  I  can  contemplate\nattachment,  this  grasping  of  the  clock,  I  realise  that  there  is\nno point in getting rid of it \u2014 it\u2019s a good clock; it keeps good\ntime  and  is  not  heavy  to  carry  around.  The  clock  is  not  the\nproblem. The problem is grasping the clock. So what do I do?\nLet it go, lay it aside \u2014 put it down gently without any kind\nof  aversion.  Then  I  can  pick  it  up  again,  see  what  time  it  is\nand lay it aside when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You  can  apply  this  insight  into  \u2018letting  go\u2019  to  the  desire  for\nsense  pleasures.  Maybe  you  want  to  have  a  lot  of  fun.  How\nwould you lay aside that desire without any aversion? Simply\nrecognise the desire without judging it. You can contemplate\nwanting  to  get  rid  of  it  \u2014  because  you  feel  guilty  about\nhaving  such  a  foolish  desire  \u2014  but  just  lay  it  aside.  Then,\nwhen  you  see  it  as  it  is,  recognising  that  it\u2019s  just  desire,  you\nare no longer attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the way is always working with the moments of daily life.\nWhen you are feeling depressed and negative, just the moment\nthat  you  refuse  to  indulge  in  that  feeling  is  an  enlightenment\nexperience. When you see  that , you need not sink into the sea\nof  depression  and  despair  and  wallow  in  it.  You  can  actually\nstop by learning not to give things a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You  have  to  find  this  out  through  practice  so  that  you  will\nknow for yourself how to let go of the origin of suffering. Can\nyou let go of desire by wanting to let go of it? What is it that is\nreally letting go in a given moment? You have to contemplate the experience of letting go and really examine and investigate\nuntil the insight comes. Keep with it until that insight comes:\n\u2018Ah,  letting  go,  yes,  now  I  understand.  Desire  is  being  let  go\nof.\u2019 This does not mean that you are going to let go of desire\nforever but, at that one moment, you actually \nhave\n let go and\nyou  have  done  it  in  full  conscious  awareness.  There  is  an\ninsight  then.  This  is  what  we  call  insight  knowledge.  In  Pali,\nwe call it \n\u00f1anadassana\n or profound understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I  had  my  first  insight  into  letting  go  in  my  first  year  of\nmeditation.  I  figured  out  intellectually  that  you  had  to  let  go\nof  everything  and  then  I  thought:  \u2018How  do  you  let  go?\u2019  It\nseemed   impossible   to   let   go   of   anything.   I   kept   on\ncontemplating: \u2018How do you let go?\u2019 Then I would say, \u2018You\nlet  go  by  letting  go.\u2019  \u2018Well  then,  let  go!\u2019  Then  I  would  say:\n\u2018But have I let go yet?\u2019 and, \u2018How do you let go?\u2019 \u2018Well just\nlet  go!\u2019  I  went  on  like  that,  getting  more  frustrated.  But\neventually it became obvious what was happening. If you try\nto analyse letting go in detail, you get caught up in making it\nvery complicated. It was not something that you could figure\nout in words any more, but something you actually did. So I\njust let go for a moment, just like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now  with  personal  problems  and  obsessions,  to  let  go  of\nthem  is  just  that  much.  It  is  not  a  matter  of  analysing  and\nendlessly  making  more  of  a  problem  about  them,  but  of\npractising  that  state  of  leaving  things  alone,  letting  go  of\nthem.  At  first,  you  let  go  but  then  you  pick  them  up  again\nbecause  the  habit  of  grasping  is  so  strong.  But  at  least  you\nhave the idea. Even when I had that insight into letting go, I\nlet go for a moment but then I started grasping by thinking: \u2018I\ncan\u2019t  do  it,  I  have  so  many  bad  habits!\u2019  But  don\u2019t  trust  that\nkind  of  nagging,  disparaging  thing  in  yourself.  It  is  totally\nuntrustworthy. It is just a matter of practising letting go.
