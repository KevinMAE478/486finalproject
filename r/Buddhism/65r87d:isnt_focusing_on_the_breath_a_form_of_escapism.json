Of course, this is more difficult, as the mind is prone to be unmindful and swept up into all sorts of things without a meditative focus.  So focusing on the breath isn&amp;#39;t like an escape.  Rather, it is almost like training wheels for simple awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: In fact, when I face boredom in meditation, I allow the boredom to be my meditation focus... what it reveals is not some unique emotion called &amp;quot;boredom&amp;quot; but rather craving for things to be other than they are and dissatisfaction with the moment.  This isn&amp;#39;t running away from the boredom.  Rather, it is facing it, letting it permeate you, feeling it fully.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Buddhism", "name": "t1_dgctzqi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492418034.0, "created_utc": 1492389234.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65r87d", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcuk5h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "rang-rig", "parent_id": "t3_65r87d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Buddhism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sidebar: There are 40 other objects of meditation mentioned in Buddhist texts: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidebar: There are 40 other objects of meditation mentioned in Buddhist texts: &lt;a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamma%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADh%C4%81na\"&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na&lt;/a&gt;
