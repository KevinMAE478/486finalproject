I'm sure you will enjoy your trip to the mosque and I'm glad if I've helped in any way :)\n\nI can definitely sympathise with feeling anxiety about the state of the world and leaning more into religion. To be honest, although I may be Buddhist, I'm also a religious pluralist inasmuch that I feel all of them have something valuable to say on the matter of Truth (Reality, Dharma). \n\nTo me, Truth doesn't have a religion - if I can get a better handle on it sometimes in a Christian or Islamic or Hindu \"wrapper\", then so be it. No-one owns it. In that sense, I don't feel there is a possibility for me to be disloyal to Buddhism by engaging with other religions, any more than I would be being disloyal to my sister when I spend time with my best friend. I love them both in different ways and there is no sense of exclusivity.\n\nThis doesn't mean that I need to syncretise Buddhism with Islam, however, so that I'm practising both. And when it comes to comparing religions, it's important to remember that they are different and not try and subsume one into the other (e.g. saying things like Muhammad was really a Buddhist without knowing it, or something the Buddha said was a prediction of Islam coming later and being the perfect religion). In order to be as fair to another religion as possible, it requires some level of immersion into their perspective, whilst still retaining the link to your own.\n\nAnd I will be honest with you, there are sometimes things that are uncomfortable to deal with, so it isn't just looking at the stuff in common, but being prepared to be with the awkward, difficult stuff too, which can sometimes be the same stuff that followers of that religion also find difficult. As a Buddhist, I struggle with accepting literal rebirth and I know there are Muslims who struggle with certain bits of the Qur'an, and we both have to find a way to make sense of that and retain faith in our respective religions. Recognising that we were both having to deal with this issue made me more compassionate towards both myself and others when it came to the challenges of interpreting doctrine.\n\nI would definitely recommend having a chat with the imam or other attendees at the mosque if you feel comfortable - I'm sure they will be very welcoming. In these times, any attempts to build bridges between different communities will always be warmly welcomed. \n\nFeel free to PM me and let me know how you get on :)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s great! I&amp;#39;m sure you will enjoy your trip to the mosque and I&amp;#39;m glad if I&amp;#39;ve helped in any way :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can definitely sympathise with feeling anxiety about the state of the world and leaning more into religion. To be honest, although I may be Buddhist, I&amp;#39;m also a religious pluralist inasmuch that I feel all of them have something valuable to say on the matter of Truth (Reality, Dharma). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, Truth doesn&amp;#39;t have a religion - if I can get a better handle on it sometimes in a Christian or Islamic or Hindu &amp;quot;wrapper&amp;quot;, then so be it. No-one owns it. In that sense, I don&amp;#39;t feel there is a possibility for me to be disloyal to Buddhism by engaging with other religions, any more than I would be being disloyal to my sister when I spend time with my best friend. I love them both in different ways and there is no sense of exclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that I need to syncretise Buddhism with Islam, however, so that I&amp;#39;m practising both. And when it comes to comparing religions, it&amp;#39;s important to remember that they are different and not try and subsume one into the other (e.g. saying things like Muhammad was really a Buddhist without knowing it, or something the Buddha said was a prediction of Islam coming later and being the perfect religion). In order to be as fair to another religion as possible, it requires some level of immersion into their perspective, whilst still retaining the link to your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I will be honest with you, there are sometimes things that are uncomfortable to deal with, so it isn&amp;#39;t just looking at the stuff in common, but being prepared to be with the awkward, difficult stuff too, which can sometimes be the same stuff that followers of that religion also find difficult. As a Buddhist, I struggle with accepting literal rebirth and I know there are Muslims who struggle with certain bits of the Qur&amp;#39;an, and we both have to find a way to make sense of that and retain faith in our respective religions. Recognising that we were both having to deal with this issue made me more compassionate towards both myself and others when it came to the challenges of interpreting doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend having a chat with the imam or other attendees at the mosque if you feel comfortable - I&amp;#39;m sure they will be very welcoming. In these times, any attempts to build bridges between different communities will always be warmly welcomed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to PM me and let me know how you get on :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Buddhism", "name": "t1_dgdj4sa", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492467564.0, "created_utc": 1492438764.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dga2qrm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fags4islam", "parent_id": "t1_dg97fsm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Buddhism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh man, I am *so* happy to hear you say that.\n\nI'm in a similar situation.

The source is escaping me, but in something I read I found the attitude to be on the verge of complete gender fluidity, something like \"there is no distinction between male and female, and that one can be male and female at the same time (I believe it might have been in a Tantra, but not sure).

There is no \"hardline\", and as you say, I think it comes down to a)skillful means and b) the distinctions between ultimate and conventional truth, which is something that I've been thinking about a lot recently, as it seems like that distinction is the nexus where many of the distinctions break down, at least in the vajrayana tradition. \n\nEdit: I think the payment thing boils down to what Tsongkapa sees as a fundamental distinction of consent and \"possession\" (using that term loosely).

Perhaps it's also an extension of the prohibitions concerning stealing? Idk just stood out as strange to me, but I take it as a cultural relic and not as dogma.

Problematic especially given the debate around so many \"gurus\" who have done morally questionable things.
