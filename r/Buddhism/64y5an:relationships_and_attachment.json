So be realistic about your relationships. You&amp;#39;ll always have some level of attachment if you have your own relationships or are married or have a family, etc.  Don&amp;#39;t be hard on yourself if you think you &lt;em&gt;simply must&lt;/em&gt; be unattached.  Not everyone is ready to give up attachments in this lifetime. You can work at lessening your attachments, but don&amp;#39;t beat yourself up over not achieving the ideal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are other things to remember.  For example,  a healthy relationship can support one&amp;#39;s practice.  If you have a partner,  using the relationship to cultivate loving kindness, generosity, concern for others, compassion, etc., can be a huge plus. Some might best further their dharma practice within the context of a healthy relationship.  Healthy relationships can further our common bonds to other humans, foster compassion, foster loving kindness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Buddha recognized that not everyone would be ready for the same level of practice.
