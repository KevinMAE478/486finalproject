When I look at my wooden kendo swords propped up against the wall, and think that there&amp;#39;s a real chance I may not be able to practice kendo again, it makes me want to cry. Because I placed my self worth in identifying as someone who works hard, is active and strong and healthy and is passionate about kendo. It&amp;#39;s scary that a physical ailment can come out of nowhere and jeopardize the identity you&amp;#39;ve built for yourself. But I think that&amp;#39;s exactly why you have to accept that you&amp;#39;re perfectly good just as you are. If you place too much value on things that are outside of yourself, they can get taken away from you by forces that are beyond your control.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Buddhism", "name": "t1_dgad63i", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492265182.0, "created_utc": 1492236382.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnf", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65gcz9", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaj1bv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "consciousperception", "parent_id": "t3_65gcz9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Buddhism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You cannot become happy.
