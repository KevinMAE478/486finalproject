Emptiness is defined as the \u2018absence of reference&amp;#39; or \u2018unfindability, in other words, the absence of inherent existence. Phenomena, from form to omniscience, are totally devoid of even the slightest degree of intrinsic being. Their true status lies outside the range of discursive cognition, and consequently it is precisely mental construction that veils it. Phenomena, the objects of thought, appear only as long as thoughts occur (namely, the ordinary mind and its mental factors). For in themselves, phenomena are without true existence, not only on the ultimate level but even on the conventional level.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Absence of attributes [signlessness] or featurelessness is defined as \u2018pacification&amp;#39; or \u2018subsiding.\u2019 Phenomena arise in interdependence as the natural display of emptiness. Thus, from the very outset, conceptual ascriptions like existent or nonexistent, good or bad, and definitions in terms of productive causes and conditions (beneficial or otherwise) cannot properly be applied to them. To divide the phenomenal field into self and other, clean and unclean, and so on, is the very antithesis of the absence of attributes. For the truth is that, within the nature of emptiness, the dharmadhatu, the domain of nonconceptual primordial wisdom, phenomena do not exist in this way.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Absence of expectancy [wishlessness] is defined as \u2018absence of suffering and ignorance.\u2019 The phenomena included within the categories of true sufferings and true origins (\u2018true sufferings&amp;#39; means the universe and its inhabitants, and their \u2018true origins&amp;#39; means karma and defilement born of ignorance) have never existed [as such]. Therefore they are no different from \u2018nirvana,&amp;#39; the state beyond suffering.

Emptiness refers to the ground because it lies beyond the extreme ontological positions of existence and nonexistence. Absence of attributes refers to the path because, even at the present moment, phenomena are without real existence. Absence of expectancy refers to the result, because no hope or reliance is placed in the future.
