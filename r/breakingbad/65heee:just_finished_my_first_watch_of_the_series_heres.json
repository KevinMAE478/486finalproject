Admired him even when I *knew* he was being prideful and murderous. But at every stage in his journey, I always knew what he *was*.\n\n\"Good\" and \"bad\" don't do it justice. He was a man that loved his family. A man who did evil and allowed evil to be done. A generous and indulgent father, and a bad liar. A brilliant chemist, and a tragically incompetent drug kingpin. \n\n&gt; *God/the universe had a mission for him, and he found the strength to answer the call. He was essentially doing 'Gods work' in that he was doing the job that he was assigned to do.*\n\nWas he doing God's work? Okay sure, I can agree that Walt was \"at his best\" when doing what he loved - the chemistry. Yes, in that sense I can agree there is something \"divine\" in striving for perfection and purity in the practise of ones craft. But when this pursuit is at the exclusion of other considerations, consequences happen. Therein lies the seed of Walt's tragedy, his tunnel vision. Was it strength, or ego that drove him? \n\nDid the Universe/God *really* want Walt to indirectly cause a plane crash and the deaths of over 160 people? To manipulate Jesse into murdering Gale?

A brilliant chemist, and a tragically incompetent drug kingpin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God/the universe had a mission for him, and he found the strength to answer the call.

Okay sure, I can agree that Walt was &amp;quot;at his best&amp;quot; when doing what he loved - the chemistry. Yes, in that sense I can agree there is something &amp;quot;divine&amp;quot; in striving for perfection and purity in the practise of ones craft.
