I can absolutely help you here. What I say you might not like, but I will try to keep this as common-sense fact as possible so you can do what you will with it. \n\n\n1. Gigging musician is too broad of a term. In marketing, when you have a demographic, you have subdivisions of the demographic. This is a way of describing patterns within patterns. People are ultimately individuals, so you can't perfectly predict what they want, but you CAN narrow your \"gigging musicians\" term down into a few different categories. In marketing, this is done first with age. If you are 30, that is one of the first thing that a data collection company wants. It and female vs male are two of the easiest things to compare since it's an absolute, while everything else is this personal matter other than race and all that jazz. \n\n\n2. So what you should probably be asking yourself is how to appeal to the big ass group of people you're trying to appeal to. Remember, 18-24 might have 3 different, specific groups. In order to get 2 of them to come to your store, you might have to ditch one. Your older musicians usually will have a different financial outlook for better or worse (retirement money vs a frugal wife), and if you can start grouping the types of people that gig a little better, you can get them through the doors on THEIR terms instead of putting YOUR terms on all the musicians. \n\n\nIn order for you to appeal to \"gigging musicians\" right now, you are absolutely going to alienate what someone else locally would prefer. You're talking about customers that can pull a $1,000+ transaction for you consistently, it's ok to spend a little time on this :) Nerd out and buy a notebook and just start looking at guitar sites and what they offer, etc. Marketing data is good but you'll never pry that outta the hands of the people that have it. \"Case studies\" are your research friend :) Good luck :D  ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I&amp;#39;m a guitarist with a marketing background (kinda, it&amp;#39;s complicated). I can absolutely help you here. What I say you might not like, but I will try to keep this as common-sense fact as possible so you can do what you will with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gigging musician is too broad of a term. In marketing, when you have a demographic, you have subdivisions of the demographic. This is a way of describing patterns within patterns. People are ultimately individuals, so you can&amp;#39;t perfectly predict what they want, but you CAN narrow your &amp;quot;gigging musicians&amp;quot; term down into a few different categories. In marketing, this is done first with age. If you are 30, that is one of the first thing that a data collection company wants. It and female vs male are two of the easiest things to compare since it&amp;#39;s an absolute, while everything else is this personal matter other than race and all that jazz. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what you should probably be asking yourself is how to appeal to the big ass group of people you&amp;#39;re trying to appeal to. Remember, 18-24 might have 3 different, specific groups. In order to get 2 of them to come to your store, you might have to ditch one. Your older musicians usually will have a different financial outlook for better or worse (retirement money vs a frugal wife), and if you can start grouping the types of people that gig a little better, you can get them through the doors on THEIR terms instead of putting YOUR terms on all the musicians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order for you to appeal to &amp;quot;gigging musicians&amp;quot; right now, you are absolutely going to alienate what someone else locally would prefer. You&amp;#39;re talking about customers that can pull a $1,000+ transaction for you consistently, it&amp;#39;s ok to spend a little time on this :) Nerd out and buy a notebook and just start looking at guitar sites and what they offer, etc. Marketing data is good but you&amp;#39;ll never pry that outta the hands of the people that have it. &amp;quot;Case studies&amp;quot; are your research friend :) Good luck :D  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guitar", "name": "t1_dg7blb2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492101446.0, "created_utc": 1492072646.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64z4ti", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7gtc4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lilloller", "parent_id": "t3_64z4ti", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guitar", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fret Wraps/ pick holders (something they can stick on guitar or mic stand etc) / rag for wiping down strings - guitar after show / string - fretboard cleaner / stickers / coupons and shirts / u can get custom sweatbands like for wrist etc, made for pretty cheap (look on amazon).
