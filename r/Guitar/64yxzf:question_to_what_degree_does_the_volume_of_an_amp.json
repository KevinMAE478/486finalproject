I will tell you that having the headroom of a larger amp is relieving, but if it sounds the same at a lower volume will totally depend on you and your tone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also my opinion that there&amp;#39;s some showmanship involved in this decision. Having a good sized combo amp on the stage looks cooler than having lets say, a 15w Blues Jr mic&amp;#39;d up in the corner.
