I suspect it's partly because you only have to add a note to the triad to get a sixth chord, whereas other inversions of the Em7 would require you to subtract notes from the triad if you changed the root. For example, Em7/B does not contain all the notes of the Bm triad (B, D F#) so it doesn't make sense to think of it as an extension or variation of B, and Em7/D does not contain all the notes of the D triad (D, F#, A), so it doesn't make sense to think of it as an extension or variation of D either.\n\nFor that reason, adding the 6th on top of the triad sounds nice, so it's useful to think of it as a variation of the \"basic\" G chord. It also doesn't change the sound of the chord very much, whereas if you tried playing Em7/B as a variation of a B minor triad it would sound quite a bit different.\n\nFor example, it's pretty common for blues guitarists to play something like:\n\nG G6 G G6\n\nwhen playing rhythm, but it's not very common to hear someone play:\n\nBm Em7/B  Bm Em7/B\n\nSo as with a lot of things in music theory, I suspect it comes down to convention.

If you came across this playing in C major it&amp;#39;s the Fourth chord because it&amp;#39;s built from the Fourth, Sixth, and Root notes in the C major scale (CDEFGABC). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because all major scales follow the same interval pattern (whole step whole step half step whole step whole step whole step half step) chords within a key have a pattern too. Major minor minor Major Major minor diminished.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how the Nashville Number System works btw; assigning numbers to chords based on their root note&amp;#39;s place in the scale. That way you can transpose on the fly (as long as you know your scales well enough to quickly identify which note is where in the scale). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that wasn&amp;#39;t more than you wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guitar", "name": "t1_dg751dh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492086326.0, "created_utc": 1492057526.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6km95", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "timthetollman", "parent_id": "t3_64w8bg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guitar", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Chords are just the root, 3rd and 5th of a scale aren't they?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chords are just the root, 3rd and 5th of a scale aren&amp;#39;t they?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guitar", "name": "t1_dg6km95", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492060391.0, "created_utc": 1492031591.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64w8bg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6rvmc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ilovestinkybutts", "parent_id": "t3_64w8bg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guitar", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Every chord in western structure is built off thirds.
