The albums *40oz. to Freedom*, *Robin' the Hood* are amazing and were well ahead of their time in terms of the musical fusion they employ. For even more insight into the incredibly wide ranging amount of diverse influences in their music, be sure to download \"Rewind Selector\", which is a series of albums that document and highlight all of the original songs and influences that the band drew from and incorporated into their own music. It's edited in an incredibly entertaining fashion that merges the original versions of the songs they borrowed from and seamlessly merges them with the band's own renditions. The sheer breadth and depth of their musical influences is stunning and deeply entertaining. Bradley's solo acoustic album \"Live at the Firecracker Lounge\" is also amazing and highlights his raw talent and purity as a singer/songwriter. \n\nThe irony that their greatest success coincided with the loss of Brad is the stuff of tragic legend. The fact that they were most active at the same time as Grunge bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam also worked against their achieving the amount of success and exposure they deserve, but they have managed to stay relevant and serve as an inspiration to others while many other bands from this era have faded into obscurity. \n\nWhile Brad's loss can never truly be made up for, there are several Sublime-related projects well worth checking out including the Long Beach Dub All-Stars, Second Hand Smoke (a tribute to Sublime by various artists) and the latest incarnation of the band Sublime with Rome. The music lives on in Bradley's son Jakob Nowell's band Law, as well. \n\nIf you're a fan of raw power, enthusiasm and melodic mastery, you owe it to yourself to listen to as much Sublime as possible.
