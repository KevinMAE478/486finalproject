They told me it would be there about a week after I ordered, so I went over to try out some guitars and make sure I liked them. I got back to my place and called them up about it again, ready to place my order for the HP when I was told that they were now backordered until mid-March, same as Sweetwater or GC. \n\nOnce I was told that, I started looking at the traditionals. I was looking at the ones on Sweetwater, Zzounds, Guitar Center, and Wildwood, but all the ones at that time (early Feb) were looking really purple (which I don't like). Within 3 days of me starting to look at the T's, even with the more purple finishes, they were sold out (besides a couple at Wildwood that I didn't want because of how purple they are). It looked like it was going to be March before I even got my hands on a traditional. \n\nThen I get a call from Wildwood that they had another guitar come in and they thought I would like how it looked. I checked the pictures on their website and liked it, but thought it was a little odd that some pictures made it look like there was massive flame and others made it look like a plain top on the left half. Went in, played the guitar, and was pleasantly surprised by the top so I bought it. It turns out the flame on the top actually changes from dark to light stripes depending on the angle and they just had one picture that caught it in between light and dark. The effect of it looks really cool to me in person.\n\nI had the guitar and was playing it for a little bit when I heard rumor that they were moving up the production and shipping of Blueberry Burst HP's because of demand, so I went and called to see if it would be possible to return the traditional I had and go for the HP. I got a call back an hour or two later: the rumors were unfounded, and by then they were backordered until late April.\n\nI stuck with my traditional and have been happy with it. I may consider selling it in the fall to order an HP if I feel the need, but after playing for a while I'm leaning towards just purchasing the g-force tuners and installing them myself since that was the big reason I wanted the HP (I liked the heel joint too, but I'm alright with the standard one). I'm happy with what I have, since the finish has [just the right amount of blue for me (pics)](http://imgur.com/a/ogoQG).", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, I had something a little bit similar when I was getting my guitar back in February. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I first checked online and saw late March as the delivery date for any of the Blueberry Burst HP&amp;#39;s from a major retailer, which was disappointing so I called up a local shop (Wildwood Guitars) to see if they could get one any sooner. They told me it would be there about a week after I ordered, so I went over to try out some guitars and make sure I liked them. I got back to my place and called them up about it again, ready to place my order for the HP when I was told that they were now backordered until mid-March, same as Sweetwater or GC. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I was told that, I started looking at the traditionals. I was looking at the ones on Sweetwater, Zzounds, Guitar Center, and Wildwood, but all the ones at that time (early Feb) were looking really purple (which I don&amp;#39;t like). Within 3 days of me starting to look at the T&amp;#39;s, even with the more purple finishes, they were sold out (besides a couple at Wildwood that I didn&amp;#39;t want because of how purple they are). It looked like it was going to be March before I even got my hands on a traditional. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I get a call from Wildwood that they had another guitar come in and they thought I would like how it looked. I checked the pictures on their website and liked it, but thought it was a little odd that some pictures made it look like there was massive flame and others made it look like a plain top on the left half. Went in, played the guitar, and was pleasantly surprised by the top so I bought it. It turns out the flame on the top actually changes from dark to light stripes depending on the angle and they just had one picture that caught it in between light and dark. The effect of it looks really cool to me in person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the guitar and was playing it for a little bit when I heard rumor that they were moving up the production and shipping of Blueberry Burst HP&amp;#39;s because of demand, so I went and called to see if it would be possible to return the traditional I had and go for the HP. I got a call back an hour or two later: the rumors were unfounded, and by then they were backordered until late April.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stuck with my traditional and have been happy with it. I may consider selling it in the fall to order an HP if I feel the need, but after playing for a while I&amp;#39;m leaning towards just purchasing the g-force tuners and installing them myself since that was the big reason I wanted the HP (I liked the heel joint too, but I&amp;#39;m alright with the standard one).
