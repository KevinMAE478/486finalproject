I honestly think the best technique is to listen to ,music with patterns you want to learn, and try to copy it over and over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone can say down down up down up down down.  But once you learn THAT pattern, you&amp;#39;re back to square one for the next one.  By trying to train your ear and rhythm clock to be able to interpret sounds into strums, you&amp;#39;re basically teaching yourself an approach to use for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but it takes time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guitar", "name": "t1_dg51sfp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491979119.0, "created_utc": 1491950319.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64s18t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg578iy", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bodeanicus", "parent_id": "t3_64s18t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guitar", "controversiality": 0, "body": "By playing along.
