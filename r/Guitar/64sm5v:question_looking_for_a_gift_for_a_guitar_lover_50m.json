There&amp;#39;s a lot of great pedals that can be found on craigslist for around 60 bucks. Really depends what he has already but some cool pedals to check out are a ditto looper (thats even like $100 new), boss bd-2 (very versatile) or ibanez tubescreamer, boss ds-1 (a classic), a big muff, dunlop crybaby wah, or even a polytuner 2 pedal. Pretty key stuff to have on any pedalboard and definitely a gift I&amp;#39;d enjoy receiving. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guitar", "name": "t1_dg4qwu6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491966522.0, "created_utc": 1491937722.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sm5v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sm5v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sm5v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64sm5v", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg52es4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MajorLongBridge", "parent_id": "t1_dg51yt9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guitar", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Trust me.
