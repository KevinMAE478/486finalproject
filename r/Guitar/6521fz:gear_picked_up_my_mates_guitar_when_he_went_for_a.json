Only sometimes are they amazing individually (because i&amp;#39;m not amazing), but meshed together, they sound awesome!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guitar", "name": "t1_dg7hii3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492116195.0, "created_utc": 1492087395.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7g4gr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RouSGeLi", "parent_id": "t3_6521fz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guitar", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Which one do you play the most?\n\nWhich feels the best to play?\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which one do you play the most?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which feels the best to play?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guitar", "name": "t1_dg7g4gr", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492113755.0, "created_utc": 1492084955.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6521fz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7phmt", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "the_frey", "parent_id": "t3_6521fz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guitar", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Getting pedals is a bit of a broad thing to say unless you know what sounds you want to make!\n\nThat said, get a delay, a whammy and a fuzz and you will have a great time.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting pedals is a bit of a broad thing to say unless you know what sounds you want to make!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, get a delay, a whammy and a fuzz and you will have a great time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guitar", "name": "t1_dg7phmt", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492126190.0, "created_utc": 1492097390.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6521fz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6521fz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6521fz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6521fz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6521fz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6521fz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg81dbm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JackSparrow420", "parent_id": "t1_dg7wi8v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guitar", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Yeah i'm only 18 so i can sit and play for a whole day or until the tips of my finger are ripped off, then i keep going haha\n\nI miss those days!
