I bargain shop for guitars, never paying more for a guitar than I can flip it for. That said, my more expensive guitars are easily my favorites. They're higher quality guitars, they feel better, they sound better, and I play them longer. Plus, they'll last virtually forever because they are professional grade instruments made to take years of abuse. That last point is one that is often overlooked.\n\nFor instance, I shunned Paul Reed Smith forever because of the price tag. I laughed at people spending big money on relics. Today, my two favorite guitars that I own are a PRS Core Custom 24, and a Fender Limited Edition Custom Shop '56 Heavy Relic. These are very expensive guitars that I got well below market by wheeling and dealing. Everything about these guitars is dramatically better than a $600 guitar. I play the hell out of the PRS it's so playable, just ridiculously playable and it doesn't want to be put down. Can I say the same thing of a really good quality SE? Nope.... I've owned those too. Same with comparing a AVRI '52 tele vs. Standards, etc. \n\nNow, expensive guitars don't make poor players good players. They don't suddenly make your technique better, and with amps and pedals they may not really be all that distinguishable from a tone perspective, but they are much better guitars.\n\nLastly, I'm a person that says \"there is no such thing as a beginner guitar\" There are simply guitars you can afford, and guitars you can't. Generally speaking, you should buy as much guitar as you can afford as long as you buy it used, or manage to get 25% or better off at retail (which can easily be done if you play the game right). This way, you can sell the guitar without losing money if it doesn't work out. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I partially disagree with you - which I guess isn&amp;#39;t surprising in an &amp;quot;unpopular gear&amp;quot; post. I bargain shop for guitars, never paying more for a guitar than I can flip it for. That said, my more expensive guitars are easily my favorites. They&amp;#39;re higher quality guitars, they feel better, they sound better, and I play them longer. Plus, they&amp;#39;ll last virtually forever because they are professional grade instruments made to take years of abuse. That last point is one that is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, I shunned Paul Reed Smith forever because of the price tag. I laughed at people spending big money on relics. Today, my two favorite guitars that I own are a PRS Core Custom 24, and a Fender Limited Edition Custom Shop &amp;#39;56 Heavy Relic. These are very expensive guitars that I got well below market by wheeling and dealing. Everything about these guitars is dramatically better than a $600 guitar. I play the hell out of the PRS it&amp;#39;s so playable, just ridiculously playable and it doesn&amp;#39;t want to be put down. Can I say the same thing of a really good quality SE? Nope.... I&amp;#39;ve owned those too. Same with comparing a AVRI &amp;#39;52 tele vs. Standards, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, expensive guitars don&amp;#39;t make poor players good players. They don&amp;#39;t suddenly make your technique better, and with amps and pedals they may not really be all that distinguishable from a tone perspective, but they are much better guitars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I&amp;#39;m a person that says &amp;quot;there is no such thing as a beginner guitar&amp;quot; There are simply guitars you can afford, and guitars you can&amp;#39;t. Generally speaking, you should buy as much guitar as you can afford as long as you buy it used, or manage to get 25% or better off at retail (which can easily be done if you play the game right). This way, you can sell the guitar without losing money if it doesn&amp;#39;t work out. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guitar", "name": "t1_dganwsh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492293266.0, "created_utc": 1492264466.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hjoa", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hjoa", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hjoa", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65hjoa", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgazocr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "onioning", "parent_id": "t1_dgawpou", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guitar", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm not saying there isn't a world of difference, but the difference between a $500 and a $50 guitar is \"I can play this\" or \"Shit, what the fuck?\" It's not that better isn't better, but just for dollars invested and whatnot, I think that point that the return starts dimishing comes much earlier, it's just gradual and slow, and doesn't really become offensive for some time. \n\nA decent acoustic is far more expensive than a decent electric, but you can get a decent acoustic for less than that, and it's really once you pass decent that the returns start to diminish.
