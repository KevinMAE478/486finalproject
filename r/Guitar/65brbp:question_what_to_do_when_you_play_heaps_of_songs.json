What happens sometimes is that the \"open strings\" make the chord sound GREAT as-is in open B, but when you play it in standard you might have some open strings that *don't\" sound great. So what we did with that one was, after finding where the main notes would go in standard, we slid the whole chord up 2 frets so that we could open up the high E string for a better sounding chord. \n\nOnce you do something like this, you have to move the entire key of the song up 2 frets - which is what \"transposing\" actually means - it means moving a song from one key to another key, by shifting all of your chords in the same direction by the same amount. And that sounds like a nightmare, but it's actually not so bad. All your A's become Bs, C's become D's, E's become F#'s, and they retain any major/minor/aug/7th/2nd/whatever else when they make that transition. Don't like what happens when you move it up 2? Fine. Take it down 2. Or up 3, or down 1, or up 6. Play around with alternate keys for songs until you find something that you think sounds good.\n\nAs far as \"how to learn it\" - practice!

Muting the high E here leaves that sus2 with a little more room to breathe, but your mileage may vary.

The idea behind any \"open\" guitar tuning is that every string is tuned to the 1st, 3rd, or 5th of a major (unless otherwise noted) triad. There may be many ways to achieve this - the strings don't have to be tuned in the order of the triad's voicing. For example, open C tuning is typically tuned C-G-C-G-C-E, which is a voicing of the Cmaj triad C-E-G. You hear this Cmaj chord when all strings are strummed \"open\" - meaning no fingers on the frets at all, hence \"open C\". As far as I have ever been taught and understood, \"open C tuning\" does NOT mean \"this tuning is explicitly in the key of C\".   \"Open [whatever]\" tunings refer to the triad, and not the scale, if that makes sense.\n\nSo while the open C tuning does happen to be typically played in the key of C major, I have never heard of any rule regarding \"[some tuning] is in the key of [some key]\", and I highly doubt that there is one. There is really nothing inherent to an open [whatever note] tuning that says I can't play in [some other whatever] key. Open tunings *do* have a strong bias towards the root, dominant and subdominant keys of the [whatever] triad. For example, if I was tuned to open C as above, it would be easy to play in F and G because all the notes in the Cmaj triad are also in the F and G major scales, and would be easily accessible. However it would be a royal pain the ass to play in, say, F# or B because the interval between C and G is 7 half-steps, my ideal root is off the board completely, sitting exactly 1 half-step below the lowest part of the range, my other root is up on the 6th fret, and most of my open strings are a half-step dissonant to the triads in F# in B which means any open string is gonna sound fucking awful. Kill me. The fret distance between strings is pretty inconsistent too. In terms of half steps between strings, which determines the amount of reaching you have to do in order to perform basic shit like scales, open C has distances of 7-5-7-5-4 which just kinda blows. (Sorry I know this is convoluted via text)\n\nOn the other hand, standard tuning is specifically designed to be balanced so that the fret distance between strings is 5-5-5-4-5. It's built so that you can play in most keys just as easily as any other key. Guitar novices tend to avoid the keys of Bb and F, because their barre chords take a bit more finger strength, but that's a minor inconvenience by comparison. It because of it's even spacing and manageable fret distance between strings,  if you just give me 6 notes, I will *probably* be able to find a way to play all 6 of those notes at once in *some voicing*. I might have to shift an octave here or there, but I'll make it happen as long as you don't get cheeky and tell me to play 6 Eb's or something. That's the beauty of standard tuning: If I put my left hand on any fret, I have 2 full octaves at my disposal *without even moving my hand up the neck*, and without having to reach any of my fingers more than 4 frets.\n", "edited": 1492237746.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;, but it&amp;#39;s kinda in Cmajor.

For example, open C tuning is typically tuned C-G-C-G-C-E, which is a voicing of the Cmaj triad C-E-G. You hear this Cmaj chord when all strings are strummed &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; - meaning no fingers on the frets at all, hence &amp;quot;open C&amp;quot;. As far as I have ever been taught and understood, &amp;quot;open C tuning&amp;quot; does NOT mean &amp;quot;this tuning is explicitly in the key of C&amp;quot;.   &amp;quot;Open [whatever]&amp;quot; tunings refer to the triad, and not the scale, if that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while the open C tuning does happen to be typically played in the key of C major, I have never heard of any rule regarding &amp;quot;[some tuning] is in the key of [some key]&amp;quot;, and I highly doubt that there is one. There is really nothing inherent to an open [whatever note] tuning that says I can&amp;#39;t play in [some other whatever] key. Open tunings &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a strong bias towards the root, dominant and subdominant keys of the [whatever] triad. For example, if I was tuned to open C as above, it would be easy to play in F and G because all the notes in the Cmaj triad are also in the F and G major scales, and would be easily accessible. However it would be a royal pain the ass to play in, say, F# or B because the interval between C and G is 7 half-steps, my ideal root is off the board completely, sitting exactly 1 half-step below the lowest part of the range, my other root is up on the 6th fret, and most of my open strings are a half-step dissonant to the triads in F# in B which means any open string is gonna sound fucking awful. Kill me. The fret distance between strings is pretty inconsistent too. In terms of half steps between strings, which determines the amount of reaching you have to do in order to perform basic shit like scales, open C has distances of 7-5-7-5-4 which just kinda blows. (Sorry I know this is convoluted via text)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, standard tuning is specifically designed to be balanced so that the fret distance between strings is 5-5-5-4-5. It&amp;#39;s built so that you can play in most keys just as easily as any other key. Guitar novices tend to avoid the keys of Bb and F, because their barre chords take a bit more finger strength, but that&amp;#39;s a minor inconvenience by comparison. It because of it&amp;#39;s even spacing and manageable fret distance between strings,  if you just give me 6 notes, I will &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; be able to find a way to play all 6 of those notes at once in &lt;em&gt;some voicing&lt;/em&gt;. I might have to shift an octave here or there, but I&amp;#39;ll make it happen as long as you don&amp;#39;t get cheeky and tell me to play 6 Eb&amp;#39;s or something. That&amp;#39;s the beauty of standard tuning: If I put my left hand on any fret, I have 2 full octaves at my disposal &lt;em&gt;without even moving my hand up the neck&lt;/em&gt;, and without having to reach any of my fingers more than 4 frets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Guitar", "name": "t1_dga32ck", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492248606.0, "created_utc": 1492219806.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi79", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65brbp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dga0n9r", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "5redrb", "parent_id": "t1_dg9yc1m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guitar", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would transpose the song to the key that fits my guitar tuning.
