You should have to put in effort, it should be a little bit of a workout to get going, but you shouldn't be \"straining\" yourself.

This gets worn down after showers, work with other fluids, etc. You want dry hands, don't play after showers, don't play with wet hands. That can even strip the material altogether and leave you waiting for it to reform. \n\n\n* Your left hand is \"choppy\" because you don't possess the combination of finger strength and hardened skin-layer to play them consistently.

I used to do this in the morning all the time and I think my calluses have been premium since then. They don't tear or crack, they are hardly visible and they don't ever feel dry or flakey. Calluses are growths that respond to heat or friction. Careful, don't be a dumbass and burn the shit out of yourself with fluid that's way too hot, if the shit hurts stop it dammit. You want to hold it there until the heat starts to get uncomfortable, back off and use a different finger. Roll it around so you get the side coverage of your finger too, that's useful for advanced play, but it will come in handy within the week. I can personally promise that you will recognize the difference after a single hot cup, maybe a grand total of 1-2 minutes held on every finger. If you start to feel the burn, take your finger off and let it cool a bit, switch to another finger and just get a minute or so on every finger. It should not hurt that bad, if it hurts bad you're a dumbass for not listening to your body, take that lesson with you for a few years. About an hour from the time doing this, you will notice this \"airy\" feel to your fingertips, almost like there's something there that's foreign. That is fresh callus, it will be more solidified over time, and it gets deeper if you heat it while it's still a little freshly developing. It shouldn't take more than a week or so of doing this to get them nice, I don't do this often anymore and I'm way ahead of the pack in terms of stamina (I can consistently practice indefinitely, my hand muscles are done long before my fingertips unless I'm really pushing it.) \n\n\n* You can put a little tiny touch of oil on your strings (don't use too much, terrible for your frets, ideally keep the oil on outward-facing part of the strings and not any on the side facing the fretboard).

It slows the rate that you develop calluses, but it definitely adds a small percentage to your total practice time in the early stages. And hey, if you can practice 10 extra minutes a day, you're 3,650 minutes ahead of yourself by the end of the year.
