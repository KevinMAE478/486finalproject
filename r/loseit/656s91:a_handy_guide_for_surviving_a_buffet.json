But the good news is, you don&amp;#39;t have to avoid them.  Part of this sub is re-learning how to feed ourselves, for the rest of our lives.  So on that note, here are some helpful tips to get you through those super stressful buffets that will occasionally pop up on your social calendar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat before you go.  If you&amp;#39;re a control freak, then you let your freak flag fly!  Eat your normally portioned meal and log it. Bring a Nalgene or other bottle of water or tea and sip while everyone else is eating.  You don&amp;#39;t owe it to anyone to indulge in a high calorie buffet.  Obviously this works for weddings, birthday parties, or other special occasion gatherings, not so much at Thanksgiving or other &amp;quot;eating&amp;quot; holidays.   Still.  No one can force you to eat.  If you&amp;#39;re not comfortable eating food you didn&amp;#39;t prepare and can&amp;#39;t accurately log, eat first.  No one wants to be that guy/gal having a panic attack staring at chafing dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat.  I know this sounds counter-intuitive, but one day cannot and will not make or break your weight loss.  Unless you eat 4000 calories or more, the most you&amp;#39;ll do is gain 1 lb.  You&amp;#39;ll set your progress back by 1 or 2 weeks.  Forgive yourself, but understand that special occasions arise in life, and enjoying yourself with reckless abandon is perfectly normal in moderation.  If you can handle cutting loose for a day, and then getting right back on track tomorrow, then don&amp;#39;t beat yourself up over a special occasion meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re going with choice #1, you can increase your daily deficit on the 4 days leading up to the buffet and 4 days after by 100 or more calories each, effectively giving you an 800-1000 calorie buffer to go over your calories and still keep your progress relatively intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to be good (and you can!) there are a few veteran buffet tricks you can deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;grab the smallest plate available.  Most buffets will have salad plates/bowls, large dinner plates, and smaller appetizer/dessert plates available at the various stations.  I always grab the smallest plate.  Helps keep the temptation to &amp;quot;load up&amp;quot; at bay.  Since plate space is at a minimum, you&amp;#39;ll grab smaller portions of everything naturally, and skip things you don&amp;#39;t really want because you don&amp;#39;t have room for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat a salad or plate of veggies first.  Load a plate with salad or fresh vegetables and then SIT BACK DOWN.  Enjoy your healthy plate first and wait 10 full minutes before returning to the buffet.  Use the same small salad plate and take smaller entr\u00e9e portions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the hand ruler.  A portion for a good cut of lean meat should be the size of your fist.  Don&amp;#39;t take more than that.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the 50/25/25 method if you are only having one plate.  50% veggies, 25% starch/carbs and %25 meat/fish/protein.  Mess with the carb/protein ratio at your leisure, but your buffet plate should always be 50% vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t eat the rolls/bread on the table.  IT&amp;#39;S A TRAP.  Both filling and calorie dense, these should be avoided at any buffet.  Save your precious calories for the mains.  No one ever returns from a wedding saying &amp;quot;OMG that dinner roll!  EXQUISITE.&amp;quot;  Skip it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one said you can&amp;#39;t bring your pocket scale!  Weigh your food and log it.  You might get one or two odd looks and maybe one genuine question, but this is your health.  Awkwardness takes a backseat to your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the labels on the buffet stations.  With allergies the way they are today, 90% of buffet style meals are required to list their ingredients on the placard.  Pass on the cream sauces and pasta dishes.  Same for any dishes containing oils, butter, sauces, and any other high calorie fillers.  Think before grabbing that spoonful.  Look for keywords like:  &lt;em&gt;Baked&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Steamed&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;Pan Seared&lt;/em&gt;,  or &lt;em&gt;Broiled&lt;/em&gt; and avoid &lt;em&gt;Fried&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Saut\u00e9ed&lt;/em&gt; as these have high oil contents due to cooking method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skip dessert if you can, and if you absolutely must, bring your knife with you and cut an existing portion in half or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;USE YOUR JUDGEMENT.  You know by now what foods you should be eating.  If you want to try those fried scallops in lemon butter, then try ONE and then grab some extra steamed veggies.  If you must have a piece of Tiramisu or Peanut Butter Ice Cream Cake, then have half a piece at most.  Try to wait 10 minutes between courses to really let the food settle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all else, HAVE FUN.  Special occasions are just that:  Special.  No one wants to be a nervous wreck at a party, so if trying to control yourself at a buffet is going to stress you out, then just understand that one day won&amp;#39;t ultimately hurt you, and relax and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Post your tips/tricks in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Good Morning!\n\nI've seen this post here many, many times:\n\n&gt;I'm going to a (insert meal/occasion) buffet on X date, how do I survive?\n\nBuffets are a natural part of life (at least in America) and cannot be avoided forever.

The first few days the scale was a few pounds up due to the water retention that also came with the increased food consumption, but after a few days it all leveled off and by the next &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; weigh in (I weigh myself daily but only track the Saturday weigh in) I was down a pound for the week despite the birthday dinner. I typically lose 2 pounds a week, so i still lost and it only cost me one pound. It was definitely worth it for a one off.
