I was lazing around at home like I usually do, but I wanted to go out and do something. So I just up and decided to go to the mall to see if I could get some cheapo clearance clothes. Kohls is a great place for that, and my mother taught me how to clearance shop, so that&amp;#39;s what I did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At my largest, I wore a size 44 waist and XXX Large shirt. I recently have been wearing 40&amp;#39;s and even own a couple 38&amp;#39;s that I fit into. I had tried on 36&amp;#39;s before, and back then there was NO way my fat ass was gonna fit in those. Today, however, the stars aligned and a miracle was born. I picked out a 36 waist just to see how close I was to wearing them, or just for shits and giggles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine my surprise when they actually fit?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only did I pick up a pretty nice pair of jeans at an 80% discount, they actually fit me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought that my luck had run out for the day, but I thought I&amp;#39;d check around for some shirts as well, just to see what I could fit into comfortably. I tried one of the brands that was on sale that day, seeing if I could squeeze into a large, but today wasn&amp;#39;t the day for that. Maybe in another 20 pounds. BUT, my shopping wasn&amp;#39;t over, so I grabbed the XL and went to the fitting room and slid it over my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing I felt was disappointment, because I really loved the shirt, but it was a V-Neck. i don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m the only one that feels this way, but I could not for the life of me wear V-Necks at my largest, I felt like everyone was just looking at me. Not today though, because I took another look at myself in the mirror and said &amp;quot;You know what? I look good in this V-Neck. I&amp;#39;m gonna buy it. I don&amp;#39;t care if people look because I feel like I look great.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: I have never owned a V-Neck prior to this because I was always ashamed to wear them. Today, however, was a big eye opener in all the progress I have made, and damn if it doesn&amp;#39;t give me even more motivation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope your journey can bring you happiness as it has so far for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey everyone, I just had an awesome day today.
