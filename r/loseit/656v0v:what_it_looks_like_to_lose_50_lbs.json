I take progress pics every 10 lbs, but I usually just compare them to my starting photos. This time, I realized that I actually have six sets of progress pictures now and I figured it might be interesting to see what the full progression of my weight loss looked liked. So I did my best to line them up and the results were really interesting: &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/XayrW\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/XayrW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing that really struck me is that the changes with any individual 10 lbs loss really aren&amp;#39;t that dramatic. Sure, if I scrutinize the photo close enough I see little improvements, but it&amp;#39;s not that noticeable. But when you put it all together (i.e., when you cover up the middle pictures and just look at the first and last one), it adds up to a pretty striking change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of posts on this sub about people being frustrated about putting in so much effort and not seeing results. I&amp;#39;ve definitely felt that way, too, at times. It&amp;#39;s just important to keep in mind that weight loss really is a gradual process. Your body changes in subtle ways as you lose weight and it can be hard to notice that as it&amp;#39;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My other big takeaway from looking at these photos is that the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/sq7x8/paper_towel_theory/\"&gt;paper towel theory&lt;/a&gt; is totally real. Especially when I&amp;#39;m looking at the photos of me from the front, it&amp;#39;s so much easier to spot the changes from 146.5 lbs to 136.5 lbs than it is to see them from 186.5 lbs to 176.5 lbs. The side ones are a bit complicated by the fact that my belly was the last place I put on weight and the first place I lost it, but even in those photos I think the changes (especially to my arms and legs) are more noticeable as I get closer to my goal weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this also really underscores the importance of taking progress pictures at the start of your journey. I know it can be emotionally tough to have to confront what you look like when you&amp;#39;re not that happy with you&amp;#39;re appearance. I remember feeling really upset and disappointed with myself after taking my first set of pictures. But I&amp;#39;m so grateful that past-me worked through the discomfort and took those photos. Without them, I think I would have a really hard time appreciating how much my body has changed. They have been a great source of motivation throughout this journey. I still have another 10 lbs to go before I hit my goal weight and looking at these photos really gets me fired up to keep at it. And I hope that once I hit maintenance, I&amp;#39;ll be able to look back on this series of photos as a reminder of all the work I put in and why it&amp;#39;s so important to stay vigilant about maintaining my weight at a healthy level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For anyone out there who is just starting out or is in that tough stretch where you haven&amp;#39;t really started noticing visible changes yet, I just want to say: you can do this. Weight loss really is just calories in &amp;lt; calories out. If you can commit to counting your calories accurately and honestly and consistently hitting your daily calorie goals, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; lose weight. And if you stick with it for long enough, those little changes that you either don&amp;#39;t notice or don&amp;#39;t think matter that much will add up to a big transformation.

I did run into a bit of a plateau when I added in some light resistance training, but that was just for a couple weeks and I think the gains in how I look and feel are worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg81baw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492138779.0, "created_utc": 1492109979.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656v0v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656v0v", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_656v0v", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9clpr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "crayolakitty", "parent_id": "t1_dg9cdgu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm the same way, I have to force myself to workout lol.

What are your go to favorite snacks?\n\nI stick pretty consistently to 1200 calories a day. There are a few things I've discovered about what helps me hit 1200 calories consistently while feeling full. First, I do best when I have lots of protein and fat in my diet and not much in the way of simple carbs. In terms of timing, I try not to eat breakfast too early in the day and I do best if I can have small meals or snacks every few hours.\n\nMy diet is pretty consistent during the day -- I pretty much always have a greek yogurt around 10:30 am (100 to 150 calories), about 200 to 300 calories worth of deli meat and cheese for lunch, a protein bar in the afternoon (150 to 200 calories), and some beef jerky later in the afternoon if I'm having a late dinner or feeling peckish (60 to 80 calories). That leaves me with a good number of calories to play around with for dinner and evening snacks. I try to mix things up with dinner and get some veggies in -- my favorite dinner dish lately has been [shakshuka](http://imgur.com/a/hUVcf). I'm not a very good cook, but I'm learning and getting better at it! I also try to have a side salad at dinner. My after-dinner snacks tend to be more desert-like stuff, such as 100-calorie popcorn bags with cayenne pepper (which has been my sub for my old habit of eating flaming hot cheetos), Halo Top ice cream, and sugar-free jello. If I'm still feeling really hungry after dinner, though, I'll pick something with more protein as a snack (greek yogurt, protein bars, or jerky).\n\nI do go out to eat with friends or my boyfriend sometimes -- when that happens I just have lower calorie versions of my normal meals earlier in the day and skip some snacks if necessary.

There are a few things I&amp;#39;ve discovered about what helps me hit 1200 calories consistently while feeling full. First, I do best when I have lots of protein and fat in my diet and not much in the way of simple carbs. In terms of timing, I try not to eat breakfast too early in the day and I do best if I can have small meals or snacks every few hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My diet is pretty consistent during the day -- I pretty much always have a greek yogurt around 10:30 am (100 to 150 calories), about 200 to 300 calories worth of deli meat and cheese for lunch, a protein bar in the afternoon (150 to 200 calories), and some beef jerky later in the afternoon if I&amp;#39;m having a late dinner or feeling peckish (60 to 80 calories). That leaves me with a good number of calories to play around with for dinner and evening snacks. I try to mix things up with dinner and get some veggies in -- my favorite dinner dish lately has been &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/hUVcf\"&gt;shakshuka&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m not a very good cook, but I&amp;#39;m learning and getting better at it! I also try to have a side salad at dinner. My after-dinner snacks tend to be more desert-like stuff, such as 100-calorie popcorn bags with cayenne pepper (which has been my sub for my old habit of eating flaming hot cheetos), Halo Top ice cream, and sugar-free jello. If I&amp;#39;m still feeling really hungry after dinner, though, I&amp;#39;ll pick something with more protein as a snack (greek yogurt, protein bars, or jerky).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do go out to eat with friends or my boyfriend sometimes -- when that happens I just have lower calorie versions of my normal meals earlier in the day and skip some snacks if necessary. I also try to look at the menu for where we&amp;#39;re going ahead of time to pick out something that will work with my calorie budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg90bsj", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492196602.0, "created_utc": 1492167802.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8us7f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "VodkaActually-", "parent_id": "t3_656v0v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm so happy for you!
