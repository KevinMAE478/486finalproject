It all starts with taking care of your depression. Talking to a psychiatrist can do a world of good. Since I&amp;#39;ve began to take care of everything my binge eating has gone and I&amp;#39;m down 10 pounds. I&amp;#39;m not scared to go to the gym anymore and I&amp;#39;m feeling better all the way around.

But the past year or two it has gotten pretty severe - to the point where I was no longer functioning properly and ended up taking a 5 week leave of absence from work.

All of a sudden I realized \"hey, today didn't suck.

I know they don't work for everyone, but for me they have been a life saver. But meds aren't the only thing. I've also made a very concentrated effort to change my lifestyle and the bad habits that contributed to my depression. I started out by making a couple of lists: 1.) bad habits I wanted to quit 2.) good habits I wanted to adopt 3.) [reasons I wanted to get healthy](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/60jra7/why_are_you_trying_to_lose_weight/df6yu7m/) - both mentally and physically 4.) a detailed bucket list of all the awesome things I want to do and accomplish in all aspects of my life. The lists gave me direction, motivation, and hope for the future. I started by taking my list of habits and tackling them one at a time. The first thing I did was cut out soda, juice, lattes, energy drinks, and all other high calories beverages. I focused on drinking more water and unsweetened tea. Second I made an effort to pack a lunch for work the night before. I tackled my bad habit list one at a time (getting more sleep, not eating out as much, etc.). I did not put ANY pressure on myself to loose weight (although I did lose my first 15 lbs during this time). I did not count calories. I just focused on changing bad behaviors. It's been about six months since I started and today I am on a 1500 calorie diet, walking at least 40 minutes a day, I've lost 35 lbs, and I am happier and healthier than I have been in YEARS. I still have a long way to go in my weight loss, but I am doing it and I am not going to quit. I feel like if I had attempted to change my whole life and all of my habits all at once I would have gotten overwhelmed and given up. As it is, when I finally got around to counting calories the transition was pretty painless because I had already changed my lifestyle. My new mantra is: You only fail if you quit.
