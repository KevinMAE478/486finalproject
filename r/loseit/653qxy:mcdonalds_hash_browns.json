But I usually give the benefit of the doubt.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently joined what I guess you&amp;#39;d call a weight loss support group - it&amp;#39;s through the gym I already go to twice a week.  Our coach basically told us &amp;quot;you have to earn your cheat meals&amp;quot;.  I already knew this, but it helps to hear it from someone who knows what he&amp;#39;s doing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am also choosing to believe that the people replying to you aren&amp;#39;t espousing an all-fast food diet.  FWIW I somewhat agree with you - while CICO is ultimately important, you need to also make sure you&amp;#39;re eating nutritiously.  Where I disagree with your initial reply was where you seem to imply there&amp;#39;s absolutely no place for fast food, ever.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit to add: I also appreciate that you seem to be replying mostly courteously and not resorting to name calling.  The latter happens all too much on reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg7t0et", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492129935.0, "created_utc": 1492101135.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7rehi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg7rado", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg7rehi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492128226.0, "created_utc": 1492099426.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7rado", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "broomlad", "parent_id": "t1_dg7ex8u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There's room for fast food in any diet.
