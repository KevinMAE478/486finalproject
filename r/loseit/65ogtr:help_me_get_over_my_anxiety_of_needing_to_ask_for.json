If it&amp;#39;s a huge portion, like at a chain restaurant, I&amp;#39;ve been known to cut it into thirds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frequently my hubby ends up eating the other half for me (he&amp;#39;s super slim but highly active and can eat like a horse and not gain a pound). But when he doesn&amp;#39;t, I just ask for a box. Usually I just smile and say, &amp;quot;That was delicious, can I get a box as I&amp;#39;m looking forward to having the rest for lunch tomorrow.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually feel bad when I don&amp;#39;t box up the rest, as I worry about food waste. But sometimes I don&amp;#39;t bother if the meal wasn&amp;#39;t very good. Or we are traveling and the hotel room doesn&amp;#39;t have a fridge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some restaurants will take your plate and box it for you. Others bring you a box and let you box it yourself.  I&amp;#39;ve never been to a restaurant that didn&amp;#39;t have containers, so I wouldn&amp;#39;t bother bringing your own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, portion size has become so huge, restaurants must expect that their diners can&amp;#39;t possibly eat it all. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dgc5u6p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492385918.0, "created_utc": 1492357118.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ogtr", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcmkad", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "katarh", "parent_id": "t3_65ogtr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Husband used to be a busboy in a fancy restaurant.
