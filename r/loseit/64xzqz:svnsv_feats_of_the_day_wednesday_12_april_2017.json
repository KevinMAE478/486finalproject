The menu was available, but no calorie count, except there was like a small page on each fish, with calories per 100 grams, which is the norm on processed food in Europe but doesn&amp;#39;t help you at all when you don&amp;#39;t know the weight of a portion, how they cook it, the sauce...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up making a guess when ordering, and boy was that a bad guess. When I logged it in MFP I was really scared as I was watching the calories count rise, reach the lunch budget, overtake it by a wide margin... It was my first significantly over-budget meal since I started CICO 10 days ago, and I was afraid I had ruined everything and wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to keep restricting myself after feeding the monster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully it was very satieted and thus able to have a very very light dinner, I ended up around my target calories with only my macros quite far from my goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so angry, at the restaurant for their useless info, at my grandma who insisted for the fish restaurant because the meat restaurant was too far away (there it&amp;#39;s easy, they give the weight of every peace of meat, add green veggies and you&amp;#39;re done).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve ordered a pocket scale that I can keep at the office and use when I eat out, it&amp;#39;ll relieve some worries of wildly underestimating calories.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg5tzms", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492031379.0, "created_utc": 1492002579.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xzqz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xzqz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5wu28", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "grilledcheesetruck", "parent_id": "t1_dg5tzba", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Damn, girl!
