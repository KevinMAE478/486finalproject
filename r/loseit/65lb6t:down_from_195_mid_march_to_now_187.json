Dirty bulk didn&amp;#39;t care what I was eating. went from 160lbs to almost 200. Gained alot of fat, and been hard to get it off. After trying to cut, failing miserably multiple times get demotivated ect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I think I am starting to get it under control. I am using the ECA stack, love how it gives me bit of energy while killing my appetite, Also doing intermittent fasting 16off 8 on sometimes sore or less. Seems like I am going down around 2-2.5lbs a week.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Went from 34 jeans to almost 38 (36s were feeling tight) Now my 36s are starting to feel too big for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also learned I noticed with the ECA stack and fasting when I do binge eat it&amp;#39;s not going to hit me as hard as if I was eating through out the day. Actually Had 2 pieces of pizza, can of pop and some icecream on the weekend. previous times trying to cut that binge be a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wish I had pics of before I started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the read.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey poke my head around this sub for a while, thought I would make my first post here. \n\nStarted weightlifting about 5 years ago, went off and on.
