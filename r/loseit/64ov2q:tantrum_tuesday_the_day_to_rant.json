Every ounce I lose is very hard-won at this point (oh man I hope it gets easier). I'm taking this extremely slowly in the hopes that I can form new habits that will stick, and frankly have to focus all my mental energy on just diet right now and haven't started a formal workout routine yet. I will once I get to about 210 or 200 lbs and can start walking/running again without so much pain in my joints.\n\nWell, last Weds I had a doctor appointment, a quick medication checkup. I don't know what I weighed last time I was there, it's been about a year, so maybe even having lost some I weighed more that day than I did last time I was there. My doctor started in saying that I needed to work on my weight, as he always does.

I&amp;#39;ve recently discovered that I have a lot of emotional issues with food, so I&amp;#39;m working on that as well as counting calories, and as of last Weds I was down 9 lbs and really happy about it. Every ounce I lose is very hard-won at this point (oh man I hope it gets easier). I&amp;#39;m taking this extremely slowly in the hopes that I can form new habits that will stick, and frankly have to focus all my mental energy on just diet right now and haven&amp;#39;t started a formal workout routine yet.
