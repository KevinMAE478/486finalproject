You may need to slowly lower your deficit. Try starting at 1500 or 1600 and work you way down to 1300.\nI also highly suggest upping the veggies, as well as making sure you have a balanced meal of protein, carbs, and fat to feel fuller longer.&lt;br/&gt;\nAs a mom with a toddler, the clean plate thing can be tempting, but  try and take your cues from them and stop when you are no longer hungry (not full, but not hungry).&lt;br/&gt;\nI also make sure to log my meals before hand, and only eat that much. Sometimes I may still be a little hungry, but then I will only eat a bit more veggie (if it wasn&amp;#39;t cooked with oil).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg4df09", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491951749.0, "created_utc": 1491922949.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qnvp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qnvp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qnvp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qnvp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qnvp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qnvp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5vzcf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "themdimplestho", "parent_id": "t1_dg5u9ju", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I JUST started appreciating and drinking coffee about two weeks ago.

You probably also like to wear swingy, non-clingy tops. And you are prone to people thinking you might be pregnant. \n\nClues you are an inverted triangle: you take a size larger in tops compared to your bottoms. You need the extra size to accommodate your shoulders and maybe your arms too.\n\nContrast that to a pear shape, which is exact opposite: a woman who gains first and loses last on her lower body, and probably retains a 0.7 waist to hip ratio. She will loose first and fastest on her upper body and may have delicate arms, small chest, pronounced shoulder bones/clavicle... all while still having padding on her hips, thighs and rear, which is the last to go, and even then, it's about your underlying skeleton so a pear probably has wider hip bones. (\"These hips were made for birthing\" style).\n\nClues you are a pear: you take a size larger on bottom than on top, and you need to get your jeans altered to have the waist taken in, because of gaping at the back.\n\nContrast to an hourglass who has a teeny tiny waist, 0.7 ratio, while being equal in the chest to the hips. An hourglass is when you have say a 36-23-36 figure. What's more there are two types of hourglasses depending on the distance between your waist and your hip bone. \n\nClues you are an hourglass: you look fantastic in wrap dresses.\n\nYou can also be a rectangle which means you are kind of straight up and down -- chest and hips are equal but your waist is kind of straight. Rectangles can be prone to apple-dom, or not. \n\nClues you are a rectangle: you rock the jeans and tee shirt look. You can also pull off menswear-inspired clothing like nobody's business. \n\nIn theory you can be any of these shapes and have a full bust or not, that said, in general, hourglasses and apples in general tend to have fuller busts, while pears and rectangles do not.\n\nNow add on top of this picture some of us have sloping shoulders, and some of us have straight shoulders... this is different than broad vs narrow and has to do with the slant. \n\n38.5 divided by 42 = a 0.91 hip to waist ratio, which would put you in apple territory.
