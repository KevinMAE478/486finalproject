But I don&amp;#39;t want to coast, and these pictures helped me remember who I was, and that not only am I not that person anymore, but I never have to be that person again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have felt as though I was incredibly overweight my entire life (and I absolutely was a chubster in middle school), even though I was actually pretty normal throughout high school and the first couple years of college, once I started gaining weight, I didn&amp;#39;t even notice it. I always felt fat, so when I actually started to become fat, I didn&amp;#39;t even realize it, although it was probably a surprise to everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pretty much ballooned, going from my thinnest, 140, to my heaviest, 230, in the span of about 4 years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was after I broke up with this big huge jerk, sold my car, and moved to San Francisco when I started to lose some weight. Not being in a (terrible) relationship with someone whose idea of a vegetable is a french fry, being forced to walk everywhere, and having tons of healthier options, I dropped 15 pounds without even thinking about it. And that is when I decided 30 was going to be my year, and in order to do that, 29 was going to have to be full of different decisions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A doctor recommended the Lose It app to me, and about a month after my 29th birthday, I started counting calories. Who knew drinking 2 sodas a day could be so bad for you? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was eating the app&amp;#39;s recommended calories to lose 2 lbs a week, and before you knew it (okay 9-10 months) I was down a considerable amount. I had always set my goal at 145 lbs, but when I hit 160-165 lbs, I kinda got over the strict calorie counting game, and went into eating pretty much what I thought I needed. I learned a LOT about what amount of food had what amount of calories, and was able to maintain without really thinking about it, and so for my 30th birthday I was able to actually be happy with my appearance, and figured 163 lbs was good enough. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept it at that weight, no problem, until a new boy came on the scene about a year later. Now there was going out to eat all the time, and drinking to get over having to try and awkwardly talk to one another, and Thanksgiving, and Christmas, and the Super Bowl and Oh My God I am back up to 175 lbs, no no no no no no no!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here we are. I have been counting calories again for the past 6 weeks, staying at a 500 calorie deficit from my 1,795 TDEE (didn&amp;#39;t know what this was previously, thanks &lt;a href=\"/r/loseit\"&gt;/r/loseit&lt;/a&gt;), and typically hitting slightly above 1,200 a day, and am back down to my initial 160. But this time I am going to keep going! I&amp;#39;ll reach that 145 lb goal this time! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been back to logging absolutely everything I eat, started running 3-4 miles 3 times a week, a hobby I picked up last spring (and dropped for about 6 months...) and really enjoy, and have been coming here for inspiration and advice. Even though I&amp;#39;ve been at 160 for about 2 weeks now, I know this time around to not be discouraged by the plateau, and to just keep on going. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I know that I am not that person in those pictures, I have a physical reminder that I am on the right track.
