I&amp;#39;m talking about the actual number people ended up with vs. what TDEE calculators predict.  I&amp;#39;m not talking about differences between men or women, short or tall people, or heavier or lighter people.  I&amp;#39;m talking about, for example, two women, both aged 30, both 150 pounds, both 5&amp;#39;8&amp;quot;.  But one woman used to weigh 300 pounds.  The other woman has never had to diet.  There is scientific research out there saying that when the formerly 300 pound woman hits 150 pounds, she may need fewer calories than the second woman, due to metabolic adaptation/adaptive thermogenesis as a consequence from a period of caloric restriction.  And from the research, they don&amp;#39;t know how long this phenomenon will last.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673773/\"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673773/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maintenance of a 10% or greater reduction in body weight in lean or obese individuals is accompanied by an approximate 20%-25% decline in 24-hour energy expenditure. This decrease in weight maintenance calories is 10\u201315% below what is predicted solely on the basis of alterations in fat and lean mass 11, 12. Thus, a formerly obese individual will require ~300\u2013400 fewer calories per day to maintain the same body weight and physical activity level as a never-obese individual of the same body weight and composition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg9all2", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492213352.0, "created_utc": 1492184552.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg990rh", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PolarsteeleMGB2", "parent_id": "t1_dg88z0c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "TDEE perception is all relative I think- I see the occasional short lady rant on here and it makes me feel bad for disliking my own TDEE at maintenance which is roughly 1670 or so cals at sedentary.
