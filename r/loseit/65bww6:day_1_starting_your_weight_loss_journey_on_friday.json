Don\u2019t worry!  \u201cHow do I get started?\u201d is our most asked question.  &lt;a href=\"/r/Loseit\"&gt;r/Loseit&lt;/a&gt; has helped over 400,000 people lose nearly 1,000,000 pounds  and these are the steps that we\u2019ve found most useful for getting started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Why you\u2019re overweight&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Before You Start&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that &lt;a href=\"https://www.tdeecalculator.net\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tracking&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  &lt;a href=\"/r/loseit\"&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; recommends an app like &lt;a href=\"https://www.myfitnesspal.com/\"&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://loseit.com/\"&gt;Loseit!&lt;/a&gt; (unaffiliated), or &lt;a href=\"https://cronometer.com/\"&gt;Cronometer&lt;/a&gt;.  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don\u2019t cheat the numbers.  You\u2019ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you&amp;#39;re eating is more important than what you&amp;#39;re eating.  Why?  &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU\"&gt;This may explain it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Creating Your Deficit&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  &lt;a href=\"/r/loseit\"&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you\u2019re eating you won\u2019t stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Exercise&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has it\u2019s own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Crawl, Walk, Run&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isn\u2019t necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Acceptance&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will &lt;em&gt;struggle&lt;/em&gt;.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We don\u2019t need perfect.

SW: 154. GW: 130. Long time lurker\n\n\nThis isn't my Day 1- I started about 2 weeks ago. It's also not my first time attempting to lose the same pounds.\n\n\nAbout a year ago, I went from ~155 to 138. The weight loss actually came fairly easy. I had started a new medication and one of the side effects was a loss of appetite, and I had decided to use that to my advantage. I tracked, I walked, I kept a constant and maintainable deficit, and I managed to do that while still saving calories to have fun with my friends the way most college students liked to have fun. It was almost easy. Unfortunately, the weight slowly crept back on. \n\nThe problem was not the type of food I ate. I love raw veggies, fruit in moderation, lean protein and fish, etc. I definitely could have cut down on some processed carbs, but for the most part, I had a balanced diet. My problem was that I binge- especially at night. \n\n\nI'm not sure when I started to mess up my body's natural hungry/full cues. My first problem is eating when I'm not hungry- either because I'm home alone and bored, or because I would follow the standard meal times and eat breakfast or lunch just because I was supposed to. This would lead to me burning through half my calories by 3pm.\n\n\nMy second problem is eating way past the point of being full. In fact, I would eat to the point where I was sure that the next bite would make me sick, and I'd do that for most nights of the week. I could fill my house with skinless chicken breasts and broccoli and carrots, and I will get fat off skinless chicken breasts and broccoli and carrots.\n\n\nI almost gave up after I gained back all the weight. I was so embarrassed. I tried to convince myself that my natural appetite would always put me around 150, and that would be fine. A couple months ago, I realized 150 was never going to be my \"set point\". I could and would get bigger than that if I didn't get my stuff under control. \n\n\nSo here I am- trying to train my mind and body. I do not eat until I am hungry, and I stop when I am no longer hungry. I track (never had a problem with it before, but its a big step in my accountability). Unfortunately, I am apple-shaped, meaning I store most of my body fat in my torso, and have little fat from my hips downward. I do not wear excess weight well. I know that this is the dangerous fat- the kind that surrounds my organs. I need it gone.\n\n\nIts been 2 weeks and I. feel. amazing. I've walked to and from work every day, when I used to take the bus. I'm no longer in pain from stuffing myself at dinner. I have so much energy. I've been out to a few restaurants since starting, and I've managed to control myself. Despite there being no noticeable change in my body yet, I feel so much more at peace with myself. I've done this song and dance so I know it won't always be as easy as this week has been, but I'm way more hopeful this time.
