Tracking these really helped when the weight loss slowed toward the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, I know 20-ish pounds isn\u2019t that impressive compared to some of the journeys here. I started at the high end of normal BMI, so this was just vanity weight. But it does represent something I had never been able to achieve in all my years of \u201csuccessful\u201d dieting. You see, I was a classic yo-yoer. Every spring, I would dust off MFP and lose as much as I could. I\u2019d see 140 for maybe a day, and then stabilize around 142-143. In the winter, when holidays and seasonal depression hit, I would slowly creep back up to 155. This was an annual cycle, and I thought it was normal. I thought that was what everyone did. I thought that was how you \u2018maintained\u2019 your weight \u2013 gain and lose, gain and lose. In short, I thought I already knew everything I needed to know about diet and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of that, I wanted to write a post about what I didn\u2019t know that I didn\u2019t know before finding &lt;a href=\"/r/loseit\"&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt;. This sub has been incredibly helpful to me to recognize ways I wasn\u2019t actually being honest with myself about food. Getting a fitbit was also a huge motivator for me. Having accurate data about my calorie output made me want to get better data about my input.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My progress isn\u2019t over \u2013 I want to try all the recipes from the Skinnytaste website! I want to run a 5k! I want to finish Strong Curves! I want to do an actual, &lt;em&gt;planned&lt;/em&gt; bulk and cut cycle! But I can now say, thanks to what I\u2019ve learned here, this is the last time I\u2019ll be dieting off my unintentional \u201cwinter weight.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here\u2019s what I used to get wrong about dieting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I would use MFP only at the beginning of the day, and if I had 1,000 calories to spare by dinnertime, I\u2019d assume I had plenty of wiggle room and didn\u2019t need to log after that. Lol, no. I\u2019m what the show Secret Eaters calls a \u201cNighttime Nosher.\u201d I can devour 700+ calories of \u201chealthy\u201d desserts like granola or frozen yogurt after a 1,000-calorie dinner.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I never logged alcoholic beverages because \u201calcohol doesn\u2019t count on a diet\u201d lolololol. I think I got this from my boyfriend, who does a very low-carb keto diet when losing weight, and doesn\u2019t count alcohol towards his carb count. (I also assumed it would be too depressing to control my alcohol intake while trying to diet, which says some revealing things about my relationship with alcohol.) When I finally started logging drinks, I learned that in party environments I was probably consuming 1,000 \u2013 1,500 calories worth of booze a day. That would explain why I felt like a whale towards the end of music festivals!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I believed I had to drink alcohol to have fun. I believed I had to drink a lot of alcohol to have a lot of fun. I believed I could never drink less than the people around me and not feel deprived. I\u2019m not sure I have actually overcome these beliefs, but I have at least been forced to recognize they exist, and evaluate them in the light of day.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I would measure my food (with cups \u2013 I didn\u2019t have a scale), but I\u2019d always give myself a heaping scoop, and then not log the little bit of extra food. My reasoning? \u201cI have a fast metabolism so I can eat a bit more than other people and still lose weight.\u201d Hahaha, no, brain, why would you believe that?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I never logged restaurant meals, or food that other people cooked for me. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete mystery what\u2019s really in this, so why even bother!\u201d Um, no, self, you have eyes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I would vastly overestimate portion sizes for most carbs. My pretzel snack was a double portion. My bowl of cereal was a triple portion. My handful of crackers was a quintuple portion. Once I had to face how many calories were really in them compared to the amount of satisfaction they brought me, they became less appealing as day-to-day food options.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I treated fruits and vegetables as freebies \u2013 I would eat as much as I wanted, and just log it as a single portion, or maybe double if I was being \u2018conservative.\u2019 Half a bag of grapes? Sure, they\u2019re good for you. The entire bowl of broccoli slaw? Definitely, I mean, it has a whole bottle of dressing in there, but it\u2019s only low-fat dressing after all. A whole container of cucumber salad? Can\u2019t hurt, you only drizzled sesame oil on it for a few seconds so it\u2019s basically zero calories. Lol. Nowadays I only do this (that is, eat as much as I want without measuring) with undressed spring mix.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I believed I \u2018had\u2019 to eat carbs and sweets at the end of every meal to feel satisfied. As I finished the last bite of my main meal, my mind would be racing with ideas for the treat I needed to \u2018fill in the corners.\u2019 There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with some dark chocolate after dinner, and I do still eat some kind of dessert most days. But I don\u2019t actually NEED to. If I take that last bite, put my fork down, drink some water, and wait 20 minutes before rushing off to the cupboard, I often wind up just as satiated as if I grabbed a sweet. These days, if I get a dessert, it\u2019s because I WANT to.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the mistakes I would make about exercise:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I believed the MFP calorie estimates for biking. And I ate them all back.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I counted my bike commute time as continuous biking even though it was start-and-stop traffic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I believed the MFP calorie estimates for weightlifting were &lt;em&gt;too low&lt;/em&gt; because my muscles were sore, so surely I was burning more than that! So I\u2019d just tack on extra time to my lifting sessions to make the numbers say what I thought they should. And then I\u2019d eat them all back. Lol.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I believed walking didn\u2019t burn many calories compared to \u2018real\u2019 exercise so it wasn\u2019t worth trying to get more walking in my day.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I believed I couldn\u2019t run because my body \u201cwasn\u2019t made for running.\u201d This probably stems from negative adolescent experiences in PE (chubby kid, puberty, chafing thighs, ungainly hips, etc.). Turns out C25K works for me too. Who knew. I ran 4 miles straight yesterday. Averaged 5.2 mph, but still.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Subconsciously, I believed I had an \u201cupper cap\u201d on weight for any particular lift, because I was a woman and my body just had limits. I would only keep increasing my weight until I found it genuinely challenging to do 3 sets of 10. And then I would just stay there forever. I also didn\u2019t keep any records of what I was doing, so keeping the same weights on everything made it easier to memorize my routine. Once I started logging what I was lifting, I was forced to confront my numbers instead of allowing them to stagnate. \u201cYour goal is 3 sets of 8 for this exercise? Well, you\u2019ve done that the past two workouts. Guess it\u2019s time to move from 25 pounds to 30. It hurts? You failed after 5 reps? That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do 30. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work. Just wait until next workout. Look at your record log now. You can do 7 reps at 30 already. See, that was fast.\u201d&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally, my lingering fatlogic I was shocked (shocked!) to realize was wrong:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I don\u2019t have a \u201cset point.\u201d 143 isn\u2019t the weight I\u2019m \u201cmeant to be,\u201d and there\u2019s no magical reason why my weight loss would stall when I got there \u2013 my sloppiness would just catch up to me as my TDEE dropped due to the weight I had already dropped.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There\u2019s no mystery to why my weight goes up or down \u201crandomly.\u201d That\u2019s water weight, and it might not be totally controllable, but it is comprehensible. That random spike that used to make you throw in the towel? That sudden drop that made you think you could just eat whatever? That\u2019s your period fluctuation. Ignore it and keep tracking.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I don\u2019t have a set number of fat cells, or a level of body fat I\u2019m always going to \u201cnaturally\u201d have. I get to decide my ideal weight and body composition based on the conscious choices I make.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the outset, I just started walking a lot more \u2013 getting a Fitbit helped tap into my competitive impulse, haha. I cut back on carbs and indulgences, and increased my raw veggies and lean protein. I eventually started drinking less, and making sure when I did drink the calories came mostly from alcohol rather than added sugar (bourbon neat, vodka soda with lemon and lemonade Mio, gin and diet tonic, red wine).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By now, here\u2019s an average 1200-1700 calorie day (depending on exercise and hunger levels) might look like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Intermittent fasting from midnight until 2-4 pm. Exception: cold brew coffee with almond milk and Torani sugarfree syrup.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5-6 liters of water per day, flavored with Mio or Crystal Light. This doesn\u2019t include diet soda or flavored sparkling water, which I drink as oftenas I want.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Afternoon snack: Quest bar (microwaved 30 seconds until fluffy) and a 10-oz pink lady apple with a Babybel light cheese. If I\u2019m still hungry, I\u2019ll add baby carrots with Bolthouse yogurt dressing, or a homemade marinated cucumber or carrot salad.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dinner: 600-calorie meal (food-prepped on Sunday) from Skinnytaste or similar \u2013 5-6 oz chicken or other lean protein cooked with veggies / beans / lentils /squash and topped with avocado, mozzarella, or both, served over a big bed of spring mix. Or I\u2019ll do Explore Cuisine\u2019s high-protein pasta (25g protein for 210 calories!) with some kind of veggie sauce / stir-fry and topped with melted cheese. Mmmm.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dessert: depending on my macros for the day, either a whole container of Halo Top with sugar-free chocolate syrup, a serving of breakfast cereal, or a serving of chocolate almonds. If I\u2019m still hungry, I\u2019ll add a Fiber One bar or a bit of dark chocolate, and then drink a bunch of sweetened sparkling water.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I usually keep a more aggressive deficit during the week so on the weekend I can afford some drinks and/or meals out with friends. I\u2019ve never had to say no to going out \u2013 I\u2019ll make it a maintenance day if I have to. I\u2019m doing this to feel good in social settings, not deprive myself of being social. I aim for 40% carbs, 30% protein, 30% fat. The vast majority of my carbs come from fruit, veggies, and beans/legumes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Workouts are Strong Curves Gluteal Goddess 3x week, with C25K on off-days, and one rest day a week. I always aim for 15,000 steps a day, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!
