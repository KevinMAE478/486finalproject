Don\u2019t worry!  \u201cHow do I get started?\u201d is our most asked question.  &lt;a href=\"/r/Loseit\"&gt;r/Loseit&lt;/a&gt; has helped over 400,000 people lose nearly 1,000,000 pounds  and these are the steps that we\u2019ve found most useful for getting started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Why you\u2019re overweight&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Before You Start&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that &lt;a href=\"https://www.tdeecalculator.net\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tracking&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  &lt;a href=\"/r/loseit\"&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; recommends an app like &lt;a href=\"https://www.myfitnesspal.com/\"&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://loseit.com/\"&gt;Loseit!&lt;/a&gt; (unaffiliated), or &lt;a href=\"https://cronometer.com/\"&gt;Cronometer&lt;/a&gt;.  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don\u2019t cheat the numbers.  You\u2019ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you&amp;#39;re eating is more important than what you&amp;#39;re eating.

This is up to you.  &lt;a href=\"/r/loseit\"&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you\u2019re eating you won\u2019t stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Exercise&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has it\u2019s own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.

We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.

Let's just say it was due to medication (steroids) in my late thirties and up until then I was a pretty good weight despite having undiagnosed hypothyroidism for a while. So I knew how to eat, it's just that the specific medication I took made my stomach physically bigger, at least it felt like that.\n\nI put on weight in whooshes. In 2010 I went from 60 kg to 85 within a few days, after having binged for weeks. Then stayed there for a year, then 90 kgs for a couple of years, then gradually to 102.\n\nThese last few days I saw a big big milestone for me, being under 90 again, after four years approximately. I can do this!\n\nI have not been counting calories, I tried a very restrictive regimen for a while, that didn't work and I lost hair on my legs which was creepy. That happened as a supposedly miracle cure for my diabetes, which I am diagnosed with since last September.\n\nAnyway, I feel lighter overall, in every sense of the word.\n\nMy progress has been very slow, possibly due to age, health problems, not wanting to put stress on my body while having the stresses of my everyday life. However, I can see I am losing slowly but surely. I am more determined, especially after finding out about the whooshes, that I am waiting out any whoosh time.\n\nI work out, walk on average for an hour each day. I have discovered on my last woosh that I was losing fast on a combination of not having anything to eat from one afternoon to the next noon and a relatively intense workout before the working day. \n\nMy current regimen, adjusted occasionally depending on energy levels. If I feel my work performance is affected, I go easier, while having maintenance days at the worst.\n\n*Morning workout for half an hour before work: circuit training\n\n*Half an hour walk to work\n\n*then office work: some small breaks within working hours for workouts.\n\n*Noon: Salad bar with any meat that is on offer at the cafeteria. If I am hungry, I eat a small salad or fruit or fruit juice before or after that meal. Salad+meat combination is actually a wide variety of things. Also, where I work, people at the cafeteria make sure their fruit is ripe and delicious so that takes care of most of my cravings. I try to avoid having much fruit though.\n\n*Afternoon. Half an hour walk home. Then eat whatever is cooked at home for everyone in small quantities, some veggies or fruit as well, a handful of nuts, small meal total.\n\n*Then relaxing until bedtime. I am going to add here a couple of hours of swimming twice a week, as a temporary thing, so as not to have loose skin. Not much loose skin until now, but there are some worrying signs. I can't keep up the intense workouts indefinitely. My hubby does quite a lot of everything that needs to be done at home, while I am pursuing the weight loss, trying to reverse my diabetes, but he can't be doing all he does indefinitely.\n\n\nOn weekends I do long hikes occasionally, like 2-7 hours long, it is something I enjoy. But I can also not exercise at all and meet with friends and eat out, takeaways, anything, aiming to be around maintenance in the worst case scenario.\n\nLong hikes in the past helped my lose pregnancy weight without really doing anything on the diet level, but my body just doesn't work like that anymore. They helped me however, not gain any more, when I started this journey back in Feb 2016. I found out the above regimen with circuit training a couple of months ago and it's working.

The recommended minimum daily intake for adult women in order to get adequate nutrition is 1200 calories a day, so you just don't have that much room to create a sizeable calorie deficit through diet alone. Adding in regular exercise can help bump that up, but to a certain extent you just have to accept that you can't lose as fast as someone who's taller or more overweight (or more male). The good news is that every pound you lose is going to be more noticeable on you than it would be on a larger person.\n\nEating at a 500 calorie deficit (so for you 1179 if you're not exercising) will put you on pace to lose one pound for week. But keep in mind that there's no rule saying you *have* to lose at that pace. You might find it more workable and more sustainable to have more flexibility with your calorie budget even if that means losing at a slower pace.\n\nIn terms of recipe resources, I'd recommend checking out /r/1200isplenty, /r/vegan1200isplenty, skinnytaste.com and hungry-girl.com.\n\nGood luck -- you can do this!

Adding in regular exercise can help bump that up, but to a certain extent you just have to accept that you can&amp;#39;t lose as fast as someone who&amp;#39;s taller or more overweight (or more male). The good news is that every pound you lose is going to be more noticeable on you than it would be on a larger person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eating at a 500 calorie deficit (so for you 1179 if you&amp;#39;re not exercising) will put you on pace to lose one pound for week. But keep in mind that there&amp;#39;s no rule saying you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to lose at that pace. You might find it more workable and more sustainable to have more flexibility with your calorie budget even if that means losing at a slower pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of recipe resources, I&amp;#39;d recommend checking out &lt;a href=\"/r/1200isplenty\"&gt;/r/1200isplenty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/r/vegan1200isplenty\"&gt;/r/vegan1200isplenty&lt;/a&gt;, skinnytaste.com and hungry-girl.com.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck -- you can do this! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dgaoft1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492294175.0, "created_utc": 1492265375.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65iklz", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65iklz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgap668", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Futuredrbooboo", "parent_id": "t1_dgao3gn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It was a rate off of 1 lb per week.

I\u2019m determined to start it in the best possible physical condition and use the opportunity as a springboard to enjoying the rest of my life.\n\nThis whole weight loss business is going to be a challenge for me.

So, for the foreseeable future, I\u2019ll be putting my faith in the gods of CICO, religiously (pun not intended) tracking my diet through MyFitnessPal, and trying to incorporate exercise into my daily regime as I know how beneficial it can be.\n\nI\u2019ve got two major goals, both related to my BMI. My first goal is to reach 104kg, at which point my BMI will be below 30 and I\u2019ll no longer be obese. The second goal, and my final goal weight, is to get my BMI below 25 at a weight of 87kg. I\u2019m sure that the good people of the Internet could argue the toss about the relevancy of BMI until the cows come home, but for me they\u2019re major mental goals.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it to the bottom of this wall of text, congratulations, and I look forward to joining you in losing weight!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I discovered this sub about a week ago whilst trawling the Internet for ways to lose weight and I\u2019ve been lurking since then. Today I finally decided to bite the bullet, sign up, and join you all on the weight loss journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, a little bit about me: I\u2019m 22, from Manchester, UK, and I\u2019ve just graduated from university. I spend most of my spare time either playing or listening to music, keeping up to date on current events through the news, or going on several-hour adventures through Facebook, Reddit, Wikipedia, and many other Internet time-wasting methods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve got several reasons for wanting to lose weight, including struggling with physical activity and extensive, hideous stretch marks across my entire torso, but the main one is that I\u2019ve just been offered a job which means I\u2019ll be relocating a long way from home, offering me a completely fresh start. I\u2019m determined to start it in the best possible physical condition and use the opportunity as a springboard to enjoying the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This whole weight loss business is going to be a challenge for me.
