As of today, after my grueling after-work jog, the scale read 199.2, the first time I have been below 200 probably since sometime in middle school. Years of being overweight, not being comfortable in my own skin, suffering because of how self-conscious I was and, at the time, irreparably damaging my self esteem. The first picture of me is in 2013, during a time of my life that I was at my worst and heaviest, 286. I was in a horrible relationship, having family issues, flipping between majors in school, basically everything was trash. But after I got out of that restricting relationship, I began to shape my life in a way that gave me control. I was tired of having other people stomp all over me and I wanted to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After taking control of my life, I have slowly been able to transform myself into the person you see on the right. It wasn&amp;#39;t easy. There was a ton of suffering. There was a ton discipline. You learn a lot about yourself when you&amp;#39;re trying to lose nearly 100 pounds, and in that time I managed to piece together myself. I try to be humble and true to myself, but I worked hard for this and I earned this. I couldn&amp;#39;t buy this. I couldn&amp;#39;t fake my way to this. I had to sweat, suffer, resist and push on through every difficult moment. And still, this is only the beginning for me. Getting this far I have nothing but a stronger desire to become a stronger version of myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look forward to reaching that next point in my physical health, but for now I&amp;#39;m celebrating who I was able to achieve and who I&amp;#39;m going to continue to become. Every ending has a beginning, and if you&amp;#39;re struggling with anything in your life, the only way to remedy it is to take it on, one day at a time, fall off the wagon but be willing to get right back on. Take the suffering. Take the push of the voice in your head. You can&amp;#39;t buy your self-worth, but you can fight for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as routines are concerned, I was all over the fuckin&amp;#39; place. No seriously, I initially did keto, then paleo, went to vegetarian, and eventually found myself just doing a standard CICO routine. I didn&amp;#39;t try to restrict tempting things like sweets and beer, I just limited them severely. This last push I stopped drinking beer completely and that has really helped with these last five pounds or so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and for the last four months or so I have been doing IF, intermittent fasting. Stop eating by 8 pm, don&amp;#39;t start eating until noon and get my calories in during that 8 hour time period.  I constantly updated my TDEE to make sure I was getting the full 7000 calorie deficit per week. It was rough, but worth it. Right now I am at 1300 calories a day to lose two pounds and it has been tough. But god am I glad I stuck with it. My next goal is 190 and I&amp;#39;m probably going to go back to IF to knock out these last 9 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With exercise, I tried a multitude of routines. Unfortunately I get very bored very quickly. I did stronglifts, general cardio (ran 4 miles once, that was great!) and everything under the sun. I&amp;#39;m trying to stick harder to weight lifting, so once I make my next post for goal number two I&amp;#39;ll let you know if it worked out :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and be careful who you call ugly in middle school ;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Pictures first!](http://imgur.com/a/nBsfx)\n\n[Scale for reference](http://imgur.com/a/iAw1j)\n\nI have been waiting to make this post for a very, very long time.
