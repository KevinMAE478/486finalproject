There was even a noticeable change from 135lbs to 133lbs, so the leaner/lighter you are the bigger a difference you'll see with smaller losses. \n\nWith respect to abs or any muscular definition though, it's about doing something to *maintain* that muscle mass, and generally speaking that is heavy lifting, adequate protien intake (for you 0.8g/lb would be a good minimum), and a moderate deficit (20-25% from maintenance, so your ~1lb/week falls in that realm). \n\nI track my calories. I monitor protein. I lift heavy (as an intermediate lifter I cannot comfortably use a full body routine but that is ideal for a beginner, strong lifts or starting strength are worth looking into), moderate deficit. I make my own pre-workout mix but it is not at all necessary; if you need energy just drink some coffee or buy caffeine pills. I don't even use caffeine anymore because long term it makes me fatigued. But the things I do use help with focus and a bit with energy and I do find that I feel better at the gym when I have a good pre-workout snack and the supplements. Could be placebo but eh, I'm okay with that. You don't need to be at the gym for a long-ass time but my workout does keep me there pretty long because it is higher in volume for accessory (I use Wendler's periodization template but only do 5x10 for the accessory, but I like do to joker sets where I increase the weight by 5-10% from my training max, or reverse pyramid back down to my first working weight and do as many reps as possible if my energy is not quite there for the jokers).\n\nI buy my supplements from myprotein btw, their protein powder sucks balls but the supplements themselves are quite affordable if you buy them on a sale. They seem to have sales quite often as well. If you wanted anything, creatine monohydrate and beta alanine are the main ones along with caffeine. I use those two with citrulline malate and tyrosine, the latter helps a lot for me with concentration and the former with energy since I don't use caffeine (and I noticed improvements once I introduced it). Myprotein has 35% off atm but I'd wait a while to see if they get a better deal (they go as high as 70% off).

There was even a noticeable change from 135lbs to 133lbs, so the leaner/lighter you are the bigger a difference you&amp;#39;ll see with smaller losses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With respect to abs or any muscular definition though, it&amp;#39;s about doing something to &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt; that muscle mass, and generally speaking that is heavy lifting, adequate protien intake (for you 0.8g/lb would be a good minimum), and a moderate deficit (20-25% from maintenance, so your ~1lb/week falls in that realm). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I track my calories. I monitor protein. I lift heavy (as an intermediate lifter I cannot comfortably use a full body routine but that is ideal for a beginner, strong lifts or starting strength are worth looking into), moderate deficit. I make my own pre-workout mix but it is not at all necessary; if you need energy just drink some coffee or buy caffeine pills. I don&amp;#39;t even use caffeine anymore because long term it makes me fatigued. But the things I do use help with focus and a bit with energy and I do find that I feel better at the gym when I have a good pre-workout snack and the supplements. Could be placebo but eh, I&amp;#39;m okay with that. You don&amp;#39;t need to be at the gym for a long-ass time but my workout does keep me there pretty long because it is higher in volume for accessory (I use Wendler&amp;#39;s periodization template but only do 5x10 for the accessory, but I like do to joker sets where I increase the weight by 5-10% from my training max, or reverse pyramid back down to my first working weight and do as many reps as possible if my energy is not quite there for the jokers).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I buy my supplements from myprotein btw, their protein powder sucks balls but the supplements themselves are quite affordable if you buy them on a sale. They seem to have sales quite often as well. If you wanted anything, creatine monohydrate and beta alanine are the main ones along with caffeine. I use those two with citrulline malate and tyrosine, the latter helps a lot for me with concentration and the former with energy since I don&amp;#39;t use caffeine (and I noticed improvements once I introduced it). Myprotein has 35% off atm but I&amp;#39;d wait a while to see if they get a better deal (they go as high as 70% off). Otherwise if you wanted to try anything, making a new account allows you to get 25% off if you use the code EXCLUSIVE, iirc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dgaxvm6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492307695.0, "created_utc": 1492278895.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kc48", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbntyo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "coldize", "parent_id": "t3_65kc48", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "[This article](http://www.builtlean.com/2012/09/24/body-fat-percentage-men-women/) has some good sample images and illustrations for how your body is likely to look at certain bodyfat percentages (obviously can be different from person to person).\n\nYou'll likely need to be somewhere around 12-8% to see visible abs.\n\nIf you want your abs to look good, you'll want to do some resistance training.\nIf you want your abs to look better than good, you'll want to add lean mass by eating with good macros at a caloric surplus while also having a good resistance training program.\n\nYou don't have to do direct ab work to train your abs but they do need to get work.\n\nFor the big 5 compound lifts (Squats, Deadlifts, Flat Bench Press, Overhead Press and Rows), your entire core is recruited to stabilize your body.
