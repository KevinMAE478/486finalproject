I&amp;#39;m not those people and what works for them doesn&amp;#39;t work for me. I know very well that it is very easy to get caught up in the anxieties of &amp;quot;not achieving enough&amp;quot; and of treating this lifestyle like a marathon and imagining that there is a finish line.

Just go and do something. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter what it is even if it is walking on the treadmill as slow as possible. The point is getting into the habit of going to the gym.
