I guess over time my closet will look more how I would like to but it&amp;#39;s just seems so wasteful and frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dgc6qr7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492387146.0, "created_utc": 1492358346.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65kqkf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgciv4w", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "honestasxo", "parent_id": "t3_65kqkf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm the opposite right now.
