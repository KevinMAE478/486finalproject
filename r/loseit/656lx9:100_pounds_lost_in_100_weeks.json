It didn&amp;#39;t fit.  I was crushed and embarrassed and had to sort through the suitcase to find something else to wear.\nOn the trip home, I started to look through some of the pictures that had been taken.  I was ashamed at how bad I had let myself get.  Finishing up the most awesome vacation I had had in over a decade and I couldn&amp;#39;t even stand to look at the pictures of it.\nWhen I got home, I stepped on the scale for the first time in a long time.  I had told the lie of &amp;#39;290&amp;#39; when asked &amp;#39;how much do you weigh?&amp;#39; for so long that I almost believed it.  The scale read 315 and I felt that punch to the gut once more.  40 was less than two years away, I was in the worst shape of my life, and I had to do something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eat less, move more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;100 pounds off in two years.  That was the goal and I told no one.  For me, only I could hold myself accountable here, this had to be for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting off it really was just &amp;#39;eating less&amp;#39;.  I really didn&amp;#39;t eat all that badly, I just ate WAY too much:  Two pieces of pizza instead of four, get a medium sub not a giant, don&amp;#39;t go back for seconds, don&amp;#39;t eat all those cookies/snacks.  I needed to make slow and gradual changes that I could live with.  And for the first 9 months, I lost 50 pounds pretty much &amp;#39;eating less&amp;#39; and then hit a lengthy plateau and knew I needed to be a little more aware if I was going to take the next step.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through all this, I had been pretty sedentary, so set a goal of 60 active minutes a day, every day for a month.  It didn&amp;#39;t have to be anything more than walking, but 60 minutes a day.  That turned into me accidentally backing into C25K.  That month turned into 6 weeks and I hit the 5K distance (once) and then hurt my ankle moving some pool furniture.  During those 6 weeks the scale didn&amp;#39;t move but I ran 5k so that was awesome! (It was a 39 min 5k but still!).  During the next week, where I was off my feet an odd thing happened.  I dropped 11 pounds.  I had been making great progress over the 6 weeks on my body but the scale was deceiving me since my body was holding onto so much water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past year I have focused a lot more on my TDEE/BMR and CICO as the margins get a little tighter the closer you get to your target.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My typical day is:\nBreakfast: greek yogurt or eggs (100-200 calories)\nLunch: Sandwich/fruit/chips  or leftovers (400-600 calories)\nDinner:  It is amazing what I can fit into 800-1000 calories for dinner!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not a small man, so I have been able to &amp;#39;guesstimate&amp;#39; calories with decent success.  I read the nutritional information on every food package and know the values of most of the foods I eat regularly.  And since I control my breakfast/lunch pretty tightly, I have a good bit of flexibility with dinner and still not go over my dailies.  My heart goes out to the smaller people that need to really keep control under 1200-1500 and totally respect your efforts using scales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hit my 40th birthday at 227 pounds and that was the first time I honestly believed I had a chance to hit my goal.  I repeated my efforts from the previous spring to get out and be active.  40 pounds lighter than the previous Spring and knowing I did it once, it only took me a little over 2 weeks to get back to running that 5k distance (and have even knocked almost 10 minutes of my previous years time)  12 pounds to go and three months to do it.  And today I did.  Today the scale reads 215 and after two years I know that I am just at the beginning!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did this without a gym, without gimmicks, and without eliminating my favorite foods from my diet.  I am a convert to the church of CICO.   Any exercises have been walking/running, cycling, or bodyweight.  I want to tell people that anyone can do it and there is no magic.  Just be aware of what you are putting into your body.  Find those super calorie dense foods and limit them.  I have days where I hit one too many food trucks or drink one too many beers AND still eat under my TDEE for that day because I think about my calorie allocation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The War is not won or lost at Thanksgiving and Christmas, it is won/lost in the everyday grind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have learned not to stress the plateaus, the crazy things sodium can do to water weight, and that I am in control.  This is not a sprint, it is a marathon.  It is a simple numbers game, but it won&amp;#39;t be easy to break all your habits.  This community has been a great support.  Reading others challenges and successes has been helpful in my own journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t decided what my next health/weight/fitness goal will be yet, but it is a good feeling to know that my first finish is just the start!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  Thanks for reading.

I definitely 'fill' a lot faster these days, even when I eat a little too much I get overfull much quicker.\n\n I admittedly I am not super great with macros, but I have learned that protein in the morning tends to help me with morning hunger.  That is why I tend to greek yogurt or eggs (and black iced coffee) for breakfast.\n\nI really don't snack anymore and that has allowed me to control a lot of my calories and use them for my favorite meal (dinner) and not feel like I am dieting.  I have seen others use carrots or other things as snack substitutes.  For me, in the early stages if I was feeling an urge to eat something, I would just eat a single baby dill pickle.  I know it sounds odd, but the act of eating that tiny pickle would turn my brain off from needing to ravage the fridge.  And pickles have barely any calories (but OHH the sodium).\n\nI have countless times stood there with the fridge/cabinet door open staring into the abyss.  Asking myself 'is it worth it?  are you really hungry?  is this what you really want to eat?'.  Sometimes, the answer actually is yes, and then I just have to add it to my calories for the day and adjust.\n\nEspecially early, I made a more wrong choices than I do now, but I built a structure into my day that allowed for it.  My TDEE when I started was almost 3000 calories.  In my mind, I aimed for 1500 with the understanding that I was new at this and was going to make mistakes and likely going to eat over 2000, but that was still well below what I could and lose weight.  \n\nAs I lost weight and my TDEE came down a bit, I had to a take a closer look at my progress and goals.  I have added a little of activity in my formerly sedentary day just to help with the progress a little.  After two years, I am also much better at judging the calories so able to make many fewer mistakes.\n\nI get the fight.  I am not sure the cravings ever completely go away, but over time every time I choose not to give in, it makes it easier to not succumb the next time.

I definitely &amp;#39;fill&amp;#39; a lot faster these days, even when I eat a little too much I get overfull much quicker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I admittedly I am not super great with macros, but I have learned that protein in the morning tends to help me with morning hunger.  That is why I tend to greek yogurt or eggs (and black iced coffee) for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t snack anymore and that has allowed me to control a lot of my calories and use them for my favorite meal (dinner) and not feel like I am dieting.  I have seen others use carrots or other things as snack substitutes.  For me, in the early stages if I was feeling an urge to eat something, I would just eat a single baby dill pickle.  I know it sounds odd, but the act of eating that tiny pickle would turn my brain off from needing to ravage the fridge.  And pickles have barely any calories (but OHH the sodium).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have countless times stood there with the fridge/cabinet door open staring into the abyss.  Asking myself &amp;#39;is it worth it?  are you really hungry?  is this what you really want to eat?&amp;#39;.  Sometimes, the answer actually is yes, and then I just have to add it to my calories for the day and adjust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially early, I made a more wrong choices than I do now, but I built a structure into my day that allowed for it.  My TDEE when I started was almost 3000 calories.  In my mind, I aimed for 1500 with the understanding that I was new at this and was going to make mistakes and likely going to eat over 2000, but that was still well below what I could and lose weight.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I lost weight and my TDEE came down a bit, I had to a take a closer look at my progress and goals.  I have added a little of activity in my formerly sedentary day just to help with the progress a little.  After two years, I am also much better at judging the calories so able to make many fewer mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get the fight.  I am not sure the cravings ever completely go away, but over time every time I choose not to give in, it makes it easier to not succumb the next time.  And I am still not perfect, I still give in sometimes.  But even now when I give in, I give in in a more calorie aware way and put everything against my total.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg93bvh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492203368.0, "created_utc": 1492174568.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8pij8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Yazbremski", "parent_id": "t3_656lx9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I love you.
