However, my looming 40th birthday spurred me to action. I was going to be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; 40 year old woman. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started a low-carb/high protein &amp;amp; fat diet. I cut out all processed foods. After a few weeks, all the cravings for &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; food ceased. During this time, I also joined a gym. Like a lot of people, I was terrified to join one. I would be the fat chick who didn&amp;#39;t know what she was doing in a sea of toned bodied people. I sucked it up and knew I had to do it. I joined a local gym and instantly felt at home. I hired an amazing and inspiring trainer. I knew if I didn&amp;#39;t, I wouldn&amp;#39;t know what I was doing, and having someone to be accountable to helped keep me motivated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started dropping weight quickly.

If friends and acquaintances asked, I&amp;#39;d tell them what I was doing: low carb and going to the gym every day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, I got a message from a friend. She told me she joined a gym and hired a trainer &lt;em&gt;and it was all because of me&lt;/em&gt;. She was so inspired from my success, she started getting healthy too. I was shocked. I cried.
