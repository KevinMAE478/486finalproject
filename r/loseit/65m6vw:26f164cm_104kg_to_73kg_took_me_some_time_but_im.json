I&amp;#39;ve been lurking this sub for a long time, never replying but occasionally leaving some upvotes on all your wonderful progress posts, and felt it was about time I made a post myself. I kept telling myself &amp;quot;one more kg and then you can post about it&amp;quot;, but kept postponing it... but I finally made myself do it now. I hope posting here will help with accountability a bit as well. (This is also my first post on reddit at all, whooo!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll start off with my stats: I&amp;#39;m a 26-year-old girl from Europe, 1,64m tall, and am currently down 31kg from my highest (known) weight. At the moment I weigh in at 73kg, from my highest of 104kg. (5ft4, from 230 to 160 lbs.) I don&amp;#39;t have many full body pics of when I was at my heaviest, but this is one of the biggest older pics I still have. It was taken at halloween 2014; the second picture is from last week. I&amp;#39;m still not seeing the difference in the mirror all that much, but when I put pics together I can&amp;#39;t deny there&amp;#39;s been some huge change...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/rSPUIDg.jpg\"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/rSPUIDg.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for my story (there&amp;#39;s a tldr at the bottom for who doesn&amp;#39;t want to read all of it). I&amp;#39;m still very much a work in progress and I&amp;#39;ve had many setbacks, but I&amp;#39;ll try to keep it brief(ish). As a lot of people on here, I&amp;#39;ve been overweight my entire life. Even as a child my mum was constantly dragging me to dieticians and stuff like weight watchers, when in reality I didn&amp;#39;t really care and didn&amp;#39;t want to do all that. Even when I was in college, I never gave a damn about how I looked or felt. Not in an &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m perfect the way I am&amp;quot; kind of way, nah. I&amp;#39;ve never felt good about myself or how I looked. I was miserable most of the time. It&amp;#39;s just that I also just couldn&amp;#39;t bring myself to care enough to do something about it. I was depressed to my very core and had been for a very, very long time. Food was my coping mechanism for my massive inferiority complex. I was bullied all through high school and fell into a deep pit of social anxiety and isolation. My family wasn&amp;#39;t really supportive either (they&amp;#39;re great, but none of them have weight issues and none of them understood. They&amp;#39;d yell at me for being fat and finding no way out of it, and then wonder why I&amp;#39;d isolate even more). The internet pulled me through here - I had a few online friends who helped me cope with the fact that I had no one irl, no one at all. Once I graduated from hs this improved and I did manage to make two good friends over there, but the general feeling of &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not good enough&amp;quot; still lingered in all I did (and do).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was 22, I wanted to lose weight all of a sudden. No specific reason or goal, I was just tired of always feeling tired and miserable and unhealthy and I figured that that was 100% because I was fat. I opted for a very bad version of CICO: basically using up my entire calorie budget on junk food and snacks. I lost 15 kg in only three months that way, but the second I figured out that I was doing well, I rewarded myself with food again. Didn&amp;#39;t really work that way: in no time I was back up at 104 kg. I felt awful again, and sank even deeper into my depression. I was starting to isolate myself again as well, which only added to my (self-imposed) feeling of &amp;quot;see, nobody wants to spend time with you because you&amp;#39;re so fat&amp;quot;. They were very awful and very harmful thoughts, it was mentally an extremely exhausting state to be in all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I turned 24, after I&amp;#39;d graduated from college, I still felt so miserable about my entire life I decided to make a drastic lifestyle change, for real this time. I went from the worst possible diet (soda, fries, mcdonalds, takeaway, etc) to a healthy one all at once. CICO was my new best friend. I kept to a calorie budget of 1200, then raised that to 1400 when I started feeling a bit lightheaded on only 1200 a day. I also started working out intensively, 5-6 times a week of mixed cardio and weights. I lost 35 kg from february 2015 to september 2015, and I couldn&amp;#39;t have been happier about it. I was at 69 kg then (152lbs). The last time I remember being at that weight I was what, 12? 13? It was such a surreal thing, but I was feeling much better. Still, I wasn&amp;#39;t happy with where I was. I was still fat and still not good enough or where I wanted to be. I still felt repulsive to the point where people would avoid me. I&amp;#39;d lost weight, but it wasn&amp;#39;t enough. My goal was to lose at least 10 kg more, perhaps 15 depending on how I&amp;#39;d look at 59 kg (my initial goal weight).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then in september I started a new job, with irregular working times and many late hours...and slowly but surely bad habits started to creep back in because of the stress of the job. Getting home late and not feeling up for the gym anymore. Working a late shift and ordering takeaway because I was too tired to cook anymore. By mid-2016, I&amp;#39;d gained back 15 kg and got back to 84 kg, a weight I maintained for a few months, losing and regaining the same 1-2 kg every time. I got back to my mental bad place of continuous self loathing and not caring about how I felt or looked at all anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mental state got worse and worse, and it all just kept piling up; I felt awful in general, I was still depressed, I was still socially anxious and isolated, I was still fat and getting bigger as I went, I was still stressed out, I was still feeling like a lesser person - at one point I could barely take it anymore. I befriended a few of my coworkers; one of them is now one of my best friends and she has helped me a great deal on the whole self hate and body image thing. The anxiety lessened a little bit, though it&amp;#39;s still very prominent and hinders me a lot. Still, I&amp;#39;ve made quite some progress in this regard. Then another coworker I was talking to suggested therapy for my social anxiety, as he&amp;#39;d had similar issues and they&amp;#39;d improved for him after therapy. It took me another few weeks and some more nudges in the right direction from my close friends, but then I finally did it. Finally feeling ready (and I suppose, finally feeling like it was worth the effort), I stepped up and got a referral for a psychologist via my GP. I was referred for depression originally, but the psych I was seeing concluded quickly that I wasn&amp;#39;t depressed - it was something, in her words, that lay &amp;quot;a lot deeper than that&amp;quot;. She diagnosed me with a personality disorder I&amp;#39;d never heard of but which fits me to a T, and referred me to another psychologist who specialises in personality disorders. I&amp;#39;m seeing her once a week now, and though it hasn&amp;#39;t been going on for very long, I feel like I&amp;#39;m finally taking a step forward instead of going back in circles every time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On 1 january 2017, only a few weeks into therapy, I decided that since I was now ready to work on my mental state, I&amp;#39;d also be focussing on my physical state again. New year new me and all of that. I&amp;#39;m still at the same job and I still work many irregular hours, but as I&amp;#39;m now consciously working on my mental state I&amp;#39;m also in a place where I know I won&amp;#39;t likely self-sabotage as much as I did before. It was like this endless cycle: my physical state would drag me down mentally, so I&amp;#39;d make myself feel better with coping food, thus worsening the weight problem, thus feeling worse again, thus reaching for comfort food again, etcetera... I feel like I&amp;#39;m finally actively working on putting a stop to that cycle. I&amp;#39;ve finally managed to balance working out, cooking healthy for myself every day, and my job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since starting over this january around 84kg, I&amp;#39;m now back down at 73kg again. I&amp;#39;ve been going to the gym occasionally (though not as often as I want to), I&amp;#39;ve been at it with CICO again, I&amp;#39;ve generally cut junk out of my diet. I cannot say I feel fantastic, but I feel better. I feel motivated to keep going. I feel like it&amp;#39;s finally worth the effort to keep going. Like &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m&lt;/em&gt; finally worth the effort to keep going. I still have a long way to go, both in regards to my mental state and my weight, but it&amp;#39;s no longer feeling like an impossible task. I&amp;#39;m finally seeing that my weight wasn&amp;#39;t the roadblock keeping me back from living life, my disorder was. And now that I&amp;#39;ve finally got that clear, I&amp;#39;m going to work on overcoming both of them. One step at a time. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for how I&amp;#39;ve done it: I didn&amp;#39;t slowly phase out stuff, the truly bad foods I just cut out cold turkey. I&amp;#39;ve replaced soda with pepsi max (so glad this is a thing that exists or I would not be doing nearly so well), other than that I only drink water or tea. I eat a truckload of vegetables at dinner, sometimes with lunch as well. I don&amp;#39;t particularly like fruit so I&amp;#39;m eating a lot less of that than I should... but anyway. Breakfast is usually something quick before work (oats, or yogurt, or toast, or an egg, something along those lines). My meals generally are 300-400 cal each, with the remaining bit leaving room for snacks. I stick to a 1200-1400 cal daily budget depending on how much I feel I need during the day. Or sometimes I don&amp;#39;t feel well for the day and eat at maintenance instead, that&amp;#39;s completely fine too. It slows me down in the long run, but I&amp;#39;ve come to accept that I can&amp;#39;t do perfectly all of the time. I try to go to the gym 3-4 times a week and mostly focus on cardio as it&amp;#39;s fat loss I&amp;#39;m focussed on currently. Will start to get back into strength once I get closer to my goal. When at the gym I usually opt for running (I got close to finishing c25k on my last weight loss attempt and really got into running then), or rowing, or a combination of the two. Plus I go to work by bike almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading if you made it this far :) if anyone has any questions feel free!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Tldr: several failed weight loss attempts, recently discovered mental disorder dragging me down, now receiving treatment for said disorder and finally feeling to be moving ahead &amp;amp; losing the weight for real this time.

The thing is: the blonde in my older picture is also a dyed colour. My natural colour is actually a more pale light blonde, with eyebrows to match. In other words: if I don't draw them on or fill them in, I basically have no eyebrows at all, they're so light, haha. I've dyed my hair bright red for a year or so, and I filled in my eyebrows in dark blonde then, which wasn't the best, but they matched well enough (my original colour was non-existent in contrast to my hair). Then I went to this current colour and my brows were just way too light in comparison if I kept doing them dark blonde... so I went with a matching colour instead. It just didn't look right to me, my face looks really weird without noticeable brows (imo).\n\nAlso I'm just generally a big noob at makeup. When you go through your teens never feeling pretty you don't get as tempted to experiment with makeup so I never did, and I still haven't gotten into it for pretty much the same reason... 'Doing makeup' for me is doing my eyebrows and that's it. If I'm feeling fancy I add mascara and on some occasions lipstick and eyeliner. That's it. So my skills don't go much further than simply grabbing an eyebrow pencil in a colour I think looks ok, and roll with it for however long I keep that hair colour, haha...\n\nThat being said, I'll make sure to remember the next time I'm buying makeup, just to be sure ;p thanks for the tip!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Haha, I get what you mean, I guess. The thing is: the blonde in my older picture is also a dyed colour. My natural colour is actually a more pale light blonde, with eyebrows to match. In other words: if I don&amp;#39;t draw them on or fill them in, I basically have no eyebrows at all, they&amp;#39;re so light, haha. I&amp;#39;ve dyed my hair bright red for a year or so, and I filled in my eyebrows in dark blonde then, which wasn&amp;#39;t the best, but they matched well enough (my original colour was non-existent in contrast to my hair). Then I went to this current colour and my brows were just way too light in comparison if I kept doing them dark blonde... so I went with a matching colour instead.
