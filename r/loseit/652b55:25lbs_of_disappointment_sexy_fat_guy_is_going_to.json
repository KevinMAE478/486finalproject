I hadn't stepped on a scale since high school. I weighed 118 ( too thin) going into pregnancy. I struggled with an eating disorder from about 6 years old, and even at the Drs office, I have stepped on scales backwards.  To make matters worse, my husband is built like Brock Lesnar, so i look and feel small next to him. \n\nBut that number.... got a new doctor,  and she made me look. She told me \"no way,  even if you lose some muscle, that number has to drop. Your  frame is small,  you are shortening your life,  there is major fat with that muscle.

I&amp;#39;m 5 foot 11, so I don&amp;#39;t look fat, but definitely plus size, in shape, I workout daily and have my whole adult life. I  run 5ks, I am very strong . No doctor had ever told me I have a small frame, and should not be 248, size 16 pants. I&amp;#39;ve had 6 kids, ( a set of twins first) and due to my well defined muscle and breast implants d, I guess I looked healthy?

I hadn&amp;#39;t stepped on a scale since high school. I weighed 118 ( too thin) going into pregnancy.
