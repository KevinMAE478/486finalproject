It also gets you away from the kitchen for that period of time after eating when you think you're still hungry but you're not.\n\n * If you're a sweets person, leave calories for dessert. I'm an incurable sweet tooth, so I always leave some calories for a bowl of berries with whipped cream, some dark chocolate, or some halo top. I'm always much more satisfied and feel less deprived if I end the meal on something sweet.\n\n * Sip on some herbal tea for the rest of the evening.
