I had to buy a dress for a Christmas party. I guess I hadn&amp;#39;t even worn much outside of jeans and baggy hoodies for a long time so I was just in shock that my body looked the way it did.

Especially &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/Jbgfw\"&gt;these ones&lt;/a&gt; taken shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember looking at my face in these pictures and thinking, &lt;em&gt;is that seriously my face?

I didn&amp;#39;t recognize myself anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a long journey since then.

I gradually changed my eating habits, made an effort to try new activities, and focused on becoming the person that I wanted to be.

Now it seems like every candid picture has the opposite effect. I&amp;#39;m like, damn that&amp;#39;s me? I look\u2026 healthy. And normal. And sometimes even strong. It&amp;#39;s taking a while for my mind to catch up to my body. While I&amp;#39;m so much more confident than I used to be, I still struggle with seeing myself as who I am now.
