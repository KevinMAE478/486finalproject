I weighed 338.8 pounds and was feeling miserable every day.  At The Camp they do 6 week challenges where the goal is to lose 20 pounds by working out 5 days a week and following a pretty strict nutrition plan.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then I have finished two challenges and lost a total of 64.3 pounds.  I&amp;#39;ve been tracking my food with MFP and average about 1400-1600 calories a day.  Lots of lean protein, low glycemic index carbs, and vegetables.  Have I been perfect on the diet?  Hell no.
