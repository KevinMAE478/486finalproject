Suppose you're losing towels (i.e fat) at a constant rate k with respect to time t, so that dV/dt = -k. We're interested in the rate dr/dt at which the waistline appears to change over time.

That is, at the start when the radius is big, the denominator above is big so the rate of change is small, whereas when the radius is smaller the denominator is small so the rate of change is big. The waistline change accelerates as you lose.\n\nThe moral of the story is that you shouldn't get discouraged if you don't notice big changes in your waistline right away; remember that your fat loss

You bet.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg7s7ap", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492129077.0, "created_utc": 1492100277.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ikq8", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "temp4adhd", "parent_id": "t3_653oju", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Is there a calculator online where I can put in my height and weight and calculate how little I'd have to weigh to have a 25 inch waistline?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a calculator online where I can put in my height and weight and calculate how little I&amp;#39;d have to weigh to have a 25 inch waistline?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg7ikq8", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492117818.0, "created_utc": 1492089018.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653oju", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7ku37", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "razumdarsayswhat", "parent_id": "t3_653oju", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ohgod calculus flashbacks.. *eyes glaze over*\n\nActually, this is really cool! :D ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohgod calculus flashbacks.. &lt;em&gt;eyes glaze over&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, this is really cool! :D &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg7ku37", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492120857.0, "created_utc": 1492092057.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_653oju", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7l9kr", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Norcalgirl79", "parent_id": "t3_653oju", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have lost 50 pounds and not a ton of people have noticed which is fine.
