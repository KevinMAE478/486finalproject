In that second post I set some goals that I did not meet. I have made significant progress, but I stalled for a long time. Winter was hard on me.

While this is technically true, without my focus on DDR I would not be motivated to keep a healthy diet. When I eat poorly I am immediately adversely affected by what I&amp;#39;ve eaten and my performance drops significantly.
