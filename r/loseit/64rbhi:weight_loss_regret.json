And I think its a great motivation to see where you&amp;#39;ve come from and where you are when you can see a difference, even though the scale might be moving slowly, or at least slower than you&amp;#39;d like. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just know that for myself, it would have been just another excuse to have &amp;quot;one last meal&amp;quot; or reason to eat my feelings and feel defeated before even starting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Congrats on your weight loss! And congrats on taking those during pictures today! Hopefully that will help you, I&amp;#39;ve heard from so many people who really feel taking those pictures and comparing as you lose can help keep you going during the harder times. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg4zn96", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491976400.0, "created_utc": 1491947600.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64rbhi", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg50s8h", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Juana-Mo", "parent_id": "t3_64rbhi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Me too!
