Of course, the restaurant had zero nutrition information on their website, and MFP didn&amp;#39;t have much to go on either. After reading a helpful article I decided to just go for a small margarita on the rocks and leave it at that. Weelll....the end of the day rolls around and we get to the place and I am starving. It had been about five hours since I last ate and next thing I know I am sitting in front of a delicious looking bowl of chips and salsa. When all was said and done I ended up eating a (generous) handful of chips, a $2.00 taco (it tasted better knowing it was only two bucks), and the margarita. And you know what? According to MFP with my (high) estimates I was only about 400 calories over for the day. I ended up clocking under my calories when I included my Fitbit steps and I was still waaay under when I changed it to maintenance. And today, I get back on the wagon. Just because I had fun last night, does not mean my life is over, I stop going to gym and start eating whatever comes my way. I think this is the most important lesson I have learned so far in this journey - yes I can still have fun and eat &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt;, just not all the &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; and I have to balance that out with a healthy diet.
