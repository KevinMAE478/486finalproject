I have to let this out. You've triggered me. I have a lot of feelings about Plexus. \n\nFour people on my friends list, two of whom REALLY should know better, are hawking Plexus. What's in it? Who f'ing knows?! It has \"coffee bean extract,\" which is so much better than coffee! But, I mean, isn't *coffee* coffee bean extract? What is being extracted? Is this a code word for \"caffeine pill\" so you can slip it by the FDA? But wait! It has chromium! Great, you can buy a chromium supplement for $2.47 at CVS, so what exactly is in this stuff that causes it to retail for $89.99 a month, plus a $30 \"ambassador\" fee? Definitely not hoodia! Just synthetic hoodia under another name! They change the names on the labels and then promote their \"dramatic reformulation\" as if it is due to something other than whatever the fuck supplement powder China is selling the cheapest at that moment. \n\nBut wait! There's more! They are also constantly talking about how \"candida\" is the cause of literally every disease known to man. No it isn't, but who are we to spit science in the face of all the miracle cures that your friend's friend's aunt's ex-girlfriend have experienced through Plexus? Also, they're making so much money just by posting to social media! Except they can't be making that much money, because each dose of the hashtag-crazyawesomepinkdrink costs like $3, and all of them are doubling up on \"crazy days!\" Plus taking half a dozen other products from the line, from probiotics to \"pain relief\" (it's turmeric) to a \"natural\" caffeine pill (caffeine and a caffeine analog). \n\nI honestly think one of these women is on the verge of a mental breakdown, because her main form of marketing Plexus is telling the story of how she used to be so depressed and have such a hard time taking care of her children without yelling at them and being a terrible, mean mom, but then Jesus brought Plexus into her life because he DOES answer prayer and now she just feels AMAZING! all the time. Except when she doesn't, but let's be real, girls. It's not a miracle cure. It takes *time* and *commitment* to Plexus to really \"get healthy.\" It's like saying \"Plexus makes it all better\" has finally given her permission to talk about how hard her life is, but in the weirdest and most delusional way possible. The day of reckoning is going to come eventually, and it's not going to be pretty. \n\nJust to put the icing on the cake, the Australian government did lab testing and determined that the \"Accelerator\" product contained an illegal stimulant, DMAA, that was not listed on the label and is \"banned\" by the FDA in the US (a totally toothless ban, since the FDA can't even shut down the people who are selling the stimulant *as* DMAA, much less those not listing it on the label). \n\nEvery six months or so, they do a \"slim down\" challenge, drink Plexus shakes for breakfast every morning, and all lose negligible amounts of weight, which they list as \"total inches,\" meaning they add up any inches \"lost\" from their arms, thighs, waists, and god knows where else. \n\nMy inner antagonist badly wants to start openly parodying their sales posts, extolling the virtues of my hashtag-crazyawesomecleardrink, water, and how it really balances my gut and restores me to full health.

I have a lot of feelings about Plexus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four people on my friends list, two of whom REALLY should know better, are hawking Plexus. What&amp;#39;s in it? Who f&amp;#39;ing knows?! It has &amp;quot;coffee bean extract,&amp;quot; which is so much better than coffee! But, I mean, isn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;coffee&lt;/em&gt; coffee bean extract? What is being extracted? Is this a code word for &amp;quot;caffeine pill&amp;quot; so you can slip it by the FDA? But wait! It has chromium! Great, you can buy a chromium supplement for $2.47 at CVS, so what exactly is in this stuff that causes it to retail for $89.99 a month, plus a $30 &amp;quot;ambassador&amp;quot; fee? Definitely not hoodia! Just synthetic hoodia under another name! They change the names on the labels and then promote their &amp;quot;dramatic reformulation&amp;quot; as if it is due to something other than whatever the fuck supplement powder China is selling the cheapest at that moment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But wait! There&amp;#39;s more! They are also constantly talking about how &amp;quot;candida&amp;quot; is the cause of literally every disease known to man. No it isn&amp;#39;t, but who are we to spit science in the face of all the miracle cures that your friend&amp;#39;s friend&amp;#39;s aunt&amp;#39;s ex-girlfriend have experienced through Plexus? Also, they&amp;#39;re making so much money just by posting to social media!

Except when she doesn&amp;#39;t, but let&amp;#39;s be real, girls. It&amp;#39;s not a miracle cure. It takes &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;commitment&lt;/em&gt; to Plexus to really &amp;quot;get healthy.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s like saying &amp;quot;Plexus makes it all better&amp;quot; has finally given her permission to talk about how hard her life is, but in the weirdest and most delusional way possible.
