From my own experience (everyone is different) I&amp;#39;d suggest cutting 150 to 300 calories out for a few days before making the next jump down. Give your body a little bit of time to adjust, especially when it comes to eating at a deficient. Also, I know this is cliche advice but pay attention to the quality of your food too. You&amp;#39;re going to feel bad if you&amp;#39;re eating crap vs healthier foods, but if you add in a lot of fiber all of a sudden you can expect some gastrointestinal discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dgcrrg6", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492415006.0, "created_utc": 1492386206.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ozk2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ozk2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ozk2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcv04s", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BugZwugZ", "parent_id": "t1_dgcs5vb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Physical activity makes very little impact.

So a calorie goal of 1570 is going to give you a daily calorie deficit of about 257 or about half a pound per week. That's a pretty modest deficit and one that can be easily masked for a while on the scale by water weight fluctuations. Additionally, it seems like you're eating back your exercise calories. That's fine, but you should be aware that most calorie counters overestimate how much you burn through exercise. For that reason, many folks here try to limit themselves to eating back only half of their estimated exercise calories.\n\n2. Not using a food scale to measure out portions. If you're not currently using one, check out this video for an illustration of why food scales are so important: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjKPIcI51lU&amp;feature=youtu.be. You can get a food scale for about $10 on Amazon and it's seriously the best $10 I've ever spent.\n\n3. Not counting *everything* you're eating, including little stuff like oil you cook with, creamer in your coffee, bites you take to taste things, etc.\n\n4. Not being accurate with your logging entries. This can mean weighing stuff when it's cooked rather than raw (if the entry your using is for raw, as most are), using generic recipes rather than entering in individual ingredients, etc.\n\nThe final possibility is a legit medical issue.
