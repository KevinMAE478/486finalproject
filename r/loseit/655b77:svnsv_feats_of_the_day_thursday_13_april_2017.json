Up until Thanksgiving last year, I was eating about 700-1000 calories a day in sugar to treat my depression. I would typically a pint Ben and Jerry's ice cream, or 3 doughnuts, or an entire box of Oreos. But of all the things I was addicted to, I would say the Double Chocolate Loaf Cake at Starbucks was the hardest to avoid. I work right next to a Starbucks and almost every day I worked I would get a latte and a double chocolate loaf cake. It is freaking amazing. \n\nLast fall after talking to a psychologist and reading a few books, I decided I needed to stop self treating my depression with sugar and make a plan. Part of the plan was cutting out almost all sugar. However, I do allow myself one 500 calorie dessert a week. I found replacements for my other desserts, including a pint of Halo Top or Arctic Zero ice cream (150-250 calories) in place of Ben and Jerry's. I also decided that I still like coffee, so I still go get a coffee at Starbucks, but I just get a black coffee or iced coffee. \n\nThe other part of treating the depression was to understand that I was eating because I was sad.

This got long, sorry! :/ \n\nA little backstory- I have been back on the CICO horse in a big way for the past few weeks (I had slipped into maintenance mode for a couple of months but am now losing again- 5 lbs down in 3 weeks) and having family in town this week means several meals eaten out, meals at others' houses, etc. in the evenings. It *shouldn't* be a HUGE deal for me since I do IF and only eat 300 calories before 6 p.m., so I usually have about 900 calories left to play with at night, but we all know how quickly even that many calories can go at a restaurant or someone else's house! I totally believe in a cheat meal every now and then (maybe every 2-3 weeks) even when I am losing weight, but I am not in the mood to cheat right now because I'm feeling both extremely disciplined and motivated to stay on track, so any \"cheat\" is not actually enjoyable to me at this time (so, not worth it).\n\nAnyway, I had lunch with my parents and their friends who were in town for the day at a local restaurant known for its fried food and large portions, and I got a grilled cheese sandwich (I've had one there previously and I knew they are small) with a side salad (no chips or fries). I ate half the sandwich and not even the salad (it was all lettuce, boring) and brought the other half home with me. I ate my two Babybel cheeses for snacks (I'd had an apple for breakfast) and was satisfied. Good food decision, but in my head I was saving room for dinner at my aunt's house because I knew that she was making me spaghetti &amp; meatballs, my favorite. \n\nSo then we had dinner at my aunt's house with other relatives who are in town. My aunt had made everyone else seafood but I don't eat seafood so she made me the spaghetti (she's the best!) I had a very small serving of pasta (maybe 1/3 of a serving) and two meatballs (delicious) and... this is the big one... SKIPPED THE GARLIC BREAD. I have never not eaten bread that has been on the table in my life (at least, not in the past 10 years), it's my biggest weakness by far. But it just was NOT worth it to me in the moment. My aunt gave me a doggie bag with pasta, meatballs, and bread, but I actually threw it away (I never throw food away, but there was no one to give it away to in this case) because I just. don't. want. it. That was the 2nd big moment for me. \n\nI did enjoy a couple of glasses of wine but they fit within my calories so I don't consider them a cheat. I was up late and ate the other half of my small grilled cheese as a snack and it was the perfect amount of food! I'm really feeling happy today. Usually when I come back from my family's house, I have overeaten and am very bloated the next day, but this morning my tightest pants felt perfect on me. :D", "edited": 1492104505.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of big NSVs for me yesterday (they will definitely sound small lol, but, huge for me personally).

As ridiculous as that sounds, that really is what got me to buy that damn gym groupon and try again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, while I&amp;#39;ve joined gyms before, this is the first time it&amp;#39;s really stuck and I really have to credit that to getting a personal trainer. It&amp;#39;s not the economical way to lose weight, that&amp;#39;s for sure, but it&amp;#39;s really been the best thing that has kept me accountable and motivated--mostly out of fear that if I don&amp;#39;t eat healthy (my trainer has me set up on a general plan outlining apprx macro goals and calories, between 1400-1600/day) or keep up my training and stay relaxed between sessions, I&amp;#39;ll DIE when our next session comes around and I&amp;#39;m out of shape (very nearly happened when I went on vacation and came back 2 weeks later after having definitely not gone to the gym once, despite bringing my stuff....). But it&amp;#39;s truly been the most motivating thing through this whole journey--from the actual things I learn to do and the community of people I have met as a result, and hearing from the other people that they are really seeing a difference and they can see how hard I am working and the results are paying off is so amazing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, sorry for the long post. I feel amazing today, despite the DOMS. 40lbs. While I&amp;#39;m still far from my goal, and I know I&amp;#39;ve got lots of things to work on like better, consistent eating habits and consistency with that god damn cardio, it just feels to fucking attainable. Like shit. I&amp;#39;ve done 40lbs. I&amp;#39;m gonna crush it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg7oizs", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492125148.0, "created_utc": 1492096348.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655b77", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655b77", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_655b77", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg88972", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "49mercury", "parent_id": "t1_dg7r48m", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you so much.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg88972", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492146470.0, "created_utc": 1492117670.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7r48m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "fritom0jito", "parent_id": "t1_dg7oa2b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Your progress is great, and really inspiring!
