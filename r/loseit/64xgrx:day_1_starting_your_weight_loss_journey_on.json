If you do this, you will lose weight over the long term. This is often summarized by the term &amp;quot;Calories in, Calories out&amp;quot;, or CICO.

Don&amp;#39;t worry about any calorie goals just yet.  Get used to the process; Read the information on your food packaging, weigh all of the things you eat and drink, and accurately record the amount of calories you consume in your calorie tracker. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider using a &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004164SRA?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00\"&gt;food scale&lt;/a&gt; to measure portions, at least for the first couple months of counting.

Life is full of detours.  Plans change.  &lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s okay!&lt;/em&gt;  Keep logging.  If you&amp;#39;re logging, you haven&amp;#39;t quit.  If you are logging through a crisis, you&amp;#39;re back on track as soon as your next meal.  Don&amp;#39;t quit.  It is your log, it is not your judge.  The goal isn&amp;#39;t to have the perfect log, it is to have the information that will help you gain awareness and then control over your eating and your weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20080708/keeping-food-diary-helps-lose-weight\"&gt;[Further Reading: Studies Show that Logging Helps Lose Weight]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Week 2: Set a Goal for your Intake&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that you are used to logging, you can start focusing on a calorie goal.  Enter at most 1 lb/week weight loss into myFitnessPal, and it will provide you with a calorie goal.  For this week, do your best to stay within 100 calories of this goal, but don&amp;#39;t worry if you go over.  You will be gradually working toward this goal in the coming weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t already, take progress pictures of yourself, and start recording your weight every day.  Remember that your weight will fluctuate quite a bit day to day, so enter your weight into your calorie tracker to see the long term trend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Week 3 and On: Make a Small Improvement Each Week.&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For weight loss to be permanent, your plan needs to be sustainable.  It is best to make slow, gradual changes that will cause you to develop better eating habits.  Overhauling your life may get you quick results at first, but you are much more likely to gain back any weight you lose in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each week from now on, make a small, actionable change to your lifestyle .  Keep in mind that it is a lot easier to replace things than to eliminate them.  A few examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;replace a nightly bag of chips with a bag of air popped popcorn or an apple&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;replace a side at dinner with a vegetable&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;order a healthier option at a restaurant you frequent&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;walk for 20 minutes a couple days this week&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use your logs from the previous couple weeks to see where you can make small changes to get closer to your calorie goal.  Look for the &amp;quot;low hanging fruit&amp;quot; that give you more calories for smaller changes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wisdomination.com/practical-discipline/\"&gt;[Further Reading: Practical Discipline]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;I still have questions!&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are still unsure, the &lt;a href=\"/r/loseit\"&gt;/r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; community is always happy to help you get started.  First, take a look at some of the common questions we see in the FAQ: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/faq\"&gt;/r/loseit FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for more details, check out the compendium, which has a lot of detail on all things weight loss: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki\"&gt;/r/loseit Compendium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How to Stick with It&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having a plan is a great start, but no plan will work if you don&amp;#39;t stick with it.  Follow these guidelines to make it easier to stick with this plan or any other one:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Make the good choice the easy choice&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Losing weight takes discipline, but the less you have to exert your willpower, the better.  Always have low calorie, filling foods easily available to you.  A few examples are apples, oranges, and light popcorn.  Keep these front and center.  Don&amp;#39;t buy large packs of junk food.  If you want to get junk, go to a convenience store and get a single portion.  It is easier to use willpower once at the store than for the rest of the week at home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to go hungry&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should be able to eat your target calories without constantly being hungry.  Making good decisions is much easier if you aren&amp;#39;t hungry.  If you need to slow down your progress, so be it; it is better to lose slower than to give up.  It can also help to eat more filling foods, typically food with more fat, protein, and fiber.  Simple sugars are less filling and can even make you hungrier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, keep in mind that cravings and hunger are different.  To identify if you are really hungry, think about if you would eat an apple or other fruit.  If not, you are experiencing a craving; these will get less severe in time as your body adjusts to changes you are making.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Be consistent&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eating the same thing for a meal most days (for example having the same lunch at work each day or the same afternoon snack) makes it the choice you don&amp;#39;t have to think about, so you are more likely to keep having it and stay away from less healthy choices.  We are very inclined to choose something that our brain considers a default &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-science-willpower/201003/why-habits-are-hard-change-and-printers-hard-buy\"&gt;[Further Reading - Why Habits Are hard To Change]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Plan Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people prepare a week&amp;#39;s worth of meals over the weekend and have them for lunch and dinner throughout the week.  If you eat out often, look at the menu online before you go and decide what you will order beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/mealprepsunday\"&gt;[Further Reading - Find ideas for meal prep on /r/mealprepsunday]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;When Things Go Wrong&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will inevitably have days where you do not follow your plan, but keep in mind that these days will only be a problem if you let them derail you.  The ideas in this section will help keep you on track through the tougher times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Have a Baseline&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When starting weight loss, you will probably feel very motivated to keep going.  But as you progress, your initial motivation will wane and it is easy to get discouraged.  As you progress, have a baseline for things you do when you are feeling discouraged or unmotivated, things you do no matter what.  For example, you might stop going to the gym for a couple weeks, but you maintain a baseline of logging your calories and eating 200 calories below maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Have a support system to keep you accountable&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is helpful to be a part of a community of people who are also losing weight, such as &lt;a href=\"/r/loseit\"&gt;/r/loseit&lt;/a&gt;, TOPS, or weight watchers.

For most of my life I was skinny, but it was because I was poor and often didn't have anything to eat unless it was provided by a school. Needless to say, I didn't learn how to count calories or eat healthy. That was a luxury.\n\nI lost a parental figure right before starting college, and battled with mild depression for a while. THEN I started graduate school and I felt dumb and unworthy compared to my peers. I didn't have a lot of friends after graduation and I had a really hard time making friends with my cohort. I didn't realize it at the time, but my depression was getting worse. I didn't leave my house except for class, and sometimes I would even skip that. I ate away my stress, sadness, loneliness.. really everything. I live with my fiance, and he and my cat were basically the only things keeping me going. I went from 125 to 183 in less than two years.\n\nI hate my body. Unless I see myself in the mirror, my brain still \"sees\" the old me. I have angry red stretchmarks everywhere, and especially the ones on my stomach are hard to look at. I feel ugly, and that makes it even harder to meet new people or even leave the house. But I'm sick of feeling unattractive. I don't want to be unhealthy. I realized that I couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs without gasping for air.\n\nLast week I finally decided to do something about it, instead of just wishing I could change. I used to have food delivered a lot, and I was eating huuuuge portion sizes. Now, I'm sticking to 1200 calories per day. It was so hard the first day or two, because I felt really hungry and I questioned if I could do this. Then, one day I woke up and that 1200 felt so filling.\n\nI'm making sure to eat lots of veggies, mostly broccoli and carrots. Chicken and eggs are my new best friends. I found low-cal yogurt!! I've become addicted to sugar, so instead of quitting that completely I switched to zero calorie soda. I hope to switch entirely to water at some point. In the near future I want to start exercising too, but I've never done it and it's still a scary concept to me. I have a lot of questions that I'm afraid to ask, but I'm sure I'll work up the courage eventually.

Learning about CICO and using myfitnesspal was the key for me. \n\nThis is how CICO (caloreis in, calories out) works:\n\n- We need a certain amount of energy to function. The amount of energy you need to function, at rest, is called your BMR. Seeing as you're walking and talking and picking your nose most of the time, rather than resting, your even your sedentary Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE - how many calories you burn in the average day) is usually a bit higher than your BMR.\n\n- Energy is measured in calories. By doing some math with your height, weight, age and sex, you can figure out what your BMR, and your Total Daily Energy Expenditure are - this may vary, depending on your stats.\n\n- When you eat MORE calories than your daily expenditure, you store the extra energy as fat. When you eat LESS calories than your daily expenditure, you use the fat you've stored for that extra energy. That's what people refer to as burning calories.\n\n- During weight loss, most people aim to eat 500-1000 calories less than their TDEE. Just under 1lb/0.5kg of body fat contains 3500 calories your body can use. So every time you eat 3500 less calories than you need, you lose about 1lb/0.5kg of body fat. That 3500 calories is usually spread over the course of a week - because 500x7=3500.\n\n- That means that most people, who are eating between 500-1000 calories less than their TDEE every day, lose about 1lb/0.5-2lb/1kg of body fat per week - though that can go up and down, because our bodies are full of water, which weighs a lot, and comes and goes as we eat, drink, excrete and eliminate.\n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll explain TDEE and why we always advocate tracking on this sub&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing with tracking.

Hopefully this time will be different, and I&amp;#39;ll finally be able to confidently say that I like my body by the end of the summer. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg64g6l", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492043696.0, "created_utc": 1492014896.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xgrx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xgrx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xgrx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xgrx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xgrx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xgrx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xgrx", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64xgrx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6d3ai", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hxcjosh23", "parent_id": "t1_dg6cs1o", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/loseit", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; I just started my journey on Monday via a keto diet and was wondering if anyone more knowledgable could help me out?\n\nBased on that I assumed it was your first go round, hence my advice.

Do not drink any sodas - sugary drinks, or fruit juices don't consume sugar at all to be honest, only drink Teas, water. Only Coffee - with sweetener.

Also nuts.  That's about it. I of course miss all the tasty snacks and lovely Juicy Burgers, who doesn't, However i desperately want to sort myself out.

I 'technically' started Sunday when I bought an apple watch and started tracking calories/exercise. I set a move goal on there, and I plan on eating or at least tracking 1/3 of the calories I burn during intentional exercise like biking/running. I saw my friend over the weekend who just looks HEALTHY. She's thinner, but she's got strong muscles on her. She eats reasonable amounts and exercises. She's so healthy and athletic! I realized I could be that way too. \n\nCounting calories is mentally tough for me. I *hate* feeling deprived of anything. I actually maintain my weight very well as long as I'm eating whole foods. Once I eat anything processed (oil, sugar, cookies, etc) however, I gain weight QUICK since it's so calorically dense and I eat large volume foods on a regular basis.\n\nI've failed to meet my calorie goals on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.

I also have a 'move' goal on my apple watch to burn 500 calories a day through exercise and general walking/stairs.

I imagined myself replacing those calories today with WHOLESOME foods like more oats, salad, and potatoes and I was immediately encouraged to get back on it!!

Also my best friend is getting married in a year and I&amp;#39;m MOH....those wedding photos will last forever so got to look my best! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My biggest struggle is discipline, I struggle to commit to counting calories or an exercise programme, so we will see how I get on, maybe this is the last day one I have or maybe I will have more day ones yet to come. But for now, thank you &lt;a href=\"/r/loseit\"&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; for being an inspiration to a fat girl whose trying to learn to love herself :) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "loseit", "name": "t1_dg5sc0m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492028658.0, "created_utc": 1491999858.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
