I was also diagnosed with gluten intolerance so I knew I needed to make a lifestyle change anyway. Over the course of a year I took things really slow and dropped about forty pounds total. I started eating better and working out. I never thought I&amp;#39;d say this but I LOVE Zumba.

This is one of the first times in my life where I find myself willing to be in/take pictures. I have a long way to go, but I&amp;#39;m starting to feel more comfortable with myself. The most rewarding part? I know that I won&amp;#39;t be going back to the first picture. It is so much easier to maintain counting calories then any other &amp;quot;diet&amp;quot; because this isn&amp;#39;t a diet, it&amp;#39;s a lifestyle change.
