Once again our weekly meetup shall be held at the Elysian Brewery on E. Pike St. and 13th avenue. It will start up at 7:30 pm and goes till about 11 pm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend showing up at 7:15 pm if you have something in particular you want to make sure gets played or if you&amp;#39;re a bit nervous about showing up. A lot of the regulars show up around then and get food started and socialize. So come out and eat, drink, and be merry!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are normally located in the seating area downstairs against the wall, look for the weirdos with the bags of games! If you don&amp;#39;t see games out on the table immediately, fear not! Usually the first half hour we&amp;#39;re getting food and drinks and chatting till we form different game groups. Depending on the night we typically get from 20-30 players and we play social games, strategic games, and whatever other games you could imagine/supply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We always have games* to share, but feel free to bring any games you wish to play. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note on etiquette: when attending keep in mind this is a public bar/restaurant and please order something, whether its a beer/drink or a snack.&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FAQ: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q:Is this weekly? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Yes, at the same time and place unless its a major holiday or the Elysian is closed. However, I don&amp;#39;t always make the post every week if I feel like we&amp;#39;ve been a bit too busy or the Elysian has been too packed. But if I am cancelling the event I will always make an &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s cancelled&amp;quot; post.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q: What&amp;#39;s the typical demographics of the event?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: We&amp;#39;re a mixed bunch of weirdos, but on average people tend to be around 25-30 years old and more boys than gals typically (tho I&amp;#39;m a gal, go figure), and a lot of software engineers (tho I&amp;#39;m not, go figure). However, there&amp;#39;s outliers and we welcome all comers!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q:  Do I have to order at the bar?     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: No, and actually pleaseeee don&amp;#39;t! We have waiter service and it complicates matters to have some people order at the bar.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q: Do I have to bring games?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: No, we always have plenty of games, but if you have something to bring we&amp;#39;d love you to share it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q: Can I come if I&amp;#39;m under 21?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Yes, Elysian is all ages till 11 pm.
