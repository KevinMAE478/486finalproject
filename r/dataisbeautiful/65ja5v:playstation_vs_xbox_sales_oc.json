They learned their lesson, but early adopters set the trend for a generation of consoles. Consumers want to buy the more popular option, as it&amp;#39;s generally the one they perceive to have the best support and most peers using. So once PS4 took off (like a rocket) the Xbox had trouble catching up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, and perhaps more importantly, Xbox has only ever done well in North America and some parts of the U.K. and Australia. The original Xbox in particular only really made it in the US, and even then only because of Halo. The 360 came out earlier and cheaper than the PS3, so it exploded in popularity in the US. The PS3 came out a year later, and for $100 more. Although it eventually caught up with the 360, Microsoft&amp;#39;s early lead made it a more popular choice for years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The PS4 on the other hand had a launch closer to that of the PS2: more affordable and earlier than the Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Xbox is still millions behind in the US and many millions behind worldwide. I&amp;#39;ve owned both over the years and love them both for different reasons, but I have to admit, without halo, Xbox would have been dead in the water. Now that halo is way less popular than it used to be, Xbox is struggling to attract gamers. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "name": "t1_dgbpofq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492347849.0, "created_utc": 1492319049.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbmzub", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "backtoreality00", "parent_id": "t3_65ja5v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataisbeautiful", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why is the PS4 doing so much better?
