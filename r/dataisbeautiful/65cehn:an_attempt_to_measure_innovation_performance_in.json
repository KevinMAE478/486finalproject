I took four main indicators:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-the total R&amp;amp;D (research and development) expenditure as a % of regional GDP in 2013;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-the number of people employed in high- and middle-high-tech manufacturing and in knowledge-intensive services in 2015, as a % of total employment in the region;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-the number of people employed in science and technology in 2015 as a % of the total population in the region;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-the number of high-tech patents per million inhabitants in 2012 in each region.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some rare cases I simply used the most recent data available; in the case of regional R&amp;amp;D expenditure for Switzerland I applied the national value (3%) to all Swiss regions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then assigned 1000 points to the region holding the highest value for any category and then all the points to the other regions making a simple proportion: best performing region&amp;#39;s value:1000 = region&amp;#39;s value:x. Thus for example, if the best-performing region in the &amp;quot;R&amp;amp;D expenditure&amp;quot; category has an R&amp;amp;D expenditure of 10% of GDP, a region which spends 3% of its GDP on R&amp;amp;D would get 300 points in the category.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I simply summed all the values in all the categories to come up with a final index. As you can imagine, the highest value possible is 4000; the best-performing region overall is Stockholm, with an Innovation Index of 3146.8, while the worst-performing one is Nord-Est in Romania, with an Innovation Index of 490.5.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find all the values &lt;a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/regions/data/database\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in the Eurostat database within the &amp;quot;Regional science and technology statistics&amp;quot; section.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The map was made with ArcMap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also calculated the index for NUTS1 regions and for the countries as a whole.
