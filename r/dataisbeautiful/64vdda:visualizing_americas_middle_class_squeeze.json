Household composition have changed and so has age distribution, cash wage to total compensation ratio (due to higher costs for health insurance). If anything, more households are richer than they used to be according to the data. If you look at the second chart, you see the distribution has changed so that significantly more people have higher incomes now than ever, while there are less poor people now than in 1971 (other than those near $0 income but it&amp;#39;s possible that includes retirees).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "name": "t1_dg645om", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492043392.0, "created_utc": 1492014592.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg61xvf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pissedadmin", "parent_id": "t1_dg5w26p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataisbeautiful", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You are right that the geographic visualization does not illustrate the proposition.\n\nHowever, the income distribution for the 20 cities further down on the page is a great visualization of the vanishing middle class, and how the income distribution has changed over time.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are right that the geographic visualization does not illustrate the proposition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the income distribution for the 20 cities further down on the page is a great visualization of the vanishing middle class, and how the income distribution has changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "name": "t1_dg61xvf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492041024.0, "created_utc": 1492012224.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5w26p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "holy_rollers", "parent_id": "t3_64vdda", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataisbeautiful", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Am I crazy or does the data not align with the proposition?\n\nIt is a great visualization, but it most appropriately illustrates geographic stratification of median household income.
