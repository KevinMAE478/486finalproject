After that, the tax code will benefit you more if you are a spouse in a lone-breadwinner household. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rant incoming: could it not be said that the tax code currently reinforces more traditional spousal arrangement (not in an anti-LGBT way necessarily, but in an anti-dual income way, just to clarify)? If two people are married and both are contributing to the economy with jobs that pay well - $125k each, for example - why should they have a worse tax situation than a couple who are making the same amount combined, but with a skewed distribution of earnings, where one person makes $200k and the other makes $50k? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible, perhaps, that this is just the random convergence of many unconnected rules in the tax code. I can&amp;#39;t help but wonder, though, if some of the tax rules were written in such a way that a major breadwinner could use the tax code as leverage for convincing their spouse that getting a better job would be detrimental to their taxes....and therefore, their marriage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "name": "t1_dgdq3ij", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475902.0, "created_utc": 1492447102.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk95", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65w900", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk95", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65w900", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdtnr2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Thanksforsayingthat", "parent_id": "t1_dgdqdpw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataisbeautiful", "controversiality": 0, "body": "For once I think OP has the Upshot beat.
