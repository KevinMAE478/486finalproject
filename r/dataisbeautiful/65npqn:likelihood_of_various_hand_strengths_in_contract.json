Let's take it slowly: there are 13 tricks in a round of Bridge.  If you bid, you're saying \"I think our team will win at least 7 of those tricks.\"  (You can bid to take more than 7 tricks with a stronger hand, which gives you more points, but if you fail to get the tricks you bid, you lose points.)  \"Opening\" a bid means that you're the first player on your team to state that your team will take 7 tricks.  That's risky, because you don't have any idea what cards your partner has yet.  And once you start bidding, there's no going back -- if the other side takes your bid, you have to play out the hand and win the 7 tricks.  So having a hand that qualifies as \"opening\" strength means that you have to have enough high cards in your hand that you could win most of those 7 tricks on your own, regardless of what cards your partner might have.  Think of it as being the equivalent of having sufficient hole cards in Hold 'Em poker to warrant bidding on the pot, rather than checking or folding.  \n\n\"Medium\" and \"Strong\" hands are even more powerful than \"opening.\"  They mean that you have a lot of high cards, and can win a lot of tricks on your own.
