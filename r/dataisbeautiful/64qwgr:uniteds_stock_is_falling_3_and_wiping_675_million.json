The customer in question hadn&amp;#39;t and was being removed to make room, not because of a conduct issue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is additionally complicated because the rules for bumping someone from a flight apply to &amp;quot;overbooked&amp;quot; flights. The flight in question was not overbooked - it had a full booking, with every customer accounted for, and the additional four seats they were trying to clear were a last minute attempt to convey united staff to another airport (presumably so they could attend to other flights). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The normal way to resolve this problem, as I understand it, is to offer increasingly higher compensation to buy flyers off of the flight before they board, but in this instance United chose to not offer compensation greater than $800, which was refused by all the customers, hence they randomly selected some to involuntarily bump, which you can&amp;#39;t do after boarding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;ve since learned that apparently United&amp;#39;s computer system now determines the maximum amount that employees are allowed to offer as compensation, which put a hard cap on what they could offer. Prior to their takeover by continental, this was not the case, and gate agents were authorized to raise the compensation until sufficient seats were freed - but again, this is only allowed to happen pre-boarding.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "name": "t1_dg5anim", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491990841.0, "created_utc": 1491962041.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5933g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "koncept61", "parent_id": "t1_dg58kjx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataisbeautiful", "controversiality": 0, "body": "http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/united-airlines-flight-3411-video-overbooking-chicago-louisville-security-passenger-denied-boarding-a7677601.html\n\nOnce they asked him to leave and he refused, they were able to have him removex ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/united-airlines-flight-3411-video-overbooking-chicago-louisville-security-passenger-denied-boarding-a7677601.html\"&gt;http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/united-airlines-flight-3411-video-overbooking-chicago-louisville-security-passenger-denied-boarding-a7677601.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once they asked him to leave and he refused, they were able to have him removex &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "name": "t1_dg5933g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491988798.0, "created_utc": 1491959998.0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg58kjx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "onlycomeoutatnight", "parent_id": "t1_dg50sc5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataisbeautiful", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No they can't.
