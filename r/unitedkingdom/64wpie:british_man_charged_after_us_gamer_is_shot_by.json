He advised that he had three hostages, a loaded gun, several explosive devices, and was demanding $15,000. He  provided his specific address and advised he would execute the first hostage in 15 minutes if his demands were not immediately met. \n\nPolice responded to the scene and determined Tyran Dobbs was, in fact, inside the residence with three females. They contacted the lease holder for the apartment, who advised he is Mr. Dobbs' father. According to police reports from a lieutenant and sergeant on-scene, Mr. Dobbs' father advised that there was a gun in the apartment and that he could not be sure whether or not these were credible threats from his son.  \n\nNegotiators made contact with a woman inside the apartment, who was able to exit with her child. They were immediately transported away from the scene for their safety and to be interviewed. A third female, believed to be Mr. Dobbs' girlfriend, remained inside. \n\nMr. Dobbs was initially seen by officers crawling on the floor in front of a sliding glass door. He then came to the open slider twice and both times police repeatedly directed him to come out and show his hands. Mr. Dobbs did not comply and walked back into the apartment. The third time he walked to the glass slider, Mr. Dobbs was given the same direction by officers,  but kept his hand inside the lower front of his shirt. Before he could again walk back toward the  bedroom, where a woman who may be a hostage was still inside, he was struck with two non-lethal rubber rounds to prevent him from retreating back inside the apartment. Mr. Dobbs was struck in the torso and started to fall forward. A second round also intended for his torso struck Mr. Dobbs in the face as he was falling to the ground. \n\nA doctor who is part of the county's tactical response team was on-scene and rendered immediate aid before Mr. Dobbs was transported to the hospital. In a consent search of the residence, officers located a small quantity of drugs. This is relevant  because after interviewing all of the parties involved, it was clear that the people inside the apartment believed the drugs were the reason the police were at the residence. They were not aware of the alleged hostage situation. \n\nIt was determined that this was a swatting incident. Investigators believe that Mr. Dobbs, who has been cooperative with police, was targeted by an online gamer. The investigation has led detectives to work with the FBI and Interpol, as it appears that the case may have ties in the UK.\n\n----\n\nI'll let everyone else argue about the accuracy of that statement, or who was to blame, or whether you should come outside if a SWAT team tells you to.

In a consent search of the residence, officers located a small quantity of drugs. This is relevant  because after interviewing all of the parties involved, it was clear that the people inside the apartment believed the drugs were the reason the police were at the residence. They were not aware of the alleged hostage situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was determined that this was a swatting incident. Investigators believe that Mr. Dobbs, who has been cooperative with police, was targeted by an online gamer. The investigation has led detectives to work with the FBI and Interpol, as it appears that the case may have ties in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll let everyone else argue about the accuracy of that statement, or who was to blame, or whether you should come outside if a SWAT team tells you to. But no, he was not shot while he was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dg5r4lu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492026268.0, "created_utc": 1491997468.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 162}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wpie", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wpie", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6aa4p", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "UltimateGammer", "parent_id": "t1_dg63emm", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "*Now sprinkle some crack on him Johnson and lets get outta here.*", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now sprinkle some crack on him Johnson and lets get outta here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dg6aa4p", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492049631.0, "created_utc": 1492020831.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg63emm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 14, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Barry_Scotts_Cat", "parent_id": "t1_dg5ocm5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Have you seen American Police\n\n\"Put your arms up!\"\n\n*bang bang*\n\n\"HE WAS RAISING HIS ARM!\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you seen American Police&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Put your arms up!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;bang bang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;HE WAS RAISING HIS ARM!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dg63emm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492042605.0, "created_utc": 1492013805.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wpie", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wpie", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wpie", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wpie", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6fev1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Barry_Scotts_Cat", "parent_id": "t1_dg6fdln", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Are you an armed terrorist?\"\n\n\"No?
