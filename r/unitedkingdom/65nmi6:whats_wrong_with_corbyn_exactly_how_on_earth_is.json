He then sacked me the next day when he realized he had given away part of someone else's role. But didn't bother to tell me that either. By then my office had been besieged by press and the story was out that I was Shadow Minister. I decided to make the best of it and to serve. I worked on his Arts policy whilst I was still having treatment but in Bristol.. When I went back to Westminster, I discovered that he had sacked me but hadn't told me and did not have any ideas for how I was supposed to explain it to Bristol West members or constituents. I was then faced with the choice of telling the truth - that he had made a series of errors, and inevitably thereby face a pile of criticism from his supporters - or say I had changed my mind about accepting the role - and thereby face a pile of criticism from.his supporters. And I knew the pile would arrive because I had seen how it went for others who had resigned. And because Corbyn supporters had already piled into me for disloyalty when I had had to miss votes for cancer treatment.\n\nI then, contrary to the story he keeps giving on TV, found it near on impossible to get to talk to him about this problem Eventually I did get to meet him and he had nothing to say. No idea what to do. It took my boss Maria Eagle to explain to him that as he was leader he could re appoint me if that was what he wanted. I then worked hard for him on his Arts policy, loyally didn't go to the press about the above, got stuck in and worked. And yes, I enjoyed the role, it is one of my dream jobs in parliament and I believe I did Corbyn and the Labour Party a great service, as millions of people work in the arts and culture sectors and they valued being involved in policy-making. So it was never my intention to resign.\n\nHowever, I kept hearing from other colleagues on the front bench just how difficult or impossible it was to get a decision out of him on important policy issues - the very thing Corbyn is supposed to be good on. I also noticed that the policy making process through the National Policy Forum was being slowed down by lack of decisions from Corbyn's office. But then he was missing in action during the EU referendum, including going on a week's holiday three weeks before the day. I found that unforgivable. I had re-started campaigning in this campaign, phone-canvassing to conserve my energy, and kept hearing Labour voters saying 'but your leader wants out, doesn't he?' His team didn't send anyone to the EU Campaign meetings in Westminster and his lack of enthusiasm showed.\n\nOn the day after the referendum he asked for an early Brexit. My constituents want exactly the opposite and were telling me so in their hundreds, and voted 85% to remain.\n\nThat was the tipping point for me - it is not allowed to remain on the front bench whilst taking an opposing view to the leader in something so important.\n\nI therefore had to resign.\n\nThe reason I then voted no confidence in him as leader is because I have no confidence in him as leader. See above. Plus I had found out from other front bench women how unwilling and unable Corbyn is to communicate with, listen to or work with anyone outside his narrow group.\n\nSince then he has stated publicly that he isn't prioritizing winning elections. How can I support a Labour leader who doesn't want to form a Labour government above everything? When working people, the old, the young, the poor, the country, need a Labour government above everything?\n\nI want a Labour government more than anything, because that is how we change the world and how we help millions of people, just as the 1997-2010 Labour government helped millions of people, my own family included. I profoundly wished I never had to say all this publicly, but people keep asking, and I believe they have a right to know the truth about what Corbyn's leadership is like.\n\nWe cannot win general elections with a leader who is unable and unwilling to learn how to communicate with, listen to and persuade people with whom he doesn't already agree - we need to convince swing voters who voted Tory last year in Southern seats to vote Labour next time and we need Labour voters in Wales and the North to continue to vote Labour - without this we can't win a general election.\n\nAll that is what's at stake. Not having a Labour government again is unbearable. I will do anything I can to help to ensure this. It's the constitutional duty of all Labour MPs, especially the leader, to try to secure a better life for working class people through parliamentary means. And that's what I will continue to do.\n\nI hope that's clear.\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s important that everyone reads the experience of Thangam Debbonaire MP in the facebook post she made last year:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dear everyone who has asked me what my problems are with Corbyn&amp;#39;s leadership, Here is my experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Corbyn appointed me and press released this without my knowledge or consent whilst I was in the middle of cancer treatment.

Their tax bill might go up or down slightly, but generally it makes little difference when they wake up the next morning.\n\nThat's because most people don't feel a heavy influence or reliance on the state in their day-to-day lives. Bar a couple of interactions with the NHS or the occasional call to the police, most people probably feel fairly self-sufficient. Those particularly in the middle of society, don't aspire to live in a council house, they aren't on a ZHC and they (unless they're in the South East) probably don't use public transport, so policies on those issues are a tough sell.\n\nObviously, if you live on the 'outliers' of society, such as being heavily dependent on welfare and public services or at the wealthiest end of society, a swing from left to right or right to left will be more noticeable, but it isn't really to your average Joe. So in that context, is it surprising that people are fairly apathetic towards politics in general, and that they vote on the basis of individual needs - such as wanting to reduce their tax bill, getting free childcare or using a Help to Buy scheme? And is it any surprise that they don't buy the \"Tories ruining the country\" rethoric that they get shouted at them by people who keep posting shit from The Canary on Facebook?\n\nLabour under Corbyn, I have no doubt, will be very good at talking to the former group of those outliers - the people who, for whatever reason, are heavily dependent on the state. But here is the problem;\n\n* Those people would vote Labour anyway.\n\n* They will more than likely live in a constituency that would return a Labour MP anyway.\n \n* That's if they actually do vote - the lower income demographics are historically poorer at turning up at polling stations than other demographics.\n \n* That cluster of the electorate has shrunk over recent years - more people identify themselves as 'middle class' than before, the population has aged and we see downward trends around typical Labour voter charateristics (trade union membership for example).\n\nTargeting just one section of Labour's core vote isn't going to win Corbyn any new seats because, quite simply, those people outside that core won't see what Corbyn offers them. They don't feel that the state is a big presence in their day-to-day lives, they don't feel that it needs to be and they certainly don't want to pay for it to be.\n\nOn the specific policies you listed, many of them sound great, but you really need to scratch beneath the surface to see how workable they really are. \n\nTake taxation rates on the wealthy and on corporations for example. Yes, raising the rates sounds great, but what is actually important is not the rate, but the overall revenue it generates. If a higher tax rate generates less revenue (because organisations and individuals use vehicles to legitimately make their earnings more tax efficient), then its a poor policy that works purely on a symbolic basis, rather than a practical one.\n\nRailway nationalisation is another. The key problems with our railways (infrastructure, ticket prices and capacity) are nothing to do with privatisation and are actually controlled by government. You can solve those problems without nationalisation and you can fail to solve them with nationalisation. What he is actually talking about here is increasing subsidy for the railways - and he hasn't explained by how much, or who will pay for it. \n\nIn terms of his policies on unionisation and right to strike - again, on the face of it a sound policy, but try selling that to a good proportion of Southern Rail passengers who, rightly or wrongly, aren't going to be huge fans of the RMT or Aslef right now. Also put that policy into the context of declining unionisation, particularly in the private sector, and you wonder how \"relevant\" that policy is.\n\nAs for \"industrialisation of the north\", what does this even mean in real terms? Does it mean tax payer subsidies for industries that may not be ecomonically viable? There are more than enough incentives for organisations to base themselves in Yorkshire, the North West or the North East as it stands.\n\nAnd I think that's a big issue that Corbyn has. For most of these policies, the obvious question is \"who is paying for it?\" and in a country that tends to support low tax policies at the ballot box, that's really something that he needs to address. If the lazy answer is \"the rich, Starbucks and Amazon\", then it's not enough. History suggests that taxing the rich rarely generates what the forecasts suggested it would, and that means more and more people in the middle get dragged into that bracket.

President Blair anyone?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He may oppose military interventionism but in his case he doesn&amp;#39;t even subscribe to Nato&amp;#39;s article 5 - an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/08/jeremy-corbyns-nato-stance-first-labour-leader\"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; - that simply makes him come across as weak or a pussy depending on your choice of words and certainly doesn&amp;#39;t make him sound statesman like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His support of abortion rights (which I strongly support) puts him at odds with a lot of the religious voters whose beliefs guide them on their voting.  T&amp;#39;was always thus a political hot potato and will always continue to be, but you lose more voters there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You missed one of his biggest problems though; he suggested the Falklands be power shared.  Despite a high proportion of the UK electorate probably being unable to find it in a map, they&amp;#39;re very protective of this obscure bunch of islands that we fought for over 30 years ago; that too sheds voters.  It also sheds all of the voters who pay attention to Falklands affairs; a referendum there in March 2013 on sovereignty came out 99.8% in favor of remaining British and I strongly doubt the political stance of the electorate there has changed in the past 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s also the fact that he is clearly not media trained nor wants to be.  Add it all up and he&amp;#39;s not an attractive option in the voting ballot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dgbzwlx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492376147.0, "created_utc": 1492347347.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nmi6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65nmi6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc4kmu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "antitoffee", "parent_id": "t1_dgc0rta", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; What the media says is irrelevant.
