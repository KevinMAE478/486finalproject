I cross check them with the live rates from Google finance and they are always similar. \n\nYes, it makes sense to compare them.  Just because I live here doesn't mean that all my bills are in Sterling.  I have a doctor's education to pay for back in America.  The vast majority of Americans trained to my level have over 150K in student loan debt.  The average American who goes and gets a Bachelors degree will owe 60K. Living on a salary of 23K GBP with 100K dollars of student debt is very difficult. Convert that salary into dollars and if the rate is high it is manageable, if the rate is low its not.  While I realise not all American nurses have my level of education, even a 60K debt would be hard to manage here.  I don't want to get too far off point but even in your own country student debt is a problem and contributing to the difficulty with nursing salaries.  Nursing students in England can graduate with 13K or more worth of debt and then go into a job making 19-23K a year?  That really changes how well you can cope on such a small salary. Regardless of what country or currency student debt is a huge problem, but there wouldn't be many doctors and nurses without it. Medical education is very expensive.  I was willing to take somewhat of a pay cut to come here because to an extent I can reduce payments based on income, but as I explained the exchange rate has squashed that. \n It has eaten up what little wiggle room I had in my budget.  So yes, it is valid to include exchange rates when you have bills in another currency and it has changed so much. \n\nLiving standards have gone down because expenses have gone up.  I have noticed myself not willing to spend on luxury items or take that extra shopping trip.  I got a cheaper car and leave the heat off more.  I wouldn't be leaving the country I love unless (back into the Trump disaster) if it was not absolutely necessary and there was no other way.  I've gone to great lengths even meeting with financial advisers to try and make something work.  I have had the same expenses and the same budget for the last 10 years of my life like clockwork.  I know exactly how much I spend on everything each month and expenses have risen.  Example, The price of some food items has tripled.  When I first moved here you could buy 2 avocados for 99p.  Now they are 2.99.  Prawns are a similar story as is grain and other feeds for my horses.  And that has happened all within the last year. It doesn't take much.  Spending an extra quid on 75 items every month can make a huge difference and is remarkably easy to do.  How bad is it going to be 5 years down the line at this rate?\n\nThe GBP may in fact recover someday, but it has not changed dramatically since the Brexit vote last year against the dollar and I'm not going to sit around losing money waiting.\n\nI'm sorry you feel my situation is one, an argument, and two, not a valid one.  That is taking away from the main point I was attempting to make.  Overseas nurses want to come here, stay, and contribute to your economy and life quality just as UK nurses do.  Foreigners also often have other pressures that make that difficult.  That difficulty is compounded by the exceptionally low salaries of healthcare workers in this country.  It means that we have to walk a tight line financially. Things have changed enough that I personally can't do it anymore.  I'm out of time to do the additional on the job training specific for this country which will move me into a nurse practitioner band and help the situation.  That may not be the case with everyone, but based on conversations with other co-workers I am sure I'm not alone in this.  The lower your salary, the less wiggle room you have when the economy has bumps.  Bear in mind, additional problems as an overseas person here in the UK.... I am not able to get benefits like council subsidised housing or other public monies to mitigate low salaries and I am taxed twice for healthcare.  In order to even apply for a visa in the UK we have to pay a \"healthcare surcharge\" which amounts to 1,000 GBP per year of the work visa (5 years in my case).  We then have the regular taxes you all have as well. I'm not complaining, its a great deal compared to cost at home, but all these things chip away at an already small salary.  Bottom line.  When it comes to healthcare and people's lives, you want highly trained, highly motivated people.  You won't get that without some financial incentive and you certainly won't get it with most nursing salaries below the national average.   \n\nIf you are looking for me to hold up America as an ideal, don't.  I left for a reason.  I am acutely aware of what my countrymen have done, absolutely disgusted by it, and deeply sorry for it.  Unfortunately that is the result of the GOP gerrymandering themselves into public offices, apathetic voters (plus or minus Russian influence), and a largely uneducated electorate who will buy any pack of lies sold to them.  It makes me sick to my stomach to think how badly people are going to suffer under his time in office.  It will be generations before it gets better now.  I am very distressed to have to walk back into that situation, which should tell you that what I am saying is valid and real problem. \n\nI'm also experiencing first hand what your fellow citizens have done to themselves and the other 48.1% of the population by believing a pack of lies fed to them from some rich businessmen who painted a bus and have no interest in helping anyone but themselves...Including your leader the public never voted to put into the office she now holds.  Maybe Brexit will do all that leavers want in 10 years, I don't claim to know the future.  What I can tell you is, it is causing problems now for nurses.  Foreign nurses are having to leave because of it and you need us.  Unless the UK does something radical about all healthcare salaries and the NHS all the people who want to do it won't be able to.  Hope that helps to clarify my remarks.     \n\n  ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My exchange rates come directly from Wells Fargo and are the rates they apply to my bank accounts.

Example, The price of some food items has tripled.  When I first moved here you could buy 2 avocados for 99p.  Now they are 2.99.  Prawns are a similar story as is grain and other feeds for my horses.  And that has happened all within the last year. It doesn&amp;#39;t take much.  Spending an extra quid on 75 items every month can make a huge difference and is remarkably easy to do.  How bad is it going to be 5 years down the line at this rate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The GBP may in fact recover someday, but it has not changed dramatically since the Brexit vote last year against the dollar and I&amp;#39;m not going to sit around losing money waiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry you feel my situation is one, an argument, and two, not a valid one.  That is taking away from the main point I was attempting to make.  Overseas nurses want to come here, stay, and contribute to your economy and life quality just as UK nurses do.  Foreigners also often have other pressures that make that difficult.  That difficulty is compounded by the exceptionally low salaries of healthcare workers in this country.  It means that we have to walk a tight line financially. Things have changed enough that I personally can&amp;#39;t do it anymore.  I&amp;#39;m out of time to do the additional on the job training specific for this country which will move me into a nurse practitioner band and help the situation.  That may not be the case with everyone, but based on conversations with other co-workers I am sure I&amp;#39;m not alone in this.  The lower your salary, the less wiggle room you have when the economy has bumps.  Bear in mind, additional problems as an overseas person here in the UK.... I am not able to get benefits like council subsidised housing or other public monies to mitigate low salaries and I am taxed twice for healthcare.  In order to even apply for a visa in the UK we have to pay a &amp;quot;healthcare surcharge&amp;quot; which amounts to 1,000 GBP per year of the work visa (5 years in my case).  We then have the regular taxes you all have as well. I&amp;#39;m not complaining, its a great deal compared to cost at home, but all these things chip away at an already small salary.  Bottom line.  When it comes to healthcare and people&amp;#39;s lives, you want highly trained, highly motivated people.  You won&amp;#39;t get that without some financial incentive and you certainly won&amp;#39;t get it with most nursing salaries below the national average.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for me to hold up America as an ideal, don&amp;#39;t.  I left for a reason.  I am acutely aware of what my countrymen have done, absolutely disgusted by it, and deeply sorry for it.  Unfortunately that is the result of the GOP gerrymandering themselves into public offices, apathetic voters (plus or minus Russian influence), and a largely uneducated electorate who will buy any pack of lies sold to them.  It makes me sick to my stomach to think how badly people are going to suffer under his time in office.  It will be generations before it gets better now.  I am very distressed to have to walk back into that situation, which should tell you that what I am saying is valid and real problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also experiencing first hand what your fellow citizens have done to themselves and the other 48.1% of the population by believing a pack of lies fed to them from some rich businessmen who painted a bus and have no interest in helping anyone but themselves...Including your leader the public never voted to put into the office she now holds.  Maybe Brexit will do all that leavers want in 10 years, I don&amp;#39;t claim to know the future.  What I can tell you is, it is causing problems now for nurses.  Foreign nurses are having to leave because of it and you need us.  Unless the UK does something radical about all healthcare salaries and the NHS all the people who want to do it won&amp;#39;t be able to.  Hope that helps to clarify my remarks.     &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dg8yzf7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492192351.0, "created_utc": 1492163551.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7b26i", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MyFavouriteAxe", "parent_id": "t1_dg79yzw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 1, "body": "Where are you getting your fx rates from?
