EU officials say there is no question they must move.\n\nBut Donald Tusk, European Council president, will this month set out the criteria for judging what will be an intensely fought competition over which city will replace London as the host of the agencies.\n\nEU leaders are expected to discuss the new base for the agencies at a summit on April 29, where the 27 remaining member states will hammer out their Brexit strategy.\n\nThe EMA and EBA both have to go to a member state. There are many interested member states. There is a broad understanding that it is something that you need to move quickly on\nEU official\nNo decision will be made at that point, but Mr Tusk wants to lay the ground rules for deciding which city should host the agencies. Such contests have unleashed fierce national rivalries in the past. In 2001, then Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi insisted that a new food standards agency should be based in Parma instead of Helsinki, saying: \u201cThe Finns don\u2019t even know what prosciutto is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe EMA and EBA both have to go to a member state,\u201d an EU official said. \u201cThere are many interested member states. There is a broad understanding that it is something that you need to move quickly on.\u201d\n\nAsked whether there could be a decision by June, the official said: \u201cThat would be nice but I doubt it. You do not have to spend long here to know that these decisions are difficult to make.\u201d\n\nThe EMA\u2019s Canary Wharf headquarters hosts 36,000 national regulators and scientists each year from across the continent, who come to London to approve drugs for the EU.
