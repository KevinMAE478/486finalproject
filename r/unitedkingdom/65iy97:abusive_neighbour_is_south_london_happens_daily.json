I am also a service user rights advocate and work with a prominent mental health charity. \n\nThe reason you call the police in these circumstances is because that is how the service response is structured in the UK. I would personally much prefer if another organisation could be contacted, but that is simply the way things are here. If you did so you would most likely be redirected to the police. \n\nThe reasons you call the police in this specific circumstance are twofold: First, broadly speaking, people do not spend their time aggressively screaming when they are not suffering. Anyone reading this who automatically categorises the woman's actions as insane and therefore other are making a significant mistake: She is not something else. She is human and her expressions of distress represent the same emotions that yours do. Something should at least be attempted because long-term suffering should be avoided, and because clearly no one else knows what to do. \n\nSecond, this woman is putting herself at risk. People with mental health problems are significantly less likely to commit violent crimes and significantly more likely to be a victim of them. This woman's behaviours are one of the reasons for this: She seems scary and aggressive and unpredictable. One day she will scare or upset the wrong person and she will get hurt. This is the narrative that needs to be communicated to the police. \n\nIf they do their job, which the police in South London are actually pretty good at doing when it comes to unwell people, they will come down, knock on her door and have a chat. If they have any concerns about her they will take her for an assessment or request one at her home. They will establish whether she currently has support in place and if so, will communicate this important information back to her team. \n\nThere are many good reasons to call the police in these situations. I would encourage everyone to do so.
