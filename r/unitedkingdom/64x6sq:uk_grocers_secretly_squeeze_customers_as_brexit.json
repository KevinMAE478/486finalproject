Sometimes they're for a promotional deal because the store has too much inventory of an item, they got a good deal, or the item in question was damaged at some point. 50% off a packet of crisps round here is a 50% chance the crisps got crushed at some point.\n\nBut they're also used to mask price increases, or make prices unpredictable. This was especially noticeable in 2009-2010 when the financial crash was making an impact on consumer prices, and they use the sales/new low price to mask a new higher price. Let's say a pizza is being sold at $5.99. The store decides it needs to up the price on them, so for a month it won't make any mention of the item in it's promotional literature. Then one day there's a 2 week store-wide sale on some items, including the pizza at $4.99. But it's priced down from $6.99. After the sale is done they'll put a yellow price tag saying \"New Low Price\" and the pizza is now $6.79. The price has gone up about 10-15%, but the customer is communicated the price in a way to make them believe they're getting a deal if they didn't remember the price of that item was originally $5.99. These pricing methods get applied to a lot of the non-staple items. Staple items get the price chaos treatment. Fruit and veg have always had chaotic pricing because of supply factors, but baking ingredients also get the chaos treatment. An item can vary between 50%-125% of it's expected price. If a store keeps track of an expected customer's cart contents they can apply a variety of methods to slowly increase the average cost of a customer's purchase while making them think they got a great deal on steak, eggs and flour.\n\nFurthermore beyond Walmart and CostCo a lot of the stores round here are all owned by a parent company, either Kroger or Albertsons, and they may leverage a combination of branding and geography to roll out price increases. If our QFC (nice looking stores owned by Kroger) has a price increase on an item you can bet the Fred Meyer (more general, less fancy store also owned by Kroger) a mile away will get the price increase in a month or two.\n\nUsing a combination of data tracking with loyalty cards (which are the only way to even benefit from the sales price) and a lot of data crunching in these stores HQs it's not hard for them to increase prices over here. It might be harder in the UK because of people actually keeping track of things; but here a combination of franchising, leveraging geographical income disparity and people just not having time to do shit means they've made an art of price-adjustment.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t trust the promotional price labels all the time.

This was especially noticeable in 2009-2010 when the financial crash was making an impact on consumer prices, and they use the sales/new low price to mask a new higher price. Let&amp;#39;s say a pizza is being sold at $5.99. The store decides it needs to up the price on them, so for a month it won&amp;#39;t make any mention of the item in it&amp;#39;s promotional literature. Then one day there&amp;#39;s a 2 week store-wide sale on some items, including the pizza at $4.99. But it&amp;#39;s priced down from $6.99. After the sale is done they&amp;#39;ll put a yellow price tag saying &amp;quot;New Low Price&amp;quot; and the pizza is now $6.79.
