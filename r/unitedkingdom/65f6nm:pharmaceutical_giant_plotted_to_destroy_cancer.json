Certainly not. The reward granted by the patent system is necessary to provide an incentive for the research and development of truly new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for drugs that have reached the end of their patent lifetime and should now be generic, hell yes. If competition works properly, then generic drug companies should step in and make the off-patent drugs, then sell them to anyone in the world for a fraction of the price of the original branded medications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, stories like this, plus the antics of people like Martin Shkreli, prove that competition isn&amp;#39;t working as it should. If companies can make all their money by jacking up the price of old drugs, then the incentive to create new, patentable medications is diluted or may even disappear altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a strong argument for having a government run (or at least state owned) generic drug company to make all the off-patent drugs that should be cheap. With some vital conditions built into the system, such as:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(1). That the state owned drug company can never be privatized under any circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(2). That it sells all the drugs it makes for the cost of production, plus a strictly limited profit. Otherwise the government will end up losing money sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(3). That it buys all its starting materials (chemicals, equipment and so on) from the cheapest supplier possible, providing said supplier meets the necessary quality control standards. Otherwise the government will only end up being shafted by suppliers jacking up their prices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dgah8xx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492276119.0, "created_utc": 1492247319.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65f6nm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgawl4g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "tunisia3507", "parent_id": "t1_dg9ts35", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There was a bill a couple of years back to get the NHS invested in off-patent drugs.
