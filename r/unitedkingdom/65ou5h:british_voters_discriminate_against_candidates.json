In-group\u2013out-group bias is a fascinating subject, there have been studies which reveal that women are less likely to have, or at least reveal, such bias, also how Oxytocin (often referred to as the love hormone) can greatly increase this bias with the suggestion that it might be linked to xenophobia. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However there&amp;#39;s also cross-cultural evidence to suggest that in-group derogation is more common, and ingroup favouritism is much less common, amongst any group which isn&amp;#39;t the dominant one, so you&amp;#39;re likely to find both whites and asians in the UK have bias against an asian candidate for example, although very likely for different reasons. This is also true of collectivist cultures, which many have put down to the inherent dialecticism behind their lay beliefs rather than the empiricism of common western thinking.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dgd0fmn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492426765.0, "created_utc": 1492397965.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc4tl1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 39, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Metalboot", "parent_id": "t3_65ou5h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And I bet every other country in the world tests the same according to faith/culture.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I bet every other country in the world tests the same according to faith/culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dgc4tl1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492384514.0, "created_utc": 1492355714.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 39}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ou5h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcgrcv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "boss_electro", "parent_id": "t3_65ou5h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I should get in to politics then my surname is White ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should get in to politics then my surname is White &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dgcgrcv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492400413.0, "created_utc": 1492371613.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ou5h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgci0h1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NikkiJayne28", "parent_id": "t3_65ou5h", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My MP is Nadhim Zahawi, further proving my point that Stratfordians will vote for anything wearing a blue rosette.\n\n(He's the joker that claimed expenses to heat his second home's stables.)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My MP is Nadhim Zahawi, further proving my point that Stratfordians will vote for anything wearing a blue rosette.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(He&amp;#39;s the joker that claimed expenses to heat his second home&amp;#39;s stables.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dgci0h1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492402038.0, "created_utc": 1492373238.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ou5h", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ou5h", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcp4y4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jedibeeftrix", "parent_id": "t1_dgcck16", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "and consciously.\n\nlive in a rural area, and see just how much much 'local roots' are valued in local politics.\n\nobviously not a factor in long-time high ethnic minoirty communities, but given how much people move around people might be surprised how much you stand out in a large percentage or rural authorities.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;and consciously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;live in a rural area, and see just how much much &amp;#39;local roots&amp;#39;
