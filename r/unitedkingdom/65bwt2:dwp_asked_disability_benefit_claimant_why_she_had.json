First of all, I switched my course, which might not be pertinent advice but it's definitely something I needed to do. I swapped the half of my joint honors that \"made me employable\" for philosophy, which is what I really wanted to do but told myself it wasn't useful. I enjoy it a lot more, the workload is less intense and I find it enriching in its own right. Maybe something to consider , but remember it would extend your time at uni. But if you just want to finish a degree, it's worth doing something not just realistic but that suits you as a person and excites you. Switching, deferring etc are a lot easier on medical grounds, SFE were very helpful for me. I thought declaring medical reasons would make it more complicated but a guy there almost begged me to do so because then he could pretty much just handwave it and approve another year. \n\nThe rest of it was largely luck I'm afraid. I started seeing a psychoanalyst, after years of trying to get access to therapy, finding CBT ineffective and medication unsuitable by pure chance I got referred to a very different therapist and she's turned my life around. I guess what to take from that is that you should keep trying. It's utterly disheartening when you are actually seeing people about your illness but you feel like you're getting nowhere, or even more ill just from the process, don't be afraid to express that you don't think something is working for you if that's the case, try and pursue all the options you have. \n\nAlso - I know that a lot of the misery is from approaching work at all, but bear in mind that uni grading is actually quite forgiving if you're not aiming for a high mark. It doesn't take as much to pass, and if you're at uni to improve yourself and learn then that's just fine. You don't need to worry that it won't be perfect, or it might be late, if you just want to continue studying then really all you need is that 40%, which if you understand the content and put a little time in is almost always attainable. Once I started actually getting assignments done I came to realise I'm not that bad after all as well - a lot of the inability came from the crippling anxiety of failing itself. I'd also isolated myself from other students and didn't realize they were often having just as intense doubts about themselves and their ability. Somehow figuring that out made it less of a problem for me, that I wasn't a complete freak, everyone is having a really hard time (just maybe not ALL the time as you might be). \n\nFinally, I imagine you are in contact with you uni's support services but if not, check them out. At mine a support agreement is made regarding what accommodations would help you complete your work, and to get that help you don't need to disclose anything to anyone after that point, just refer to your agreement. I've not used it a huge amount but when I have, lecturers are very eager and understanding and sometimes even provide more accommodation than I explicitly asked for. \n\nI hope you find your way through both uni and your problems. It's really tough when you depend on the loans, but remember to keep the finance going you don't have to be perfect. People want to help you stay on track too. You have a lot more control over the situation than it feels! I think it's almost like I stopped trying to contort myself to how life is supposed to be and began trying to shape my life into something I can actually do. Suddenly it's a lot easier to breathe. I really hope you get there too. (Also, sorry for the HUGE wall of text!) ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That does sound extremely familiar! First of all, I switched my course, which might not be pertinent advice but it&amp;#39;s definitely something I needed to do. I swapped the half of my joint honors that &amp;quot;made me employable&amp;quot; for philosophy, which is what I really wanted to do but told myself it wasn&amp;#39;t useful. I enjoy it a lot more, the workload is less intense and I find it enriching in its own right. Maybe something to consider , but remember it would extend your time at uni. But if you just want to finish a degree, it&amp;#39;s worth doing something not just realistic but that suits you as a person and excites you. Switching, deferring etc are a lot easier on medical grounds, SFE were very helpful for me. I thought declaring medical reasons would make it more complicated but a guy there almost begged me to do so because then he could pretty much just handwave it and approve another year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of it was largely luck I&amp;#39;m afraid. I started seeing a psychoanalyst, after years of trying to get access to therapy, finding CBT ineffective and medication unsuitable by pure chance I got referred to a very different therapist and she&amp;#39;s turned my life around. I guess what to take from that is that you should keep trying. It&amp;#39;s utterly disheartening when you are actually seeing people about your illness but you feel like you&amp;#39;re getting nowhere, or even more ill just from the process, don&amp;#39;t be afraid to express that you don&amp;#39;t think something is working for you if that&amp;#39;s the case, try and pursue all the options you have. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also - I know that a lot of the misery is from approaching work at all, but bear in mind that uni grading is actually quite forgiving if you&amp;#39;re not aiming for a high mark. It doesn&amp;#39;t take as much to pass, and if you&amp;#39;re at uni to improve yourself and learn then that&amp;#39;s just fine. You don&amp;#39;t need to worry that it won&amp;#39;t be perfect, or it might be late, if you just want to continue studying then really all you need is that 40%, which if you understand the content and put a little time in is almost always attainable. Once I started actually getting assignments done I came to realise I&amp;#39;m not that bad after all as well - a lot of the inability came from the crippling anxiety of failing itself. I&amp;#39;d also isolated myself from other students and didn&amp;#39;t realize they were often having just as intense doubts about themselves and their ability.

Something like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo if you get these thoughts of killing yourself, what is it that prevents you from going through with it?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c...\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIs it, perhaps, support from your friends and family?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assessors are under pressure to behave like this because of the government\u2019s promise to bring the welfare bill down by \u00a312bn ... by any means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dg9ne71", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492228249.0, "created_utc": 1492199449.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bwt2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bwt2", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bwt2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgahlwf", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BigWolfUK", "parent_id": "t1_dg9ryfi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Isn't it amazing how privatisation is supposed to be saving us all this money, but it seems there isn't a single saving in sight?\n\nWell, other than the savings in the retirement funds of certain people I suppose", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t it amazing how privatisation is supposed to be saving us all this money, but it seems there isn&amp;#39;t a single saving in sight?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, other than the savings in the retirement funds of certain people I suppose&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dgahlwf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492277257.0, "created_utc": 1492248457.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ryfi", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cheapo-Git", "parent_id": "t1_dg9rfor", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Maybe outsourcing mental healthcare to private services.\n\nLike *all* private healthcare, there's the total price, of which a fair proportion of which will be skimmed off to be spread around the shareholders.\nSo it's 11bn spent, but actually only 8.5 bn goes into the actual services.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe outsourcing mental healthcare to private services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; private healthcare, there&amp;#39;s the total price, of which a fair proportion of which will be skimmed off to be spread around the shareholders.\nSo it&amp;#39;s 11bn spent, but actually only 8.5 bn goes into the actual services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dg9ryfi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492233819.0, "created_utc": 1492205019.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bwt2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9s67u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SilverDustiest", "parent_id": "t1_dg9rfor", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Its because a lot of the money that should be hitting the health service is being vaccumed up by private loans they've been forced into- theres a couple of documentaries on it.
