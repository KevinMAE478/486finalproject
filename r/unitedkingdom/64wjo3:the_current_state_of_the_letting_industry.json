If they own business, do a bit of digging. Websites like www.duedil.com are a great resource for viewing publicly available information on their companies. If your landlord owns a dog grooming company, or is a chocolatier, chances are they dont fully understand the costs involved to them and will be reluctant to shell out in repairs etc. \n- Ask your landlord for an inventory. If they refuse, procrastinate, or give you an incomplete inventory, do not move in. \n- Take photos of everything in the flat/house when you move in, and I mean everything. Every square inch. Get these photos printed or at least make copies digitally and store them somewhere secure. The print outs, mail them to yourself and leave them unopened - make sure they have a date/time stamp on them.\n- Never pay for anything in cash ever, not even for a new doorknob. Especially not a deposit or rent. If a landlord asks for payment in cash, they are more than likely trying to avoid paying tax. If they ask for a cash deposit, run a mile. They will give you a flimsy paper written receipt and will deny any knowledge of it when you come to claim the deposit back. They will not put that money in a third party protection scheme and you wont see it again.\n- Read your contract, then read it again.
