In virtually all scenarios the lowest bidder is awarded the social care contract for a council/borough - to make this bid the staff get fucked over.\n\nUnder National Minimum Wage legislation a worker must be paid for all time spent travelling between appointments in relation to their job. In most cases reviewed the gaps between visits for domiciliary cafe workers aren't paid with reimbursement as low as 2p per mile for fuel between visits to the elderly and vulnerable within their own homes.\n\n'Sleeping Shifts' when a carer spends the night on call in a client's home or a care home, ready to wake and provide assistance at any stage across the night is another huge issue in the care sector. Some of these shifts can be as much as 11 hours long (between 10pm and 9am) with a block payment for this shift as low as \u00a315. These carers have a statutory obligation under the care provider's agreement with the council/NHS to be on the premises throughout that time and are unable to leave. Therefore they must be paid at least the minimum wage for all hours worked - potentially \u00a382.50 against the block payment of \u00a315. \n\nCare providers are exploited, underpaid and generally under resourced (given the low bid their employer submitted for the contract this last part goes without saying). It's a race to the bottom to provide care for an increasingly aged and vulnerable population, the Government's proposed \u00a32b investment is but a drop in the ocean.\n\nReal reform needs to happen, and last year. From speaking with carers - what they're most worried about is the people in their care.

In virtually all scenarios the lowest bidder is awarded the social care contract for a council/borough - to make this bid the staff get fucked over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Under National Minimum Wage legislation a worker must be paid for all time spent travelling between appointments in relation to their job. In most cases reviewed the gaps between visits for domiciliary cafe workers aren&amp;#39;t paid with reimbursement as low as 2p per mile for fuel between visits to the elderly and vulnerable within their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Sleeping Shifts&amp;#39; when a carer spends the night on call in a client&amp;#39;s home or a care home, ready to wake and provide assistance at any stage across the night is another huge issue in the care sector. Some of these shifts can be as much as 11 hours long (between 10pm and 9am) with a block payment for this shift as low as \u00a315. These carers have a statutory obligation under the care provider&amp;#39;s agreement with the council/NHS to be on the premises throughout that time and are unable to leave. Therefore they must be paid at least the minimum wage for all hours worked - potentially \u00a382.50 against the block payment of \u00a315. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Care providers are exploited, underpaid and generally under resourced (given the low bid their employer submitted for the contract this last part goes without saying).
