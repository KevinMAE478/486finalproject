Alcohol is one of the hardest drugs available. Not only is it incredibly damaging to the body (causing strain on the NHS), it lowers inhibition which makes the user more likely to fight and commit crimes (causing strain on the police). Most other drugs cause way less damage to the body, meaning strain on the NHS wouldn't increase much, or maybe even could decrease (if users substitute other drugs for alcohol). Most other drugs don't make users willing to fight or commit crimes. The effect on the police is a positive one for two reasons - first, they wouldn't have to spend a stupid amount of money trying to catch people who are using drugs. Secondly, they wouldn't have to spend a stupid amount of money cleaning up the mess caused by people who use drugs (assuming they substitute other drugs for alcohol).\n\nYou're arguing that the negatives will outweigh the positives for other drugs because they do for alcohol. That's akin to saying \"broadswords can fuck people up, so we should ban butter knives\". Alcohol and other similarly hard drugs are the broadswords of drugs, and are not a good reason to ban the butter knives (cannabis, MDMA, LSD, psilocybin, etc.).\n\nI hope this answers your original question.

Most other drugs don&amp;#39;t make users willing to fight or commit crimes. The effect on the police is a positive one for two reasons - first, they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to spend a stupid amount of money trying to catch people who are using drugs. Secondly, they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to spend a stupid amount of money cleaning up the mess caused by people who use drugs (assuming they substitute other drugs for alcohol).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re arguing that the negatives will outweigh the positives for other drugs because they do for alcohol. That&amp;#39;s akin to saying &amp;quot;broadswords can fuck people up, so we should ban butter knives&amp;quot;. Alcohol and other similarly hard drugs are the broadswords of drugs, and are not a good reason to ban the butter knives (cannabis, MDMA, LSD, psilocybin, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this answers your original question.
