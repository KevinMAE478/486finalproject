Pit some very similarly minded left wing people against each other and continue being a right wing monolith.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact is: Corbyn isn&amp;#39;t doing well. He&amp;#39;s policies are great and the public love them. Somehow they won&amp;#39;t vote for him anyway. Can we stop focusing all our arguments on why he&amp;#39;s failing and just first acknowledge he is? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either he&amp;#39;s a bad leader and the media is reflecting that or - concerted or not - the media has been pretty against him from the start and the public is being led by that. Or it&amp;#39;s a mixture of the two. Who cares? The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Corbyn hasn&amp;#39;t lost my support because of Corbyn. But I can no longer put my support behind someone who&amp;#39;s doing so poorly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t affect any change sitting at what is it now 20 something percent? The centre of the party have annoyed me greatly. They&amp;#39;ve thrown all their toys out the pram the whole time Corbyn has been going. They&amp;#39;ve plotted and schemed and tried to tear down their own side in what seems like the express interest of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the US elections we saw people so annoyed at their own left-wing establishment they flirted with the idea of voting for Trump. The right win because they don&amp;#39;t ever do that. Libertarians are currently happy to vote for a lady who wants to read everyone&amp;#39;s emails. That&amp;#39;s why the right win. Our principles will keep us out of power until we can work together for some sort of common good and it is more important now than ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/rant&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dgdcjt1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492454728.0, "created_utc": 1492425928.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uhaa", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdiulw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Magnets", "parent_id": "t3_65uhaa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's all a conspiracy by the media", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all a conspiracy by the media&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dgdiulw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492467174.0, "created_utc": 1492438374.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uhaa", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65uhaa", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgeed4u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ff14questions", "parent_id": "t1_dgdz4vh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "For sure.
