May&amp;#39;s Industrial Strategy is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The author encourages a transitional arrangement with the EU and the speedy conclusion of Article 50 negotiations, perhaps concluding them before the two year time limit has expired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Encourages a deal with the US that focuses on &amp;quot;better trade arrangements for services and investment, mutual recognition of standards, qualifications and regulation, or agreed treatment for data&amp;quot; rather than tariff reductions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The UK should stay in certain agreements between the EU and other countries, especially if those countries have major tariff reductions. Some countries with these preferential agreements, including Commonwealth nations, may only be &amp;quot;secondary [concerns] in economic terms&amp;quot;. Some, like South Korea, are useful partners and our trade deals should not be interrupted for economic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There may be opportunities in growing markets such as the BRICS. However, trade with these would have to increase significantly to match even a minor decrease in our trade with the EU.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;England could become &amp;quot;a self-governing nation, an independent country in the British realm&amp;quot;. This would allow Scotland, NI, and Gibraltar to continue using the UK&amp;#39;s agreement with the EU to trade whilst England and Wales can leave. This would be an internal agreement amongst the Three Kingdoms and would not require negotiation with the EU.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dgc758m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492387701.0, "created_utc": 1492358901.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
