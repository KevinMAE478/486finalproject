Suppose a good chunk of that population of disadvantaged but hard working people got the good jobs they do deserve (and they do, Im not disputing that, I just dont agree with these arguments for a solution). Do you think they would then place their children in to state schools (without gaming catchment areas), deny them tutors when they struggle and artifically limit the help they offer to their children both financially and in terms of their own knowledge for their children to learn from, to place them on par with others that face the disadvantage they faced?

Even entry-level positions require very specific degrees these days, so the choice you make at 18 effectively prohibits you from ever getting near a huge range of career paths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dgbv2ka", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492361473.0, "created_utc": 1492332673.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbsvle", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lx6g", "parent_id": "t1_dgba6r8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for the insight.
