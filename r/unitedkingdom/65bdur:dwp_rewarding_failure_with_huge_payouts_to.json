In many areas welfare rights officers have been cut, while legal aid cuts mean that people appealing against their benefit rejection no longer have the right to help (aid is only available for appeals of appeals based on points of law). For an insight into the impact of this, the Law Centres Network says that for the whole of 2015, there were only 254 new benefits cases helped by civil legal aid in England and Wales. This compares with 82,542 cases in 2012-13, the year before the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/765242/PIP-Atos-disability-activists-assessors-fail-test-claim\"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Express.co.uk recently revealed as many as 800 people per week are being stripped of their benefits, or the higher rate, leaving them too ill too work and too afraid to fight the decision in court.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that doesn&amp;#39;t really help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dg908nc", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492196347.0, "created_utc": 1492167547.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bdur", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9l43x", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Fiishbait", "parent_id": "t1_dg8zz7u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; 53 weeks in a year\n\nI'm confused.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;53 weeks in a year&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m confused.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dg9l43x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492225499.0, "created_utc": 1492196699.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8zz7u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shameless_Bullshiter", "parent_id": "t1_dg8zh6b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The standard award from pip is \u00a355.65 a week, so for the sake of ease, I'm going to assume everyone gets that.\n\n55.65 x 53 weeks in a year = \u00a32949.45\n\n100 million \u00f7 2949.45 = 33904 \n\n33904 people could be on standard pip for a year from that \n\nI'm shit at math so take it with a grain of salt ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard award from pip is \u00a355.65 a week, so for the sake of ease, I&amp;#39;m going to assume everyone gets that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;55.65 x 53 weeks in a year = \u00a32949.45&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;100 million \u00f7 2949.45 = 33904 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;33904 people could be on standard pip for a year from that &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m shit at math so take it with a grain of salt &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dg8zz7u", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492195563.0, "created_utc": 1492166763.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bdur", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bdur", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bdur", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65bdur", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9w03g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "parent_id": "t1_dg9bjd4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree, it doesn't - I don't for a minute think only 0.93% of cases have an error in.
