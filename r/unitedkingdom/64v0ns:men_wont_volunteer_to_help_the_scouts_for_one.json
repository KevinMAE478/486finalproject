I'm female, but the vast majority of leaders I've met are male. The exception is Beavers, the youngest age group who are mostly female leaders. I have never, not once had a leader express to me they are or have ever worried about being seen as a pedo. And trust me, we talk about all sorts on a late night when the kids are tucked up in tents. \n\nWe have strict child protection policies and good, regular training to protect us and the kids. It's just not an issue. Some eedjit writing a piece in the paper about it might make people think it's an issue mind you. \n\n&gt; The first barrier is red tape, in the form of an exhaustive, compulsory background check\n\nI can't comment for England/Wales/NI but up here in Tartantown it's a four page form that you send off and wait to hear back. Whoop de fucking do. Our *parents* get one done when they come to family camps, as a one-off for one weekend away. It's not at all a big deal.\n\nAs for us needing a background check 'with some justification', no it's not just because of child abuse cases. It's because we are with kids away from their parents doing possibly hazardous activities for as much as weeks at a time. You want to make sure that someone with that kind of responsibility over your kids is as steady and reliable a person as possible. \n\n&gt; The second barrier is a more general red flag: the very real fear among many men who want to work with children that they will be branded a potential paedophile.\n\nThis is down to the individual's feelings. As said above, it's not an issue I've ever come across. We work hard to protect both kids and adults. Scouting was traditionally a male led organisation, there are still loads of male leaders. I think if there's anywhere you would assume a dude would be in charge, it would be in Scouting. \n\n&gt;This drive to encourage \u201ccross-gender participation\u201d was a huge success: there are 83,363 female members aged between 6-25. But it's possible that this boom has exacerbated the shortage of adult male volunteers willing to come forward.\n\nAgain, not a problem with anyone I've met. I have come across male leaders who are happy to have a female leader join their group to help with girls, but they have had no issues coping without one. I joined a group that was all male leaders but nearly half their kids were girls. They had a 'female first aid kit' for any issues that popped up and kids can always call their mum/guardian if they need female support while away. Remember a lot of Scout leaders have kids of their own, and some of them are daughters.  \n\n&gt; A male pal of mine, who would have made an amazing school teacher, summed it up: \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the risk. One accusation from a kid, teen or a mother you p***ed off and your career is over\u201d. \n\nWhich is why we have a strict safeguarding policy and code of conduct. \n\nHonestly I don't think this dude has spent any time with a Scout leader or involved in the Scout association at all. I'm noticing no quotes from the SA, from other leaders, from parents about the role of males in Scouting. Nothing even from those who were genuinely put off Scouting because of the aforementioned fears. Just his own blinkered views about how he assumes male leaders are seen. If any of our parents or potential parents held these views we'd have no kids, and certainly no waiting list of 55,000. \n\n", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What complete and utter nonsense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a Scout leader and have been for over a decade.

I took the kids to the park or the beach, every opportunity I could get. I took pictures of them every where, with no problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a couple of years it was good. Then I think that some female groups saw that we could easily cope with working and taking on traditionally female roles. It was no problem to me, I was brought up in an all female household (apart from me). Media then started portraying us as freaks. I got odd looks at the park or the swimming pool. Then we weren&amp;#39;t allowed to take pictures at school plays, or the pool, or the park. Innocent male role models seem to all be painted with the pedo paint brush.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was quite glad when my kids were older, I didn&amp;#39;t feel out of place doing things with them. Now I have grandchildren. Have I changed there nappies? No. Do I take them to the park? Only if their mum or my wife is with me. Would I take them swimming? No. Have I bathed them? No. Do I take photos of them? No, I leave that to the girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the 90&amp;#39;s, women wanted more from their men, when they got it, they didn&amp;#39;t like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit":
