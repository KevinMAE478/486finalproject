Copernicus is two-thirds funded by the EC and one-third by ESA, but the climate change component of it is carried out by the ECMWF, who then contract bits of it out to private sector organizations (which is how I&amp;#39;ve ended up working on it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there are national space agencies, too (the UK has one, and ESA launches from French Guyana are on a site run by the French one) - and a whole bunch of research organizations, commercial organizations and so on. Bits of work on the launch control room in French Guyana were contracted from CNES (the French agency) to a Spanish company and then subcontracted to an Italian company carrying them out in Britain, for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How Brexit will affect these things I don&amp;#39;t know. But it&amp;#39;s far from impossible that even projects carried out by organizations the UK remains a part of will no longer happen in the UK because of relationships to the EU - and maybe EU non-discrimination procurement rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dg8yz13", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492192315.0, "created_utc": 1492163515.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8yevx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hogger85", "parent_id": "t3_65az4v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I thought ESA was seperate to the EU", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought ESA was seperate to the EU&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "unitedkingdom", "name": "t1_dg8yevx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492190504.0, "created_utc": 1492161704.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhqb", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65az4v", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg901d7", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "socr", "parent_id": "t3_65az4v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/unitedkingdom", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's all good.
