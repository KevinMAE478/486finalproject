A lot of the peace process was propped up on European Money, a lot of the higher level (yet lowly paid) technical jobs are propped up on EU money and we&amp;#39;ve got to be concerned about the fact that we have a neighbour right next door who will retain access to the single market which will make it much more attractive for foreign investment rather than the north. Throw into the mix the possibility of a return to armed checkpoints / customs checks and that leads to a possibility (at least) of a return of some paramilitary actions along the borders which is no good for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do you think there will be a majority of N.I. citizens, regardless of confession and ancestry, in favour of reuniting Ireland in case of a hard border?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a fucking chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(From my perspective, a hard border will turn N.I. into economic backwaters, but it might take years or decades of economic decline for a majority to emerge.
