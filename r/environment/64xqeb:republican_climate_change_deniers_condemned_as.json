So it&amp;#39;s not so much that climate change is fact, but more that it&amp;#39;s most likely that it is happening and we are causing it or at the very least contributing to it significantly. In the face of overwhelming evidence and observation proving it, the chances are that it is real (and as far as I know, over 95% of scientists worldwide agree with this), and it is very improbable that it isn&amp;#39;t real.
