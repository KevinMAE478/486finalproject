You can't mix crop orchards very well.  Additionally in agricultural terms, harvest becomes difficult with machinery and greatly increases man power, which in turn greatly increases the cost of the product.\n\nTo my knowledge mixed cropping is best in a small garden or even small family farms.  But it absolutely does not solve pest problems.  Delia flies for example attack so many species of horticulture crops such as radish, rutabaga, cabbage, onion, corn, and more.  Cucumber beetles love most melons as well.  \n\nMixed cropping stops complete wipeouts so each producer doesn't break the bank during a specific pest outbreak.  It also doesn't change the fact that soil isn't equal and that different locations are specifically suited for specific crops.
