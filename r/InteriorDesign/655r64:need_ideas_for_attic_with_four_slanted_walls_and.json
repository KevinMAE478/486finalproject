I have a soft spot for slanted ceilings, even though I know they present some design challenges :)\n\nSo, lots to consider here:\n\n- You have a ton of tiny little doors all around the room. (Attic/storage space?) It seems very likely to me that in order to make this room functional, you're going to have to cover at least some of them up (otherwise, there wouldn't be many options for furniture placement). You don't necessarily have to actually board them up or anything - just know that you'll have to sacrifice some of them, usability-wise.\n\n- Skylights - it looks like there are two, across from each other - right? I'm not sure which way the light shines through, but you'll want to consider that for TV placement. Nobody wants to have constant glare, and it would be a shame to cover one of them up.\n\n- Do you want to keep the built-in seating? If so, I might make that side the TV side. From the pictures, it looks a little darker and cozier. However, this would involve (most likely) covering up that little closet door, and I'm not sure what size your TV is. Removing the built-in seating would give you a bit more flexibility.\n\n- The side without the built-in seating seems to be the bigger side, but on that side, you have to contend with the entryway, which you of course don't want to block. Just something to keep in mind.\n\n- Another thing to keep in mind: rugs are a great way to define areas. I would get a nice, cozy rug for the TV side, and maybe something flat-weave for the office side. \n\n- If it were me: I would make the built-in seating side the movie side, but I would probably tear out the built-ins in favor of a cozier couch or love seat. Finish it off with a cozy rug. I would make the more spacious side the office side, and make low reclaimed-wood bookshelves (similar to the style of that inspiration image you linked - which I love, by the way!) to go along the non-slanted parts of the wall.
