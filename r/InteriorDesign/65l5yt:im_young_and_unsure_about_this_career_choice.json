Some people do a lot better sitting in a lecture, talking to classmates, doing study groups.  Online requires self discipline to take the time to watch lecture videos and give it full attention.  You cant easily ask questions in online classes and you miss the communication given verbally or in person.  I've also found some professors are shall i say lazy in online classes.  Some are responsive but some just post assignments, quickly post grades, and otherwise dont do much.  Some open a discussion forum for questions but tell classmates they must answer each other.   \n\nDo consider the financial aspect of both scenarios.

Some people do a lot better sitting in a lecture, talking to classmates, doing study groups.  Online requires self discipline to take the time to watch lecture videos and give it full attention.  You cant easily ask questions in online classes and you miss the communication given verbally or in person.  I&amp;#39;ve also found some professors are shall i say lazy in online classes.  Some are responsive but some just post assignments, quickly post grades, and otherwise dont do much.
