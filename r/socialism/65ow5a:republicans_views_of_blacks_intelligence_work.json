Jews were frequently massacred and exiled from various European countries. \n\nflourishing communities on the Rhine and the Danube were utterly destroyed, a prime example being the Rhineland massacres. \n\nIn the Second Crusade (1147) the Jews in France were subject to frequent massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the Shepherds' Crusades of 1251 and 1320. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including in 1290, the banishing of all English Jews; in 1396, 100,000 Jews were expelled from France; and, in 1421 thousands were expelled from Austria. Many of the expelled Jews fled to Poland.[4]\n\nAs the Black Death epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than a half of the population, Jews were taken as scapegoats. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence in the Black Death persecutions. Although Pope Clement VI tried to protect them by July 6, 1348 papal bull and another 1348 bull, several months later, **900 Jews were burnt alive in Strasbourg**, where the plague hadn't yet affected the city.\n\nIn the Papal States, which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called ghettos.

We enslave, torture, and murder tens of billions of animals every year. Why? Because there's this attitude in our culture that animals are \"inferior\", that they're \"beneath us\". Looking at chickens objectively, they are obviously less \"intelligent\", they are physically weaker, and in general, they probably feel less pain/suffer less because of the smaller brain size. Does that mean it's OK to viciously enslave and slaughter them, ESPECIALLY when we are more than capable (for the most part) as a species of going vegan? Fuck no (I'm vegan in case you can't tell lol). But it's that superiority complex we have, and our use of the differences between us to justify it.\n\nAnother example: Suppose we encounter an alien species, and they are pretty much in every way (that we would define) \"superior\" to us. Does that actually make them superior, or justify any superiority complex they might have? No.\n\nAnyway this is the perspective I was looking at this whole thing from, more as an analysis of power structures as a whole, not just racism.
