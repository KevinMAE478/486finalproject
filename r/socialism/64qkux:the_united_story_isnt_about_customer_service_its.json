But the vast majority of people see the more highly visible actions of the police, including protecting individuals from violence and investigating common crime, as their core functions. There&amp;#39;s always a problem with immediately rejecting the institutions of capitalism based on their purpose of supporting capitalism, but without fully acknowledging their peripheral purposes and supplementing them with egalitarian alternatives. Most state institutions purport to spend at least a fraction of their effort organizing activities that are beneficial to society. So I&amp;#39;m totally with you on the principle of the issue here, but I wonder if that&amp;#39;s only because I&amp;#39;m a highly educated and well-read anarchist with Marxist leanings.

Especially in the US, a job as a police officer is one of the most stable and secure job you can get without a college degree. If even a large part of the most educated groups in America don't see the fundamental problem with policing as localized tyranny and resource extraction from the poor, then I don't think it's fair to call them class traitors to the exclusion of other laborers. Police departments draw from the segment of society that is most susceptible to capitalist ideology (aside from the capitalists themselves), including and perhaps especially racism and classism.\n\nWe are all somewhat class traitors in that if you have a \"job\" you are in the business of creating wealth for capitalists. Police officers are just laborers whose job it is to protect that wealth. \n\nThis is not to take away from my hatred for the system of policing or from the despicable actions of many police officers. I'm not saying we shouldn't call police on their bullshit, instead I'm saying that more effort should be put into recruiting them to their class-members' cause. Many a social movement might have been successful if they had gotten the crucial domino of law enforcement support to fall.\n\nedit: adding in a comment I made below so that I don't keep getting the same response.\n\nI don't disagree with what you're saying here. All I was trying to get at is that it's a sliding scale of complicity with capitalism. To be a victim of capitalism and a perpetrator of capitalism are not mutually exclusive, especially when institutions like police departments and the military aggressively recruit the people who have no other options and have not been exposed to any ideology counter to that of the ruling class.\nA laborer's work enriching capitalists allows capitalists to pay police to protect that capital.\n\n&gt; many of us partake in unmoral actions (captialism) to earn our daily bread and to take care of our families\n\nThis is exactly what I'm saying in my first comment. Taking up arms to defend wealth is perhaps more immoral than giving your labor to create the wealth, but it's a difference of degree rather than a difference of kind. Whether it's a \"choice\" to become a police officer depends on the other opportunities available to you, but like you said it may be the only option for someone with few skills and no money for education to feed their family. In the Los Angeles area, police departments are one of the only jobs that are always hiring and will take you with no education or experience.\n\nFrom the point of view of someone working multiple part time jobs who is currently lacking access to healthcare, a retirement plan, or any other side benefits, it's pretty obvious why a position as a cop would be a tempting one, especially if you've never had a discussion about the role police play in oppressing the working class. It would mean the difference between your kids getting to go to the doctor or rolling the dice with catastrophic injury every day.\n\nAgain, I'm not apologizing for police behavior or the criminal justice system, and firmly believe that police should be disarmed and the institution eventually abolished. Just trying to add some color to a discussion that usually doesn't go beyond \"fuck the police.\"", "edited": 1491943241.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are absolutely right, but it&amp;#39;s important to recognize that police are workers too. Especially in the US, a job as a police officer is one of the most stable and secure job you can get without a college degree. If even a large part of the most educated groups in America don&amp;#39;t see the fundamental problem with policing as localized tyranny and resource extraction from the poor, then I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s fair to call them class traitors to the exclusion of other laborers. Police departments draw from the segment of society that is most susceptible to capitalist ideology (aside from the capitalists themselves), including and perhaps especially racism and classism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are all somewhat class traitors in that if you have a &amp;quot;job&amp;quot; you are in the business of creating wealth for capitalists. Police officers are just laborers whose job it is to protect that wealth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not to take away from my hatred for the system of policing or from the despicable actions of many police officers. I&amp;#39;m not saying we shouldn&amp;#39;t call police on their bullshit, instead I&amp;#39;m saying that more effort should be put into recruiting them to their class-members&amp;#39; cause. Many a social movement might have been successful if they had gotten the crucial domino of law enforcement support to fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: adding in a comment I made below so that I don&amp;#39;t keep getting the same response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t disagree with what you&amp;#39;re saying here. All I was trying to get at is that it&amp;#39;s a sliding scale of complicity with capitalism. To be a victim of capitalism and a perpetrator of capitalism are not mutually exclusive, especially when institutions like police departments and the military aggressively recruit the people who have no other options and have not been exposed to any ideology counter to that of the ruling class.\nA laborer&amp;#39;s work enriching capitalists allows capitalists to pay police to protect that capital.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;many of us partake in unmoral actions (captialism) to earn our daily bread and to take care of our families&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what I&amp;#39;m saying in my first comment. Taking up arms to defend wealth is perhaps more immoral than giving your labor to create the wealth, but it&amp;#39;s a difference of degree rather than a difference of kind. Whether it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot; to become a police officer depends on the other opportunities available to you, but like you said it may be the only option for someone with few skills and no money for education to feed their family. In the Los Angeles area, police departments are one of the only jobs that are always hiring and will take you with no education or experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of someone working multiple part time jobs who is currently lacking access to healthcare, a retirement plan, or any other side benefits, it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious why a position as a cop would be a tempting one, especially if you&amp;#39;ve never had a discussion about the role police play in oppressing the working class.
