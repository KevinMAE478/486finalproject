We definitely embraced the rise of neoliberalism in the late 80's and the 90's, when a lot of privatisations happened such as in public transport, postal service and telecommunications. In 2010, the VVD became the largest party for the first time in their history, and produced the first past-WWII liberal prime minister, Mark Rutte. They continued this streak in 2012 and the previous month, so they became the largest party three times in a row now and we'll likely get Rutte III. Left is definitely on the decline. The three major parties usually grouped as \"the left\" (socialists SP, which I'm a member of; labour PvdA and greens GroenLinks) got 65 out of the 150 seats in 2006, 55 in 2010, 57 in 2012 and [only 37 in the elections last month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_general_election,_2017)...\n\nConcerning our culture, one of the most important things I feel is that we're very down to Earth.

Even the greens, which ran a Sanders-like hyped up campaign with a young Trudeau/Obama impersonator did decent (14 seats out of 150, biggest amount for their party ever) but still not great.

I could never phantom a big surge in the polls by someone like M\u00e9lenchon or a party like Syriza or Podemos here, or someone equivalent on the right side.
