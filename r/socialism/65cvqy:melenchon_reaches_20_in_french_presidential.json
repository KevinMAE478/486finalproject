Civilization has progressed over the last 10,000 years, technological change clearly does happen, and human life has improved significantly from our zoological condition.\n\nOh, don't get me wrong it definitelt has. But, not necessarily in a linear fashion. There have been reversals, not to mention that fact that \"progress\" itself is an ill-defined, obtuse word carrying centuries of connotation in western society. Progress is not limited to technological advancement, progress also encompasses institutional, cultural, and societal advance, though because any advance in those areas are bound to result in disagreement of contemporaries, it's difficult to correctly identify progress except reflexively. In reflexively defining progress, it's incredibly easy to impose modern connotations and belief about progress onto a past that lacks them. This is why there must be intense caution when speaking of progress. \n\n&gt; To deny this is to engage in primitivism, a perspective I find repugnant to the socialist project. Historical materialism is not perfect, but it is certainly more a systematic approach to history than anything the bourgeoisie has produced. And it does appear to capture certain truths. To look at history and to deny that societal change does not follow certain trends is inaccurate.\n\nOh, I am in no way a primitivist. Primitivism is more ahistoric than dialectical materialism. I would also caution your disavowal of all other forms of historical thought and the superiority of systemstatic thought in dialectical materialism. For one, nearly all forms of modern historical thought are based systemstically and structural(one of the great things Critical theory brought us). For two, having a syncretic approach to history is far more serviceable and it broadens your ability to understand the past and the continuities therein by allowing you to look at problems and questions from multiple theoretical perspectives. \n\nHistorical materialism does in fact capture truth, I never argued that it doesn't, it just tends to become bogged down in economics in lieue of other factors. I am not denying continuities over time(or trends), I am denying overarching, universalizing trends that do not have a basis in material reality. Human society differs greatly throughout the world snd the avenus through which these societies \"progress\" differs wildly as well. Not simply in productive and economoc terms but in ideological, social, institutional, and cultural terms. \n\n&gt; I think this a difference in lexicon, which is fine. The point is that fascists, as far as I can tell, essentially want to restore the monarchy. Globalization has resulted in the creation of economic relations that now operate across a larger scope than society. Socialists want to expand society in response; fascists want force the new relations to be subsumed under old society.\n\nFascism is not monarchy and is not trying to revive monarchy. They are based in completely different forms of legitimacy and political power, though they share certain features. The biggest is the derivation of legitimacy and authority. Kings do not derive their authority by being the embodiment of the \"people\" at the head of the state. Further, the King is the sovereign of the monarchic state, holding *all* authority, whereas the state, itself, is the sovereign and all aspects of society sre subducted under the power of the state in fascism. This is a key difference among many, many differences between monarchy and fascism. Even if a fascist seeks to reinstate the monarchy or at least uses it as a dogwhistle, it does not have the same structure as a monarchy nor the same form of legitimacy or authority. \n\n&gt; Humans are conscious beings---we possess the capacity for rational thought. With rational thought, humans are able to logically order the material universe in service of human needs. In my view, the history of all civilization can be boiled down to this singular project: rational thought is producing an environment of its own conception.\n\nOver time, thought develops new mechanisms to travel through the material environment. The master-slave relationship does not occur without the invention of language proper, i.e. representational forms that are divorced from observational forms. Feudal estates in land as an organizing principle are impossible without the written word. The proliferation of money-capital---that is, the abstraction of property interests into progressively integrated forms---is not feasible without printing. I will not go into too much detail here, but I think that if you look at the development of civilizations you will see that disruptive periods tend to occur synchronously with the onset of new developments in the technology of thought.\n\nMy view is that the invention of machine programming represents a similarly disruptive event in human history, and demands new relations of production. More specifically, software is rapidly becoming a new organizing principle of the production. Through the use of code-based control systems, human life processes are subjected to automation, the process by which the environment transforms itself according to a rational plan. Unlike previous relations of production, the capabilities of such systems are not constrained by the limitations of human beings. A written order can only travel as quickly the human being carrying it. An order that occurs over a network of telecommunications switches, on the other hand, travels at virtually the speed of light.\n\nThus when I talk about \"logic,\" I am talking about building a society that embraces software as the new organizing principle of the economy: the new mechanism through which rational thought imposes its will on the material universe. That means constructing an international order large enough to subsume the scope and speed of the new productive forces. That means building a governance structure in the image of the class that controls software: the proletariat. Finally, that means liberating software from the influence of inferior systems of economic organization, i.e. financial capital. I am a socialist because I believe that no other word better describes that vision. I am against fascism because I believe its primary function is to utilize software to destroy the progress capitalism has already made.\n\n*Good analysis*. I agree with some points and disagree with others, but all in all they are personal disagreements that represent different ideological frameworks at play, so we won't get anywhere arguing them lol. \n\n&gt; I do not think this is a sheer coincidence, though. I think it is a reflection of the underlying material forces. The brain is divided between rationality and zoological instinct. These two minds are in constant tension: the one wants logical order, the latter wants entropy and chaos. As new relations of production take over the economy, this fundamental tension presents itself in the form of political polarization. The progressives who want to proceed civilization to its next logical stage; the reactionaries who want to destroy the progress that has already been made. What is happening, in my view, is that the fascists and socialists are fighting for control of software.\n\nAh, I have some problems here. Specifically, I don't think the dichotomy between rationality and zoological instinct is so marked as modern theorist would have it. Rationality is just as base in humans as instinct, and even more so, humans, to me, cannot really ever be rational creatures. We all have biases, internal scruples, non-sensical morals imbued into us by society. You might say this is the irrational, instinctual side of the mind, but I disagree. I think there's far more interplay and far less tension between base instinct and rationality in this dichotomy you'e established. I also thinkt the emphasis on software is a bit narrow. \n\n&gt; I think that Marx's big failure was not explaining politics in this way. Regardless, however, I hope you see now why I am taking a stand here. Logic is central to my critique of political economy. Civilization is the reification of logic. That's why the word is so important.\n\nOh, I definitely do, and it's been interesting to see your point of view. We're just operating and two very different frameworks of thought here lol.

In my view, the history of all civilization can be boiled down to this singular project: rational thought is producing an environment of its own conception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time, thought develops new mechanisms to travel through the material environment. The master-slave relationship does not occur without the invention of language proper, i.e. representational forms that are divorced from observational forms. Feudal estates in land as an organizing principle are impossible without the written word. The proliferation of money-capital---that is, the abstraction of property interests into progressively integrated forms---is not feasible without printing. I will not go into too much detail here, but I think that if you look at the development of civilizations you will see that disruptive periods tend to occur synchronously with the onset of new developments in the technology of thought. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My view is that the invention of machine programming represents a similarly disruptive event in human history, and demands new relations of production. More specifically, software is rapidly becoming a new &lt;em&gt;organizing principle&lt;/em&gt; of the production. Through the use of code-based control systems, human life processes are subjected to automation, the process by which the environment transforms &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; according to a rational plan. Unlike previous relations of production, the capabilities of such systems are not constrained by the limitations of human beings. A written order can only travel as quickly the human being carrying it. An order that occurs over a network of telecommunications switches, on the other hand, travels at virtually the speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus when I talk about &amp;quot;logic,&amp;quot; I am talking about building a society that embraces software as the new organizing principle of the economy: the new mechanism through which rational thought imposes its will on the material universe. That means constructing an international order large enough to subsume the scope and speed of the new productive forces. That means building a governance structure in the image of the class that controls software: the proletariat. Finally, that means liberating software from the influence of  inferior systems of economic organization, i.e. financial capital. I am a socialist because I believe that no other word better describes that vision. I am against fascism because I believe its primary function is to utilize software to destroy the progress capitalism has already made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I disagree with many aspects of historical materialism, yes. I agree with your analysis of the political polarization of the times, insofar as it does seem to be fracturing into two factions. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not think this is a sheer coincidence, though. I think it is a reflection of the underlying material forces. The brain is divided between rationality and zoological instinct. These two minds are in constant tension: the one wants logical order, the latter wants entropy and chaos. As new relations of production take over the economy, this fundamental tension presents itself in the form of political polarization. The progressives who want to proceed civilization to its next logical stage; the reactionaries who want to destroy the progress that has already been made. What is happening, in my view, is that the fascists and socialists are fighting for control of software.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that Marx&amp;#39;s big failure was not explaining &lt;em&gt;politics&lt;/em&gt; in this way. Regardless, however, I hope you see now why I am taking a stand here. &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt; is central to my critique of political economy. Civilization is the reification of logic.
