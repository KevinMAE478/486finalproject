Now who is going to question a story like that, its the panthers, they&amp;#39;re following cops around with guns, of course the police would raid them for illegal weapons charges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But of course the reality was that there was a single firearm in that house. But the Panthers own hostility had created an image and environment where that claim would be perfectly natural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the same is true today. Its one thing for them to have persecution complexes that there libruls are out to get them but they can&amp;#39;t act on it much without real provocation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just look at the sample of responses from the rightwing nuts in the article, they love this, this is what they&amp;#39;ve been waiting for finally they can justify their aggressiveness as defence against people who want a confrontation and if that&amp;#39;s what they want they&amp;#39;ll give it to them. Just playing right into their demented revenge fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "socialism", "name": "t1_dgbgo5k", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492333828.0, "created_utc": 1492305028.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbgbyu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FlorencePants", "parent_id": "t1_dgbed1u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You say that like they need an excuse.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You say that like they need an excuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "socialism", "name": "t1_dgbgbyu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492333364.0, "created_utc": 1492304564.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjii", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jot4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjii", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jot4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbtvzb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lamont-Cranston", "parent_id": "t1_dgbpbzb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;all the excuse they need to crack down", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;all the excuse they need to crack down&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "socialism", "name": "t1_dgbtvzb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492357712.0, "created_utc": 1492328912.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbpbzb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "f1ndme", "parent_id": "t1_dgbed1u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "On the contrary, lots of people complaining about the police not doing their jobs and not being protective enough.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, lots of people complaining about the police not doing their jobs and not being protective enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "socialism", "name": "t1_dgbpbzb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492347215.0, "created_utc": 1492318415.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjii", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jot4", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjii", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65jot4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbvyhs", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Lamont-Cranston", "parent_id": "t1_dgbujgu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sure they want to push things, and this sort of response is exactly the sort of way things get pushed further.
