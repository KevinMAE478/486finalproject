Their willingness to engage in acts of violence that hurt and killed innocent civilians firmly puts them in the \"terrorist\" category in my book. \n\nI try not to speculate on their dissolution, but their final communique suggests that having been forced underground for decades, the infiltration and imprisonment of their members, and finally the collapse of the DDR was detrimental to the RAF.

In many of Meinhof's early writings she suggests that an armed militant movement would be the spark that finally makes all the left-wing tension boil over into full-blown revolution.

I seen people in my city doing Roman salutes, saying Hail Trump or Hail Kek, spouting neo Nazi memes like Physical Removal and calling us racial and sexual slurs. It&amp;#39;s actually kind of cringy that they take their memes out into the real world, but I certainly dont have an issue with a community saying shut the fuck up we dont want your Nazi bullshit in our town. I dont understand why defending edgy neo nazis is the hill so many people chose to die on. Lastly its pretty telling that you think antifa are the ones instigating it. Last one I went to a trump supporter peppersprayed a woman who was just standing there arguing with a different trump supporter.
