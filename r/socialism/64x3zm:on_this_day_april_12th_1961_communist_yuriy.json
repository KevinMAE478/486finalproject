However, what they often forget is that the world we live in today isn't based on successful competition (or at least the way we like it to be), but exploitation. I'll tell you why we enjoy smartphones and nice things under capitalism. \n\nTo preface, when I talk about capitalism, I mean the system of ownership characterized by private property. Private property is different from personal property in that private property is used to make money in turn for wage labor. Markets and Capitalism are two different things. The Free-Market, however, is based off of Capitalist ideology.\n\n**Exploitation**\n\nNow, exploitation doesn't just mean I beat my slave or treat my workers badly, it's something we believe is inherent to capitalism. We think that a well off employee promoting capitalism is exploited similarly (though not exactly) to a well off slave who promotes the system because it keeps them well fed, and housed. It sounds like a fantastic idea to the boss because making money off of other's work (for the sake of risk) sounds like an idea that's too good to be true when in fact, it's \"good\" because it's based on exploitation.\n\nExploitation is inherent to capitalism for a couple reasons. A boss, who doesn't even live in the same state, can make money off of private property by paying workers a wage to produce something that boss eventually owns and has full rights over. \n\nThe workers have no input in what happens to the final product, only that they participate in making it for the boss. As a result, a worker can get a 10 dollar wage while the boss can rake up hundreds of thousands in profits.\n\nThis is made worse by competition. While competition benefits consumers because of low costs, we should realize *why* that's the case, and why there's no such thing as \"ethically consuming\" something. Competition usually results in exploited labor, lower wages, off the book exploitation, layoffs, and a plethora of issues. You might think that these don't usually happen in well regulated economies, well that's because regulation hurts business, forcing them to move to places (which is now affordable because of unavoidable globalization) where they can exploit labor for cheap products.\n\nTake your IPhone, Xbox, PC, etc. They're usually pretty expensive but definitely affordable to the average consumer right? Well, this gets tricky because a lot of these products are cheap because corporations do whatever they can to cut prices, even if it means:\n\n1. Paying one dollar an hour to thousands of overworked miners in disgustingly unsafe mines in Africa to get the resources to create hardware.\n\n2. Assembling machinery in horrid factories where everyone's overworked, and a lot of people commit suicide for jobs that pay them to get by.\n\n3. Sweat shops\n\netc.\n\nThis greatly reduces costs. If an IPhone were first sold in America, it wouldn't have made it. The cost would be immensely high and barely anyone would be able to, or would want to afford it. It'd be a rich person toy until someone found a way to exploit others for the production of cheap IPhones.\n\nWhat's worse? The people I discussed actually **want** it, when they honestly shouldn't. It's like Samuel L. Jackson in Django Unchained. You always hear articles about sweatshop or Foxconn workers \"preferring\" work so they can get some money to start their own businesses or support their family, etc. \n\nEven our own media helps us lighten the mood by telling us it's ok, when in reality, the only reason capitalism works is because people halfway across the world are getting the shaft.\n\nThis is more eye opening in places where the locals participate in the tourist economy. I'm planning a trip and wanted to take a hiking trail. The good operators cost 600-1000's of U.S dollars so usually middle class to upper class folk hire them. Guess what a lot of people do now? They hire the 100-200 dollar operators who are known to severely exploit their workers. We're talking underpay, overwork, suicides, etc. Because of this, the normal operators are going to use similar tactics just to stay alive.\n\nThis also delves into globalization.\n\n**Globalization**\n\nThis is going to be a shocker, but well-regulated economies don't work well in the globalized world. This is why social democracies like Sweden and Denmark were forced to liberalize their economy. What we see today, are less regulated economies with welfare states. Now, there's a lot of factors playing into why they're definitely better than us, including a homogeneous population making democracy and the welfare state more efficient. However, we often look towards these countries as examples because they have what we in the US lack, plain and simple. A lot of people often overlook or don't take into account why a \"social democracy\" like Sweden is doing better than a \"social democracy\" like Brazil or even arguably Venezuela (since Chavez ran a Soc-Dem campaign). \n\nHowever, I digress, a globalized world is damaging to us, but inevitable. It could be argued that neoliberalism was a natural reaction to globalization. If a company has no incentive to do business in one country, why not move? \n\nRaise taxes/Regulations? Corporations move somewhere else.\n\nLower taxes/Regulations? Corporations move back to exploit the fuck out of you.\n\nThe United States has a 38 percent corporate tax rate which is one of the highest in the world. Denmark and Sweden have an almost flat tax. Liberals are usually at odds when they hear these statements. Sure, I agree; regulations would be great, but the cost of that is losing business, jobs, and wealth.\n\n**Capitalism**\n\nThere's a lot more I didn't discuss, but there should be resources in this sub or around the net. A lot of these issues don't arise from \"evil business man exploiting workers\", but the fact that capitalism makes it a natural part of life.\n\nIf you haven't heard of the unemployment pool phenomena, read into it. It talks about how business owners, through natural, and rational decisions, create planned unemployment pools to keep costs down and demand for jobs high. It's not intentional, but structured as part of the system. They don't want to exploit you, it just naturally happens.\n\nThat's just one topic of the serious, inherent problems of capitalism that can't be fixed. Another one that I haven't heard many people discuss is how the state **naturally** exists to promote and protect capitalism.\n\n- Rising crime rates from poverty and inequality leads to gentrification and concentration which leads to the need of a strong police force, as opposed to policing methods before industrialization (while not ideal, show how an alternative can exist).\n\n- How the state only really cares about what makes up a big portion of its tax base.... the rich. The state has an incentive to promote business and lower taxes for the sake of appeasing to the people who hold true power in society, the capitalist class.\n\n- Copyrights\n\n- Increased regulation and laws regarding things that can breach even individual liberties at times.\n\n- Private Property rights for the middle and upper class who make up a minority of the population but are protected because of differences between them and the regular folk. (remember, this doesn't mean personal property which only you consume).\n\n- Police stepping in to make sure the economy is functioning and putting down strikes when necessary.\n\nForget lobbying and bribing, the state needs rich people, they will always appease to them. If not, they do business elsewhere. In our case, they exploit workers in Foxconn factories so we can all enjoy our IPhones for only $600.

Another one that I haven&amp;#39;t heard many people discuss is how the state &lt;strong&gt;naturally&lt;/strong&gt; exists to promote and protect capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising crime rates from poverty and inequality leads to gentrification and concentration which leads to the need of a strong police force, as opposed to policing methods before industrialization (while not ideal, show how an alternative can exist).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the state only really cares about what makes up a big portion of its tax base.... the rich. The state has an incentive to promote business and lower taxes for the sake of appeasing to the people who hold true power in society, the capitalist class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copyrights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased regulation and laws regarding things that can breach even individual liberties at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private Property rights for the middle and upper class who make up a minority of the population but are protected because of differences between them and the regular folk. (remember, this doesn&amp;#39;t mean personal property which only you consume).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police stepping in to make sure the economy is functioning and putting down strikes when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget lobbying and bribing, the state needs rich people, they will always appease to them. If not, they do business elsewhere. In our case, they exploit workers in Foxconn factories so we can all enjoy our IPhones for only $600. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "socialism", "name": "t1_dg60y4j", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492039930.0, "created_utc": 1492011130.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 46}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5xnv2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 20, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ExultantSandwich", "parent_id": "t1_dg5wt81", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I came here from /r/all actually.
