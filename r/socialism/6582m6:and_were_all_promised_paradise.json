Banks and Landlords rule the cities, and the economy isn't producing anything because all the wealth is being extracted by the landlords and financial sectors.  Industrial Capitalism to the rescue!  Rather than finance rent and bank loans, we could instead tax those things (or write down debts), to finance infrastructure (or lower other taxes), which would then lower the cost of doing business, to allow for more production (more factories, more jobs, more employment, etc).  So now landlords and financiers start to lose their power, as citizen wealth goes up, and slowly banks start to become beholden to big industry - because they are the largest market with which to do business.   Basically, now, if a big industrial producer (like a major manufacturer or a railroad) wanted a loan to expand business, they could basically muscle the bank into giving them a very favourable loan.  Banks make small margins, debt is repaid quickly, and money in circulation is always tied to production.  It's basically an ancap fantasy of what maximum efficiency would actually look like for them, if they can ignore all the government involvement and regulation required.  Economists always used to talk about Says Law, and Industrial Capitalism was sort of trending towards that sort of equilibrium.\n\nMeanwhile, the Entente powers were using a much more primitive banking system.  Fractional reserve banking would had the economy becoming dominated by the financial sector.   It was highly unstable, and always dependent on finding a new market to corner.   There were major financial panics through the 20th century from the wild speculations of this system.  The idea is that a bank can loan out indefinitely, holding only a small portion of a deposit to be lent out again.  The thing is, that they can do this on top of money already borrowed against, so like a $1000 deposit is supposed to only be at most a $900 loan, but because they do it again on the $900 for an $810 loan, and then $810 ... and so on to the point where there is 5-10 times as much money in circulation than exists.  The problem is that it is all getting extracted by speculators who ditch out before the bottom falls out, and so someone always gets left holding the bag for the debts.  So the economy slumps, or crashes, and stagnates, and the best surefire way to kickstart it again is to find new wealth in a new market.  That means getting paid back, over and over, larger and larger, is always a matter of finding and acquiring new wealth.  So a fractional reserve system is an imperialist system, because it will always expand in search of *more*.  It has no natural moderating power, unlike the German system.\n\nSo, WWI brings these two systems into conflict - and the Germans lose, despite having the more developed economy.  Part of their defeat is that the Germans adopt the same banking system.  Now, instead of banks being beholden to industry, industry became beholden to banks - getting undesirable loans and being forced to cancel expansion to pay back interest on debt.   In this same way, the industrial capitalist becomes exploited by the financial capitalist, who is now exploiting fucking everyone (credit cards, mortgages, car payments, etc).  And they are not producing anything!  They strip companies of assets and turn them into shells.  They make all of their money on money, on interest, or speculation.\n\nSo when Marx was writing he saw the German banking system (you know, the one that was replacing banks and landlords with actual production) as the most advanced in the world and the one most suited to develop into socialism.  Other economists felt it was sort of the natural dissolvement of powers from kings down to the lords down to the merchants and now finally the peasants would slowly get better and better conditions and it would all reform nicely into some semi-heirarchical socialism.\n\n  Instead, Finance Capitalism overpowers Industrial Capitalism in the First World War, and suddenly banks and landlords start making a comeback.  It leads to economic crash, saved by the super-massive government intervention of World War II, and then slowly re-cannibalized by the financial sector to the place where we are at today (there way more too it than that, but banks taking over the world is its own story), where banks and landlords rule everything, production is falling off, yet financial sector profits keep growing and their market keeps expanding.\n\nThis is where Lenin gets way too real for people, because he basically says \"Oh shit, comrades, this is what we are up against now.  It's not nice and fluffy industrial capitalism, it's voracious imperialism.   This requires a quite different strategy . . . \" So the USSR adopts a bunch of rather imperialist policies in order to be able to fight and resist imperialism.  And he basically said that if left unchecked, Imperialism would basically go country to country and extract all their resources until they are picked to the bone, and left with nothing and no real economy and no wealth and totally plundered, and now in 2017 it kinda looks like that's exactly what's been done to much of the planet.\n\n(Also note: I haven't read much Lenin, in truth, so Leninists, if I've misinterpreted something let me know)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well  WWI was, in part, a war of banking systems, and the wrong side won and forever shifted history. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, so going back to the end of feudalism - we are stuck in a rentier economy.

Rather than finance rent and bank loans, we could instead tax those things (or write down debts), to finance infrastructure (or lower other taxes), which would then lower the cost of doing business, to allow for more production (more factories, more jobs, more employment, etc).  So now landlords and financiers start to lose their power, as citizen wealth goes up, and slowly banks start to become beholden to big industry - because they are the largest market with which to do business.   Basically, now, if a big industrial producer (like a major manufacturer or a railroad) wanted a loan to expand business, they could basically muscle the bank into giving them a very favourable loan.  Banks make small margins, debt is repaid quickly, and money in circulation is always tied to production.  It&amp;#39;s basically an ancap fantasy of what maximum efficiency would actually look like for them, if they can ignore all the government involvement and regulation required.  Economists always used to talk about Says Law, and Industrial Capitalism was sort of trending towards that sort of equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Entente powers were using a much more primitive banking system.  Fractional reserve banking would had the economy becoming dominated by the financial sector.   It was highly unstable, and always dependent on finding a new market to corner.   There were major financial panics through the 20th century from the wild speculations of this system.  The idea is that a bank can loan out indefinitely, holding only a small portion of a deposit to be lent out again.  The thing is, that they can do this on top of money already borrowed against, so like a $1000 deposit is supposed to only be at most a $900 loan, but because they do it again on the $900 for an $810 loan, and then $810 ... and so on to the point where there is 5-10 times as much money in circulation than exists.  The problem is that it is all getting extracted by speculators who ditch out before the bottom falls out, and so someone always gets left holding the bag for the debts.  So the economy slumps, or crashes, and stagnates, and the best surefire way to kickstart it again is to find new wealth in a new market.  That means getting paid back, over and over, larger and larger, is always a matter of finding and acquiring new wealth.  So a fractional reserve system is an imperialist system, because it will always expand in search of &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;.  It has no natural moderating power, unlike the German system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, WWI brings these two systems into conflict - and the Germans lose, despite having the more developed economy.  Part of their defeat is that the Germans adopt the same banking system.  Now, instead of banks being beholden to industry, industry became beholden to banks - getting undesirable loans and being forced to cancel expansion to pay back interest on debt.   In this same way, the industrial capitalist becomes exploited by the financial capitalist, who is now exploiting fucking everyone (credit cards, mortgages, car payments, etc).  And they are not producing anything!  They strip companies of assets and turn them into shells.  They make all of their money on money, on interest, or speculation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when Marx was writing he saw the German banking system (you know, the one that was replacing banks and landlords with actual production) as the most advanced in the world and the one most suited to develop into socialism.  Other economists felt it was sort of the natural dissolvement of powers from kings down to the lords down to the merchants and now finally the peasants would slowly get better and better conditions and it would all reform nicely into some semi-heirarchical socialism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, Finance Capitalism overpowers Industrial Capitalism in the First World War, and suddenly banks and landlords start making a comeback.  It leads to economic crash, saved by the super-massive government intervention of World War II, and then slowly re-cannibalized by the financial sector to the place where we are at today (there way more too it than that, but banks taking over the world is its own story), where banks and landlords rule everything, production is falling off, yet financial sector profits keep growing and their market keeps expanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where Lenin gets way too real for people, because he basically says &amp;quot;Oh shit, comrades, this is what we are up against now.  It&amp;#39;s not nice and fluffy industrial capitalism, it&amp;#39;s voracious imperialism.   This requires a quite different strategy . . . &amp;quot; So the USSR adopts a bunch of rather imperialist policies in order to be able to fight and resist imperialism.  And he basically said that if left unchecked, Imperialism would basically go country to country and extract all their resources until they are picked to the bone, and left with nothing and no real economy and no wealth and totally plundered, and now in 2017 it kinda looks like that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s been done to much of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Also note: I haven&amp;#39;t read much Lenin, in truth, so Leninists, if I&amp;#39;ve misinterpreted something let me know)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "socialism", "name": "t1_dg8w7gb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492183633.0, "created_utc": 1492154833.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg8vefa", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SvensonofSven", "parent_id": "t1_dg8hjuy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Problem is that after WWI, financial capitalism took the reigns from industrial capitalism, and basically mutated capitalism into the Imperialism that Lenin goes on about.\n\nCould you explain this in greater detail?
