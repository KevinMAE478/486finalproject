The majority of kids aren&amp;#39;t put into foster care without spending years in the worst kind of households and the damage is already done. We live in a society where there is nothing to be done about such issues - because we force people into small groups who care for their own needs. Freeing people from capitalism means giving them back their humanity.  I also believe outside of capitalism people won&amp;#39;t have the selfish desire to see their own children succeed - for the most part seeing our own offspring do well is self affirming, it makes the parent feel successful. Also, the enormous sense of relief that your child &amp;quot;did well&amp;quot;. A lot of current parenting is out of anxiety - my child has to be exceptional or he will fail! Wanting the best for your own children isn&amp;#39;t a bad thing - but the reasons behind it would be different. Under socialism it wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense to want to see your own child achieve more than the others. You&amp;#39;d want the others to do well too because in the end it benefits everyone. But capitalism forces us to petty and short sighted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "socialism", "name": "t1_dgcczqx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492395394.0, "created_utc": 1492366594.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjii", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pd83", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjii", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65pd83", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcjtze", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CommandoDude", "parent_id": "t1_dgc65ap", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialism", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Capitalism, in general, has been the dominant socio-economic norm of society for the past 300 or so years.\n\nIf Capitalism were \"tearing apart\" society.
