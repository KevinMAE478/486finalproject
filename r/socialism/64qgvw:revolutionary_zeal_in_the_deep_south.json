I like how instead of entertaining the idea that maybe Marxists have failed the working class, they instead have to resort to inventing elaborate theories and conspiracy theories. \n\n\"Clearly it's not the vanguard that's wrong, those silly working people are just too blinded by ideology/contradiction/false consciousness/propaganda to realize that the eternal truths of Marxism will set them free! Obviously it is up to us middle class intellectuals to take control of society and seize political power to guide them to truth!\"\n\nWorking people want to be free from wage slavery, want to have their needs met, and want to be free to live whatever sort of life they choose. Pretty simple. They're not interested in being disciplined pawns for party idealogues in their struggle to remake society in their image. Workers like me look back at history and see a repeated history of intellectuals and the middle classes using us, and promising us liberation if we just follow their lead, in their struggle against the upper classes. We see that as soon as the idealogues get the political power they want, workers are disposed of and relegated back to the same position we were to start with. The real truth of class struggle is that all forms of political authority and governance are ultimately tools to oppress those who work and produce value for society, liberation will only come by breaking down all those institutions without reservations. Political power never institutes itself for the sake of abolishing itself or \"withering away,\" the nature of authority is to perpetuate itself. Our task then is to eliminate authority from the start.\n\nMarx is good for understanding capital, class domination, and exploitation. As a political program, though, Marxism should be left in the dustbin of history along with other failed twentieth century ideologies.

I like how instead of entertaining the idea that maybe Marxists have failed the working class, they instead have to resort to inventing elaborate theories and conspiracy theories. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Clearly it&amp;#39;s not the vanguard that&amp;#39;s wrong, those silly working people are just too blinded by ideology/contradiction/false consciousness/propaganda to realize that the eternal truths of Marxism will set them free! Obviously it is up to us middle class intellectuals to take control of society and seize political power to guide them to truth!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Working people want to be free from wage slavery, want to have their needs met, and want to be free to live whatever sort of life they choose.
