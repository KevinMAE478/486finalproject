And while this attitude wins the day and cements Luke\u2019s status as a true Jedi Knight, it is the same attitude that led to the Order\u2019s collapse in the Prequel Trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we saw in &lt;em&gt;Revenge of the Sith&lt;/em&gt;, a taciturn, emotionless outlook will eventually create outliers (Anakin, Dooku, and, to an extent, Qui-Gon Jinn) who resort to extreme and sometimes violent means to reprimand that outlook for personal gain. Say what you will about the Prequel Trilogy, but Lucas had a clear design in portraying the Jedi as staunch, out-of-touch monks \u2013 what many saw as poor writing was an admittedly flawed articulation of the notion that Jedi ideals were incompatible with human nature. The Jedi didn\u2019t fail because of Palpatine; they failed because they\u2019d grown beholden to archaic notions of good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ll get back to this is a minute. Right now, let\u2019s focus on Rey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to a Post-&lt;em&gt;Jedi&lt;/em&gt; world. Together with the Alliance, Luke helps sweep the galaxy for remnants of the Galactic Empire. He\u2019s a badass Jedi, doing what badass Jedi do: punishing evil and restoring order. In &lt;em&gt;Jedi&lt;/em&gt;, we saw him carve through Jabba\u2019s henchman like paper \u2013 here, he\u2019s a young, Force-wielding knight at the peak of his power. Topple one dictator and the whole thing goes right to your head, so it\u2019s easy to imagine Luke becoming just a mite sanctimonious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that self-righteous attitude blows up in his face when, at some point, he kills an Imperial. The Imperial himself doesn\u2019t really matter. All that matters is that he has a baby, and that baby is now an orphan. Rather than leave this child to a life of poverty and sunset-staring, Luke does what any reasonable, guilt-stricken person would do: he adopts this baby as his own, names it Rey, and says, \u201cYou will be better than me.\u201d And together with Rey, Luke Skywalker retires from war and starts a brand-new Jedi academy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As he watches the child grow, he realizes that every Imperial he\u2019s ever killed was a person \u2013 he hasn\u2019t been cutting through heartless meat, he\u2019s been slaughtering either drafted soldiers or conscripted orphans. People with homes, histories, families. People with stories. This forces him to question the binary ideals of good and evil as taught by the Jedi. For the first time, Luke Skywalker starts to wonder if he is, in fact, the asshole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take Finn. A bumbling, generally well-meaning kid who was conscripted into the First Order at a young age. Regarding Finn\u2019s opinion of Luke, Boyega flat-out says that someone like Skywalker would be seen as a terrorist from Finn\u2019s perspective: \u201cFor Finn, he\u2019s been raised from the ashes of the Empire. He\u2019s been taught about Luke Skywalker, he knows about his history. For him it\u2019s like joining the army and then learning about one of the great enemies of your country.\u201d Having blown up two Death Stars &lt;em&gt;filled with people like Finn&lt;/em&gt;, Luke is admittedly upset with the notion of moral relativism. The seeds have been planted. In killing Rey\u2019s father, Luke has opened a door inside his head: a door marked &lt;strong&gt;Maybe the Jedi had it wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this soul-searching comes too late, and the rigid code of the Jedi good-and-evil binary bites him in the ass when his nephew, Ben, hits puberty. All his life, Ben has heard nothing but \u201cthere is Good and there is Evil and never the twain shall meet.\u201d So rather than dealing with his darker instincts like a mentally healthy person would do, he decides to go all-in and embrace them. He becomes Kylo Ren, an embodiment of rage, anger, and blind destruction \u2013 he\u2019s a &lt;em&gt;Weird Al&lt;/em&gt; parody of the Sith, mimicking the boogeymen his uncle warned him about. Here, we have another Anakin: someone so fed up with the restrictive dogma of the Jedi that he embraces their ideological opposite in the worst possible way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Kylo slaughters his Jedi classmates, as one does. While &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; isn\u2019t exactly the appropriate venue for a school shooting metaphor, this is exactly how it plays out in the flashback as depicted in &lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt; - a handful of black-clad outcasts carving through their peers as &lt;em&gt;The Darth Plagueis Mixtape&lt;/em&gt; blares over the intercom. Kylo Ren\u2019s Vader-like outfit isn\u2019t just a sign of reverence to his fallen grandfather \u2013 it\u2019s a symbol that the cycle has repeated and the Jedi\u2019s staunch ideology has once again produced unspeakable violence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then Kylo happens upon Rey \u2013 a child, a friend, his cousin in all but name. And rather than kill her, Kylo holds his nose and does the unthinkable: he compromises. He wipes her mind and drops her off on Jakku. Remember the flashback in &lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt;? Even as Rey screams \u201cCome back!\u201d to the fleeing starship, Kylo Ren sits onboard and facetimes Snoke about how he &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; slaughtered his cousin and how it was \u201cso fucking badass and evil, I swear.\u201d This momentary indiscretion eats at him, and it\u2019s why he\u2019s so eager to impale his father the first chance he gets \u2013 remember, he\u2019s embraced the idea that you must be either entirely good or entirely evil. Saving a little girl from the pale space-scrotum (Snoke) is decidedly not-evil, so Kylo has been longing for a way to balance to scales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so Rey, blind to her abilities, spends ten years screwing around on Jakku as her Jedi powers lie dormant, waiting to be unleashed. By chance, she happens upon a BB-8 unit carrying vital information, and the subsequent events made $2 billion at the box office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke, meanwhile, realizes that adhering to the dogmatic principles of the Jedi has created catastrophe yet again. Worst of all, he was in the perfect position to stop it, and failed. So he retreats, in exile and in shame, to die alone as the last of the Jedi. And after spending ten-or-so years jerking off to erotically-shaped rocks, imagine Luke\u2019s surprise when his long-dead-not-daughter shows up and hands him his father\u2019s lightsaber.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke has a miracle on hands: one last chance to get it right. So what\u2019s the first lesson for Rey? &lt;strong&gt;\u201cIt is time for the Jedi to end\u201d&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 and, by extension, their archaic conception of good and evil. Luke is one-hundred percent done with this shit, and his design for Rey is imperative: in order to amend the mistakes of the past, he must teach her to look beyond the Jedi code and carve out a new path for future generations. To do that, he has to tell her the truth about her past \u2013 he must dash her hopes against the rocks and make her hate him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The revelation in &lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt; turned the Original Trilogy on its head \u2013 it flipped the narrative from \u201cDarth Vader must be destroyed\u201d to \u201cDarth Vader must be saved.\u201d It opened doors previously unthinkable, and &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt; might just pull off the same trick. Here, the revelation is infinitely more complicated \u2013 we learn that Luke\u2019s relationship with Rey is not one of love and fatherhood, but of murder and guilt. Rey will have to wrestle with the complexity of that relationship and the complexity within herself if she is to become the first in a new generation of Force-wielders: a generation that is not beholden to the rage of the Sith or the staunchness of the Jedi, but rather to a serenity that arises only from embracing the intricacy of human emotion and acknowledging the fundamental truth that we are all composed of instincts both dark and benevolent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is time for the Jedi to end \u2013 and something new, led by Rey, to begin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Luke killed Rey\u2019s father and felt guilty about it. Also, the series is taking a step away from the black-and-white morality of the original trilogy and embracing a more complex evaluation of human emotion.
