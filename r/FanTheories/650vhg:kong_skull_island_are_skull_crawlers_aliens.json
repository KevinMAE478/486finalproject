That still does not change the fact that there is only one species of them left, so what happened to the other dinosaurs? well, as we see in the scene that the soldiers fight the skull crawlers, one soldier is positioned on top of a ceratopsian skull, so we know there were others. Basically, what i am trying to get at here is that perhaps when the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs came, it carried the skull crawlers with it, and the reason they live underground is because that is how they adapted to live on their home world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!
