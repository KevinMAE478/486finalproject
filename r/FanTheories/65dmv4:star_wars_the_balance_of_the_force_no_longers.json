The people are light and dark, not the force. Imagine the timeless depiction of an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other. Now look at the poster. \n\nThe disproportionately large Luke seems to be advocating for the end of the Jedi. Perhaps because they are too regimented, a problem shared by the Sith (or whatever order sits diametrically opposed to the Jedi). Reject the order of things. Abandon the notion that anything has been predetermined. Decide for yourself whether the light and dark are good and evil or it is the individual that makes it so. \n\nThe current state of the force is more like a seesaw. The Jedi rise as the Sith fall. The Sith rise as the Jedi fall. The solution is to remove the pivot point. Without the pivot point neither side rises and neither side falls. Good and evil remain as they always will but they no longer rise and fall by evangelism without the pivot point. Destroy the order on both sides.
