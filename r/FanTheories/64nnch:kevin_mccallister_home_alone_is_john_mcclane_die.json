I think Kevin had a big falling out with his family who clearly did not take care of him and decided to leave them behind and start fresh, changing his name from one Mc to another. Actually not only that he went from one McC to another McC and one generic name to another. And where else would he start this new thrill seeking life than in New York, where he took down the wet/sticky bandits once again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://gph.is/2hKc31K\"&gt;http://gph.is/2hKc31K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Kevin is now John living in the city and he attempts to start a family. But he has no idea how because he grew up in a dysfunctional home with absent parental figures, which explains his inability to keep his family together through 5 full films. But he clearly wants to have a real family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://gph.is/2hK2xf0\"&gt;http://gph.is/2hK2xf0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So one christmas he decides he needs to win back his wife, because he will NOT let another family be lost on another christmas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://gph.is/1TDwD0k\"&gt;http://gph.is/1TDwD0k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://gph.is/2glPGBH\"&gt;http://gph.is/2glPGBH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course this is too bad because that will require him to fly.
