Obviously traumatized by the constant stress and violence in his house, Normans psyche began to crack, leading to Norman killing his father. In many Christian circles, trauma can open a door to demonic influence in an individuals life. There&amp;#39;s also an idea of generational curses, which is a rampant line of sin which jumps from generation to generation, usually started by some unchecked, major sin, embraced by a family member in the past (note: I&amp;#39;m not sure about this belief in Orthodox Christianity). Norma and Caleb grew up in an extremely abusive household, where their only source of comfort was each other. This lead to an incestuous affair between the two of them (which led to Dylan being born) that Norma denied for years, claiming Caleb had raped her, which was untrue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So what, Norma and Norman had traumatic pasts, that doesn&amp;#39;t make Norman possessed!&amp;quot; You shout.
