Is Batman actually aware that he is a criminal, just like the monsters that he fights against?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While it may be a necessary approach to target corrupt criminals and for those who willingly commit crimes because they want to, what about people who commit crimes because they have to or because they have no other choice? Research says that those who commit crimes are not as &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; as they are portrayed and sometimes, they are people with a tragic background or commit crimes to survive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And what about the issue regarding Arkham Asylum? Is it meant to help and rehabilitate these criminals to reduce the chances to commit crimes in the future or is it just another &amp;quot;loony bin for the evil ones and the crazies&amp;quot; which is very similar to a setting of that from a psychological horror film? Does Arkham Asylum exist just to let them rot and not meant to help them at all? Research says that it is is not the most effective approach to &amp;quot;bring justice&amp;quot; to these criminals as it gives this black and white mentality and sees the mentally ill as evil people and cannot be cured or rehabilitated in any way and more likely to be ostracised from the rest of society and commit crimes in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just to clarify, I am a Batman fan, meaning I have nothing against him and I am not trying to criticise against the lore and mentality of Batman but through my years of reading comics and watching other media related to the lore of Batman, I do often find dilemmas and ironies that do not really make much sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(and also, I am pretty much aware that different interpretations of Batman vary from writer to writer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from the fact that he is human and has no superpowers which make him more relatable, he has three things that make him unique: the persistence and indomitable willpower, his incredible amount of wealth which gives him an endless arsenal of tools and equipment to use, and this extremely logical, tactical, and scientific mind since he is a thinker, planner and a detective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do understand for sure that he has a huge grudge against crime and he promised to avenge his parents\u2019 deaths against all criminals after having to suffer that horrible trauma at a very young age, so I can understand why he is willing to punish all criminals and why he was willing to go all out to even become a persona of intimidation and superstition to make criminals shit their pants before committing a crime. Though his main motivation is his will to avenge his parents, he took a logical choice to commit to the \u201cno kill\u201d rule because he didn\u2019t want to be at the same level of his enemies as he said once in Batman Year One \u201cscum maybe. But even scum have &lt;a href=\"http://www.readcomics.tv/batman-year-one-special-edition/chapter-1/single\"&gt;families&lt;/a&gt;\u201d (pg. 16)and as a true personification of justice, not vengeance &lt;em&gt;(even though it shows that he doesn\u2019t like the justice system or how it works because if he did, he would have probably become a police officer or a lawyer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, he wants to fight crime ... by becoming a criminal &lt;em&gt;(obviously, since he is a vigilante)&lt;/em&gt; though he once said to Robin in the DC Animated Movie \u201cSon of Batman\u201d, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2W4RVpj9A8\"&gt;\u201cYou cannot fight crime by becoming a criminal\u201d&lt;/a&gt;. Right, because vigilantism is not illegal at all, right? But in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KfsAK3fIQo\"&gt;\u201cDark Knight Returns\u201d&lt;/a&gt; animated movie and in the latest movie &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwiNzV6QMog\"&gt;\u201cBatman v Superman\u201d&lt;/a&gt;, Batman himself acknowledged that he is actually a criminal. So is he aware that he is a technically a criminal because his actions do not actually make him a law abiding citizen or not? Does he actually see himself in a black and white or me vs them mentality?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even though he will willing to induce fear in the hearts of all criminals in Gotham and since Batman is more or less a thinker, isn\u2019t he aware that his actions of being Batman are making things worse?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since Batman is pretty much a brains-kind of hero as one of his many fields that he learned during his training was &lt;a href=\"http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/batman/images/9/93/Batman_biography_Arkham_City.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150717063603\"&gt;criminal psychology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(among many other fields of knowledge)&lt;/em&gt;, shouldn\u2019t Batman be aware that not all criminals, especially people who do petty crimes like pickpocketing, are not actually bad people but people who were in bad situations like &lt;a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/inside-the-criminal-mind/201412/crime-causes-poverty\"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt; which one of the common factors of crime? &lt;em&gt;(of course, that does not mean that the crime is justified because some form of discipline and justice is still required before things get worse)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Mr. Freeze has a motivation that we can sympathise with because he found out that his wife is terminally ill and commits crime &lt;a href=\"http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Victor_Fries\"&gt;to find the cure for his wife&lt;/a&gt; or in the last few pages of The Killing Joke, Batman was willing to sympathise with the Joker and offer him to chance &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/R7UDF\"&gt;to help or rehabilitate him&lt;/a&gt; to stop their long fight before one of them kills the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, as such as I do agree that some criminals deserve to have a taste of their own medicine and show the meaning of fear &lt;em&gt;(like Black Mask, the Penguin and the Joker)&lt;/em&gt; because before Bruce Wayne took the persona of Batman, Gotham is incredibly corrupt from both criminals and people who work with the law. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But shouldn\u2019t Batman know that this action makes people more likely to go back and commit crimes in the future? There is this phenomenon in psychology known as &lt;a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/10/fear-based-appeals.aspx\"&gt;fear appeal&lt;/a&gt; where people use fear tactics to motivate people to avoid doing a behaviour once that fear was induced &lt;em&gt;(for example, to avoid smokers from smoking, you show them explicit pictures from what a smoker\u2019s lung is like)&lt;/em&gt;. It sounds good on paper but there is a catch \u2013 too much fear will backfire and the whole phenomenon goes backwards, what is known as the &lt;a href=\"https://www.ohpe.ca/node/113\"&gt;boomerang effect&lt;/a&gt; and knowing how Batman behaves and treats his enemies, he intentionally wants to traumatise them and scar them for life. The more you treat them as criminals, the more they will start thinking of themselves as criminals, the more likely it will turn into a &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=jvAQ4Bhm5FIC&amp;amp;pg=PA57&amp;amp;lpg=PA57&amp;amp;dq=boomerang+effect+self+fulfilling+prophecy&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=ssO7FHuQbn&amp;amp;sig=p-n2FElx22v82TahkPRAxbaS9VM&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-5YD6iqDTAhUBmxQKHUvGA-AQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=boomerang%20effect%20self%20fulfilling%20prophecy&amp;amp;f=false\"&gt;self-fulfilling prophecy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, not to mention of how many of his enemies broke out of Arkham Asylum or Blackgate to commit crimes again just so that they would get their revenge or cause havoc because ... why not?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Arhkam Asylum ... it is not really the most helpful of places to help rehabilitate the criminally insane. \nFor starters, it has \u201cAsylum\u201d in its name, not \u201chospital\u201d or \u201cclinic\u201d, it\u2019s a name spells out \u201chome for the insane and the freaks\u201d. Now even though most of Batman\u2019s enemies go there in hopes of being rehabilitated and hopefully law abiding citizens, that place doesn\u2019t really look so ... hopeful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/8024/what-is-the-word-that-is-used-nowadays-to-mean-asylum\"&gt;Out of mind and out of sight&lt;/a&gt; to further distance these criminals from everyone else, making them feel more isolated and feel that they are different than everyone else. Feeling that they deserve that kind of \u201cpunishment\u201d because they are too inhuman and dangerous &lt;em&gt;(which they are in some way)&lt;/em&gt; to be in a \u201chospital\u201d that is specially designed to care for patients/clients like them which is built in within the city. It gives out this us vs them mentality&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, comic book interpretations of that place and even in the Arkham Asylum game, you can clearly see that Arkham Asylum is nothing more but an asylum straight from a &lt;a href=\"http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Arkham_Asylum\"&gt;psychological horror movie&lt;/a&gt; of an old Victorian era design &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine those mentally ill patients who are dangerous and violent and commit crimes without their intention or awareness &lt;em&gt;(such as a very hostile schizophrenic or a guy with multiple personality disorder with an abusive past and one of his personalities is his physically abusive reckless parent)&lt;/em&gt;, imagine the fear and anxiety that the setting provokes to those patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you want to rehabilitate and treat these patients who are taken there, you are already not doing a very good job with the setting &lt;em&gt;(not to mention the chances of being discriminated and de-individualised from staff and other people who work there)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, some of the staff there are not really there to help people. Some of them are .. well, criminally insane as the criminals who are put there such as &lt;a href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Hugo_Strange_(New_Earth\"&gt;Hugo Strange&lt;/a&gt;). So if you know someone who even looks like a mentally deranged person or you have a hunch that he or she is so mentally out of touch with reality and is prone or wants to do horrible things to you or to someone else &lt;em&gt;(whether it was done intentionally/consciously or not, which contract to popular belief, most people who are diagnosed with a mental illness are not actually \u201ccrazy\u201d or deranged or even dangerous)&lt;/em&gt;, you can just dump them in Arkham Asylum and throw the key and let them rot &lt;em&gt;(and then these criminals are do feel criminalised and dehumanised and their view as a criminal who does not deserve to be a normal, functioning person slowly diminishes and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if Batman\u2019 aim is to treat his enemies and all other criminals who are taken to Arkham Asylum, he is not doing a very good job either and is making things worse. Is Arkham Asylum meant to be a hospital to treat the criminally insane and the mentally ill or is it just another prison where you can dump these criminals and let them rot like Blackgate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t managed to see Batman or even Bruce Wayne put much emphasis on making Arkham Asylum a much better while simultaneously keeping the streets of Gotham in check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, there are plenty of bad criminals in Gotham like Black Mask and the Penguin and they do deserve justice &lt;em&gt;(not punishment)&lt;/em&gt; but we slowly learned that not all of Batman&amp;#39;s enemies are as villainous or as evil as we thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of them are physical representations of Batman&amp;#39;s personality &lt;em&gt;(like Bane is Batman&amp;#39;s rage and anger who also lost his own mother but he lived his entire life as a criminal. Or Scarecrow is a physical representation of Batman&amp;#39;s fear tactic but he was a nerdy boy who was physically bullied throughout his childhood and he was unfortunate enough to be a test subject of the fear toxin which violates a lot of ethical issues)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, it is quite strange that while Batman took the logical choice to not kill because he sees criminals as people deep down but not invest on rehabilitation or some form of psychological help to these people who help prevent them from committing more crimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, the fear tactic has its own benefits and sometimes, it is indeed effective &lt;em&gt;(after all, it is how the legal department and the justice system works to keep law abiding citizens in check though it can sometimes be abused like North Korea&amp;#39;s system is to worship Kim Jung Un or suffer the most horrible tortures)&lt;/em&gt; but too much is still too much and has a lot of consequences&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I love Batman. I love his stories. I love his bravery and his willpower. I love seeing some new plan that he makes out of the whim that I was not aware of and I love the villains because they are very memorable and interesting but taking from a critical and analytical setting and looking through the mind of Batman, if Batman really is a thinker as we think he is, then I guess he has not been doing a very good job to eliminate crime in Gotham and help those who commit crimes because as far as we are aware, Batman realises that his enemies are damaged in some way much like he is, then he may not be doing a very good job to eliminate crime altogether or minimise it at a controllable level.

It's to address his wants and needs.\n\n1) Batman helps people, but the reason he does it is to assuage his own personal demons and moral beliefs, and not for the benefit of others. He'd rather keep playing hero even if it means people dying because the problem isn't getting fully addressed. He could, for example, hold a gun and fire it in self-defense. If Joker had knocked on Jim Gordon's door instead of Barbara Gordon's door, there's a chance that Joker would have caught a bullet in the face, saving countless lives, and nobody would think any less of Jim Gordon for having defended himself against a serial killer. It'd be just 1 normal guy with a gun permanently fixing a problem that Batman refuses to.\n\n2) **Batman chooses to be ineffective.** Batman could easily bang it out toe-to-toe with the Hulk or KO superman in a single punch. That's not an outrageous claim: **Batman, Iron Man, and Dr. Doom all have the same powerset!**. They both have effectively infinite wealth and resources, as well as an infinite amount of off-panel free time to accomplish anything they want. Thus Batman would field a hulk-buster suit at any time, or magical armor like Doom. Or even spend a summer with his bestie Zatanna and take out Superman by simply saying \"Srewop On.\" and taking down Superman with one bare fisted punch. \n\nBatman's limitations in dealing with bad guys are self-imposed. He likes the feeling of struggling against bad guys with the least efficient means because of the thrill and satisfaction from smashing faces with his own hands and feet. It's his way of temporarily soothing his own psychological damage. If he really wanted to stop threats, it'd be trivial to do so in a more permanent fashion the way his protege Jason Todd does, with a bullet. \n\nJason Todd himself is an example of Batman's refusal to deal with the Joker problem. He had a wealth of opportunity to stop Joker permanently, and by refusing to do so, Joker was able to kill Jason Todd the way he did. The way the story attempts to make it seem like Red Hood is a little crazy for blaming Batman, but the Joker is quite crazy, you don't blame the Joker for being Joker. But Batman at least likes to pretend that he has the mental capacity to know better and understand that his actions have consequences. Batman himself is pretty commonly depicted as accepting responsibility for what happened to Jason...because he IS responsible.\n\n**And what about getting more help to stop all these deaths in Gotham?** Batman famously has a whole Batfamily of people working for him and applying his methods. But nearly all of them did so over his extreme reluctance and his clear instructions to NOT get involved in protecting the people that Batman is clearly failing to save. Every time an outside hero visits Gotham to stop, I'm sure everybody reading this can tell me how that encounter goes. The visiting hero saves a person, and Batman shows up to say, \"Stop, get out\". Like I said, Batman's activities in Gotham are for Batman first and foremost, not for the good of Gotham.\n\n**Batman wouldn't even need to kill anyone either**. In the case of repeat offenders for whom rehabilitation has been ineffective, Batman has the following alternatives:\n\n1) Instead of constantly trusting a provably incompetent institution to lock these guys up, Batman could invest some of his infinite free time into building his own prison. It's a hell of a lot easier to break out of Arkham than say...the goddamn Phantom Zone! Cobblepot's crafty, but he has nothing at his disposal that could help him out of there. \n\n2) Cripple them. It's grisly, but these are repeat offenders and rehabilitation has been tried in earnest. Obviously, you'd want to apply the minimal amount of force necessary to ensure these guys aren't an ongoing threat. Destroy a kneecap for example, and they'll be confined to limping or the use of a cane, making it impossible for them to contemplate a plan involving any kind of running or fighting. If the first application doesn't work, remove an elbow. Maybe they manage to charismatically cajoke henchmen into dong the evil deeds on their behalf? Destroy their larynx and they'll need have to try to do that gang leadership through text. Sooner or later, they'll be ineffective, and really, nobody's going to feel bad about the serial killer that limps because of they way their last rampage got stopped. You still allow them to live and explore a fulfilling life in rehabilitation.", "edited": 1492454413.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batman&amp;#39;s work is first and foremost for Batman.

It&amp;#39;d be just 1 normal guy with a gun permanently fixing a problem that Batman refuses to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Batman chooses to be ineffective.&lt;/strong&gt; Batman could easily bang it out toe-to-toe with the Hulk or KO superman in a single punch. That&amp;#39;s not an outrageous claim: &lt;strong&gt;Batman, Iron Man, and Dr. Doom all have the same powerset!&lt;/strong&gt;. They both have effectively infinite wealth and resources, as well as an infinite amount of off-panel free time to accomplish anything they want. Thus Batman would field a hulk-buster suit at any time, or magical armor like Doom. Or even spend a summer with his bestie Zatanna and take out Superman by simply saying &amp;quot;Srewop On.&amp;quot; and taking down Superman with one bare fisted punch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Batman&amp;#39;s limitations in dealing with bad guys are self-imposed. He likes the feeling of struggling against bad guys with the least efficient means because of the thrill and satisfaction from smashing faces with his own hands and feet. It&amp;#39;s his way of temporarily soothing his own psychological damage. If he really wanted to stop threats, it&amp;#39;d be trivial to do so in a more permanent fashion the way his protege Jason Todd does, with a bullet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jason Todd himself is an example of Batman&amp;#39;s refusal to deal with the Joker problem. He had a wealth of opportunity to stop Joker permanently, and by refusing to do so, Joker was able to kill Jason Todd the way he did. The way the story attempts to make it seem like Red Hood is a little crazy for blaming Batman, but the Joker is quite crazy, you don&amp;#39;t blame the Joker for being Joker. But Batman at least likes to pretend that he has the mental capacity to know better and understand that his actions have consequences. Batman himself is pretty commonly depicted as accepting responsibility for what happened to Jason...because he IS responsible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what about getting more help to stop all these deaths in Gotham?&lt;/strong&gt; Batman famously has a whole Batfamily of people working for him and applying his methods. But nearly all of them did so over his extreme reluctance and his clear instructions to NOT get involved in protecting the people that Batman is clearly failing to save. Every time an outside hero visits Gotham to stop, I&amp;#39;m sure everybody reading this can tell me how that encounter goes. The visiting hero saves a person, and Batman shows up to say, &amp;quot;Stop, get out&amp;quot;. Like I said, Batman&amp;#39;s activities in Gotham are for Batman first and foremost, not for the good of Gotham.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batman wouldn&amp;#39;t even need to kill anyone either&lt;/strong&gt;. In the case of repeat offenders for whom rehabilitation has been ineffective, Batman has the following alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Instead of constantly trusting a provably incompetent institution to lock these guys up, Batman could invest some of his infinite free time into building his own prison. It&amp;#39;s a hell of a lot easier to break out of Arkham than say...the goddamn Phantom Zone! Cobblepot&amp;#39;s crafty, but he has nothing at his disposal that could help him out of there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Cripple them. It&amp;#39;s grisly, but these are repeat offenders and rehabilitation has been tried in earnest. Obviously, you&amp;#39;d want to apply the minimal amount of force necessary to ensure these guys aren&amp;#39;t an ongoing threat. Destroy a kneecap for example, and they&amp;#39;ll be confined to limping or the use of a cane, making it impossible for them to contemplate a plan involving any kind of running or fighting. If the first application doesn&amp;#39;t work, remove an elbow. Maybe they manage to charismatically cajoke henchmen into dong the evil deeds on their behalf? Destroy their larynx and they&amp;#39;ll need have to try to do that gang leadership through text. Sooner or later, they&amp;#39;ll be ineffective, and really, nobody&amp;#39;s going to feel bad about the serial killer that limps because of they way their last rampage got stopped. You still allow them to live and explore a fulfilling life in rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FanTheories", "name": "t1_dgdwh4g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492482982.0, "created_utc": 1492454182.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6rc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p1bf", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6rc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p1bf", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6rc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p1bf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcq8xv", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WereAboutToArgue", "parent_id": "t1_dgcflgh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FanTheories", "controversiality": 0, "body": "There have been stories where villains blame Batman for creating them (my favorite is the \"Trial\" episode of BTAS), but many ultimately admit that they'd be just as messed up without him.", "edited": 1492407090.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been stories where villains blame Batman for creating them (my favorite is the &amp;quot;Trial&amp;quot; episode of BTAS), but many ultimately admit that they&amp;#39;d be just as messed up without him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FanTheories", "name": "t1_dgcq8xv", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492412953.0, "created_utc": 1492384153.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6rc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65p1bf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcimiw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "noryu", "parent_id": "t1_dgcflgh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FanTheories", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, exactly.
