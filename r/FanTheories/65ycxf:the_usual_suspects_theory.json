Because kint was seen on the boat killing people and exposing his face, I think kint went on the boat killing people so the man in the suit who is actually keyser s\u00f6ze, can make sure he gets Arturo Marquez the man who can identify him and he happens to come across McManus and Keaton.

I think kint was ordered to clean up the boat for keyser, then he was to be captured and go back into character as a cripple, to spin the tale to the police and kint would have no attention to him due to him appearing weak, however the burnt Hungarian is a variable which wasn&amp;#39;t anticipated but lucky for kint he told his story in just enough time, but this checks out for keyser as the police thinks kint is keyser when he is not.
