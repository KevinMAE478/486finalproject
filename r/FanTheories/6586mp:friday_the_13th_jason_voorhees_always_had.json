The &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxoE9td3Hko\"&gt;explanation is that Jason survived his drowning,&lt;/a&gt; but then why didn&amp;#39;t his mother ever find him?

Wait wasn&amp;#39;t he still a weird zombie child at the end of the first movie?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plot hole 2)  Jason seems to be a normal psycho killer in the first 4 movies, but then he magically turns into a zombie for seemingly no reason other than being dug up by Tommy Jarvis and a bolt of lightening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plot hole 3)  In Jason goes to Hell, Jason suddenly has the ability to possess other people&amp;#39;s bodies.  Also some weird new stuff about Jason only being able to be killed by a member of his own family.  Also he can resurrect himself completely through a female member of his own family.  It didn&amp;#39;t really seem to make much sense... or did it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My personal fan theory has been that Jason really did die as a boy in 1958 and supernatural elements were present in all of the friday movies.  Pamela Voorhees had been trying to resurrect Jason for years using the Necronomicon.  &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L62H_tW_Hn8\"&gt;Yes, the same Necronomicon from the Evil Dead movies.  This isn&amp;#39;t part of my theory, they used the exact same prop in both movies and it was confirmed to be an intentional crossover in the comic book series.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Part 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pamela was unable to resurrect her son, but had succeeded in allowing Jason to speak through her.  This is why &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/s-ABmfXlkys?t=1m51s\"&gt;she speaks in Jason&amp;#39;s voice at the end of the first movie and answers back in her own voice&lt;/a&gt;.  This isn&amp;#39;t just insanity.  Jason&amp;#39;s spirit is actually inside her and communicating with her voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Pamela Voorhees is killed at the end of part one, it is the right blood sacrifice on the edge of Crystal Lake that finally brings Jason back to life.  It&amp;#39;s even possible that maybe Pamela Voorhees wanted to die, because she knew that it was the only thing that would bring her son back.  It would explain why she so easily killed every other counselor, but seems to hold back several times from killing Alice.  She wants Alice to kill her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After Pam is beheaded, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RObb2QfBnUs\"&gt;Jason comes back to life and attacks Alice&lt;/a&gt;.  This is not a dream or hallucination.  Jason at this point has been brought back to life and is extremely pissed off.

My theory is that Jason at the end of part 4 thinks that Tommy Jarvis is offering his body to be possessed and a little bit of Jason&amp;#39;s spirit went into Tommy Jarvis at this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tommy keeps dreaming of Jason and &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltdgreWmnSY\"&gt;has fears that he is becoming Jason&lt;/a&gt;.
