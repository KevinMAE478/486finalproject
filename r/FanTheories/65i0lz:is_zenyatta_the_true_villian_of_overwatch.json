Zenyatta and his monk buddies believe that &amp;quot;We are all one with the iris&amp;quot;(with/in the iris) and this got me thinking they were connected. Not JUST cus the &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; &amp;quot;iris&amp;quot; connection but because of other influences for shows or movies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An example would be Rick and Morty. There was an episode where there was this space gas thing , and he seemed like a kind , universe loving being, but in the end wanted to purge the universe and start over.

I heard from a Youtuber (once again I&amp;#39;ll have to find and edit him in later) throw and idea on what might be happening with the hero line up. As hero 24 came closer we all thought DoomFist  (kinky sounding) would be it. Well he suggested the reason it was Orisa and not DoomFist and why we won&amp;#39;t see DoomFist for a while is because the developers may be treating it like a series. Like on how a series progresses more characters are introduced to further the plot (Ana , Sombra , Orisa, some possible bad guys)and then as the series reaches it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Finale&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;Boss&amp;quot; character is introduced - DoomFist&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree with this , I mean DoomFist seems like a higher tier villain and should be introduced later as more of Overwatchs plot and story gets developed, but here&amp;#39;s the thing.. Talon WASN&amp;#39;T in the center of Sombra&amp;#39;s grid... the &amp;quot;Eye&amp;quot; was. Weird huh? So there&amp;#39;s an organization that&amp;#39;s more powerful than Talon?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think - going back to the &amp;quot;series&amp;quot; idea - that after the finale we find out the TRUE villian.. a plot twist that the ones that have been pulling the strings all along was Shambhala.
