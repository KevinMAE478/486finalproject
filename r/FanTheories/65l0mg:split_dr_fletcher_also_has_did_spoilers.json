It's also a fact that Dennis' other identities have their separate rooms, thus Dr. Fletcher's other identities have their own rooms as well, just like the neighbor.\n\nOr maybe this is not true and the purpose of the conversation with the neighbor is for Dr. Fletcher to deliver her line saying that maybe shattered people are more than those who aren't.\n", "edited": 1492302340.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be more true than not.
