I&amp;#39;m not really sure how many people are too interested in the Monkey Island series anymore. But I just wanted to post this theory that&amp;#39;s just been prattling around in my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;ll give you all a nice introduction, an &amp;#39;Exhibit A, exhibit B&amp;#39; sort of thing before we start connecting dots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To start this, you guys have to know who Ron Gilbert is. He&amp;#39;s a writer and director. He worked on Monkey Island 1, and 2. He intended to work on Monkey Island 3, to finally reveal the Secret of Monkey Island &lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, of course, life happened, and he never did it. The series continued on without the true revelation. And Ron kept making games... One of those games in particular plays into this theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2013, a new Ron Gilbert game was released... Called &amp;quot;The Cave.&amp;quot; The game featured an omnipresent, talking cave. Naturally, it was a massive tourist attraction. Complete with gift shops and props.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The premise of the Cave was as follows; You play as any three adventurers you choose, and enter The Cave. Inside the Cave, they are confronted with their &amp;#39;sin,&amp;#39; something they had done or are willing to do. It usually came at the cost of others&amp;#39; wellbeing. And it was usually motivated by selfishness, greed, ego, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoilers from now on, but you probably already expected some.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the Cave, the adventurers are confronted with one of two choices. Either give up the thing they desire most to preserve the wellbeing of others, which results in thr happy ending.... Or keep whatever you desire most, and receive a bad ending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing to note is... You cannot die in the Cave. Whenever you do, you are returned to another place or a different state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that the intro is out of the way, let me get to the meat of the theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the real Secret of Monkey Island is that it&amp;#39;s simply inside the Cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They share tons and tons of themes, designs, and even actual brands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They both feel like theme park rides. I mean... The Cave IS a theme park in itself. But throughout the Monkey Island series, things definitely do not add up. From the very first moment you set foot on Melee Island at the start of Monkey Island 1, you&amp;#39;re treated like a passenger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guybrush is constantly told to play along because, and I quote, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s pirate lingo. This is how they talked back then. Play along, Guybrush.&amp;quot;\nMost of the characters are acting like theme park staff... Putting on a show for you, and you alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good lord, even The Cave has the same exact Grog machines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would also explain why the geography of the Monkey Island games keeps changing. There is no way a tunnel under Inky Island should lead back to Melee Island. Among other, smaller instances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However... That poses another question. Why is Guybrush there? And what is Guybrush&amp;#39;s sin?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s there for himself... I think he&amp;#39;s there to find his brother, LeChuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about it... Elaine is what LeChuck desires most. He tries his damnedest to marry her. But it only results in his demise(s).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s his bad ending. LeChuck holds on to the thing he desires most, and it results in a bad ending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s no dying in the Cave. Which is why he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to stay dead. Whether it&amp;#39;s Ghost Pirate LeChuck, Zombie Pirate LeChuck, Demon Pirate LeChuck, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He comes back in a different state, in a different place. And he won&amp;#39;t rest until he learns to let go of Elaine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things such as Guybrush being given useful, very real instructions for LeChuck&amp;#39;s fortress from his own hallucination could definitely be marked off as The Cave trying to guide Guybrush to get LeChuck to just leave The Cave and go home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know. Disney has the rights to Monkey Island now, and they&amp;#39;ve shown no interest in the franchise.  I really hope we&amp;#39;ll see another MI game somewhere down the line.

But I will go off of what it did to the characters I played.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it can read minds, (All the trials + Cave Paintings + the Hillbilly&amp;#39;s trial in specific).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it has always existed and will always exist (Time Traveller Trial).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can warp reality and geography (You visit a deserted island and a snowy mountain peak inside the Cave, the Monk trial).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can fool minds, even convince them that what they&amp;#39;re doing is real (Hillbilly trial. Knight trial. Twins trial).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can change reality OUTSIDE the Cave (Adventurer trial).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might exist outside of time... As the Knight, hillbilly, and scientist can all co-exist even though they&amp;#39;re from different times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with all in mind, The Cave simply could have absorbed Guybrush in, to the point where he forgot what he was doing (He showed up to Melee Island confused as hell). And once he forgot, he sought after what he desired most. Which could have been either fame or glory in a fitting time period or maybe it was actually his childhood dream to become a pirate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I recall correctly, it was mentioned that LeChuck died after figuring out the Secret of Monkey Island. It&amp;#39;s possible he figured out and possibly exploited The Cave&amp;#39;s no death policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A common thing about all the characters from the Cave is that they all committed atrocities OUTSIDE The Cave, and brought those burdens into the Cave with them.
