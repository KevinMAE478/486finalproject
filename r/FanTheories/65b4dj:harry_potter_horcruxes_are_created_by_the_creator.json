Horcruxes involve a form of alchemy mixed with the Dark Arts, involving permanent removal of part of the physical body as well as the soul, in order to create a &amp;quot;vessel for the soul&amp;quot;. (One must sacrifice one separate part of the body for each Horcrux.) This results, naturally, in a disfigured appearance, loss of organs / limbs / etc., and other negative effects, which we see with Lord Voldemort. (Full explanation below.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As such, I would posit, too, that the &amp;quot;Horcrux ritual&amp;quot; found in &lt;em&gt;Secrets of the Darkest Art&lt;/em&gt;, also involves the branch of alchemy (also studied as a 6th-year-and up elective at Hogwarts), paired with the Dark Arts, as invented by the dark wizard Herpo the Foul.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once, it is said that J.K. Rowling was asked by her editor how one can make a Horcrux. After hearing the explanation, the editor was physically sickened / &amp;quot;looked like throwing up / nauseated / horrified&amp;quot;. I believe that JK detailing the process as &amp;quot;ripping out one&amp;#39;s eyes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cutting off one&amp;#39;s tongue&amp;quot;, etc...to complete the process of making a Horcrux would definitely cause that sort of response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Rowling also stated, &amp;quot;I couldn&amp;#39;t possibly tell you [the full process or ritual of creating a Horcrux]...Some things are better left unsaid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me explain as to why I think the process involves such &amp;quot;personal sacrifice&amp;quot;. They involve two examples involving Lord Voldemort&amp;#39;s Horcruxes: one being the Diary, and the other being the Locket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Namely, the Diary is important, as it was Tom Riddle / Lord Voldemort&amp;#39;s first Horcrux. According to Rowling, Riddle used the death of Moaning Myrtle in order to create it \u2014 namely, he created the &amp;quot;supreme act&amp;quot; of murder. However, while other theories allege that creating a Horcrux involves necrophilia, or dismemberment of the murdered victim, the &amp;quot;untouched&amp;quot; state of Riddle&amp;#39;s victims, such as the Riddle family&amp;#39;s bodies (and Myrtle&amp;#39;s body) indicates this isn&amp;#39;t the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their dinner things!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[...] Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddle&amp;#39; bodies came back and changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, &lt;strong&gt;or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), &lt;strong&gt;the Riddles all appeared to be in perfect health&lt;/strong&gt; -- apart from the fact that they were all dead. The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that &lt;strong&gt;each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face&lt;/strong&gt; -- but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death? (&lt;em&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I believe that, instead of doing something to defile his victim&amp;#39;s bodies (which I believe that Riddle himself would find a &amp;quot;disgusting concept&amp;quot; in itself), Riddle disfigured / did harm to his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; body in order to create his Horcrux(es), the Diary included. If the soul, in &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, is, indeed, tied to the body, then &amp;quot;ripping out a piece of one&amp;#39;s soul&amp;quot; would also mean one would have to &amp;quot;rip out of piece of one&amp;#39;s body&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what, exactly, did Riddle sacrifice for the Diary? I believe that, for this, Riddle carved out some of his own memories \u2014 sacrificing part of &amp;quot;himself&amp;quot; (figuratively) for the Diary&amp;#39;s existence. This could also mean that the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; Voldemort / Riddle, after the act, had permanent semi-amnesia, and no longer remembered some of his childhood or teenage years at all, missing them entirely from his memories. (Sort of like the effects of a powerful Memory Charm / &lt;em&gt;Obliviate&lt;/em&gt; on Gilderoy Lockhart.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the Locket, when I was reading &lt;em&gt;Deathly Hallows&lt;/em&gt;, something stood out to me: Riddle&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;dark and handsome&amp;quot; eyes are mentioned as being contained &amp;quot;behind the two glass panes&amp;quot; of Slytherin&amp;#39;s Locket, when the Locket is opened with Parseltongue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The golden doors of the locket swung wide with a little click. Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome as Tom Riddle&amp;#39;s eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit-pupiled...&amp;quot; (&lt;em&gt;Half-Blood Prince&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, interestingly, that it says that Riddle &amp;quot;turned&amp;quot; his eyes scarlet and slit-pupiled. What if he didn&amp;#39;t just &amp;quot;turn&amp;quot; them &amp;quot;scarlet&amp;quot;? What if he &lt;em&gt;replaced&lt;/em&gt; his original eyes with new, &amp;quot;scarlet and slit-pupiled&amp;quot; ones?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we don&amp;#39;t know exactly when Voldemort made the Locket. However, if he sacrificed his own eyes to create it, he must have done so around the time of his meeting with Dumbledore to apply for the DADA position:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snake-like, &lt;strong&gt;the eyes were not yet scarlet&lt;/strong&gt;, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet, however, it should be noted that, through the creation of some of his Horcruxes, that Voldemort&amp;#39;s physical body &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; appear much different, even grotesque:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become.&lt;/strong&gt; He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders...&amp;quot; (&lt;em&gt;Half-Blood Prince&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His &amp;quot;white, waxy skin&amp;quot;? Could&amp;#39;ve been Voldemort sacrificing his own, human skin for a Horcrux, which would&amp;#39;ve been...particularly nasty / bloody / horrifying to witness. His &amp;quot;bloody&amp;quot; eyes? Could be from Voldemort sacrificing his eyes / most of his eyes to create a different Horcrux. His &amp;quot;high and cold&amp;quot; voice? Again, another replacement, likely for sacrificing his original voice / voice box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also know that Voldemort can, and has, created replacement body parts - and even sacrificed body parts - in Dark rituals related to Horcruxes before. Namely, &amp;quot;bone of the father, flesh of the servant, and blood of the enemy&amp;quot; to create a new, resurrected physical form for himself, with the help of Peter Pettigrew, towards the end of &lt;em&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long, thin, shining silver dagger from inside his cloak. His voice broke into petrified sobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Flesh - of the servant - w-willingly given - you will - revive - your master.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He stretched his right hand out in front of him - the hand with the missing finger. He gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it happened - he closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream that pierced the night, that went through Harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He heard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail&amp;#39;s anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into the cauldron.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry couldn&amp;#39;t stand to look...but the potion had turned a burning red; the light of it shone through Harry&amp;#39;s closed eyelids...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[...] Wormtail&amp;#39;s robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them... (&lt;em&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Namely, and, even to Harry&amp;#39;s own horror, Voldemort has Pettigrew &lt;em&gt;willingly slice off his own hand&lt;/em&gt; for his &amp;quot;rebirthing potion&amp;quot;. However, upon Voldemort&amp;#39;s resurrection in his new body, he is &amp;quot;merciful&amp;quot;, and, with a mere wave of his wand, gives Pettigrew a new, magical, &amp;quot;glove-like&amp;quot;, shining and silver artificial hand to replace the one he cut off for the ritual. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;[Voldemort] looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, Master,&amp;quot; moaned Wormtail, &amp;quot;please. Master...please...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yet you helped return me to my body,&amp;quot; said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. &amp;quot;Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me...and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand&amp;#39;s wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtail&amp;#39;s bleeding wrist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wormtail&amp;#39;s sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder. (&lt;em&gt;Goblet of Fire&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we found out later, Voldemort even used what must&amp;#39;ve been a spell of his own creation, because later on, the hand could also immediately sense when Pettigrew had a moment of hesitation / doubt in his loyalty to the Dark Lord in &lt;em&gt;Deathly Hallows&lt;/em&gt;...and it proceeded to immediately strangle Pettigrew, presumably suffocating him until he died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It stands to reason that, if Voldemort could create a new hand for Pettigrew out of magic with just a wave of his wand, and quite &amp;quot;lazily&amp;quot;, as if he were doing it from years or decades of experiece, he likely not only had practice doing so, becoming a master at replacing such lost limbs...but that he had used &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt; as a test subject / guinea pig, for when he made his Horcruxes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, it&amp;#39;s interesting that Voldemort seems to see no issue with letting Pettigrew basically bleed out from his severed arm for as long as he pleases. This may point to Voldemort being well-aware that Pettigrew&amp;#39;s wound isn&amp;#39;t fatal; or, if it is, then he waits a little while, letting Pettigrew suffer in pain and from blood loss, until he decides to ultimately replace the limb. This could point to Voldemort himself, at points in his past, subjecting himself to such terrible pain / blood loss, as possibly related to his &amp;quot;changed&amp;quot; appearance and his Horcruxes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also believe that the concept of creating a Horcrux, through using a mix of alchemy (namely, human / soul transmutation) and dark magic, shares much in-common with how the topic of human transmutation itself is treated in &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Namely, in the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; books, according to Adalbert Waffling&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Fundamental Laws of Magic&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;[To] tamper with the deepest mysteries \u2014 the source of life, the essence of self \u2014 only if prepared for consequences of the most extreme and dangerous kind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to the textbook &lt;em&gt;Magick Moste Evile&lt;/em&gt; within the books:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction \u2014&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to the HP Wiki:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To create a Horcrux is to divide one&amp;#39;s soul \u2014 the &amp;quot;essence of self&amp;quot; \u2014 and it is therefore in the creation of a Horcrux that one falls prey to Adalbert Waffling&amp;#39;s first Fundamental Laws of Magic, which essentially states that tampering with one&amp;#39;s soul inevitably results in grave side effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[...] The nature and concepts of Horcruxes were so terrible, they were kept secret from most of the wizarding world, and very few people were ever made aware of their nature. Hogwarts banned any study of the subject of Horcruxes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This seems very similar to how human transmutation is seen, and treated, in &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these experiments have given birth to a dark and sinister side of alchemy. Whether out of despair, malice or inquisitive hubris, several alchemists have been known to attempt the application of transmutation to human bodies and souls, in essence, playing god with human lives. But, just as the Law of Equivalent Exchange applies to the transmutation of non-living matter, devastating rebounds can occur in Human Transmutation because human lives and souls are priceless according to the flow of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[...] Using various experimental theories and methods, multiple alchemists in the manga and anime have endeavored to resurrect dead loved ones, but such pursuits are always failures, forbidden by the flow of the universe and alchemy itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the manga, it is determined that resurrective Human Transmutation is impossible because a soul that has left the mortal coil has passed on into the afterlife and can never be called back by human means. The attempt will cause a rebound due to both the inherent lack of any particular substance able to match a human soul in value and the fact that the initiated transmutation is reaching for an unattainable goal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of the known attempted Human Transmutations, &lt;strong&gt;the rebound has been the &amp;quot;taking&amp;quot; of parts of the initiator&amp;#39;s body out of the living world and into the void of the flow&lt;/strong&gt; (in the case of the Elric brothers&amp;#39; attempted transmutation of their mother, Edward&amp;#39;s left leg and Alphonse&amp;#39;s entire body were taken and in the case of Izumi Curtis&amp;#39; attempt to revive her dead child, several of her internal organs were taken). It should be noted that the size of the body parts taken are generally equal to the size of the human being transmuted, in accordance with the law of Equivalent Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, particularly interesting, especially given Voldemort&amp;#39;s desire to possess the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone in &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter in the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the 2003 [&lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;] anime, the results of resurrective Human Transmutation are different. The anime declares that it is possible to bring dead humans back into the living world, but upon being revived, they generally become inhuman Homunculi with the physical appearance and memories of the humans they used to be. Using the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone or a human life as the material to recall the soul, it is possible to bring back a human as a complete human.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The above explanation would also work to explain why Voldemort wanted the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone to begin with, in order to bring himself back (from his shadow-form after his original body was destroyed) as a &amp;quot;complete human&amp;quot;. He wanted the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone in order to give himself a new, &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; human body, rather than having to &amp;quot;possess&amp;quot; other creatures and hosts, Quirrell included.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, pertaining to the Horcruxes as well; why Lily&amp;#39;s protection remains &amp;quot;bound to Harry&amp;#39;s blood&amp;quot;; and why Voldemort wants Harry&amp;#39;s blood specifically in his resurrection:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another terrible form of Human Transmutation is the manipulation of human souls. Though appearing on no official records, there have been experiments with Human Transmutation involving the extraction of souls from human bodies and the alchemical binding of said souls to inanimate objects...[usually by way of a rune drawn in blood on the object itself].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[...] In essence, these souls exist in the mortal plane without their bodies, are able to manipulate the objects to which they are bound and communicate verbally with beings around them but, of course, there are caveats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[...] Though not all the specifics of soul binding have been made clear, it has been explained that the iron in the blood bonds alchemically with the iron in the object (as most instances of soul binding has used metal armor as a vessel) and the blood itself remains bound to the soul of the person from which it was taken.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While, at first glance, this explanation does not seem to explain all of Voldemort&amp;#39;s Horcruxes, there is the possibility that it does. For example, it&amp;#39;s quite likely that Voldemort / Tom Riddle used his own blood to bind his Horcruxes to him, in order to &amp;quot;tether&amp;quot; his physical body (most of which is made up of blood) to the mortal plane of existence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means that Riddle could&amp;#39;ve easily used his blood in creating the Diary Horcrux, which which is shown to absorb liquids such as ink; the Ring, Cup, Locket, and Diadem, all of which are made out of metal, likely with some form of iron for a successful &amp;quot;blood binding&amp;quot;; and, of course, Harry and Nagini, both of which contain blood themselves, and thus, the iron required for a &amp;quot;blood / soul binding&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For additional resources on potential materials for the ritual, especially as related to traditional alchemy, you can read more &lt;a href=\"https://rurushu.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/alchemy-indepth-the-human-transmutation-circle/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, as cited from &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ripley_(alchemist\"&gt;Sir George Ripley&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Recapitulation: Being A Paraphrastical Epitome of the Twelve Gates&lt;/em&gt; (sp?).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;George Ripley was one of England&amp;#39;s most famous alchemists. His alchemical writings attracted attention not only when they were published in the 15th century (1400&amp;#39;s), but also later in the 16th and 17th centuries (1500&amp;#39;s-1600&amp;#39;s). His writings were studied by noted figures such as the alchemist John Dee, Robert Boyle (who is considered to be the first modern chemist), and even Isaac Newton.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A great deal of myth has grown up around Ripley, such as that he studied in Italy for twenty years and became a favorite of Pope Innocent VIII. He did, however, spend a number of years on the continent, and after his return to England he wrote his work &lt;em&gt;The Compound of Alchymy; or, the Twelve Gates leading to the Discovery of the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone (Liber Duodecim Portarum)&lt;/em&gt; in 1471. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cantilena Riplaei&lt;/em&gt; is one of the very first poetic composition on the subject of alchemy. Most of Ripley&amp;#39;s work is based on the work of pseudo-Ramon Lull, although &lt;em&gt;The Compound of Alchemy&lt;/em&gt; is based largely on the work of a little-known alchemist of the 15th century, named Guido de Montanor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within the canon of &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, is it quite possible - even likely - that Sir George Ripley was, in fact, an alias of none other than Nicholas Flamel (1330 \u2013 1418), after Flamel created the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is because not only do Ripley&amp;#39;s work almost exclusively feature on the process of creating the Stone itself, but Flamel was noted by Rowling as &amp;quot;going undercover / in-disguise&amp;quot; throughout the subsequent centuries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are mentions of sightings of [Flamel] through the centuries because he was supposed to have gained immortality. There are still streets named after Flamel and his wife, Perenelle, in Paris.&amp;quot; - J.K. Rowling&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would also explain why Flamel, despite being a French wizard who previously lived in Paris, &amp;quot;enjoyed his later years living a quiet life in Devon&amp;quot;. After Flamel&amp;#39;s apparent &amp;quot;death&amp;quot;, he moved to England under the guise of &amp;quot;Sir George Ripley&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Ripley&amp;#39;s generous nature also matches that of Flamel, according to Rowling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As reported by Thomas Fuller in his &lt;em&gt;Worthies of England&lt;/em&gt;, he describes &amp;quot;Ripley&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;a reputable English gentleman, who reported having seen a record in the island of Malta, which stated that Ripley gave the enormous sum of 100,000 pounds sterling annually to the Knights of that island and of Rhodes to support their war against the Turks&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the HP Wiki on Flamel:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In his youth, Nicolas attended Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in the Pyrenees Mountains of France, and it was at Beauxbatons that he met Perenelle, his future wife. It is said that he later funded both the castle and the grounds, and a fountain on the grounds was named after the couple.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, seeing as how the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone can turn &amp;quot;lead into gold&amp;quot;, and Flamel (&amp;quot;Ripley&amp;quot;) being extremely wealthy, both &amp;quot;having said to have created a Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone&amp;quot;, it stands to reason that the two are one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, as such, Ripley / Flamel&amp;#39;s alchemical work (which is more likely than not probably included in the process of creating a Horcrux, as first devised by Herpo the Foul) may hint to Tom Riddle / Lord Voldemort having known of, and even planned to rob, Flamel / the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone years prior to &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt; explanations in block quotes came from the Wiki for the show / manga. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason why I use the explanation from &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt; as likely having relevance to &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; is because both franchises based their alchemy in their series off of real-life alchemical works and research, namely off of Sir George Ripley, and, of course, Nicholas Flamel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Or, in a process similar having to sacrifice a physical body part in attempting human transmutation in the *Fullmetal Alchemist* franchise, the Horcrux's creator must physically \"sacrifice\" part of his/her body to create a Horcrux.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**tl;dnr:** What it says in the title. Horcruxes involve a form of alchemy mixed with the Dark Arts, involving permanent removal of part of the physical body as well as the soul, in order to create a \"vessel for the soul\". (One must sacrifice one separate part of the body for each Horcrux.) This results, naturally, in a disfigured appearance, loss of organs / limbs / etc., and other negative effects, which we see with Lord Voldemort. (Full explanation below.) \n\n-------------------------------\n\nAs such, I would posit, too, that the \"Horcrux ritual\" found in *Secrets of the Darkest Art*, also involves the branch of alchemy (also studied as a 6th-year-and up elective at Hogwarts), paired with the Dark Arts, as invented by the dark wizard Herpo the Foul.\n\nOnce, it is said that J.K. Rowling was asked by her editor how one can make a Horcrux. After hearing the explanation, the editor was physically sickened / \"looked like throwing up / nauseated / horrified\". I believe that JK detailing the process as \"ripping out one's eyes\", \"cutting off one's tongue\", etc...to complete the process of making a Horcrux would definitely cause that sort of response.\n\nLikewise, Rowling also stated, \"I couldn't possibly tell you [the full process or ritual of creating a Horcrux]...Some things are better left unsaid.\"\n\nLet me explain as to why I think the process involves such \"personal sacrifice\". They involve two examples involving Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes: one being the Diary, and the other being the Locket.\n\nNamely, the Diary is important, as it was Tom Riddle / Lord Voldemort's first Horcrux. According to Rowling, Riddle used the death of Moaning Myrtle in order to create it \u2014 namely, he created the \"supreme act\" of murder. However, while other theories allege that creating a Horcrux involves necrophilia, or dismemberment of the murdered victim, the \"untouched\" state of Riddle's victims, such as the Riddle family's bodies (and Myrtle's body) indicates this isn't the case.\n\n&gt; The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could.\n\n&gt; \"Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their dinner things!\"\n\n&gt; [...] Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddle' bodies came back and changed everything.\n\n&gt; The police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, **or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all**. In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), **the Riddles all appeared to be in perfect health** -- apart from the fact that they were all dead. The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that **each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face** -- but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death? (*Goblet of Fire*)\n\nHowever, I believe that, instead of doing something to defile his victim's bodies (which I believe that Riddle himself would find a \"disgusting concept\" in itself), Riddle disfigured / did harm to his *own* body in order to create his Horcrux(es), the Diary included. If the soul, in *Harry Potter*, is, indeed, tied to the body, then \"ripping out a piece of one's soul\" would also mean one would have to \"rip out of piece of one's body\".\n\nSo what, exactly, did Riddle sacrifice for the Diary? I believe that, for this, Riddle carved out some of his own memories \u2014 sacrificing part of \"himself\" (figuratively) for the Diary's existence. This could also mean that the *real* Voldemort / Riddle, after the act, had permanent semi-amnesia, and no longer remembered some of his childhood or teenage years at all, missing them entirely from his memories. (Sort of like the effects of a powerful Memory Charm / *Obliviate* on Gilderoy Lockhart.)\n\nAs for the Locket, when I was reading *Deathly Hallows*, something stood out to me: Riddle's \"dark and handsome\" eyes are mentioned as being contained \"behind the two glass panes\" of Slytherin's Locket, when the Locket is opened with Parseltongue. \n\n&gt; \"The golden doors of the locket swung wide with a little click. Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome as Tom Riddle's eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit-pupiled...\" (*Half-Blood Prince*)\n\nIt should be noted, interestingly, that it says that Riddle \"turned\" his eyes scarlet and slit-pupiled. What if he didn't just \"turn\" them \"scarlet\"? What if he *replaced* his original eyes with new, \"scarlet and slit-pupiled\" ones?\n\nLikewise, we don't know exactly when Voldemort made the Locket. However, if he sacrificed his own eyes to create it, he must have done so around the time of his meeting with Dumbledore to apply for the DADA position:\n\n&gt; \"Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snake-like, **the eyes were not yet scarlet**, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle.\"\n\nYet, however, it should be noted that, through the creation of some of his Horcruxes, that Voldemort's physical body *does* appear much different, even grotesque:\n\n&gt; **It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become.** He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders...\" (*Half-Blood Prince*)\n\nHis \"white, waxy skin\"? Could've been Voldemort sacrificing his own, human skin for a Horcrux, which would've been...particularly nasty / bloody / horrifying to witness. His \"bloody\" eyes? Could be from Voldemort sacrificing his eyes / most of his eyes to create a different Horcrux. His \"high and cold\" voice? Again, another replacement, likely for sacrificing his original voice / voice box.\n\nWe also know that Voldemort can, and has, created replacement body parts - and even sacrificed body parts - in Dark rituals related to Horcruxes before. Namely, \"bone of the father, flesh of the servant, and blood of the enemy\" to create a new, resurrected physical form for himself, with the help of Peter Pettigrew, towards the end of *Goblet of Fire*.\n\n&gt; And now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long, thin, shining silver dagger from inside his cloak. His voice broke into petrified sobs.\n\n&gt; \"Flesh - of the servant - w-willingly given - you will - revive - your master.\"\n\n&gt; He stretched his right hand out in front of him - the hand with the missing finger. He gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward.\n\n&gt; Harry realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it happened - he closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream that pierced the night, that went through Harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too. \n\n&gt; He heard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail's anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into the cauldron.\n\n&gt; Harry couldn't stand to look...but the potion had turned a burning red; the light of it shone through Harry's closed eyelids...\n\n&gt; [...] Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them... (*Goblet of Fire*)\n\nNamely, and, even to Harry's own horror, Voldemort has Pettigrew *willingly slice off his own hand* for his \"rebirthing potion\". However, upon Voldemort's resurrection in his new body, he is \"merciful\", and, with a mere wave of his wand, gives Pettigrew a new, magical, \"glove-like\", shining and silver artificial hand to replace the one he cut off for the ritual. \n\n&gt; [Voldemort] looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.\n\n&gt; \"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you?\"\n\n&gt; \"Yes, Master,\" moaned Wormtail, \"please. Master...please...\"\n\n&gt; \"Yet you helped return me to my body,\" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \"Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me...and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers...\"\n\n&gt; Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtail's bleeding wrist.\n\n&gt; Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder. (*Goblet of Fire*)\n\nAs we found out later, Voldemort even used what must've been a spell of his own creation, because later on, the hand could also immediately sense when Pettigrew had a moment of hesitation / doubt in his loyalty to the Dark Lord in *Deathly Hallows*...and it proceeded to immediately strangle Pettigrew, presumably suffocating him until he died.\n\nIt stands to reason that, if Voldemort could create a new hand for Pettigrew out of magic with just a wave of his wand, and quite \"lazily\", as if he were doing it from years or decades of experiece, he likely not only had practice doing so, becoming a master at replacing such lost limbs...but that he had used *himself* as a test subject / guinea pig, for when he made his Horcruxes. \n\nLikewise, it's interesting that Voldemort seems to see no issue with letting Pettigrew basically bleed out from his severed arm for as long as he pleases. This may point to Voldemort being well-aware that Pettigrew's wound isn't fatal; or, if it is, then he waits a little while, letting Pettigrew suffer in pain and from blood loss, until he decides to ultimately replace the limb. This could point to Voldemort himself, at points in his past, subjecting himself to such terrible pain / blood loss, as possibly related to his \"changed\" appearance and his Horcruxes.\n\nI also believe that the concept of creating a Horcrux, through using a mix of alchemy (namely, human / soul transmutation) and dark magic, shares much in-common with how the topic of human transmutation itself is treated in *Fullmetal Alchemist*.\n\nNamely, in the *Harry Potter* books, according to Adalbert Waffling's *Fundamental Laws of Magic*:\n\n&gt; \"[To] tamper with the deepest mysteries \u2014 the source of life, the essence of self \u2014 only if prepared for consequences of the most extreme and dangerous kind.\"\n\nAccording to the textbook *Magick Moste Evile* within the books:\n\n&gt; \"Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction \u2014\"\n\nAccording to the HP Wiki:\n\n&gt; To create a Horcrux is to divide one's soul \u2014 the \"essence of self\" \u2014 and it is therefore in the creation of a Horcrux that one falls prey to Adalbert Waffling's first Fundamental Laws of Magic, which essentially states that tampering with one's soul inevitably results in grave side effects.\n\n&gt; [...] The nature and concepts of Horcruxes were so terrible, they were kept secret from most of the wizarding world, and very few people were ever made aware of their nature. Hogwarts banned any study of the subject of Horcruxes.\n\nThis seems very similar to how human transmutation is seen, and treated, in *Fullmetal Alchemist*.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, these experiments have given birth to a dark and sinister side of alchemy. Whether out of despair, malice or inquisitive hubris, several alchemists have been known to attempt the application of transmutation to human bodies and souls, in essence, playing god with human lives. But, just as the Law of Equivalent Exchange applies to the transmutation of non-living matter, devastating rebounds can occur in Human Transmutation because human lives and souls are priceless according to the flow of the world.\n\n&gt; [...] Using various experimental theories and methods, multiple alchemists in the manga and anime have endeavored to resurrect dead loved ones, but such pursuits are always failures, forbidden by the flow of the universe and alchemy itself.\n\n&gt; In the manga, it is determined that resurrective Human Transmutation is impossible because a soul that has left the mortal coil has passed on into the afterlife and can never be called back by human means. The attempt will cause a rebound due to both the inherent lack of any particular substance able to match a human soul in value and the fact that the initiated transmutation is reaching for an unattainable goal. \n\n&gt; Of the known attempted Human Transmutations, **the rebound has been the \"taking\" of parts of the initiator's body out of the living world and into the void of the flow** (in the case of the Elric brothers' attempted transmutation of their mother, Edward's left leg and Alphonse's entire body were taken and in the case of Izumi Curtis' attempt to revive her dead child, several of her internal organs were taken). It should be noted that the size of the body parts taken are generally equal to the size of the human being transmuted, in accordance with the law of Equivalent Exchange.\n\nAnd, particularly interesting, especially given Voldemort's desire to possess the Philosopher's Stone in *Harry Potter in the Philosopher's Stone*:\n\n&gt; In the 2003 [*Fullmetal Alchemist*] anime, the results of resurrective Human Transmutation are different. The anime declares that it is possible to bring dead humans back into the living world, but upon being revived, they generally become inhuman Homunculi with the physical appearance and memories of the humans they used to be. Using the Philosopher's Stone or a human life as the material to recall the soul, it is possible to bring back a human as a complete human.\n\nThe above explanation would also work to explain why Voldemort wanted the Philosopher's Stone to begin with, in order to bring himself back (from his shadow-form after his original body was destroyed) as a \"complete human\". He wanted the Philosopher's Stone in order to give himself a new, \"complete\" human body, rather than having to \"possess\" other creatures and hosts, Quirrell included.\n\nAnd, pertaining to the Horcruxes as well; why Lily's protection remains \"bound to Harry's blood\"; and why Voldemort wants Harry's blood specifically in his resurrection:\n\n&gt; Another terrible form of Human Transmutation is the manipulation of human souls. Though appearing on no official records, there have been experiments with Human Transmutation involving the extraction of souls from human bodies and the alchemical binding of said souls to inanimate objects...[usually by way of a rune drawn in blood on the object itself].\n\n&gt; [...] In essence, these souls exist in the mortal plane without their bodies, are able to manipulate the objects to which they are bound and communicate verbally with beings around them but, of course, there are caveats.\n\n&gt; [...] Though not all the specifics of soul binding have been made clear, it has been explained that the iron in the blood bonds alchemically with the iron in the object (as most instances of soul binding has used metal armor as a vessel) and the blood itself remains bound to the soul of the person from which it was taken.\n\nWhile, at first glance, this explanation does not seem to explain all of Voldemort's Horcruxes, there is the possibility that it does. For example, it's quite likely that Voldemort / Tom Riddle used his own blood to bind his Horcruxes to him, in order to \"tether\" his physical body (most of which is made up of blood) to the mortal plane of existence. \n\nThis means that Riddle could've easily used his blood in creating the Diary Horcrux, which which is shown to absorb liquids such as ink; the Ring, Cup, Locket, and Diadem, all of which are made out of metal, likely with some form of iron for a successful \"blood binding\"; and, of course, Harry and Nagini, both of which contain blood themselves, and thus, the iron required for a \"blood / soul binding\". \n\n---------------------\n\nFor additional resources on potential materials for the ritual, especially as related to traditional alchemy, you can read more [here](https://rurushu.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/alchemy-indepth-the-human-transmutation-circle/), as cited from [Sir George Ripley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ripley_(alchemist)'s *Recapitulation: Being A Paraphrastical Epitome of the Twelve Gates* (sp?).\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n&gt; George Ripley was one of England's most famous alchemists. His alchemical writings attracted attention not only when they were published in the 15th century (1400's), but also later in the 16th and 17th centuries (1500's-1600's). His writings were studied by noted figures such as the alchemist John Dee, Robert Boyle (who is considered to be the first modern chemist), and even Isaac Newton.\n\n&gt; A great deal of myth has grown up around Ripley, such as that he studied in Italy for twenty years and became a favorite of Pope Innocent VIII. He did, however, spend a number of years on the continent, and after his return to England he wrote his work *The Compound of Alchymy; or, the Twelve Gates leading to the Discovery of the Philosopher's Stone (Liber Duodecim Portarum)* in 1471. \n\n&gt; *The Cantilena Riplaei* is one of the very first poetic composition on the subject of alchemy. Most of Ripley's work is based on the work of pseudo-Ramon Lull, although *The Compound of Alchemy* is based largely on the work of a little-known alchemist of the 15th century, named Guido de Montanor.\n\nWithin the canon of *Harry Potter*, is it quite possible - even likely - that Sir George Ripley was, in fact, an alias of none other than Nicholas Flamel (1330 \u2013 1418), after Flamel created the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nThis is because not only do Ripley's work almost exclusively feature on the process of creating the Stone itself, but Flamel was noted by Rowling as \"going undercover / in-disguise\" throughout the subsequent centuries.\n\n&gt; \"There are mentions of sightings of [Flamel] through the centuries because he was supposed to have gained immortality. There are still streets named after Flamel and his wife, Perenelle, in Paris.\" - J.K. Rowling\n\nThis would also explain why Flamel, despite being a French wizard who previously lived in Paris, \"enjoyed his later years living a quiet life in Devon\". After Flamel's apparent \"death\", he moved to England under the guise of \"Sir George Ripley\".\n\nLikewise, Ripley's generous nature also matches that of Flamel, according to Rowling.\n\nAs reported by Thomas Fuller in his *Worthies of England*, he describes \"Ripley\" as \"a reputable English gentleman, who reported having seen a record in the island of Malta, which stated that Ripley gave the enormous sum of 100,000 pounds sterling annually to the Knights of that island and of Rhodes to support their war against the Turks\".\n\nFrom the HP Wiki on Flamel:\n\n&gt; In his youth, Nicolas attended Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in the Pyrenees Mountains of France, and it was at Beauxbatons that he met Perenelle, his future wife. It is said that he later funded both the castle and the grounds, and a fountain on the grounds was named after the couple.\n\nOf course, seeing as how the Philosopher's Stone can turn \"lead into gold\", and Flamel (\"Ripley\") being extremely wealthy, both \"having said to have created a Philosopher's Stone\", it stands to reason that the two are one and the same.\n\nAnd, as such, Ripley / Flamel's alchemical work (which is more likely than not probably included in the process of creating a Horcrux, as first devised by Herpo the Foul) may hint to Tom Riddle / Lord Voldemort having known of, and even planned to rob, Flamel / the Philosopher's Stone years prior to *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*.\n\n------------\n\nThe *Fullmetal Alchemist* explanations in block quotes came from the Wiki for the show / manga. \n\nThe reason why I use the explanation from *Fullmetal Alchemist* as likely having relevance to *Harry Potter* is because both franchises based their alchemy in their series off of real-life alchemical works and research, namely off of Sir George Ripley, and, of course, Nicholas Flamel.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [],

It is a very important feature of Voldemort&amp;#39;s that is usually mentioned whenever he makes a physical appearance in the books, and the &amp;quot;nose&amp;quot; bit was lacking in that particular scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, in the case of the &amp;quot;nightmares&amp;quot; quote from &lt;em&gt;Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone&lt;/em&gt;, we have to recall that Harry also shared a telepathic link to Voldemort, created when the &amp;quot;Horcrux&amp;quot; in Harry was placed. The &amp;quot;Horcrux&amp;quot; was placed when Voldemort lost his original body from attempting to kill Harry. The mental link was formed at that point, after the original body had been obliterated, including Voldy&amp;#39;s nose. The &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; in Voldemort (the mangled, incomplete soul) was released from its mortal coil, taking on the &amp;quot;noseless&amp;quot; (skeletal?) appearance we first see in &lt;em&gt;Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is mainly why I think that Voldemort lost his nose when he lost his body. Harry was &amp;quot;plagued&amp;quot; with nightmares of a noseless Voldemort due to his mental link to the &amp;quot;Horcrux&amp;quot; in him, formed at that point in time. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "FanTheories", "name": "t1_dgctkwi", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492417474.0, "created_utc": 1492388674.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbi8wu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "-Mountain-King-", "parent_id": "t1_dgbbphy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FanTheories", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why do you think that the most likely point for him to have lost it was with Harry?
