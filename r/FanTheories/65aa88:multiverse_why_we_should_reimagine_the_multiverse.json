It was thought up by some guy (I can&amp;#39;t spell his name) to explain the effect of different choices we make. He reasoned that if you put a cat in a box with a broken tube of mercury, and the cat had a 50% chance of living and dying, and the inside of the box was unobservable until you open it, the cat is now in the state of being dead and alive at the same time. Once you open the box and the cat is alive, you created two pathways. The pathway you are living on now is the path &amp;quot;the cat survived.&amp;quot; The second pathway is &amp;quot;the cat is dead (and you are probably going to jail for animal cruelty charges.)&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To recap, when you ecounter a set of choices and pick one of the choices, you create two alternate universes. The model scientists use is a circle leading to two different circles, and each circle leads to a bunch more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has been the model scientists have been using for a long time, but it is very impractical. This model of showing the alternate universes only works if you are showing a small amount of splits in the universes. If you were to try and graph a whole time period of choices, that would be INSANELY difficult. You would have to model each individual choice AND their outcomes AND the outcomes of that outcome with an INSANE AMOUNT OF DETAIL. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets make a mock model. I have 4 shirts I COULD wear but I can only wear one shirt. I would not only have to model the outcome of the shirt I wore, I would also have to PREDICT the outcome of a different shirt I wore. That would be WAY too difficult because, as we all know, theoretical probablity is different than what actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, after pondering of a way we could simplify the model I thought of something we all love: colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine a blank sheet of paper. Now, imagine you were to take a highlighter and make a horizontal line in the middle. This yellow line is going to signify you putting a cat in a box with mercury and that cat surviving. Now, imagine taking a red highlighter and going over the yellow highlighter starting from half of the line to the end. You should have a portion of yellow line and the rest orange (because yellow and red make orange). Using that line, we show that their is not a lot of deviance from the two universes, but enough to show that there is now a difference. Killing one cat won&amp;#39;t make a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, using our new model that I will dub &amp;quot;The Color Model&amp;quot;, let&amp;#39;s take an important event in history: the holocaust. Let&amp;#39;s draw another yellow line on a different piece of paper. Ths Holocaust killed MILLIONS of Jewish people and ended many family lines. We will dub this event a &amp;quot;Univese splitter.&amp;quot; Instead of drawing a red line over a portion of the yellow line, now we draw the red line under the yellow line, but slightly touching. It would look like a yellow line on top, an orange line in the middle, and red line on the bottom. This would show that the new event completely changed the course of history, but still some parts overlapped. Regardless of the holocaust, WW2 would have still taken millions of lives and the devolopment of the nuclear bomb would have still happened. This &amp;quot;Color Model&amp;quot; would allow us to see the creation of a new universe, the universes before it, and when something that was a completely polarizing event happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The beauty of it all is that all you have to do is count the amount of colors that you see, and POOF! You have the amount of universes and they are all in chronological order! Cool right? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A downside is that this &amp;quot;Color Model&amp;quot; will not have the amount of detail that other models have. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another downside is that this model changes how we see multiverses. The old model suggests that every multiverse is different (which is true), while the color model skips over the details and just generalizes the universes into &amp;quot;really different &amp;quot; or &amp;quot;pretty similar.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To recap, we have our yellow + red = orange, and 1/2 yellow + 1/2 red = 1/3 red, yellow, and orange.
