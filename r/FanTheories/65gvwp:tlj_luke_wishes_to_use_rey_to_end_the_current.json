As for the sith, the rule of two is in place to help uphold the \n     history and such of the sith. \n     However, palpatine has generally not adhered to this as he almost \n     constantly tries to assassinate Vader. He does so by training secret \n     apprentices. However, these apprentices seem to be made solely for \n     combat and do not seem to gain any academic knowledge. So, most sith \n     knowledge will most likely have ended with palpatine.\n2) Force ghosts:\n     Now at first this posed a big hole in the theory; Exar Kun, Freedon Nadd, \n     Yoda, Obi-Wan. All of these people have existed past their physical forms \n     to transcend to pure force beings. Unfortunately, with Disney&amp;#39;s acquisition \n     of Star Wars and the subsequent non-canonizing of all extended media, \n     most, if not all, sith presences presumably stay dead. Though admittedly \n     this is more a technicality, it still holds. \n     As for Jedi ghosts, ep 7 seems to imply the Jedi have not appeared to \n     guide Luke, fin or rey at all to help them. While this isn&amp;#39;t definitive proof, it \n     at least shows they are taking a step back.\nNow, this last part is more a side idea i had i felt will probably not happen, but think it sounds nice. The movie sees rey acting as a jedi, but as a force of death, as in ending the jedi and sith. And Kylo being a sith trying to save or create, as in trying to at least keep the sith order alive. This idea is somewhat silly admittedly but i thought id put my thoughts on paper, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Now, Ive already seen several theories on here related to this idea, but id like to add some detail im not sure im seeing with the others.
