There are many theories circling around the internet on a vast ammount of forums. But a very big one since the 2011 movie came out is that there are an infinite ammount of multiverses or paralel universes in the Tintin world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the comics the first two episodes are the crab with the golden claw part 1 and 2 which is an intro story. It is also an introduction between Haddock and Tintin. I know there were comic books made before this but we will exclude them, for now atleast. Then the next two are the secret of the unicorn part 1 and 2, where Haddock and Tintins bond grows more as they set of after the treasure of Red Rackam that sunk with the Unicorn, a massive ship ownde by Haddocks great ancestor Sir Francis Haddock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the 2011 movie we see these two (four) parts combined to create a great movie (seriously, watch it). The movie revolves around the Unicorn and the treasure. But the introduction between the characters are very similar to the crab with a golden claw. They meet each other on board the karaboujan (Haddocks ship that has been stolen). They then proceed to escape in a life boat steal a plane and get lost in a desert where Haddock experiences mirrages. After that the movie steers almost completly into what the comic the secret of the unicorn. But there are some big differences. In the movie it is Mr.Sakarine who is the one that is also after the treasure, while in the comic he is just a random ship collector, or so we think. In the movie the treasure belonged to Sir Francis Haddock while in the comics it belonged to Red Rackam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the comics and the movie are all in the same world but in other paralel universes as I have proven (I hope I have). Now this brings me to another part of my theory. In the movies it is revealed that Mr.Sakarine is an ancestor of Red Rackam and wants to avenge him by killing Captain Haddock, who is the ancestor of Sir Francis Haddock, who killed Red Rackam. BUT! in the series Sakarine is never revealed to be his ancestor.\nI know I said there were paralel universes and that must mean that Mr.Sakarine is not the ancestor of Red Rackam in that universe. But if you were to go back that long and change the bloodline, Sakarine would not exist, pretty much all of the events of that comic would never hapened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the movie universe Sakarine got to Haddock first and was ready to kill him before Tintin was even mixed in. Therefore he revealed that he is an ancestor. But in the comics he does not because Tintin gets to Haddock first, and Sakarine being a smart man knew not to start fucking with Tintin and his friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So untill this day Sakarine is still waiting for the perfect moment to kill Haddock!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for bad english and shitty structure. I had this epic theory but I kant write so well so it turned out quite bad here. If someone would pick this up, polish it and add to it, I would love that!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Ever since a young age I have loved and been facinated by the Tintin franchise!
