When Marty explains everything to him, the Doc wants him to remain at his house and not do, or interfere, with anything to preserve the timeline, and prevent anything from changing.

This would include making sure that the Libyans found him, which would eventually result in Marty travelling back to 1955 in the DeLorean, and meeting his past self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, in other words, the Doc was trying to stabilize (or form a more stable) timeline / time loop, even in spite of Marty&amp;#39;s changes to the timeline. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I searched on /r/fantheories to see if this had been posted, and didn't see it on the first page of results, so I decided to create a thread for discussion.\n\nIn *Back to the Future*, when Doc Brown steals the plutonium needed for his time machine, only to be pursued by Libyan nationalists, he says: \"Oh my god. **They found me; I don't know how but they found me.** RUN FOR IT, MARTY!!\"\n\nMy theory is simple, but short: The Libyans knew when, and where, to find Doc Brown, because his past self had told them so.
