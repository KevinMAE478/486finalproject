But I guess in my haste, I failed to confirm my return flight when I did my original bookings so I ripped open my computer and got on Kayak and saw that the only flights back to CVG for the next 3 days were now 479 at cheapest and it was with United, not Frontier.  So I maxed out a credit card and hauled ass for the airport.  We had a minor delay in pushing back and then we sat for close to 30 minutes taxiing for takeoff but the flight otherwise was fine and I have no real complaints.   I&amp;#39;m just glad I got home, albeit ~$400 leaner than I&amp;#39;d hoped.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "reactiongifs", "name": "t1_dg915vw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492198842.0, "created_utc": 1492170042.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5y3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6u5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6irwb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "renasissanceman6", "parent_id": "t3_64y6u5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/reactiongifs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hipster boycotter over here!", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hipster boycotter over here!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "reactiongifs", "name": "t1_dg6irwb", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492058369.0, "created_utc": 1492029569.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5y3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6u5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5y3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6u5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5y3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6u5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5y3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6u5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5y3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6u5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5y3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6u5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5y3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6u5", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5y3", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6u5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6ya7u", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThatSmegmaGuy", "parent_id": "t1_dg6xzit", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/reactiongifs", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Daaang thats fuckin dope.
