I went to a private school about an hour south of Nashville and we had a great program (but our competition was almost exclusive public schools). I started shooting competitively  in the 6th grade. I think we are up to 8 or 9 squads of five between the different divisions (I graduated three years ago, so I&amp;#39;m not sure exactly how big the program had gotten). It was cool to go to a school of 700 people (k-12) and have three national championships and 9 or 10 state championship in a sport. I can honestly say, in hundreds of competitions I&amp;#39;ve been to, I&amp;#39;ve never seen someone hurt by weapon misuse. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "funny", "name": "t1_dgaz65t", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492309450.0, "created_utc": 1492280650.0, "depth": 8, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh33", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65itm7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh33", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65itm7", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgaxe2g", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 10, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jhundo", "parent_id": "t1_dgav3pq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/funny", "controversiality": 0, "body": "My high school has a indoor gun range.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My high school has a indoor gun range.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "funny", "name": "t1_dgaxe2g", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492307031.0, "created_utc": 1492278231.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh33", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65itm7", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgb2nyo", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FriendlyDespot", "parent_id": "t1_dgav3pq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/funny", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But what if Sergeant Woods was the first to be shot?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if Sergeant Woods was the first to be shot?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "funny", "name": "t1_dgb2nyo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492314151.0, "created_utc": 1492285351.0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgav3pq", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 18, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Indalecia", "parent_id": "t1_dgauboi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/funny", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Down here in South Louisiana, I took a hunters ed course in 8th grade.
