Tells you about speed cameras and other stuff uploaded by other users onto the map.\n\n2. More aggressive routing - the app is willing to take you on to side roads to save some time.\n\n3. Speed cameras are eveywhere in the UK, Waze app measures your speed and warns you if you're going over the limit.\n\nPros of google maps:\n\n1. MUCH better map layout. Waze has too much stuff on the map which can make it little hard to read.\n\n2. Less aggressive routing - sometimes you don't want to be taken to side roads to save time. From my experience, Waze only saves 5 or so minutes per an hour.\n\n3. More options. Waze has limited functionality,\n\n4. The map includes some useful information such as petrol stations.\n\n5. Lane designation - it tells you which lanes you're supposed to be on.
