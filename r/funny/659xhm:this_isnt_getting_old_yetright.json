They could raise their prices but then they'll lose customers to competing airlines with lower prices. So the only solution to guarantee profit is to overbook flights and count on people missing it.

You start as a billionaire.\n\nWhy is air traffic control a mess? This comes down to two issues: backwards compatibility and sheer traffic numbers. First, we have a lot of old planes or planes lacking features. As for the Boeing and Airbus planes, they are expensive and you want to make it last as long as you can before purchasing another. They do get phased out when they reach a specific number of cycles, so no safety issue there. As for the lack of features, not every plane has ILS, GPS, or other things. We have a lot of small planes like Cessnas or ultralights that don't have digital communication or other luxuries. So ATC has to maintain compatibility with 50 year old custom-built single seaters to Boeing 787s. It's like Microsoft trying to kill off Internet Explorer 6; there are too many major players still using it.\n\nTake a look at the air traffic over the US during the day. We have a lot of flights on major routes. Planes have to be spaced out by several kilometers. While they could get closer, the possibility of getting stuck in the turbulence caused by the preceding flight increases. There was a case recently where a smaller plane got within a few kilometers behind an A380, thus getting caught in its vortices and losing control. With a constantly growing number of flights, we are pushing our routes to their limits. Some airports are often completely maxed out on arrivals and departures that can be handled due to spacing requirements. There are new GPS routing technologies coming out to fix this, but this causes conflicts with backwards compatibility and thus increases the chances of mid-air turbulence incidents.\n\nAirports here in the US tend to suffer from a few problems. First is that they require large amounts of land and thus to get it cheap enough, some are outside of the cities. Unfortunately the travel distance to an airport can stifle business if the city does not expand as expected. Especially as they are considered NIMBYs, people aren't likely to move near it. Other airports fix this issue by being in more populated areas. They get a lot more business but being surrounded prevents them from expansion. Even stupider is that as more people move in next to airports, they sue about the noise which can in some cases impart heavy restrictions on airports and airlines or even shut down airports. Look up the John Wayne airport (KSNA) for an example of where lawsuits have caused a ridiculous departure requirement.\n\nIt's kind of a mess, but that's what happens when consumers always seek the lowest price and thus keep margins slim.
