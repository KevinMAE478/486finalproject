Be specific when making comments. Not my fault you are being clear as mud.\n\nWatch the fucking video. They are pulling him out of the seat, and he seems stuck on something. When an officer reaches over, he releases the control on an arm rest, and he flings forward since they were still pulling on the doc. He flung forward into the armrest. Try watching the video before jumping to assinine conclusions. \n\nAnd again, he was trespassing. Legally, a plane is not boarded until *everyone* is seated and the door(s) is closed. The doors were not closed, therefore the plane was not boarded. Since the plane was not boarded, they were overbooked. Since they were overbooked, they had the right to kick him. Since they had the right to kick him, they did. Since he refused, they called the cops. Since the cops couldn't get him out, they force him out. When they forced him out, he flung into the armrest, seemingly by mistake.\n\nDon't bother responding unless you can come up with a logical argument based actual facts.
