At first I was going to use Tesla in another city, like I did with Watt. Then I decided screw it &amp; see for myself, save, and used him twice in the capital. There were certainly results. **The 12 tile range can be seen from Beijing's power plant output on the production breakdown; it's PP should provide +4 (from the building list), but it's getting +8.** I couldn't figure it out initially with Watts buff being there sometimes and some cities not getting buffed at all, then a pattern started showing up. \n\nI have not tested Paxton, but I would not be surprised if his buff operates the same as Tesla's when double-stacked; +4 amenities (bonus 2 for zoo &amp; 2 for stadium) for cities within 12 tiles of the district.

You can also have Watts&amp;#39; buff stacked to give every factory +4, however it does not increase the AoE; just the factory in the city it is built in. The only districts to receive both Tesla &amp;amp; Watts&amp;#39; buffs (stacked) are the two (or one if doublestacked) that Tesla pops in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See for yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; The pictures show several cities, their buildings &amp;amp; values, production breakdown as well as an R5 for each photo. At first I was going to use Tesla in another city, like I did with Watt. Then I decided screw it &amp;amp; see for myself, save, and used him twice in the capital. There were certainly results. &lt;strong&gt;The 12 tile range can be seen from Beijing&amp;#39;s power plant output on the production breakdown; it&amp;#39;s PP should provide +4 (from the building list), but it&amp;#39;s getting +8.&lt;/strong&gt; I couldn&amp;#39;t figure it out initially with Watts buff being there sometimes and some cities not getting buffed at all, then a pattern started showing up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have not tested Paxton, but I would not be surprised if his buff operates the same as Tesla&amp;#39;s when double-stacked; +4 amenities (bonus 2 for zoo &amp;amp; 2 for stadium) for cities within 12 tiles of the district.
