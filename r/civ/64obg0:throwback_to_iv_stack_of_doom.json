In V, despite all the possibilities for tactical maneuvering, at the end of the day, I've realized there's pretty much limited depth.

The procedure for battles is pretty much this:\n\n1. Is there something to shoot at? If so, shoot with your 5-10 ranged units.\n2. Is there a unit about to die? Retreat it.\n3. Slow advance.\n4. Repeat for profit.\n\nNot as complicated or as much an improvement as most people make it out to be.\n\nIn IV, on the other hand, units have counters. It's like TF2's rock-paper-scissors system. You have to create a stack of the correct composition and then use it properly, sometimes making hard choices about whether or not to sacrifice units (something which almost never comes up in V, tbh). And you have to take into account the composition of your enemy, promotions (which make a much bigger difference), your numbers vs their numbers, etc...\n\nFor example, let's say you want to take a hilltop city defended by archers. Blindly throwing axemen or swords won't work, because you need a 5:1 ratio of attackers to defenders, and that's an unacceptable loss ratio. So you build a couple of catapults to soften them up, and you sacrifice just the right amount so you don't lose too many but your axemen will win all their battles. But wait, they have chariots. So you have to build a couple spears to counter those. And throw in some archers as a local garrison force if you don't want your new cities to be instantly taken back.\n\nHold on, they're 10 turns from feudalism! You won't be able to challenge them for a LONG time once they get longbows! So do you split up your stack to win faster but risk losing your army in a failed attack, or do you conquer just 1-2 cities and let your opponent plot revenge once they're safe with most of their empire intact? Etc. etc...\n\nThe bottom line is, both V and IV are better than the opposing fanboys give a lot of credit for. I already see a lot of people downvoting me and others for even daring to like IV as a game, much less suggesting some (or many) aspects are superior to V.
