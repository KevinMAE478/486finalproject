So if you get two different types of artists, that&amp;#39;s already 6 cities you&amp;#39;re gonna need to maximize your culture/tourism. If you get 3 types, bump it up to 9 cities, etc. And then if you want artifacts you&amp;#39;ll need even more&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mvemba is really good for getting great people and stockpiling great works of art, since with themeing bonuses he gets +12 production and food and +24 gold, and he has a lot more space for early works, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; he gets double great person points&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gorgo worked pretty well because she gets the cheap theater districts and they have better adjacency bonuses if you can build them next to your city center, and the extra wild card slot is good for bonus artist points early on. Plus killing barbarians gets you culture that much faster, and I assume if you&amp;#39;re playing on Deity you&amp;#39;re probably gonna be defending yourself a fair bit so the culture from fighting helps out&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how Russia or Trajan would be good for culture victories&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "civ", "name": "t1_dge55b7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492492812.0, "created_utc": 1492464012.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdv4o6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "XQuizyx", "parent_id": "t1_dgdukna", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/civ", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've tried it with Pericles at some point with the same result.
