I\u2019ve had no desire to explain, but won\u2019t be around forever and must.\n\nDogs never die. They don\u2019t know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they don\u2019t die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say:\u201d No, no, not a good idea. Let\u2019s not go for a walk.\u201d Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that\u2019s what dogs are. They walk.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dog\u2019s mark, a rotting chicken bone ( exultation), and you. That\u2019s what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.\n\nHowever, dogs get very very sleepy. That\u2019s the thing, you see. They don\u2019t teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. It\u2019s a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot.\n\nWhen you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging it\u2019s tail madly, you see, and that\u2019s why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. \nOuch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. That\u2019s when they say: \u201cThanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.\u201d\nWhen they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and that\u2019s why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, it\u2019s a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and it\u2019s a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)\n\nAnyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and don\u2019t want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.\n\nBut don\u2019t get fooled. They are not \u201cdead.\u201d There\u2019s no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when you\u2019re not expecting it.
