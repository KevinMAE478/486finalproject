For me, the answer is no I really don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you could argue that in the case of the &amp;#39;gay cake&amp;#39; scenario, that you&amp;#39;re discriminating against the religious people by forcing them to bake a cake that contravenes their beliefs. I&amp;#39;m dead set against racial discrimination, but this one&amp;#39;s much more grey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It shouldn&amp;#39;t be illegal to be a cunt though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure I agree with this, but it&amp;#39;s a matter of drawing the line. Stealing is being a cunt, but I think we&amp;#39;d both agree that it should stay illegal. Calling someone a dick isn&amp;#39;t nice but should it be illegal? Well, no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now though the roles have switched. The law greatly oppresses the racist (can&amp;#39;t own a business), if we abolished the law it would only slightly oppress the black guy (go down the street and take your money somewhere it will be appreciated).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, but those discriminated against often can&amp;#39;t change what they are or feel, so it&amp;#39;s not really fair to oppress them. I don&amp;#39;t think the same can be said of racists or homophobes, I think that&amp;#39;s something that can change. I&amp;#39;m not sure that forcing them to cater to those they despise is exactly going to make them sympathetic though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;m not familiar with American law, but what&amp;#39;s stopping a racist/whatever owning a business? Or do you just mean stopping them from running it a certain way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the recent rising trend of extremists, I&amp;#39;m not sure repealing anti racist laws would be a good call anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth noting that I&amp;#39;m coming at this from a different place to you, I&amp;#39;m from England, we tend to be a lot less pro business over here, I would say.
