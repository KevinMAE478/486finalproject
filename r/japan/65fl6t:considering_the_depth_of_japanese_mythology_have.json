Of course you have to consider that so-called urban myths aren&amp;#39;t necessarily that separated from Shinto beliefs and I&amp;#39;d actually argue that many beliefs that are considered part of Shinto today likely originated from what we consider &amp;quot;urban myths&amp;quot; today. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you include themes in cultural work as well, which really aren&amp;#39;t strictly mythology but may be interesting to consider still, I think there&amp;#39;s much to be seen in Anime, Manga and &amp;quot;even&amp;quot; games (Metal Gear series for example). Especially regarding the pacifist undertones or the way nuclear weapons play a role in them. The former can be traced back to efforts to establish pacifism in Japan during the period of occupation etc., the latter&amp;#39;s origin being fairly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yeah, whether that can still be considered mythology is doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "japan", "name": "t1_dgajxx7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492284570.0, "created_utc": 1492255770.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fl6t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgap22e", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dondism", "parent_id": "t3_65fl6t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/japan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The origin of this one is Taiwan, but apparently there's a Japanese pilot deified there and a Japanese volunteer group has had a mikoshi made for him.\n\nhttp://www.nippon.com/en/column/g00389/?pnum=1", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The origin of this one is Taiwan, but apparently there&amp;#39;s a Japanese pilot deified there and a Japanese volunteer group has had a mikoshi made for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nippon.com/en/column/g00389/?pnum=1\"&gt;http://www.nippon.com/en/column/g00389/?pnum=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "japan", "name": "t1_dgap22e", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492295206.0, "created_utc": 1492266406.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fl6t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbwmux", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wolframite", "parent_id": "t3_65fl6t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/japan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is a good explanation on how a myth helped contribute to the fascist movement that helped lead Japan *to* WWII:\n\n* [**Bushido: Way of Total Bullshit**]\n(http://www.tofugu.com/2014/12/08/bushido-way-total-bullshit)", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a good explanation on how a myth helped contribute to the fascist movement that helped lead Japan &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; WWII:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.tofugu.com/2014/12/08/bushido-way-total-bullshit\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bushido: Way of Total Bullshit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "japan", "name": "t1_dgbwmux", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492366878.0, "created_utc": 1492338078.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fl6t", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65fl6t", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgah2sk", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "a_very_sunny_end", "parent_id": "t1_dgagic6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/japan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Watched the film as a teen, still cry.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watched the film as a teen, still cry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "japan", "name": "t1_dgah2sk", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492275573.0, "created_utc": 1492246773.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgagic6", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ariadnepyanfar", "parent_id": "t3_65fl6t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/japan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "And really, if you have any interest in Japan and WW2, then you owe it to yourself to see Grave of the Fireflies.
