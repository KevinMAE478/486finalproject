I'll give that on the whole, they **can** be pretty well mannered.  But it's not hard to miss the little shits acting like **right cunts**, almost everywhere. \n\n&gt;As always, one starts with the parents. Specifically, the Japanese style of parenting.\n\nBrilliant. A lot, I'd say **most** of the 'Japanese style of parenting' I've seen are the parents acting like **right cunts** themselves, scolding the kids like they're inferior little slaves, telling them to shut up, basically being all-around shitcunt parents, sometimes you can really feel the rage in their reactions to the kids. Ironic given that when it's someone else telling them about their precious little Taro-kun, they become monster parents and OH NO HE WOULDNT DARE DO SUCH A THING. Pro-tip: yes, he would.\n\n&gt;Just look at this widely used definition of discipline (shitsuke) from a Japanese folklore dictionary: \u201cPutting into the body of a child, the art of living and good manners, in order to create one grown-up person\u201d.\n\nWhat the fuck am I reading? Mothers and fathers **lose their fucking rag** at kids when they're angry. I'm not sure I'd classify the results as \"grown-up persons\" either.\n\n&gt;Keiko cited an example of how Japanese parents would remove their child\u2019s shoes if they stood on the seats in subway trains. This is done out of consideration for the next user, she said.\n\nPity that consideration doesn't extend to things like people refusing to give up priority seats, old men pretending to be asleep, cunts elbowing their way to get a seat, avoiding sitting next to foreigners, or you know, rampant molestation.\n\n&gt;Says Keiko: \u201cTeachings, both in school and at home, are consistent, and are constantly instilled in the child.\u201d\n\nBang on, Diana.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe Japanese do not like people talking on the phone in the subway. It is impolite to others.\u201d\n\nOh my fucking lord, if there's a word/phrase I hate more than 'yappari', it's anything that begins with 'We Japanese'. Impolite to others?! Sure. But you can go fuck yourself with this tired old bullshit when there's a plethora of other shit you're not supposed to do, but happens anyway. Priority seats? Bit impolite to ignore the old lady who wants to sit down, no? Bit impolite for the police to accost foreigners because 'they look suspicious', no? Bit impolite for old men to glare at me then spit at my feet as they walk past muttering 'gaijin...', no? Impolite to others, what a farce.\n\n&gt;She found what she was looking for \u2014 a piece of fried chicken in her shoe.

I&amp;#39;ll give that on the whole, they &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; be pretty well mannered.  But it&amp;#39;s not hard to miss the little shits acting like &lt;strong&gt;right cunts&lt;/strong&gt;, almost everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As always, one starts with the parents. Specifically, the Japanese style of parenting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brilliant. A lot, I&amp;#39;d say &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; of the &amp;#39;Japanese style of parenting&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;ve seen are the parents acting like &lt;strong&gt;right cunts&lt;/strong&gt; themselves, scolding the kids like they&amp;#39;re inferior little slaves, telling them to shut up, basically being all-around shitcunt parents, sometimes you can really feel the rage in their reactions to the kids. Ironic given that when it&amp;#39;s someone else telling them about their precious little Taro-kun, they become monster parents and OH NO HE WOULDNT DARE DO SUCH A THING. Pro-tip: yes, he would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just look at this widely used definition of discipline (shitsuke) from a Japanese folklore dictionary: \u201cPutting into the body of a child, the art of living and good manners, in order to create one grown-up person\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the fuck am I reading? Mothers and fathers &lt;strong&gt;lose their fucking rag&lt;/strong&gt; at kids when they&amp;#39;re angry. I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;d classify the results as &amp;quot;grown-up persons&amp;quot; either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Keiko cited an example of how Japanese parents would remove their child\u2019s shoes if they stood on the seats in subway trains. This is done out of consideration for the next user, she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pity that consideration doesn&amp;#39;t extend to things like people refusing to give up priority seats, old men pretending to be asleep, cunts elbowing their way to get a seat, avoiding sitting next to foreigners, or you know, rampant molestation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Says Keiko: \u201cTeachings, both in school and at home, are consistent, and are constantly instilled in the child.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bang on, Diana.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe Japanese do not like people talking on the phone in the subway. It is impolite to others.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh my fucking lord, if there&amp;#39;s a word/phrase I hate more than &amp;#39;yappari&amp;#39;, it&amp;#39;s anything that begins with &amp;#39;We Japanese&amp;#39;. Impolite to others?! Sure. But you can go fuck yourself with this tired old bullshit when there&amp;#39;s a plethora of other shit you&amp;#39;re not supposed to do, but happens anyway. Priority seats? Bit impolite to ignore the old lady who wants to sit down, no? Bit impolite for the police to accost foreigners because &amp;#39;they look suspicious&amp;#39;, no? Bit impolite for old men to glare at me then spit at my feet as they walk past muttering &amp;#39;gaijin...&amp;#39;, no?
