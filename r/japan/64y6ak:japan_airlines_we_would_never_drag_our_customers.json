There&amp;#39;s a fiasco where the girlfriend, already having checked her bags, can&amp;#39;t come out unless she goes through security again... not even to give me a few dollars so I can post the damn thing to myself using some third party mailing system (the post office wouldn&amp;#39;t open until after the flight).  The third party post things were out of stock in that terminal anyway, so I had to run to another terminal.  Found out they don&amp;#39;t operate like the normal post.  Instead, you have to pay a ransom based on the value of the item instead of based on weight or size.  Turns out I don&amp;#39;t have enough money for the third party post and my girlfriend can&amp;#39;t leave her bags to give me the difference.  I walk around in a huff and try to give my tool to some TSA agents.  They say they can&amp;#39;t take it, but I&amp;#39;m free to throw it in the bin.  Bunch of fucking cunts.  I was resigned to losing it, so decided to give it away to a passer-by.  I&amp;#39;m sizing people up &amp;quot;he sucks&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;she sucks&amp;quot;  etc.  I pick a couple and tell them all about it and that I&amp;#39;m going to give this to them with no strings attached.  They offer to mail it to me and, in the end, they actually did!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a couple of stories, but that&amp;#39;s the most dramatic.  The bottom line is I&amp;#39;ve never had worse service than on American air carries.  The Australians and the Japanese are pretty legit when it comes to customer service (except Jetstar, lol, but you get what you pay for).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "japan", "name": "t1_dg7c8bo", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492103418.0, "created_utc": 1492074618.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6ak", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6ak", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2u", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64y6ak", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg7d2gx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FermiAnyon", "parent_id": "t1_dg681ke", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/japan", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They jerked him out of his seat *before* they knocked him out and dragged his limp body out in plain view, setting an example for the other paying customers.
