I really believe that any change of this magnitude is only truly testable once its gone live. Even though its still pretty early, everyone has at least had a decent opportunity to play around with Lucio at this point, so I&amp;#39;m curious what people think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally (and with the huge caveat that I&amp;#39;m just a very average player bouncing around high plat/low diamond), as a Lucio main with a few hundreds hours on the hero, here are my thoughts on him now:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are definitely situations where he feels much weaker than before. Any team that doesn&amp;#39;t group up consistently, whether out of sloppiness or intentional strategy, drastically cuts into Lucio&amp;#39;s effectiveness. Divey comps where everyone is rocking different movement abilities (and even basic move speeds in the case of Tracer and Genji) often fall prey to this, as do Pharmercy comps, as do your standard no coordination crappy pub comp that all of us solo queuers are used to. He&amp;#39;s also pretty weak in any situation where the team is spread out around a choke on defense, which is fairly common on maps like Hanamura Point A, the initial capture point on Numbani, or defending on the second stages of Hollywood and Dorado. Yes, in these situations you can move around quickly and try to bounce between allies to heal everyone up, but you&amp;#39;re like a less effective Mercy most of the time. The improved weapon is some compensation, but doesn&amp;#39;t really outweigh the huge loss in basic, guaranteed effectiveness that the old Lucio had....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there are still many situations where Lucio is still fucking great, and some where he&amp;#39;s flat out better than he was before. Any situation where your team is almost guaranteed to be grouped up pretty tightly--so any reasonably coordinated comp that intends to push behind a Rein shield, on Attack on basically any Payload map, and any KOTH map--Lucio feels really fucking strong right now. In part because of the improved healing aura and damage capabilities, but also because if you actually do have a team grouped up in your aura and are consistently firing at the enemy, Lucio will generate his Ult way, way faster than he did previously. Unless you fuck up, having your ult up before an enemy Genji or Soldier gets theirs is very consistently doable. He pairs even better with Ana now, and his improved wallride and boop can be fucking insane on certain maps--he was always terrifying on KOTH maps with huge pits near the point, but now he&amp;#39;s scary as hell defending the Ecihenwalde bridge (and can get from defender&amp;#39;s spawn to the first point in under 6 seconds), and nigh unhittable bouncing between columns on Anubis. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, its hard to say whether its a buff or nerf. If you define power level by pickrate its a nerf, because previously you pretty much always wanted Lucio and now there are situations where he&amp;#39;s a suboptimal pick. The super forgiving &amp;quot;floor&amp;quot; for Lucio where even if you just picked him in every single match and did almost nothing with him you were still contributing a bit has disappeared, and the sentence &amp;quot;hey can you switch off Lucio to Mercy or Zen?&amp;quot; will no longer sound preposterous in some situations. But at the same time, between every payload map, every KOTH map, the various favorable 2cp and hybrid map points (the first two stages on Eichenwalde, Anubis B,etc.) , and all the times where your team just wants to be pushing behind Rein with an Ana, there are still a lot of situations where he&amp;#39;s a top choice, and now he&amp;#39;s even better in those situations than he was previously. He&amp;#39;s much more of a real combatant now and quite formidable in a duel, better at healing a grouped up team than he was before, arguably the most mobile character in the game on most maps, and a veritable Ult machine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, there was another reason Blizzard changed him beyond just wanting to lower his pickrate and open up more spots for other healers to thrive--they wanted him to feel more fun and impactful to play. Making a character simultaneously more situational and more fun is a very tall order, but I think they may have pulled it off. Wallriding feels fucking insane right now--I&amp;#39;m no Stanky, but I pretty much always feel like I can be wherever I need to. After having sunk hundreds of hours into getting better with Lucio&amp;#39;s crappy old gun, the new version feels outstanding. The projectile speed is just a huge gamechanger. And Lucio feels like more of a true healer now too. Yes, his overall heal numbers may go down due to the aura nerf, but now there are moments where the team is taking a beating and it feels like an AMPed heal just totally turns it around, in sort of the same way that an Ana grenade feels like it can just swing the fight. Also, the new boop is so, so much fun. Launching people into the air is a blast, and opens up a surprising number of enviro kill opportunities that didn&amp;#39;t exist previously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is true that his aura nerf means he has to stay closer to the team, which does reduce the time spent just bouncing around high above everyone else. But much as I enjoyed it, it feels like a worthwhile tradeoff--the crazy movement capability is there, but now I&amp;#39;m using it with more specific objectives in mind (reach that ally, retreat, juke this guy, close the distance for a timely boop) rather than just as the basic default mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was very concerned when they changed him that my rank would drop, but if anything I&amp;#39;ve been winning more than I did before the change...with the caveat that there are now a few more situations where I&amp;#39;ll opt for Sym or Zen instead. But I&amp;#39;m still playing Lucio in upwards of 2/3rds of my matches and kicking a fair amount of ass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR If you define power level by pickrate its a nerf, because he&amp;#39;s gone from being a top choice 95%+ of the time to a top choice more like 65% of the time. But if you define power level by how well he performs in the situations where he&amp;#39;s a desirable choice, he feels even stronger and more necessary now than he did before.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Yes, I realize the Lucio changes were tested for a while on PTR, but PTR is a poor platform for testing how a character will perform in real play, and many people don't play on it anyway (either out of choice or because they're on console).

Rather than before, where he was just skating around and amping heals only to delay his inevitable death for 5-10 more seconds. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg9nc1x", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492228177.0, "created_utc": 1492199377.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d3jp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d3jp", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65d3jp", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9p3tp", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Psychachu", "parent_id": "t1_dg9ouvu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Decent is quick and easy but you have to spend a lot of time exploring each map to get GOOD like pick the fastest route to where you need to be and do it good, and since the patch the timing feels very different and you can clear different gaps, even very good Lucio's are re-learning to wall ride.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decent is quick and easy but you have to spend a lot of time exploring each map to get GOOD like pick the fastest route to where you need to be and do it good, and since the patch the timing feels very different and you can clear different gaps, even very good Lucio&amp;#39;s are re-learning to wall ride.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg9p3tp", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492230307.0, "created_utc": 1492201507.0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9ouvu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Barakuman", "parent_id": "t1_dg9nn8c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I mean, it's honestly not hard to get decent at wallriding ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, it&amp;#39;s honestly not hard to get decent at wallriding &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg9ouvu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492230007.0, "created_utc": 1492201207.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9nn8c", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Psychachu", "parent_id": "t1_dg9lpet", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Eh he has better evasion IFF you get good at wall riding.
