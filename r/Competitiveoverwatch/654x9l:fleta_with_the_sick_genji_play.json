Mei doing 3 things at the same times with just a mouse1 hold is NOT good design. Not to mention how anti-fun it is to play against. It's also not something you can \"outskill\". I'm also against winstons main damage and symmetras main damage.\n\nAre the characters op? Absolutely not, they're almost not even relevant at higher levels. That doesn't mean how they function is good design (or imho acceptable design) it means they need complete redesigns.\n\n&gt;  soldier is very balanced right now (and hard to play cause you have to \"aim\")\n\nSoldier IS balanced right now, it's also stupid you can buttfuck a soldier with a tank holding m1 down (yes winston).\n\nHealing in this game is extremely strong. Too strong at times and you need good damage to counter that.\n\nI think abilities doing too much is horrible design, ana nade is another example. Pick just about any DPS and try to outduel a top500 Ana. Ana nade should for example not damage to be more balanced. Not because the character would necessarily be more balanced but because the ability _does too much_. It is BAD design, especially when \"does too much\" is placed on something that is extremely easy to use.\n\n&gt; Comical\n\nNo, it's not comical, it's the truth.\n\n&gt;  I have easily laid out arguments, if you'd use that reading comprehension you'd realize I'm questioning your intelligence based on what you think\n\nWhich is funny because that implies you are in a position to do so.\n\n&gt; You're misinformed and have invalid opinions - case closed!\n\nExcept all my information is facts... So how can I be misinformed?

Mei doing 3 things at the same times with just a mouse1 hold is NOT good design. Not to mention how anti-fun it is to play against. It&amp;#39;s also not something you can &amp;quot;outskill&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m also against winstons main damage and symmetras main damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are the characters op? Absolutely not, they&amp;#39;re almost not even relevant at higher levels. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean how they function is good design (or imho acceptable design) it means they need complete redesigns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;soldier is very balanced right now (and hard to play cause you have to &amp;quot;aim&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soldier IS balanced right now, it&amp;#39;s also stupid you can buttfuck a soldier with a tank holding m1 down (yes winston).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Healing in this game is extremely strong. Too strong at times and you need good damage to counter that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think abilities doing too much is horrible design, ana nade is another example. Pick just about any DPS and try to outduel a top500 Ana. Ana nade should for example not damage to be more balanced. Not because the character would necessarily be more balanced but because the ability &lt;em&gt;does too much&lt;/em&gt;.
