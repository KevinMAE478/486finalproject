I hit masters on my main, and so I bought a smurf account so that I could continue to play with some friends who were mid-high plat.  within a week of playing, my smurf had gotten up to within a few hundred points of my main, and I actually hit a loss streak on my main shortly after and now they are pretty much equal.  (Meaning I streaked to masters and haven&amp;#39;t gotten good enough to belong there yet. which is fine.)  So overall I don&amp;#39;t really think smurfing is a huge deal, it&amp;#39;s really not very easy to keep an account at a lower rank without straight-up throwing, which I bet is really a very small percentage of all &amp;quot;smurf&amp;quot; accounts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg4js61", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491958769.0, "created_utc": 1491929969.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 266}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ru7u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ru7u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ru7u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ru7u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ru7u", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4z102", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 13, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheFirstRapher", "parent_id": "t1_dg4pzy8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; he gave up before even reaching a high rank\n\nMainly because of backlash", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;he gave up before even reaching a high rank&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mainly because of backlash&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg4z102", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491975656.0, "created_utc": 1491946856.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ru7u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64ru7u", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5jjpe", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sppw", "parent_id": "t1_dg5fbud", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "How would you feel on the other team, if you got rekt by a clear smurf on any of those games?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you feel on the other team, if you got rekt by a clear smurf on any of those games?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg5jjpe", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492005199.0, "created_utc": 1491976399.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5fbud", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 4, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mepto", "parent_id": "t1_dg4pzy8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I dunno, what Ster and Zz did wasn't anything bad really.
