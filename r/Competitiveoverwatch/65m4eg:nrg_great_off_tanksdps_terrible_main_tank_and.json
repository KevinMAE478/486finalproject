I dont think Numlocked landed one good earthshatter, made really stupid charges, and was constantly losing the mind games. Dummy kept nano&amp;#39;ing Numlocked, ajax would get picked at the start of fights or just randomly sound barrier fights that were already won.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Numlocked was getting painfully outplayed and the only time today they actually had success is on Lijang when Dummy was off of Ana onto mercy and Numlocked went to winston. Harb, Mendo, and IDDQD all had moments where they flashed but if they are going to do anything they cant have a reinhardt that is getting that outplayed or a shot caller (ajax) who is making that many poor calls. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgbergf", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492331118.0, "created_utc": 1492302318.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 31}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m4eg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbf2g1", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 29, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wajuka", "parent_id": "t1_dgbej9g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "No offense, but did you even watch the game?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No offense, but did you even watch the game?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgbf2g1", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492331575.0, "created_utc": 1492302775.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m4eg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbgtj4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 12, "report_reasons": null, "author": "KrushaOW", "parent_id": "t1_dgbej9g", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would really urge you to go see an ophthalmologist as soon as possible, because you are likely to have some serious eye-sight problems.
