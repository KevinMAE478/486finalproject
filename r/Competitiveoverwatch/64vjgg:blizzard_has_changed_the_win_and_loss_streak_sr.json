Today I wanted to talk about a behind the scenes change to our matchmaking systems that just went live with the 1.10 patch, but first I should take a step back and provide some background information.\n\nAs Jeff Kaplan noted in a recent post about smurfing, we do a decent job of quickly determining someone\u2019s skill at playing Overwatch. The faster we can update your matchmaking rating (MMR) to match your \u201creal\u201d skill, the fewer unfair matches get created with a player with inaccurate skill. Another way to look at it is that when we\u2019re incorrect at identifying someone\u2019s skill, then win or loss streaks can occur. One of the tools we use to accelerate a player to their appropriate MMR is a multiplier to the rating change based upon these consecutive wins or losses.\n\nWhile this streak multiplier has been working well in the \u201csmurf\u201d case, win or loss streaks can also just naturally occur when the matchmaking system has already properly identified skill. After all, the matchmaker is trying to place in you fair matches where you have a 50% chance to win. It\u2019s rare, but sometimes you flip a coin 5 times and it lands on heads every time. So, when these natural streaks occur, the multiplier has been accelerating gains and losses away from your \u201ctrue\u201d skill. You end up having a larger variance in skill rating over time, which in turn hurts the overall quality of the matches.\n\nTherefore, we\u2019re changing the tuning of the streak multiplier to be quite a bit less aggressive. You now need to win or lose more games in a row before any multiplier is used, and it scales up at a slower pace. Furthermore, we will now try to only use the multiplier in cases where the matchmaking system has some confidence that the player\u2019s MMR and skill are wildly mismatched. In cases of natural, random streaks, you ideally shouldn\u2019t see any acceleration either up or down at all.\n\nWe\u2019ll be monitoring how these changes affect overall match quality going forward, and continue to adjust tuning over time to improve the fairness and quality of Overwatch matches.

I have almost 300 games just this season. As a result, my SR fluctuates quite a bit. My career range has been all over the map due to streaks, from 1980 to 3100. I&amp;#39;m glad this will give me some stability and an idea of what my real skill level is. It&amp;#39;s tough being stable in Diamond on two accounts last season, then dropping to Gold in a weekend due to streaks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg5y55r", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492036795.0, "created_utc": 1492007995.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64vjgg", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5y7d2", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "F1sha", "parent_id": "t3_64vjgg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can't read because I'm at school rn, but will this change my hidden mmr* from decay at all?

Win or loss streaks are stupid. I prolly am a low master player. But i always get lucky one time and get up to like 3700 ish twice in a row now. Gotta admit that moment feels super fun and amazing. But you get the reverse after it mostly and you tilt hard, and make it worse and worse. You doubt every pick, every play. You start getting stupidly nervous. Because u KNOW that next loss will be a big hit in rank. I like it more when i slowly get higher and higher and sometimes have a bit of a dip. But it doesnt take me weeks to get it back. Or one lucky streak. \n\nFinally thanks blizzard. Love this one. Best change they made to comp since getting rid of the coinflip on payload.
