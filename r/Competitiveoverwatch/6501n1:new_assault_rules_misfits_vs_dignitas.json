If the second team used their  whole time bank because their push was not as effective, shouldn't that team have 0 time left? \n\nI am actually not a fan of giving teams an extra min on maps. I think its a weird mechanic. For example if Team A capped all points and have an remaining time of 6 mins,  and the second team used their whole time bank, shouldn't Team A have 6 mins and Team B have 0 mins? I don't understand why the worst preforming team gets gifted a second chance.\n\nI think it should be in ticks, 1/3rd or so to actually count, the 0.1% is too swingy.\n\nedit: I get that it looks and feels awful, but isn't it more fair to keep time constant, or add time to both teams to keep the gap the same?
