If Team Alice, flank-touches the point, Team Bob knows they have to get only this far to secure the win, and comp/play accordingly.

In this situation, Team Bob knows this: &lt;strong&gt;the moment they touch the point uncontested, they win.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is not something that Team Alice had attempted to do.  One could argue Team Alice should&amp;#39;ve played a &amp;quot;safety&amp;quot; to nab a bit of point progress even if the flanker dies in doing so.  Even so, the fact remains: Team Alice needs to keep somebody on the point at all times to contest it if Team Bob sends a flanker towards it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means either putting up a 6v5 at the gates, doing a 5v5 and leaving the flanker and point-defender to duel one another (quite the high risk approach!) or having Team Alice sit on the point itself all together, which is not a very defensible position, and it&amp;#39;s happened many times in the past that some point progress was nabbed because the defenders mistakenly stepped out, or got booped off the control point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, this means Team Bob has a sensible advantage.  Whatever action that Team Alice does in their first overtime run will dictate Team Bob&amp;#39;s response.  If Team Alice, flank-touches the point, Team Bob knows they have to get only this far to secure the win, and comp/play accordingly.  If Team Alice attempts a classical dive and fails, then we know for sure Team Bob will flank-touch the point, and so Team Alice&amp;#39;s defense is constrained and compromised before their defense run has even started.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg673nx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492046422.0, "created_utc": 1492017622.0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5pmg5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IDontApproveBiting", "parent_id": "t1_dg5pbzq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is just one out of many uncontrollable elements in the game, but at the end of the day you will always reach the rank you deserve regardless.
