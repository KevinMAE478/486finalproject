DNCE on healer looks weird, but I&amp;#39;ve seen flex DPS play well on healer (Like KoX), so hoping he does well to fill Lucid&amp;#39;s shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgdg162", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492462756.0, "created_utc": 1492433956.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ujdc", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ujdc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdhvd4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bartlet4us", "parent_id": "t1_dgdgh29", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Streaming is equally lucrative regardless of nationality.  \nIt's just about how many viewers you have and how much time you spend streaming.  \nThey use the same system of subscriptions, tips, and Ad revenue plus some sponsorships.
