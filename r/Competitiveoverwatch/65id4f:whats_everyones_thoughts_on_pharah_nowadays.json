I'll try not to be, though. \n\nI think the major issue with a good pharah is that she - like hog maybe or a good widow - needs to be countered, but not every hero can counter her effectively and it requires a little coordination to take her out. I don't think this is strictly bad design. Give Hanzo, Widow, Soldier, Reaper, Tracer, Genji, or Hog a match where they are not countered/contested and it'll feel like they're overpowered. Try playing a match with no decent counter to Genji or Tracer and you'll see what I mean -  against them you need maybe Winston and definitely some hitscan because it's typically unreliable to use projectiles against them. The case of Pharah is similar in that you need hitscan that focuses her or else she seems OP. There is no shortage of people who can play hitscan at least half decently, and I think it'd be awfully rare to run into a match where 1 of the 6 players that make up your team doesn't have soldier or mccree as one of their most played heroes. \n\nBut of course, just like running into a good widow/tracer/genji, it isn't as simple as swap and you'll kill her. You need to coordinate a little. A lone soldier or mccree can only soft-counter pharah. If there is a good soldier or mccree on the other team, they can rather effectively zone you out and really prevent you from having that free reign that people complain pharah has. People have to understand that unless your soldier/mccree knows what they're doing against the enemy pharah who clearly knows what they're doing, they won't kill her.\n\nHowever, jump into soloq and there is a decent chance you'll be on a team with a soldier main who seems to fear being blinded by the sun and therefore decides that pushing his mouse upwards is the last thing he wants to do. In cases like these you're essentially playing without a counter for her, and so she seems powerful; and it seems stupid because her counter is already in your comp. It is similar when no one on your team can match the pharah in terms of skill and take her out  (but to be fair if you're outclassing the enemy team while they play something that should be countering you then you deserve to win no matter what that hero really is). In cases where teams are losing to pharah I've noticed that just don't swap it up much, outside of double hitscan at the most. I've noticed this both on the enemy team while playing pharah and on my team while getting wrecked by pharah. People ignore D.Va's matrix against pharah, or zen's discord. Soldier and Mccree really aren't the only good counters to pharah.\n\nI just don't think that Pharah is the issue in the equation. There isn't anything broken about her or that is clearly too powerful. Place her against a team that bothers to look up and she really isn't too much of a threat. For her to take out enemies consistently she has to be in decently close range and that puts her in a dangerous position against mccree and soldier. A decent D.Va can really shut her down. She doesn't get the consistent protection and doesn't have the longevity nor raw damage that other DPS characters do. However, place her in a position where there isn't a soldier, mccree, or Dva with decent positioning and she will seem OP.\n\nI think it comes down to Pharah having a smaller hero pool than most that can counter her properly, but I don't know if that would really require a nerf. Give any hero free reign and they seem OP - especially DPS and especially flankers. It's just that with Pharah's smaller hero-counter-pool, people run into the issue more commonly, and the numbers are inflated by people who play her counters but either with bad positioning or while refusing to look upwards. Tracer has the same issue as Pharah in that she isn't really countered except by focus fire and can seem OP if left alone and IMO a good tracer is by far more of an issue than a good pharah - hell, you can see Tracers carrying games at pro level especially.\n\nKeep in mind, I'm not fully opposed to a nerf against Pharah if Blizzard decides it is needed. I would be wary against nerfing soldier (despite mccree being a far better counter for pharah, but tbf soldier is easier to play against her, especially at lower ranks where mccree isnt supported properly and is tougher to aim with) and if they did I would prefer they brought back Ana's damage as she really was the single scariest thing for a Pharah. I just don't know if Pharah deserves a nerf that will push her out of usage in mid-high ranks and pro play because people from low-mid ranks cannot properly prioritise/position/counter her.\n\nThis is way longer than i intended it to be. sorry.  \n\nTL;DR: Pharah isn't really OP, she just has a smaller than average hero-pool that counters her, and people who do play her counters dont always do their job. When she isn't countered she seems OP, but when given respect she is clearly fair.\n\nEdit: added tldr", "edited": 1492262041.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full disclaimer: I do play a fair bit of pharah, so maybe I&amp;#39;m biased.

But I think they are too situational to reliably deal with a good phara. Widow only works on some maps with long lines of sights or else phara will just &amp;#39;e&amp;#39; right into widows face and win the 1v1, dva runs out of shift very fast as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other option is to ignore phara, this is especially viable if the other team runs pharmercy; you effectively create a 6v4 in your favor. But this requires your team to collectively ignore the pharmercy and focus on the other 4 heroes, as a team, in soloQ... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I play around 3800 up to low GM and 1 decent pharmercy will USUALLY defeat us in the first round, it really requires your team to adapt as a whole to successfully counter.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my opinion on the status of phara WITHIN SOLOQ, especially when combined with a mercy, is that she is very strong, bordering on OP. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very good genji can carry a game, but even an above average phara has a lot of power simply because she requires the other team to work together. Let&amp;#39;s call it carry potential and disruptive potential respectively. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgc1pmq", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492379654.0, "created_utc": 1492350854.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65id4f", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65id4f", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65id4f", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgavdx4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "maxABC", "parent_id": "t1_dgaqbao", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "thats fair enough, however it is still almost a necessity to have a soldier in this meta.
