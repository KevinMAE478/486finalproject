Defense first gets a perceived advantage sure, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re immune from getting steamrolled and being in a worse position attacking second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The overtime system is heavily relying on a teams ability to gain % control on the meter before the &amp;quot;touch the point and win&amp;quot; is needed. Changing the minimum to one tick is still a pretty short time span from 0 and it wouldn&amp;#39;t change the need to defend on the point regardless of map or game type. Arguably with the way it was on hybrids and assault (needing to fully capture the first point) you already needed to defend on the point considering restricted time usually demanded an extremely aggressive attack anyway. I see why this is a problem but at the same time be accountable of your own teams failure up until that point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People are complaining about the strategy and team comps needed to adjust but I wonder how many people were complaining about the lack of hero pool during 3-tank deathball and stale gameplay that came with it. Whether you need 1 tick, 2 ticks, or the full capture the nature of overtime is going to open up more aggressive dive attacks, Symmetra torb bastion defensive combinations, sweaty stressful gameplay and heartbreak for the loser. Imo there isn&amp;#39;t a realistic overtime solution where people won&amp;#39;t be salty.
