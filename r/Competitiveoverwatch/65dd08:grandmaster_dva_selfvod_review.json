In the optimal situation like this you could&amp;#39;ve flown towards: Stopping rein from hitting you in the back, possibly knocking mei or zarya off the ledge, away from the team and probably doubling your damage. Dvas damage from that range is miniscule.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nice video, soothing voice and good job keeping the motivation up. Can be rather difficult to keep up the enthusiasm through the game. Interesting to see another take on Dva, I generally play more offensively on their backline when they&amp;#39;re running a tripple tank comp, but this works too :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgaqss0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492297862.0, "created_utc": 1492269062.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65dd08", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg9flfn", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BigBodChungOfficial", "parent_id": "t3_65dd08", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "RemindMe! 2 hours", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;RemindMe! 2 hours&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg9flfn", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492218980.0, "created_utc": 1492190180.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
