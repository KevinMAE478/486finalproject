This isn&amp;#39;t WOW where a story is as important, you kinda need to give your customers what they want or they will just go somewhere else....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of their ideas seem arrogant, and i get that, they think they know what the customer wants, or maybe they just want to do what they want to do, its their game after all. But people are brutal these days, and will think nothing of just dropping this game like a sack of hot turd once something equal / better / etc comes along. While they corner the market at the moment they should capitalise with allot of char releases NOW and reduce them later on. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgcw86o", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492420963.0, "created_utc": 1492392163.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ogal", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd8j7m", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cakebutt1", "parent_id": "t3_65ogal", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd like to see them work on their awful game engine", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to see them work on their awful game engine&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgd8j7m", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492441753.0, "created_utc": 1492412953.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ogal", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdpi7q", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "artosispylon", "parent_id": "t3_65ogal", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "hopefully they will make heroes that arent just for trolling, ana was good but sombra is still a complete garbage hero after buffs every patch and orisas low health and huge hitbox is a joke", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;hopefully they will make heroes that arent just for trolling, ana was good but sombra is still a complete garbage hero after buffs every patch and orisas low health and huge hitbox is a joke&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgdpi7q", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492475245.0, "created_utc": 1492446445.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65ogal", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcf7j3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Whatsthisaboot", "parent_id": "t3_65ogal", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "A hero every 3-4 months?
