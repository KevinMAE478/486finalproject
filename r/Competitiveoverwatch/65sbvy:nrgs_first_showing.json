This might just be a situation similar to Grego, but we don&amp;#39;t know. If it is actually him joining 100% then they&amp;#39;re in a good spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if Mendo is not joining, what do they do now? They&amp;#39;ve got a 3 month period without a DPS. And if Mendo isn&amp;#39;t joining, then it makes no sense for the team to pick Mendo on loan when you already have Seagull. Because if Seagull isn&amp;#39;t willing to take this weekend to play with NRG then he probably isn&amp;#39;t someone you want on the team. I get that he wants to stream for more money, but this weekend especially he could have played. It wouldn&amp;#39;t have been any worse than having a high ping Mendo who hasn&amp;#39;t played with NRG before. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgcwue5", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492421766.0, "created_utc": 1492392966.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 65}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sbvy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65sbvy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd1nw3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": -15, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anomanopia", "parent_id": "t1_dgcvstc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "They're gonna need more than luck.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re gonna need more than luck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgd1nw3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492428537.0, "created_utc": 1492399737.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -15}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcvstc", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 93, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Yiskaout", "parent_id": "t3_65sbvy", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "The bashing was fun while it lasted and I hope the players understand the banter nature of it all.
