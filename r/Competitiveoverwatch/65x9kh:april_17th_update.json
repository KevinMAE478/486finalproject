value, so their speed never got reduced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;overall, code reuse is a blessing and a curse- it makes everything work better, until you mess up one thing and it causes a ripple effect. there might be a dozens of places in the code that rely on the movement calculations, and any one of them could cause it to misbehave. then the devs have to look all over for something that&amp;#39;s probably a tiny typo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;another big source of bugs is &amp;quot;mutable state&amp;quot;. so again with the mei example, somewhere there&amp;#39;s a value in memory that indicates how frozen a hero is. there are often multiple places in the code that want to look at this value or change it (&amp;quot;mutate&amp;quot; it). the projectiles from mei&amp;#39;s gun want to increase this value when they hit a target, but a hero also wants to decrease it over time so they thaw if they get away. if these two actions don&amp;#39;t cooperate, it&amp;#39;s possible that one might overwrite the efforts of the other. because the mei glitch still allowed people to get frozen, this is probably not the kind of bug responsible (although it would depend on how they coded it). if the &amp;quot;thaw&amp;quot; code was overwriting the efforts of the &amp;quot;freeze&amp;quot; code, players would never get frozen at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to diagnose mutation bugs, devs would have to go look at all code that might be touching that freeze value. and sometimes they might have to look elsewhere. a lot of low-level programming (which is common in game dev) has to calculate the positions in memory that a value resides in. it&amp;#39;s possible that a piece of code somewhere calculates the wrong value and overwrites data that it shouldn&amp;#39;t be looking at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;typos are easy to make and can cause either of these kinds of bugs. we use compilers to turn code into programs, and compilers only catch some of the possible typos. and of course, devs have to be careful that they don&amp;#39;t make more bugs when they fix one. so there&amp;#39;s also lots of testing to see if each piece is working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dge0nql", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492487720.0, "created_utc": 1492458920.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65x9kh", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dge0j4f", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ntshd", "parent_id": "t1_dgdxizw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "You have hundreds of thousands of lines of code.

The first line is the index. `array[0]` refers to the first element in the array, which is the value \"10\". Someone might make a mistake and accidentally use `array[1]` to refer to the first element but actually get the second. Or maybe they'll do `array[4]` to try to get the 4th element, but end up getting something that comes *after* the array in memory. This is a bug. It's an easy bug to detect, but if you have variables there, you add a layer of complexity. Is `array[index]` a bug? You now need to make sure `index` is properly set, which could be easy or hard depending on context.\n\nThere are more dangerous bugs. There are two \"segments\" of memory a program can use to store things while running. The \"stack\" and the \"heap\". The difference is unimportant for this explanation. Let's say you ask for (`allocate`) 10 bytes of memory on the heap. You will receive the address of this memory, and it will be marked as \"used\" by some mysterious forces inside the computer. You're done using this, so you `free` the memory. That piece of memory is no longer marked \"used\". Again, you allocate 10 bytes of memory, and the mysterious forces inside the computer give you the same address, the same piece of memory. It's no longer in use, so it shouldn't matter, right?\n\nBut in your code, you still have the address from the first time you allocated, and your code treats it as if it was never `free`d. Your program uses the same piece of memory as if it was 2 different places. I shouldn't have to tell you why this is bad.\n\nThat bug (called \"use-after-free\" if you're interested; and just to clarify, both allocations don't have to be the same size for this to occur) is easy to find if the program is simple, but when you have thousands of lines of code, maybe even millions, they slip past. Tools designed to help you find them aren't as effective when you can't trace the program through every possible way it could run.\n\nThese are just a couple examples.\n\nTo find these bugs, you can't comb through every piece of code.
