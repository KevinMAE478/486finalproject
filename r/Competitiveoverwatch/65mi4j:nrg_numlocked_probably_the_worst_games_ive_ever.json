Their focus targeting didnt seem to be there at all, they all seemed to attack different targets. Also even though Seagull isnt the \"shot caller\" (for all we know) and Mendo played well. Replacing a player a few days before a tournament is going to be disruptive unless you have a really strong fleshed out core which they can't have with all the changes the past few months. Add to that due to ping mendo couldn't play genji which limited options that they might have practiced.\n\nHopefully it's all just nerves and roster disruption because that just gets ironed out with more play. \n\nEdit: oops i posted this in the wrong thread....", "edited": 1492305895.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few things seemed to happen and i honestly wouldnt be suprised if nerves was one of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is kinda a chain that happens in every pro match i watch.

But just look at Rogue right after the NRG games where the second anyone was attacking unkoe, winz would instantly be there to protect and disrupt. Or lunatic hai who frankly ran an escort service just to get ryujehong into a good position in their finals. We really didnt see much of that from Ajax and NRG.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It almost makes me wonder if they have got too reliant on dummy hitting sleeps on flankers in scrims. His sleeps were way WAY off tonight and he never had that protection of the lucio to compensate for the lack of sleep darts. Which means he was unable to spend as much time on numlocked which in turn seemed to cause numlocked to lose confidence through out the matches tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But seriously i think we all can agree they dramatically need to work on teamwork. Their focus targeting didnt seem to be there at all, they all seemed to attack different targets. Also even though Seagull isnt the &amp;quot;shot caller&amp;quot; (for all we know) and Mendo played well. Replacing a player a few days before a tournament is going to be disruptive unless you have a really strong fleshed out core which they can&amp;#39;t have with all the changes the past few months. Add to that due to ping mendo couldn&amp;#39;t play genji which limited options that they might have practiced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully it&amp;#39;s all just nerves and roster disruption because that just gets ironed out with more play. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: oops i posted this in the wrong thread....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgbgj4z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492333629.0, "created_utc": 1492304829.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 78}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mi4j", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65mi4j", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbjykl", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 9, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheDeadRed", "parent_id": "t1_dgbhkrb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "It was really hard to tell how good (or bad) his Winston play was when they were running such awful team comps though.
