If team B is better, then likely they can run a number of different strategies and still win the game, that doesn't make the game or the ruleset unfair though, it just means that team b was more skilled and better at allocating their defensive and offensive resources to make a strong push/hold. If team A at the beginning ran four flankers, they could have potentially overrun the point also, you don't know because apparently they go into the game looking for a team wipe/ ult combo out of the choke...like building ults alone will take 2 mins or so off the game clock for a 4 minute attack. THAT strategy alone is going to cost you the game if you want me to be honest with you. I will add however, that the route added on eichenwalde should allow for better and stronger flanking that is more likely to be in conjunction with a team attack as that route in particular doesn't take as much time as some of the older, but longer flank routes available on eichenwalde's first point attack. Definitely shouldn't be looking to combo ults for a team wipe on the first choke initiation, let alone the first fight. That is like asking to just lose four or five consecutive fights just to charge ultimate. Better idea to have at least one or two characters that have pick potential on their own, think roadhog or something like that, so that you can use a pick found by your team and snowball it into either a first point capture or at least a few tick marks on the board. This is a much better idea as it doesn't rely on having ult charge, which takes a long time to get, and instead relies on a hook CD which is 8 seconds. This way if you happen to miss only 8 seconds off the clock versus potentially 1.5 -2 minutes youd have to spend charging ult and dying, potentially charging enemy ults faster, allowing them to snowball the defense really hard. ", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but both teams had this option the whole game, attacking second doesn&amp;#39;t make it any stronger of a strategy. If team B is better, then likely they can run a number of different strategies and still win the game, that doesn&amp;#39;t make the game or the ruleset unfair though, it just means that team b was more skilled and better at allocating their defensive and offensive resources to make a strong push/hold. If team A at the beginning ran four flankers, they could have potentially overrun the point also, you don&amp;#39;t know because apparently they go into the game looking for a team wipe/ ult combo out of the choke...like building ults alone will take 2 mins or so off the game clock for a 4 minute attack. THAT strategy alone is going to cost you the game if you want me to be honest with you. I will add however, that the route added on eichenwalde should allow for better and stronger flanking that is more likely to be in conjunction with a team attack as that route in particular doesn&amp;#39;t take as much time as some of the older, but longer flank routes available on eichenwalde&amp;#39;s first point attack. Definitely shouldn&amp;#39;t be looking to combo ults for a team wipe on the first choke initiation, let alone the first fight. That is like asking to just lose four or five consecutive fights just to charge ultimate. Better idea to have at least one or two characters that have pick potential on their own, think roadhog or something like that, so that you can use a pick found by your team and snowball it into either a first point capture or at least a few tick marks on the board.

Only needing to touch the point once while uncontested just feels incredibly awkward. I think a good compromise would be to require a minimum of the first tick to cap any point, with % progress being used for anything beyond that.
