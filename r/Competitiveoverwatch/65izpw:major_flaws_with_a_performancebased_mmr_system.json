Overwatch is a very complex game, there are no stats that tell you the ana slept a nanoboosted genji at a clutch moment in the game, nor do they tell you the positional awareness of a lucio who is constantly speed boosting his ana and dps away from winston.

It goes without saying that performance stats benefit dps players because it is their job to secure the kills and do damage. The system knows better when they are doing well because it shows up on the killfeed. But again, as an extension of my previous point, this has problems because decisions that tend to support the team are rewarded less than individual play. A roadhog or mcree may get less damage and kills if he is bodyguarding his ana yet he is contributing more to a win. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This causes big problems for supports and support tanks like rein and dva, heroes where you are constantly deciding whether to save a teammate (which is usually better) or frag out. The fixes that blizz have had to make to mercy and lucio sr reflect this. For those that don&amp;#39;t remember, lucio sr used to be broken because higher rated lucios did less healing and played more defensively, so they had worse stats. Do we need further proof that this system is broken, that the optimal way of playing a hero is discouraged. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, assassin lucio is more viable now; however, if you are being rewarded for jumping in yolo and playing lucio as a dps player then something is wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2a) Furthermore, the meta is different at different ratings. Dive is flavour of the month right now in high rated games which means supports are dying quicker. Generally speaking, the higher rated you go the more focus there is to kill supports.

If two teams are playing dive against eachother, one of the anas could be surviving a lot better than the other ana yet still be rewarded negatively because you are being compared to plat anas playing quad tank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Offensive play may be rewarded better than smart defensive play.

Instead of fluctuating over a 400 SR range, I fluctuated  within a 200 SR range.\n\nI believe fixing or improving the per-player SR gain/loss weighting (the thing which looks at stats/history) would also improve ranking and in turn, improve the streak situation.\n\nOn my other account, I climbed to 3630 SR as Zenyatta very slowly by maintaining a 60% winrate.

But I agree with you. DPS is easy to measure as in \"are you killing/damaging a lot?\" But other heroes and their roles are more dynamic and what goes into a win isn't that simple. \n\nAs people were saying on here, healers aren't that simple. So you're measuring support by heals? As someone else in here noted, at higher rank, healers get focused more and say, dive comp is less popular than triple tank at low ranks, it's very easy for healers at high rank to \"underperform\". Not to mention heroes like Lucio typically the better they are use their kits in more impactful ways than simply sitting on heal aura all match at high ranks. So are they playing poorly? Same with Zenyatta. Am I a \"worse\" Zenyatta by knowing who needs my orb, like a diving Genji over a half health Rein that's in a safe position with his shield up that our primary healer can take care of, making my heals \"lower\" than a lower level Zen who just gets a ton of heals off of a tank while solo healing so they just heal and heal and heal? It's just a weird metric to use. \n\nThe reason this is weird is because a competitive game is supposed to based around wins. Your rank should reflect how well you can contribute to wins. But the issue with judging \"individual impact\" is that Blizzard has to decide on a metric that \"contributes\" to wins. The issue with that is in a competitive game what contributes to wins is outplaying the opponent which involves a ton of variables that are always evolving. Lucios may shot call and focus on engages and disengages but Blizzard can't see when a Lucio pulled their Ana out of danger at the right time, booped a Soldier off of high ground or bopped a hog and ruined his hook kill, all potential plays that could have saved a team fight. So if you're basing rank off of something besides wins, you have to pick what variables are important, and in some instances this can directly be things that contribute *less* to wins than simply knowing when to use your or in a certain way and when not to. \n\nThat's why you're starting to hear about people trying to game the system by using off-picks to climb. Because when you don't focus on \"winning\" being the variable for climbing but some stupid variable about what makes me a \"better than average Sombra\", people start climbing by not necessarily making picks that will win. That's why people climb on off-picks and get low win rates but still manage to get a decent rank. \n\nIt's so utterly stupid because it also makes healers less motivating to play since I just have to shoot-em-up as Soldier to get more SR gain. \n\nIt's also ironic that we are responding to a comment that says \"stats don't lie\". If \"stats don't lie\" then statistically if you're consistently performing well, then your odds will always be that you have 5 potential slots for bad teammates and they have 6. That means that you should eventually rank up by winning more. But picking Sombra in a situation in which you will likely lose because you can get away with climbing with a 35% win rate *is* a case where stats *are* lying and are artificially buffing people's rank.

Of course they are linked, the team that gets the 'better' stats tends to win but not always. Just recently, on the first day of the overwatch pit, Faze got beat by selfless 2-0. They had a Koth game where selfless won 3-0, even though faze had 3/4 of the scorecards. The stats tell a different story than the result.\n\nI've read that post about the trends in support players, he concluded that higher ranked support players tended to have more offensive and defensive assists and less deaths. I'm not denying any correlation in the stats, its just that since they are trends they aren't right in every case.

I&amp;#39;m a massive football fan and teams like leicester city can have terrible statistics (possession, pass completion etc.) yet they still won the premier league. Or some players are natural leaders and good communicators, they have a value that goes beyond their play. Stats can&amp;#39;t tell you that the winning lucio was shotcalling and keeping track of ults. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The statistics prioritised in overwatch are all to do with kills even though strategy is more important in this game since the win conditions are objectives. Of course they are linked, the team that gets the &amp;#39;better&amp;#39; stats tends to win but not always. Just recently, on the first day of the overwatch pit, Faze got beat by selfless 2-0. They had a Koth game where selfless won 3-0, even though faze had 3/4 of the scorecards. The stats tell a different story than the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read that post about the trends in support players, he concluded that higher ranked support players tended to have more offensive and defensive assists and less deaths.

There's only so much that you alone can carry your team, at least not with every hero. You cannot climb out of low ranks anymore by just outperforming rank average. Right now, if you really belong to grandmaster, you will climb out of platinum with 50% or even lower winrate by just doing a lot better than average platinum players. With fixed gains and losses, you will be stuck in it for far longer, and whether you climb out of it depends far lesser degree on you, and more on your luck with randomly matched teammates. \"But wait\", you say, \"if you're that good, shouldn't you get 70% winrate in platinum?\" Here's where role favoritism only **gets worse**: you sure as hell can destroy platinums if you're GM Genji or Tracer, but you cannot carry as hard with non-dps classes. While even if you're playing Lucio stats will be clear: you do a lot better than an average platinum Lucio, you have fewer deaths, more assists, more healing, more sound barriers, more objective time stalling the payload at the last seconds.

A person queuing together with a pro-Genji who wrecks low ranks can just dick around and skyrocket into grandmasters with the same speed as the booster. While with performance-based system their rank gap will quickly get large enough, separating them into different tiers.\n\n3. People will land on the undeserved ranks far more frequently. If a newbie is lucky enough to be matched with better players several times in a row, even if he did poorly, he will get a lot of undeserved rank points and play on a ranks he's not prepared for. This will cause a lot of grief to his future teammates who will see a clueless player who cannot keep the expected level of play. As this happens the whole system will get destabilized and spiral in a random directions. A couple of similarly overranked newbies matched with four fairly ranked players will bring the whole team down, causing the latter to lose a lot of rank points and become underranked, who will then climb back \"boosting\" other low-rank players who will receive the same amount of rank points even despite their skill gap. The whole process will leave a lot of players outside of their real rank, either higher or lower which will screw with their new teammate's ranks.
